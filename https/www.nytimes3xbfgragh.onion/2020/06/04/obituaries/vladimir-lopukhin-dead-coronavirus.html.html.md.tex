Mr. Lopukhin, who died of the novel coronavirus, was in charge of the
energy ministry at a time of tumultuous change in Russia's oil and gas
industry.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

MOSCOW --- Vladimir M. Lopukhin became energy minister of the Russian
Federation, the biggest component of the Soviet Union, in November 1991
--- taking charge of a vast but crumbling oil and gas sector and the
backbone of the economy. Within weeks, the Soviet empire collapsed.

The appointment made him a key member of the government that led
Russia's exit from the Soviet Union and put him at the center of some of
the fiercest battles over the nation's future.

Mr. Lopukhin pushed for the creation of so-called vertically integrated
oil companies in place of a Soviet setup in which oil exploration,
drilling, transport and sales were each handled by separate state-owned
companies. This and other proposals quickly ran into opposition from
veteran managers and also from some fellow ministers who believed that
assets should first be privatized and only then reorganized.

He nonetheless presided over the genesis of what would later become
major private Russian oil companies, including
\href{https://www.lukoil.com/}{Lukoil}. Perhaps his most important
legacy, however, was the preservation of Russia's enormous natural gas
industry as a single entity. The state-controlled company that resulted,
\href{https://www.gazprom.com/}{Gazprom}, still has near monopoly
control of Russian gas.

Mr. Lopukhin died on May 24 in a Moscow hospital. The cause was the new
coronavirus, his family said. He was 68.

Like many others who pioneered Russia's transition from central planning
to capitalism, Mr. Lopukhin had deep roots in the old system he worked
to demolish. His father, Mikhail, was a senior K.G.B. officer expelled
from the United States for espionage while posing as a Soviet
journalist. His ancestors were said to include the first wife of Peter
the Great, the early 18th century Russian czar.

But unlike some other free-marketers who held high office during and
immediately after the December 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr.
Lopukhin --- who married four times and had four children --- did not
become a multimillionaire. More interested in books than bling, he
retained the impish humor and informal habits of his earlier academic
career.

Vladimir Mikhailovich Lopukhin was born on May 23, 1952, in Moscow. He
graduated in 1974 with a degree in economics from Moscow State
University and went to work for various Soviet research institutes,
coming into contact with others who would later enter government.

For much of the 1980s, he headed a small research team at the Institute
of Economic Forecasting, an influential brain trust which helped develop
economic ideas for the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and
Russia's first elected president, Boris N. Yeltsin.

He specialized in the Soviet oil industry and shuttled between Moscow
and the Siberian oil region of Tyumen. In 1990, he realized ``that the
country was finished,'' he recalled in an interview published in 2013.
``We had to provide either bread or oil. Otherwise there would be chaos.
I knew nothing about bread so I decided I would go back to the oil
sector.''

Irene Commeau, a Frenchwoman who met and later married Mr. Lopukhin
while serving as the Moscow representative of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, recalled visiting him at the energy
ministry. His office, she said in a phone interview, was full of oil
barons from Siberia, ``all two meters tall, smoking and shouting.''

Resented by veteran energy managers, sniped at by fellow reformers and
targeted for attack by Parliament, Mr. Lopukhin lasted just six months
in office before he was fired by President Yeltsin.

``I slept three hours a day,'' Mr. Lopukhin recalled years later. ``I
lost a tooth for every month in my ministerial term of office.'' The
energy ministry --- ultimately responsible for keeping factories
running, apartments heated and the government in power --- ``was a
bone-breaking machine,'' he said.

His period in government was followed by nearly three decades out of the
limelight when he worked as a banker, mostly with an affiliate of Lazard
Frères of France, and as a consultant.
