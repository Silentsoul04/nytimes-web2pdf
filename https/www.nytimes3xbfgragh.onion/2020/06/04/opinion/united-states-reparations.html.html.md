This moment is about police brutality, but it’s not only about police
brutality. The word I keep hearing is “exhausted.”

People are exhausted by and fed up with the enduring [wealth
disparities](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/)
between white and black, with the health disparities that leave black
people more vulnerable to Covid-19, with the centuries-long disparities
in violence and the threat of violence, with daily indignities of
African-Americans and stains that linger on our nation decade after
decade.

The killing of George Floyd happened in a context — and that context is
racial disparity.

Racial disparity doesn’t make for gripping YouTube videos. It doesn’t
spark mass protests because it’s not an event; it’s just the daily
condition of our lives.

It’s just a condition that people in affluent Manhattan live in one
universe and people a few miles away in the Bronx live in a different
universe. It’s just a condition that many black families send their kids
to struggling inner-city schools while white families move to the
suburbs and put on black T-shirts every few years to protest racial
injustice.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The response to this moment will be inadequate if it’s just police
reforms. There has to be a greater effort to tackle the wider
disparities.

Reparations and integration are the way to do that. Reparations would
involve an official apology for centuries of slavery and discrimination,
and spending money to reduce their effects.

There’s a wrong way to spend that money: trying to find the descendants
of slaves and sending them a check. That would launch a politically
ruinous argument over who qualifies for the money, and at the end of the
day people might be left with a $1,000 check that would produce no
lasting change.

Giving reparations money to neighborhoods is the way to go.

A lot of the segregation in this country is geographic. In
[Minneapolis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/30/minneapolis-racial-inequality/),
where Floyd was killed, early-20th-century whites-only housing covenants
pushed blacks into smaller and smaller patches of the city. Highways
were built through black neighborhoods, ripping their fabric and
crippling their economic vitality.

Today, Minneapolis is as progressive as the day is long, but the city
gradually gave up on aggressive desegregation. And so you have these
long-suffering black neighborhoods. The homeownership rate for blacks in
Minneapolis is one-third the white rate. The typical black family earns
less than half as much as the typical white family.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To really change things, you have to lift up and integrate whole
communities. That’s because it takes a whole community to raise a child,
to support an adult, to have a bustling local economy and a vibrant
civic life. The neighborhood is the unit of change.

Who has the expertise to lift up whole neighborhoods? *It’s the people
who live in the neighborhoods themselves.* No outsider with a foundation
grant or a government contract really knows what’s going on in any
neighborhood or would be trusted to make change. The people who live in
the neighborhoods know what to do. They just need the resources to do
it.

A few weeks before the lockdown I was in and around South Los Angeles.
In Watts I interviewed Keisha Daniels from [Sisters of
Watts](https://sistersofwatts.org/), which helps kids and homeless
people in a variety of ways. I interviewed Barak and Sara Bomani
of[Unearth and Empower Communities](https://www.unearthandempower.org/),
which helps educate and nurture young people in nearby Compton.

Daniels and the Bomanis are experts in how to lift up their
neighborhoods. If we got them money and support they would figure out
what to do.

How can government focus money on formerly redlined neighborhoods and
other communities?

National service programs [would pay young
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/opinion/national-service-americorps-coronavirus.html)
to work for these organizations. A National Endowment for Civic
Architecture, modeled on, say, the National Endowment for the Arts,
could support neighborhood groups around the country. A Social
Innovation Fund would be a private/public partnership to fund such
organizations. Moving to Opportunity grants and K-12 education savings
accounts would help minorities to move to integrated schools.
[Collective impact
structures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/08/opinion/collective-impact-community-civic-architecture.html)
could coordinate[local
action](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/04/opinion/canada-poverty-record.html)
and use data to find what works.

In the progressive era, governments built libraries across the country,
which remain vital centers of neighborhood life. We’re about to have a
lot of empty retail space. Why can’t we build Opportunity Centers where
all the groups moving children from cradle to career could work and
collaborate?

It’s true this has sort of been tried before. The Great Society had a
“Community Action” project that professed to redistribute power to
neighborhoods. But it did it in the worst possible ways. A lot of what
it did involved sending disruptive agitators to stir up conflict between
local activists and local elected officials. The result was rancor and
gridlock.

This tumultuous moment offers a chance to launch a new chapter in our
history, and reparations are part of that launch. They offer a chance to
build vibrant neighborhoods where diverse people want to live together,
where the atmosphere is kids playing on the sidewalks and not a knee in
the back of the neck.
