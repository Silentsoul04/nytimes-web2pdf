  sam\\
  I remember before the internet, and the minute the internet was
  available, I had private tutors come over to my house and teach me.
  From day one, the awe of it. The whole world is at your fingertips
  with a few clicks of your mouse. The power of it takes my breath away.

  kevin roose\\
  Would you do me a favor and just introduce yourself real quick? Just
  so that we have it ---
\item
  sam\\
  --- I don't want to use my name.
\item
  kevin roose\\
  OK. Can you just introduce yourself maybe just with your first name?
\item
  sam\\
  Well no, because that's my name on Twitter.
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Mm.
\item
  sam\\
  My nickname is Sam. So you can just call me Sam.
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Sure.
\item
  sam\\
  You want me to do an introduction? Like, hi, this is Sam. I got out of
  the Q cult. So should you. (LAUGHS)
\item
  {[}music{]}
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Had you ever been attracted to a conspiracy theory before?
\item
  sam\\
  No. No, not at all. The 9/11, the moon, the flat Earth --- no. But I
  know the financial system is rigged against us. I've watched it. I've
  lived it.
\item
  archived recording\\
  Let's talk about the speed with which we are watching this market
  deteriorate.
\end{itemize}

sam

In 2008.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Traders saying this is the craziest day they have ever seen in these
  markets.
\end{itemize}

sam

I lost everything in the housing collapse.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Houses are in foreclosure in a slump triggered by subprime mortgages.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  Many say they've been left in shock and are simply waiting to see what
  will happen next.
\end{itemize}

sam

And then ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  \$700 billion to rescue the country's failing banks.
\end{itemize}

sam

--- the government bailed out all the banks. The banks got all the
money, got all the houses, got all the bailout money. And you can't help
but reflect upon all that you've managed to lose because of the unfair
banking system. And I was, you know, kind of in mourning. So I would had
different stages. You go through a grieving process, you go to anger. I
pretty much got stuck in anger.

  Holy moly.
\end{itemize}

sam

And then ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  They're calling this the ``big one,'' perhaps the worst in a
  generation.
\end{itemize}

andy mills

--- when Irma came through ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  More than 6 million Floridians have been told to evacuate.
\end{itemize}

sam

--- I was just devastated, again.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Tonight. the images now emerging of the utter destruction Hurricane
  Irma left behind.
\end{itemize}

sam

It was a nightmare.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Buildings and trees ripped apart. Hundreds now homeless.
\end{itemize}

sam

Got out with maybe 10 percent of my belongings and my car. And my
friend's like, ``Well, just come live with me.'' I'd known him 10 years,
and so I didn't mind coming in and moving in as a roommate.

I was here in a new town, living in a friend's living room, like the kid
that just got out of college and was trying to figure out what to do
with their life. So I was very emotionally fragile at that time. And I
wasn't working. I had a lot of time on my hands. And I spent a lot of
time online.

{[}music{]}

I had the whole house to myself all day. And I would put YouTube onto
the giant TV.

And then YouTube recommended the QAnon to me. That's how I found them.

kevin roose

Before you found Q, like right before that, what YouTube videos were you
watching?

sam

Before Q?

kevin roose

Mm-hm.

sam

A lot of music.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  music (trampled by turtles "whiskey")\\
  I ain't got a dime in my pocket.
\end{itemize}

sam

I would listen to ``Whiskey.''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  music (trampled by turtles "whiskey")\\
  I just stepped on my last cigarette.
\end{itemize}

sam

By Trampled by Turtles.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  music (pentatonix "hallelujah")\\
  Hallelujah.
\end{itemize}

sam

And Pentatonix's ``Hallelujah.''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  music (pentatonix "hallelujah")\\
  Hallelujah.
\end{itemize}

sam

I watched Elizabeth Warren.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  America has always been some poor, some rich, and big, big, solid
  middle class.
\end{itemize}

sam

She is amazing.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  It's part of what gives us our political stability. It's what affects
  our economy and drives our economy. It affects our self-identity. It
  affects who we are in this world.
\end{itemize}

sam

She did an analysis of how the monetary system is set up to favor the
wealthy.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  I fear that what's happening and what these data are about is that we
  actually are going to see a larger upper class. And then the rest is
  just one long trail of underclass.
\end{itemize}

sam

It's about an hour-and-a-half-long video. I've probably watched it four
times.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  And there it is. Inflation-adjusted dollars. A 76 percent increase in
  what a family spends on a mortgage. That's the mortgage payment ---
\end{itemize}

sam

It gave me an explanation as why it's so difficult to thrive.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  And I think what this means is that it's time to realign our political
  interests and alliances ---
\end{itemize}

sam

It helped me to not personalize it, that I did something wrong.
{[}LAUGHING{]} You know?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  To talk more about what's happening to these families. So with that,
  I'm going to quit and take as many questions as people have.
  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

sam

And then I was watching Lynette Zang.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (lynette zang)\\
  If you had a \$20 bill 20 years ago, and you have a \$20 bill today,
  nominally, they're identical. They're both \$20 bills. But what that
  would buy you 20 years ago and what that buys you today is vastly
  different.
\end{itemize}

sam

She's a financial analyst.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (lynette zang)\\
  The original J.P. Morgan said it best. Gold is money. Everything else
  is credit.
\end{itemize}

sam

She's definitely all about holding gold.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (sean turnbull)\\
  Hey, friends. Sean from SGTReport.com here with an important silver,
  gold, and cryptocurrency update.
\end{itemize}

sam

I would watch the SGT report, too.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (sean turnbull)\\
  --- at SGTReport.com, where we bring you real news 24/7. I have on the
  line right now ---
\end{itemize}

sam

Another pundit on the global banking system and what's going on with the
market.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  (SINGING) Bye bye, banker. Bye bye, banker. Bye bye, banker. No
  bailouts come this time.
\end{itemize}

sam

I really enjoyed his channel a lot.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (jim willie)\\
  The dollar is in the process of dying.
\end{itemize}

sam

And I would watch Jim Willie, who is the author of ``The Golden
Jackass.'' It's all about asset-backed currency.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (jim willie)\\
  The member banks of the Federal Reserve, the regional bank, they all
  report to the main headquarters. And they serve the Wall Street banks
  and the big banks of the United States.
\end{itemize}

sam

That's what I was watching.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (lynette zang)\\
  For governments, the key in this is --- it's inflation.
\end{itemize}

sam

All day.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  youtube video (sgt report)\\
  I mean, the whole thing is a con, and now it's breaking down. That's
  what we get to watch.
\item
  youtube video (sean at sgt)\\
  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. I'm so glad ---
\item
  youtube video\\
  So many are still asleep at the wheel. They're locked in their iPhone.
\item
  youtube video (jim willie)\\
  This is sickening stuff, undermining democracy that's been undermined
  now for the last 30 years. It's not a new trend.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And I wonder at the time, was that your main source of information? Were
you also looking at more mainstream news outlets?

sam

Definitely watched mainstream news. Absolutely. Because then you can
cross compare what they say to what's really going on.

That's when YouTube recommended this video to me about QAnon.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  Hello, it's Katie G. How's everybody doing tonight? I'm going to play
  a video while we're waiting for people to come in and get myself set
  up here. So let's see. Turn the camera off. Ready? Here we go, down
  the rabbit hole.
\end{itemize}

sam

Katie G. was her name.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  Ooh, there we go.
\end{itemize}

sam

She was adorable.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  I'm live. {[}CHUCKLES{]}
\end{itemize}

sam

And funny, and giggly.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  What happens when 90 percent of the media is controlled --- owned---
  by six corporations?
\end{itemize}

sam

And smart.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  What happens when those same corporations are operated and controlled
  by political ideology? How does the average person who is under
  constant financial stress --- by design --- find time to research and
  discern fact versus fiction? They don't. We are the news now.
\end{itemize}

sam

She was a deep diver. She was what I consider to be a research-based
analyst.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  Would POTUS make a serious accusation if truth wasn't about to come to
  light? Let's go back to POTUS's post again. Look at the picture here.
  It's our George Washington crossing the Delaware.
\end{itemize}

sam

Very impressive lady.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  Now, DoD uses the same picture, crossing the Delaware.
\end{itemize}

sam

In my mind, OK, they're going to go after the banks.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  This is from Dec. 7, 2017. He says, ``Rothschilds, cult leaders,
  church, banks, the financial.'' So they control the banks and the
  financial institutions. Worldwide government control.
\end{itemize}

sam

And the politicians that are on the payola and doing deals behind closed
doors that are unaudited. That's what sucked me in.

{[}music{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  youtube video\\
  This is an old post from Q. ``Stay together. Be strong. Fight the
  censorship. You the people have all the power.''
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  This to me is a confirmation of what I had said before.
\end{itemize}

sam

I felt like a part of something that was really meaningful.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  Oh, this is so big, you guys. It's so big. We can't even believe how
  big it is.
\end{itemize}

sam

That we're fixing everything. The world's going to change. The good guys
are winning.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  Hey, guys. It's Katie G. It's like, 2:30 in the morning here where I
  am. {[}LAUGHS{]}
\end{itemize}

sam

And I couldn't wait to see the next Katie G. video.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  We have a new Q post. Knew it was coming. I knew it.
\end{itemize}

sam

Or DeceptionBytes video.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  All right, I got it up. Let me read this out. Here we go. OK, here we
  go.
\end{itemize}

sam

And I would wait, anticipate every drop. I couldn't wait to see what was
going to be next.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  Everything has meaning. Who is Ambassador Matlock?
\end{itemize}

sam

When a new Q drop would come, I would have a visceral reaction.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  There is a purpose for every tweet.
\end{itemize}

sam

Like a physical joy.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  The Great Awakening. No deals. Trust the plan. Happy Sunday. Q.
\end{itemize}

sam

Goose bumps.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  youtube video\\
  We have allowed ourselves to be controlled by the puppet masters. And
  we will continue to let them control us until we are put in a
  situation where we will either surrender all personal freedoms, or we
  will throw off the chains of oppression.

  So Q posted this from 1 Corinthians 13. ``Love is patient, love is
  kind. It does not envy, it does not boast. It is not --- ''
\end{itemize}

sam

What got me out was they posted Bible verses. And I just immediately
knew ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  '' --- keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but
  rejoice --- ''
\end{itemize}

sam

--- that it was fake.

I was like, OK, let me get this straight. We're a military intelligence.
We've got a secret channel that we can communicate, and we're going to
proselytize about the Bible and risk a military channel that's leaking?
No.

kevin roose

So ---

sam

It makes no sense at all to me. It's because my father was military. I
grew up in --- he was military ops. I knew that that was just a
marketing ploy. I mean, they were hitting their market base. Their
market base are conservative church ladies. The middle America. The Joe
Sixpack. That's who they're marketing. And they wanted to bring the
religious aspect in so they could broaden their base so they can make
more money on the T-shirts, and the mugs, and the donations, and the app
memberships.

kevin roose

So you felt like Q, whoever it was, had been taking a risk by posting
these secrets and this classified information? And that if Q were real
and really part of this military intelligence operation, that they
wouldn't post a Bible verse because it was ---

sam

You're either military intelligence, or you're a preacher. And if you're
a military preacher, you're in a chapel. You're not next to the
president. It was just logic. It was just an instant, to me, an instant
pulling back of the curtain of what they were doing. And the minute I
saw that, I was just crestfallen. Because I knew that it was all fake.
And it was the instant. It was like a death. And then I was angry again.
And I said, well, you know, there is no hope. This is just ridiculous.
There's no way. This is not real. I've wasted three months of my life
researching fakeness. I really felt like I'd been had.

kevin roose

How much time are you spending online now?

sam

Well, now that the coronavirus lockdown has started, now I'm not
working, I'm spending quite a bit of time. I probably spend watching
what's going on now probably about four hours a day.

kevin roose

And do you ever worry that you could fall into something like QAnon
again?

sam

Absolutely not. I am so cynical. I am so done. I just don't believe
anything anymore. {[}LAUGHS{]}

kevin roose

Well, say more about that.

sam

I mean, I lost my job because of the Covid. I was vested for retirement
this year. And I haven't worked. My kids haven't worked, because we are
all in hospitality. And I have tried to reach unemployment for three
weeks. I got them on the phone today. She spent an hour trying to
register me for unemployment, and the computer wouldn't let her. And she
can't mail me a letter. She can't call me back. So I have to spend
another three weeks trying to get them on the phone. In the meantime, my
landlord gave me a three-day notice in the middle of a rent moratorium.

kevin roose

I guess I'm ---

sam

No, I'm so done. It's not there. There is no awakening.

kevin roose

Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm remembering you saying that when you found Q,
you were pretty cynical and thought the government was screwing you and
things were unfair, and you had a lot of time on your hands. And I
think, I mean, that's sort of what you're saying your life is like now,
right?

sam

Yeah. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. No way. Q
is a lie. {[}LAUGHS{]} Our system is all set up towards the people in
control.

kevin roose

But isn't that what Q is saying?

sam

He is saying that, and that's why I got sucked in. But remember, he's
also saying that he talks to the president and that the intel he's
getting is direct from the government. My thing is the source. Q's
source is a lie. Therefore, anything he says or Q drops say are suspect
and questionable.

kevin roose

Even though you don't think Q is real, you're still allowing that some
of what Q has said might be true?

sam

Those things were true before I found Q, and those things are marketing
tools for Q to grow his client base.

kevin roose

Do you still believe in some sort of global cabal?

sam

It's not whether I believe it or not. It's true.

{[}music{]}

kevin roose

QAnon, as a movement, continues to grow. And as it does, its message is
being amplified by people with real political power, including President
Trump ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Although he's never explicitly acknowledged the conspiracy theory, he
  has retweeted profiles with the QAnon logo and QAnon messaging in
  their bios. He's also met and taken an Oval Office photo ---
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- who has used his Twitter account to retweet or respond to QAnon
messages or QAnon-related accounts dozens of times.

{[}crowd chatter{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  kevin roose\\
  We're --- I guess we're in the opening acts of the Trump rally in
  Sunrise, Fla. Arena is filling up. There's still about two hours left
  to go before President Trump is slated to speak. And we are looking

  q enthusiast 3\\
  Well, it stands for QAnon.
\item
  q enthusiast 4\\
  Yeah, Q! Awesome. Love it.
\item
  q enthusiast 3\\
  Yeah. It's kind of an alternative that's building up an audience. What
  it means is taking back what belongs to you from the government.
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Hi, ma'am. We're talking to people about QAnon. Have you heard of
  QAnon?
\item
  q enthusiast 5\\
  Yes, I have. I believe in it. I don't think it's a conspiracy.
\item
  q enthusiast 6\\
  I think that in 10, 20 years, it'll be probably part of history

  middle school because of how it's changing history.

All right, so Kevin, as you and I are talking today in June 2020, a year
into all this --- kind of a big question, but like, where is it things
stand with the internet?

kevin roose

Well, right now, we're in this really interesting moment. All these big
social media platforms, they're getting more criticism than they ever
have ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  They've had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide,
  alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- with some of the loudest voices saying that they're exerting too
much control over what appears on their platforms.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (tucker carlson)\\
  It's likely we'll see this moment as a turning point in the way we

kevin roose

And as they pull more things down and make more new rules ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  Obviously, they have a political motivation for removing information.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- that act of control actually fuels this notion among certain corners
of the internet ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  --- if anything, that actually makes me want to watch them even more.
  Because if there's something in there that the media doesn't want me
  to say, hell, I want to see it.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- that there is this secret, forbidden knowledge out there.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  I want to know what it is that's so damning to the official narrative
  that they want to hide it from me.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

At the exact same time ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  The world wide web is now more connected than ever before. Tens of
  millions of people suddenly forced to stay in and log in.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- they have never been more popular.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Social media usage has ramped up significantly during the lockdown.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  This is unprecedented, that we're seeing this kind of demand.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

Twitter just reported that its usage has grown 23 percent since last
year. Facebook has said that, in some of the countries that were hit
hardest by the coronavirus, the time that people are spending on its
apps has increased by as much as 70 percent.

And so many people are watching so much YouTube ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  The massive migration online is putting our internet infrastructure to
  the test.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  People are asking, will all of this break the internet?
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- that the company actually had to lower the quality of its videos to
keep the internet from overloading.

YouTube wouldn't tell me exactly how much watch time has jumped up. But
one data firm estimated that 15 percent of all traffic on the internet
right now is coming from people watching YouTube videos. That's almost
double what it was last year.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Testing, testing, testing.

  How are you? I'm Kevin.
\item
  speaker 1\\
  Hi, I'm Daniel.
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Can I ask you a question, and you tell me honestly? How much like
  YouTube would you say you guys watch a day?
\item
  speaker 1\\
  Too much.
\item
  speaker 2\\
  I spend all of my time, every single {[}EXPLETIVE{]} day.
\item
  speaker 3\\
  Yeah, it's insane.
\item
  speaker 1\\
  Too much. It's like, oh, I got so much to do. And then at 3 a.m., I'm
  like, huh, look at that. And then I don't stop.
\item
  speaker 3\\
  I'm like, basically always doing it. Like, if I'm out on a walk, I'm
  using my data to watch YouTube.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And just looking forward to what this all means ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  kevin roose\\
  What do you like about your favorite YouTubers?
\item
  speaker 4\\
  Well, they just really inspire me. Like, they give me more ideas of
  what I should do, because when I get older, I want to at least have a
  YouTube channel.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

In survey after survey over the last few years, when young people around
the world are asked what they want to do with their lives ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 5\\
  Honestly, my main goal was, I would love to be a YouTuber. Like, that
  was the, the goal.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- they respond that they want to be online influencers.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 5\\
  I was stuck in a world where I felt so creative all the time in
  school, but I didn't know how I could use that. Everybody was telling
  me, oh, you have to be a doctor. Oh, you have to do this.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

There was this one survey where they gave kids a bunch of options, like
do you want to be a scientist, or a lawyer, or an astronaut? And the
kids basically said, overwhelmingly, no. I want to be famous on social
media.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 6\\
  At first, I did it for fun. But starting to grow older, you can think,
  actually, you can turn it into a career, and you meet awesome people
  from it.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

Last year, I actually went to go talk to some of those aspiring online
influencers at this event called VidCon.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  kevin roose\\
  So why do you guys come to VidCon?
\item
  speaker 7\\
  Mostly to collab with my friends and meet everyone.
\item
  speaker 8\\
  Yeah. I just want to meet all my friends that are on the internet that
  I haven't been able to before.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

Which is the biggest convention of social media influencers in the
world.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Why are you guys here?
\item
  speaker 9\\
  My goal is to like, boost my watch time. So I would just kind of like
  to learn some of the trends and kind of how to navigate the algorithm
  a little bit better.
\item
  speaker 10\\
  I'm here to collab. I'm also here to talk to companies. Next year, I
  don't want to pay to go to VidCon. I want to get invited.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And all these influencers show up ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Oh, we got screaming fans over here.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- in Southern California.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kevin roose\\
  People are lining up to take selfies.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

With their entourages. And they do these meet and greets with their
fans. And they get courted by agents and all these huge brands.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kevin roose\\
  I'm here at the YouTube party. A bunch of people hanging out.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And then they go off to these like lavish private parties.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kevin roose\\
  There must be a thousand people in here.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And it's kind of a big celebration of this multi-billion-dollar industry
that a ton of people are clamoring to break into. And, increasingly,
where they told me they were trying to break in and get noticed ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 12\\
  YouTube is slowly but surely dying. The creators are getting worse, I
  guess. I feel like they're just trying too hard to be like everyone
  else and not being themselves.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- wasn't YouTube.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Are there more TikTokers or YouTubers here?
\item
  speaker 12\\
  TikTokers.
\item
  speaker 13\\
  TikTok has literally taken over VidCon.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

It was TikTok.

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

{[}music{]}

kevin roose

Which is exactly how it was designed to feel.

andy mills

And what do you mean that?

kevin roose

So unlike a lot of American social media companies, which started off as
basically open platforms and have only recently started to implement
more rules and restrictions, TikTok is owned by this Chinese company,
ByteDance, which has been way more heavy-handed in curating and
controlling what appears on its app. Whether that's meant hiding
controversial political speech, or more subtle things, like making sure
that the people whose posts show up on the main feed look happy and
beautiful. And it seems like what they're really trying to do is to
create the most entertaining, light, glossy version of reality that they
can.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 14\\
  Does anyone want to be in my TikTok?
\item
  speaker 15\\
  TikTok is definitely the place to build an audience right now. It's so
  open and creative.
\item
  speaker 16\\
  As of right now, TikTok is the app to be on.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And it's working. People love TikTok. They've downloaded it something
like 1.5 billion times.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 16\\
  TikTok is very easy to get followers. I feel like ---
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

It's the fastest growing app in the world.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 17\\
  I got thousands of views.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

Just as a point of context, the number one star on TikTok is a
16-year-old girl who went from 0 to 60 million followers in a year.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 17\\
  And we were able to get a viral hit just because people liked the
  video, and it was seen.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

Which took PewDiePie on YouTube eight years.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Like, how many hours a day do you think you spend on TikTok?
\end{itemize}

{[}laughter{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 18\\
  Too much.
\item
  speaker 19\\
  Too much, honestly.
\item
  speaker 20\\
  Way too much.
\item
  speaker 19\\
  I honestly ---
\item
  kevin roose\\
  If I checked your phone, would it be like, six hours?
\item
  speaker 20\\
  Yeah, around there.
\item
  speaker 19\\
  Maybe more. Like, 10 hours.
\item
  kevin roose\\
  10 hours a day on TikTok?
\item
  speaker 20\\
  Yeah.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And, of course, a lot of what's fueling TikTok's success is an
incredibly sophisticated algorithm. Just like the ones that run YouTube
and Facebook and all the other big social media platforms, TikTok's
algorithm is constantly learning from people what they want to see, and
what will capture and keep their attention. And actually, ByteDance,
this Chinese tech company, it doesn't even really see TikTok or any of
the other apps it owns as its primary product because ByteDance has this
huge, advanced artificial intelligence lab --- one of the biggest in the
world. And its goal, way beyond just making a fun social media app, is
to become the world leader in the development of superpowered A.I.

andy mills

OK, Kevin. So in our attempts to better understand what the internet is
doing to us, here's where it sounds like we're landing.

kevin roose

Mm-hmm.

andy mills

First, we know that the internet is largely being run by these
sophisticated artificial intelligences that have tapped into our base
impulses, our deepest desires, whether we would admit that or not. And
they've used that information to show us a picture of reality that is
hyperbolic and polarizing and entertaining and, essentially, distorted.

kevin roose

Right.

andy mills

And now there are even more of these algorithms than ever before, and
they are getting even smarter.

kevin roose

And they're doing that in part because the technology is just getting
better. But it's also because we are giving them exactly what they are
programmed to want, which is more of our attention.

andy mills

Right. And so, in the end, what we have is a situation where the A.I.s
keep showing us this distorted reality. And then we keep paying
attention to that. And in doing so, we are telling them that we would
like to see more of this distorted reality. And, essentially, we're
living inside of this loop that's getting faster and faster and showing
us a world that is getting more and more and more distorted.

kevin roose

Right.

{[}music{]}

kevin roose

And the more and more time we spend online, the more this distorted
vision of the world actually becomes our reality.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  It spans the globe like a superhighway. It is called internet.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  The internet gave us a whole world of exciting new possibilities. So I
  guess this is a story of how it changed our lives.

  I remember before the internet, and the minute the internet was

--- the government bailed out all the banks. The banks got all the
money, got all the houses, got all the bailout money. And you can't help
but reflect upon all that you've managed to lose because of the unfair
banking system. And I was, you know, kind of in mourning. So I would had
different stages. You go through a grieving process, you go to anger. I
pretty much got stuck in anger.

sam

Got out with maybe 10 percent of my belongings and my car. And my
friend's like, ``Well, just come live with me.'' I'd known him 10 years,
and so I didn't mind coming in and moving in as a roommate.

I was here in a new town, living in a friend's living room, like the kid
that just got out of college and was trying to figure out what to do
with their life. So I was very emotionally fragile at that time. And I
wasn't working. I had a lot of time on my hands. And I spent a lot of
time online.

{[}music{]}

I had the whole house to myself all day. And I would put YouTube onto
the giant TV.

And then YouTube recommended the QAnon to me. That's how I found them.

kevin roose

Before you found Q, like right before that, what YouTube videos were you
watching?

sam

Before Q?

kevin roose

Mm-hm.

sam

A lot of music.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  music (trampled by turtles "whiskey")\\
  I ain't got a dime in my pocket.
\end{itemize}

sam

I would listen to ``Whiskey.''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  music (trampled by turtles "whiskey")\\
  I just stepped on my last cigarette.
\end{itemize}

sam

By Trampled by Turtles.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  music (pentatonix "hallelujah")\\
  Hallelujah.
\end{itemize}

sam

And Pentatonix's ``Hallelujah.''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  music (pentatonix "hallelujah")\\
  Hallelujah.
\end{itemize}

sam

I watched Elizabeth Warren.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  America has always been some poor, some rich, and big, big, solid
  middle class.
\end{itemize}

sam

She is amazing.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  It's part of what gives us our political stability. It's what affects
  our economy and drives our economy. It affects our self-identity. It
  affects who we are in this world.
\end{itemize}

sam

She did an analysis of how the monetary system is set up to favor the
wealthy.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  I fear that what's happening and what these data are about is that we
  actually are going to see a larger upper class. And then the rest is
  just one long trail of underclass.
\end{itemize}

sam

It's about an hour-and-a-half-long video. I've probably watched it four
times.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  And there it is. Inflation-adjusted dollars. A 76 percent increase in
  what a family spends on a mortgage. That's the mortgage payment ---
\end{itemize}

sam

It gave me an explanation as why it's so difficult to thrive.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  And I think what this means is that it's time to realign our political
  interests and alliances ---
\end{itemize}

sam

It helped me to not personalize it, that I did something wrong.
{[}LAUGHING{]} You know?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (elizabeth warren)\\
  To talk more about what's happening to these families. So with that,
  I'm going to quit and take as many questions as people have.
  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

sam

And then I was watching Lynette Zang.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (lynette zang)\\
  If you had a \$20 bill 20 years ago, and you have a \$20 bill today,
  nominally, they're identical. They're both \$20 bills. But what that
  would buy you 20 years ago and what that buys you today is vastly
  different.
\end{itemize}

sam

She's a financial analyst.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (lynette zang)\\
  The original J.P. Morgan said it best. Gold is money. Everything else

  Hey, friends. Sean from SGTReport.com here with an important silver,

I really enjoyed his channel a lot.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (jim willie)\\
  The dollar is in the process of dying.
\end{itemize}

sam

And I would watch Jim Willie, who is the author of ``The Golden
Jackass.'' It's all about asset-backed currency.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (jim willie)\\
  The member banks of the Federal Reserve, the regional bank, they all
  report to the main headquarters. And they serve the Wall Street banks
  and the big banks of the United States.
\end{itemize}

sam

That's what I was watching.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (lynette zang)\\
  For governments, the key in this is --- it's inflation.
\end{itemize}

sam

All day.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  youtube video (sgt report)\\
  I mean, the whole thing is a con, and now it's breaking down. That's
  what we get to watch.
\item
  youtube video (sean at sgt)\\
  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. I'm so glad ---

  So many are still asleep at the wheel. They're locked in their iPhone.
\item
  youtube video (jim willie)\\
  This is sickening stuff, undermining democracy that's been undermined
  now for the last 30 years. It's not a new trend.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And I wonder at the time, was that your main source of information? Were
you also looking at more mainstream news outlets?

sam

Definitely watched mainstream news. Absolutely. Because then you can
cross compare what they say to what's really going on.

That's when YouTube recommended this video to me about QAnon.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video (katie g)\\
  Hello, it's Katie G. How's everybody doing tonight? I'm going to play
  a video while we're waiting for people to come in and get myself set

  So Q posted this from 1 Corinthians 13. ``Love is patient, love is
  kind. It does not envy, it does not boast. It is not --- ''

What got me out was they posted Bible verses. And I just immediately
knew ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  '' --- keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but
  rejoice --- ''
\end{itemize}

sam

--- that it was fake.

I was like, OK, let me get this straight. We're a military intelligence.
We've got a secret channel that we can communicate, and we're going to
proselytize about the Bible and risk a military channel that's leaking?
No.

kevin roose

So ---

sam

It makes no sense at all to me. It's because my father was military. I
grew up in --- he was military ops. I knew that that was just a
marketing ploy. I mean, they were hitting their market base. Their
market base are conservative church ladies. The middle America. The Joe
Sixpack. That's who they're marketing. And they wanted to bring the
religious aspect in so they could broaden their base so they can make
more money on the T-shirts, and the mugs, and the donations, and the app
memberships.

kevin roose

So you felt like Q, whoever it was, had been taking a risk by posting
these secrets and this classified information? And that if Q were real
and really part of this military intelligence operation, that they
wouldn't post a Bible verse because it was ---

sam

You're either military intelligence, or you're a preacher. And if you're
a military preacher, you're in a chapel. You're not next to the
president. It was just logic. It was just an instant, to me, an instant
pulling back of the curtain of what they were doing. And the minute I
saw that, I was just crestfallen. Because I knew that it was all fake.
And it was the instant. It was like a death. And then I was angry again.
And I said, well, you know, there is no hope. This is just ridiculous.
There's no way. This is not real. I've wasted three months of my life
researching fakeness. I really felt like I'd been had.

kevin roose

How much time are you spending online now?

sam

Well, now that the coronavirus lockdown has started, now I'm not
working, I'm spending quite a bit of time. I probably spend watching
what's going on now probably about four hours a day.

kevin roose

And do you ever worry that you could fall into something like QAnon
again?

sam

Absolutely not. I am so cynical. I am so done. I just don't believe
anything anymore. {[}LAUGHS{]}

kevin roose

Well, say more about that.

sam

I mean, I lost my job because of the Covid. I was vested for retirement
this year. And I haven't worked. My kids haven't worked, because we are
all in hospitality. And I have tried to reach unemployment for three
weeks. I got them on the phone today. She spent an hour trying to
register me for unemployment, and the computer wouldn't let her. And she
can't mail me a letter. She can't call me back. So I have to spend
another three weeks trying to get them on the phone. In the meantime, my
landlord gave me a three-day notice in the middle of a rent moratorium.

kevin roose

I guess I'm ---

sam

No, I'm so done. It's not there. There is no awakening.

kevin roose

Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm remembering you saying that when you found Q,
you were pretty cynical and thought the government was screwing you and
things were unfair, and you had a lot of time on your hands. And I
think, I mean, that's sort of what you're saying your life is like now,
right?

sam

Yeah. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. No way. Q
is a lie. {[}LAUGHS{]} Our system is all set up towards the people in
control.

kevin roose

But isn't that what Q is saying?

sam

He is saying that, and that's why I got sucked in. But remember, he's
also saying that he talks to the president and that the intel he's
getting is direct from the government. My thing is the source. Q's
source is a lie. Therefore, anything he says or Q drops say are suspect
and questionable.

kevin roose

Even though you don't think Q is real, you're still allowing that some
of what Q has said might be true?

sam

Those things were true before I found Q, and those things are marketing
tools for Q to grow his client base.

kevin roose

Do you still believe in some sort of global cabal?

sam

It's not whether I believe it or not. It's true.

All right, so Kevin, as you and I are talking today in June 2020, a year
into all this --- kind of a big question, but like, where is it things
stand with the internet?

kevin roose

Well, right now, we're in this really interesting moment. All these big
social media platforms, they're getting more criticism than they ever
have ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  They've had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide,
  alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- with some of the loudest voices saying that they're exerting too
much control over what appears on their platforms.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (tucker carlson)\\
  It's likely we'll see this moment as a turning point in the way we
  live in this country. A sharp break with 250 years of law and custom.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And as they pull more things down and make more new rules ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  Obviously, they have a political motivation for removing information.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- that act of control actually fuels this notion among certain corners
of the internet ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  youtube video\\
  --- if anything, that actually makes me want to watch them even more.
  Because if there's something in there that the media doesn't want me
  to say, hell, I want to see it.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

--- that there is this secret, forbidden knowledge out there.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

  I want to know what it is that's so damning to the official narrative
  that they want to hide it from me.

kevin roose

At the exact same time ---

\begin{itemize}

  This is unprecedented, that we're seeing this kind of demand.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

Twitter just reported that its usage has grown 23 percent since last
year. Facebook has said that, in some of the countries that were hit
hardest by the coronavirus, the time that people are spending on its
apps has increased by as much as 70 percent.

kevin roose

--- that the company actually had to lower the quality of its videos to
keep the internet from overloading.

YouTube wouldn't tell me exactly how much watch time has jumped up. But
one data firm estimated that 15 percent of all traffic on the internet
right now is coming from people watching YouTube videos. That's almost
double what it was last year.

kevin roose

There was this one survey where they gave kids a bunch of options, like
do you want to be a scientist, or a lawyer, or an astronaut? And the
kids basically said, overwhelmingly, no. I want to be famous on social
media.

kevin roose

Which is exactly how it was designed to feel.

andy mills

And what do you mean that?

kevin roose

So unlike a lot of American social media companies, which started off as
basically open platforms and have only recently started to implement
more rules and restrictions, TikTok is owned by this Chinese company,
ByteDance, which has been way more heavy-handed in curating and
controlling what appears on its app. Whether that's meant hiding
controversial political speech, or more subtle things, like making sure
that the people whose posts show up on the main feed look happy and
beautiful. And it seems like what they're really trying to do is to
create the most entertaining, light, glossy version of reality that they
can.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 14\\
  Does anyone want to be in my TikTok?
\item
  speaker 15\\
  TikTok is definitely the place to build an audience right now. It's so
  open and creative.
\item
  speaker 16\\
  As of right now, TikTok is the app to be on.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And it's working. People love TikTok. They've downloaded it something
like 1.5 billion times.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 16\\
  TikTok is very easy to get followers. I feel like ---
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

It's the fastest growing app in the world.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 17\\
  I got thousands of views.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

Just as a point of context, the number one star on TikTok is a
16-year-old girl who went from 0 to 60 million followers in a year.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 17\\
  And we were able to get a viral hit just because people liked the
  video, and it was seen.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

Which took PewDiePie on YouTube eight years.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kevin roose\\
  Like, how many hours a day do you think you spend on TikTok?
\end{itemize}

{[}laughter{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 18\\
  Too much.
\item
  speaker 19\\
  Too much, honestly.
\item
  speaker 20\\
  Way too much.
\item
  speaker 19\\
  I honestly ---
\item
  kevin roose\\
  If I checked your phone, would it be like, six hours?
\item
  speaker 20\\
  Yeah, around there.
\item
  speaker 19\\
  Maybe more. Like, 10 hours.
\item
  kevin roose\\
  10 hours a day on TikTok?
\item
  speaker 20\\
  Yeah.
\end{itemize}

kevin roose

And, of course, a lot of what's fueling TikTok's success is an
incredibly sophisticated algorithm. Just like the ones that run YouTube
and Facebook and all the other big social media platforms, TikTok's
algorithm is constantly learning from people what they want to see, and
what will capture and keep their attention. And actually, ByteDance,
this Chinese tech company, it doesn't even really see TikTok or any of
the other apps it owns as its primary product because ByteDance has this
huge, advanced artificial intelligence lab --- one of the biggest in the
world. And its goal, way beyond just making a fun social media app, is
to become the world leader in the development of superpowered A.I.

andy mills

OK, Kevin. So in our attempts to better understand what the internet is
doing to us, here's where it sounds like we're landing.

kevin roose

Mm-hmm.

andy mills

First, we know that the internet is largely being run by these
sophisticated artificial intelligences that have tapped into our base
impulses, our deepest desires, whether we would admit that or not. And
they've used that information to show us a picture of reality that is
hyperbolic and polarizing and entertaining and, essentially, distorted.

kevin roose

Right.

And now there are even more of these algorithms than ever before, and
they are getting even smarter.

kevin roose

And they're doing that in part because the technology is just getting
better. But it's also because we are giving them exactly what they are
programmed to want, which is more of our attention.

andy mills

Right. And so, in the end, what we have is a situation where the A.I.s
keep showing us this distorted reality. And then we keep paying
attention to that. And in doing so, we are telling them that we would
like to see more of this distorted reality. And, essentially, we're
living inside of this loop that's getting faster and faster and showing
us a world that is getting more and more and more distorted.

kevin roose

Right.

And the more and more time we spend online, the more this distorted
vision of the world actually becomes our reality.

  It spans the globe like a superhighway. It is called internet.
\item

  The internet gave us a whole world of exciting new possibilities. So I
  guess this is a story of how it changed our lives.

In the finale of the series, we hear from a woman who stumbled upon the
``Q'' community and found herself drawn in. We trace echoes of her story
across the internet, and look at what our exploding culture of
influencers, TikTok stars and information disseminators holds for the
future.
