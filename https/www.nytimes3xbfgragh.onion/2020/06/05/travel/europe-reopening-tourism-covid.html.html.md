# Europe’s Patchwork Reopening

</div>

As countries consider reviving tourism, the calculus is complicated,
involving “travel bubbles,” ever-shifting timelines, virus testing and,
in some cases, self-quarantines.

As the summer tourist season approaches and Western Europe’s Covid-19
crisis continues to subside, leaders across the continent are deciding
whether and how to lift the border restrictions that they imposed amid a
flurry of emergency measures in March. The European Commission has urged
its members to coordinate their reopening, but a patchwork of strategies
has emerged. Some countries —
[Italy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/world/europe/italy-beaches-coronavirus-reopening.html)
and
[Germany](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/world/europe/germany-merkel-coronavirus-reopening.html)
among them — are reopening earlier and more widely. Others — like
Switzerland, Denmark and the Baltic States — are proceeding more slowly,
opting for [“travel
bubbles”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/travel/coronavirus-travel-bubble.html)
or bespoke lists of countries whose citizens will be allowed entry.

Both approaches have drawn criticism. Bubbles or corridors risk creating
confusion and could be seen as discriminatory, say some European
observers. But opening up borders among countries where the
epidemiological situations are vastly different risks triggering an
increase in cases, a scenario that officials are determined to avoid.
Indeed, all of the announced plans for reopening have come with an
important caveat: If Covid-19 cases start to tick back up, then borders
could again be forced to close.

“We need to be sure that a summer tourist season won’t come at the high
price of a second wave of infections,” Heiko Maas, Germany’s foreign
minister, said in May. “So there will be no ‘normal’ summer holiday this
year. Whether the Baltic or the Mediterranean — the social distancing
and hygiene rules will apply everywhere,” he said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For American tourists, Europe will remain off limits this summer, with a
few exceptions. Portugal is currently allowing entry to United States
citizens without a quarantine requirement. Britain, the Republic of
Ireland and Belarus are also open to U.S. citizens, but require a
two-week quarantine. Americans and other non-European Union nationals
may be able to visit Iceland from June 15, but all visitors will be
subject to a Covid-19 test upon arrival. Other European nations remain
closed to visitors coming from across the Atlantic.

## Reopening widely

Italy — which has Europe’s second-highest Covid-19 death toll, after
Britain — has jumped ahead of its neighbors in welcoming back tourists,
lifting border restrictions on visitors arriving from European countries
as of
[June 3.](https://www.thelocal.it/20200518/who-is-allowed-to-travel-to-italy-from-june-3rd)
The next major date in the continent’s reopening calendar will be June
15, when
[Germany](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/germany-plans-to-open-borders-for-eea-citizens-from-june-15/)
and [Belgium](https://www.belgium.be/en/corona) will allow entry to all
E.U. nationals, as well as Britons and citizens of nations like Iceland,
Norway and Switzerland that are within Europe but outside the E.U. Prime
Minister Edouard Philippe of France [has
indicated](https://twitter.com/EPhilippePM/status/1266035805262405632)
that France will do the same, allowing quarantine-free travel for
European visitors as of June 15. (However, starting on June 8, France
will ask British visitors to complete [a voluntary 14-day
self-quarantine](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/french-border-restrictions-in-response-to-coronavirus).)

The June 15 border openings will be like a “D-Day” for tourism in
Europe, Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, [told the Italian
broadcaster RAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o8VmIoN78). He added
that Germans account for a significant share of Italy’s visitors,
especially for high-end travel. The tourism sector accounts for 13
percent of Italy’s gross domestic product.

“We must salvage what we can salvage from the summer to help our
hoteliers and entrepreneurs,” Mr. Di Maio
said.

## Bubbles and bespoke lists

While Italy, Germany and France are planning to open up widely, other

lists of countries from which travel will be allowed, or establishing
“travel bubbles” along the lines of the one [being

Spain, one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, is waiting until July
to lift most of its travel restrictions. At that point, the country
plans to open up to visitors arriving from a list of nations where the
epidemic is under control, according to Manuel Muñiz, the Spanish
government’s State Secretary for Global Spain. That list hasn’t been
finalized, Mr. Muñiz said in an interview, but it will probably include
most European nations, and could be expanded to a select group of
countries from outside the region. (The country’s land borders with
neighboring France and Portugal [are due to
reopen](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-06-04/spain-to-open-land-borders-with-portugal-and-france-from-june-22.html)
on June 22.) He added that Spain has asked the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control for specific guidance on how the country
should draw up its list.

“When you talk to epidemiologists, what they tell you is that if you
have these two containers with equivalent amount of Covid risk, it’s
almost irrelevant if there are transfers of movement of people from one
place to the other,” said Mr. Muñiz. He added that tourist destinations
need to be able to do four things in order to welcome visitors safely:
Track the virus’s spread; test anyone with symptoms; trace the contacts
of those who test positive; and treat those who fall ill.

“When countries open needs to be fundamentally linked to how the disease
is performing there, and whether those capabilities are in place,” Mr.
Muñiz
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

This patchwork of reopening strategies is chaotic and will ultimately
undermine European tourism, said Eduardo Santander, the executive
director of the European Travel Commission, an association of national
tourism organizations in Europe.

“I think that creating corridors, bubbles, bilateral agreements between
countries only creates more confusion and frustration for the end
consumer,” Mr. Santander said. He added that his organization has been
lobbying for a harmonized return of travel and tourism across Europe.

“The information that is out there is so fragmented; it’s also so
confusing,” he said, adding that freedom of movement is a pillar of
European identity. “It’s not about cutting a deal with your neighboring
country,” he added. “We cannot create these kind of competitive
advantages and disadvantages.”

The European Commission, which [has
published](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_854)
a package of guidelines and recommendations on the resumption of travel
and tourism in Europe, is building a website that will serve as a
“one-stop shop” for anyone looking for the latest information on
border restrictions within the bloc. A spokeswoman for the commission
said that the site should be up and running by mid-June. In the
meantime, she recommended that potential travelers check the government
website of their desired destination to find the latest
rules.

## Waiting to see

In many European countries — especially those along the Mediterranean
coast — renewing the flow of tourists will be critical to keeping
national economies afloat. But it’s not yet clear how many people will
be willing to cross a border for their summer vacations.

“We don’t have tourism anymore. Corona has taken it all,” said Marjan
Dasic, the manager of Tarsa, a popular restaurant in Rijeka, a [Croatian
seaside
city](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/24/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-rijeka-croatia.html)
that was selected as one of Europe’s cultural capitals for 2020.

Normally, you would have to call at least a year in advance to reserve a
table at the restaurant, which can seat up to 200 people and welcomes
tourists from across Europe and beyond, Mr. Dasic said. The restaurant
reopened in May after two months of closure, “but it’s like we didn’t
open, because no one is coming,” Mr. Dasic said, adding that another
month without customers will force the restaurant to close for good.

In France, the mountain resort of Chamonix is preparing for a quieter
summer than usual. Major events like mountain races, climbing
competitions and music festivals have been canceled, but the area’s
trails will be open for hiking and mountain biking, and cable cars will
be operating with new hygiene measures in place.

Claire Burnet, a spokeswoman for the Chamonix tourist office, predicted
that tourists would come to the mountains to avoid the crowds one might
find at the beach or in a city.

“We are pretty optimistic, especially for the French market,” Burnet
said. “For the European market, we’re waiting to see.”
