Galleries had pushed back, saying coronavirus concerns would prevent
visitors from attending the prestigious art gathering.

LONDON --- Organizers of Art Basel, the centerpiece of the European art
market calendar, have canceled the show in Basel, Switzerland, in
September because of ongoing health and safety concerns related to the
coronavirus pandemic.

The 50th anniversary edition of the event, featuring more than 250
international galleries, had originally been scheduled to take place in
June, but had been postponed to Sept. 15-20.

The Swiss Federal Council had delayed its decision on whether the fair
could go ahead until later this month. Uncertainty about the regulatory
environment, together with concerns about the financial risks for
exhibitors and partners, as well as ``ongoing impediments to
international travel,'' had been additional factors in the decision to
cancel, Art Basel said in a statement.

``We are acutely aware that our galleries are facing unprecedented
challenges and economic difficulties, and we had fervently hoped to
support the art market's recovery with a successful fair in September,''
said Marc Spiegler, global director of Art Basel. ``Unfortunately, the
uncertainties that we face remain too high.''

This is another major blow to Art Basel's beleaguered Swiss parent
company, MCH Group. Both the 2020 and 2021 editions of the Baselworld
watch fair --- traditionally the organizer's biggest moneymaking event
--- were canceled last month.

``To lose both these events is a significant blow to MCH and its
shareholders,'' said Todd Levin, an art adviser based in New York who is
a regular visitor to Art Basel. ``Is it a blow for the art world?
Obviously, it's a disappointment, but most people were expecting it,''
Mr. Levin added. ``It's an art fair where you go to buy stuff. If you
don't go one year, you go another.''

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/06/arts/design/art-basel-cancels-hong-kong-fair.html}{Art
Basel Hong Kong}, scheduled for March 17 through March 21, was scratched
in February because of the pandemic and converted into an online fair.

On April 27, Art Basel wrote to concerned exhibitors saying that if the
Swiss fair were canceled it would refund pre-paid fees. The organizers
also said that 25 percent of booth fees retained after the cancellation
of the Hong Kong fair could be rolled over into the fees for subsequent
Art Basel fairs.

However, Claes Nordenhake, an Art Basel participant based in Berlin and
Stockholm, and other dealers coordinated a letter of response from
participating galleries, sent on May 30, that urged the organizers to
reconsider holding the fair. ``Art Basel is the most important and
powerful art fair in the world but even in the best possible scenario,
an edition held this year would be a mere shadow of its established
stature and imperil its reputation,'' the letter said. Signed by more
than 50 dealers, it concluded: ``We believe that risks are simply too
great and that regrettably 2020 is a lost year.''

``I really understand it was a difficult decision,'' Mr. Nordenhake
said, adding, ``I'm very relieved. It would have been a major threat to
our health and our finances. If you look at the demographic of the
collectors at Art Basel, many of them are over 60. There would have been
very few of them at the fair.''

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/13/arts/art-basel-collectors.html}{2019
edition of Art Basel}, held last June, attracted 93,000 visitors.

As was the case with Art Basel Hong Kong, collectors will now be able
view the fair online. A virtual version of the fair will go live from
June 19 to June 26, with preview days from June 17 to June 19.
