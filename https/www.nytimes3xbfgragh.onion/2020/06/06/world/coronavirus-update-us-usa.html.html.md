## China denies that it concealed the early spread of the virus.

The Chinese government on Sunday strongly defended its handling of the
coronavirus, pushing back at criticism that officials had suppressed
early reports of the outbreak and contending instead that China had set
a strong example for how to combat it.

A top Chinese official said at a news conference in Beijing that the
government and state news media had provided early, timely and extensive
information since the first cases appeared in Hubei Province late last
year. In an apparent reference to the Trump administration’s [numerous
assertions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/health/virus-who.html)
that China is to blame for the subsequent pandemic, he complained
bitterly about what he described as foreign lies and slanders.

“Those are completely unwarranted and unreasonable,” said the official,
Xu Lin, who oversees the State Council Information Office. On Sunday the
agency published a detailed
[report](http://english.scio.gov.cn/whitepapers/2020-06/07/content_76135269.htm)
on China’s epidemic response.

Ma Xiaowei, the minister in charge of the National Health Commission,
also said that China had “not delayed in any way” the release of
information about the disease.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The report is an attempt by the Chinese government to provide a
comprehensive narrative for the epidemic, ignoring any early missteps.
It describes local and provincial officials as having faithfully
implemented the instructions of the central government, without
mentioning that some of these officials were hurriedly replaced after
initial problems.

Critics have pointed out that while Chinese scientists moved quickly to
identify the new virus and share their findings internationally,
political leaders were slower to act, ordering police investigations of
doctors who [tried to sound the
alarm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
in late December.

As the U.S. and other countries struggle to bring their outbreaks under
control, China has largely returned to normal life, with its last
remaining high-risk area, a district in the northeastern city of Jilin,
lowering its epidemic response level on Sunday. The government reported
six new cases across the country on Sunday, including five that
originated abroad and one that was transmitted locally in the southern
island province of Hainan. Since the outbreak began, the Chinese
mainland has recorded more than 89,000 cases and more than 4,600
deaths.

With states beginning to allow varying degrees of economic reopening,
large protests against police brutality being held in dozens of cities
and warmer weather inviting people outside, forecasters tracking the
Covid-19 pandemic in the United States are approaching a difficult
juncture.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the portrait of the country over all has improved significantly in
recent weeks, epidemiologists have cautioned that different states are
likely to experience very different challenges now in measuring and
controlling the virus’s spread.

According to
[data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
compiled by The New York Times, more than a third of states are still
seeing new infections increasing. But as many of them move ahead with
reopening plans, their outcomes may depend on factors like how stressed
their health care systems have been and how far they are along the
curve.

In some relatively large states such as North Carolina and Arizona,
increased testing suggests that infections are still climbing quickly
and may spike further as more people venture out.

In another group are states that have achieved modest declines in new
cases, but where the sheer number of people already infected remains the
main source of concern. Even as states such as Maryland or Connecticut
have seen small declines in new infections, both still have alarmingly
high counts per capita, which have taxed health care systems for weeks.

The fear for states in the second category is that with scores of people
already infected, recent declines could be quickly erased through
increased social contact in the months ahead, threatening health care
systems
anew.

When the coronavirus arrived in Japan, people did what they normally do:
They put on masks.

Face coverings are nothing new there. During flu and hay fever seasons,
trains are crowded with commuters half-hidden behind white surgical
masks. Employees with colds, worried about the stigma of missing work,
throw one on and soldier into the
office.

[Japan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries)
has reported more than 17,000 infections and just over 900 deaths, while
the United States, with a population roughly two and a half times as
large, has [topped 1.9 million cases and is approaching 110,000
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).

“Japan, I think a lot of people agree, kind of did everything wrong,
with poor social distancing, karaoke bars still open and public transit
packed near the zone where the worst outbreaks were happening,” Jeremy
Howard, a researcher at the University of San Francisco who has studied
[the use of masks](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v2),
said of the country’s early response. “But the one thing that Japan did
right was masks.”

During the pandemic, scientists have found a correlation between high
levels of mask-wearing — whether as a matter of culture or policy — and
success in containing the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“I think there is definitely evidence coming out of Covid that Japan, as

better in flattening the curve,” said [Akiko

of immunobiology at Yale.

[Brazil’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/world/americas/bolsonaro-coup-coronavirus-brazil.html)
government on Friday removed comprehensive numbers on [coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/world/americas/bolsonaro-coup-coronavirus-brazil.html)
and deaths from the Health Ministry’s website, claiming without offering
evidence that state officials had been reporting inflated figures to
secure more federal funding.

Carlos Wizard, a businessman recently appointed by President Jair
Bolsonaro to a top job in the ministry, told the newspaper O Globo on
Friday that the government suspects state officials have been including
deaths from other causes in the coronavirus tallies they report to the
federal government.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Local officials, driven purely by a desire to get more funding for
their cities, labeled everyone as Covid,” Wizard said. “We’re reviewing
those deaths.”

The accusation outraged public health experts. Several noted that Brazil
has a sophisticated health surveillance system and that there is a broad
consensus among epidemiologists that a lack of testing worldwide has
resulted in a gross undercount of deaths from Covid-19, the disease
caused by the coronavirus. And an [analysis by The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html)
found that coronavirus deaths in five Brazilian cities appeared to be
vastly underreported.

Mr. Bolsonaro has come under withering criticism at home and abroad for
his cavalier handling of the pandemic. He has sabotaged quarantine

Organization](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/americas/bolsonaro-threatens-who-exit-as-coronavirus-kills-a-brazilian-per-minute-1.8900578),
which has urged countries with increasing outbreaks to adopt social
distancing guidelines.

As of Saturday, Brazil had more than 669,000 confirmed cases, second
only to the United States, and more than 35,000 deaths. In recent days,
Brazil has led the world in the number of new deaths reported each day.

The National Council of Health Secretaries, which represents municipal
health officials, called Mr. Wizard’s accusation outrageous.

“This authoritarian, insensitive, inhumane and unethical attempt to
erase people who have died from Covid-19 will fail,” the council said.
“We are not mercenaries of death.”

As the country’s caseload exploded in recent weeks, Mr. Bolsonaro fired
his health minister and replaced him with a doctor who lasted less than
a month on the job.

From London to Sydney, crowds of people around the world defied public
health warnings and turned out in solidarity with U.S. [protesters

justice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/06/us/george-floyd-protests.html)
in the death of an African-American man, George Floyd, killed in policy

especially among people not wearing masks.

In Australia, huge crowds turned out in Sydney, Melbourne and many other
communities in support of the Black Lives Matter movement calling for an
end to systemic racism and Aboriginal deaths in police custody.

The health minister in Britain urged residents not to gather for
demonstrations in London, Manchester and Birmingham. But large crowds
appeared — despite the cold weather, the rain and warnings by the police
that mass gatherings would violate the rule that only six people from
different households could gather outside during the pandemic.

Police in [Northern Ireland announced on
Saturday](https://www.psni.police.uk/news/Latest-News/060620-planned-protests-in-belfast-and-derrylondonderry-have-ended/)
that organizers of “Black Lives Matter” protests in Belfast and Derry

“We estimate there were less than 500 people in attendance at each event
and a significant number of Community Resolution Notices (CRNS) and
fines were issued,” said Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd, who added
that “Health Protection Regulations are in place to protect us all
during this pandemic and it is everyone’s responsibility to adhere to
them to protect our society.”

In Paris, [on a day the Palace of Versailles

visitors and tourists, the authorities barred people from gathering in
front of the United States Embassy, but thousands protested there anyway
in the late afternoon, as well as near the Eiffel Tower, echoing a
protest earlier this week that drew nearly 20,000 people in memory of
Adama Traoré, a Frenchman who died in police custody in 2016. On Friday,
[police officially banned protests on the Champ-de-Mars for

And in the German cities of Berlin and Cologne, thousands responded to
social media calls to take to the streets to honor Mr. Floyd. The
protests came after a week of demonstrations in cities like Hamburg and
Frankfurt.

Fury against racism and police brutality has also brought crowds into
the streets of Belgium, Canada, Sweden and Zimbabwe. In other parts of
the world:

with job losses or business closures? They are everywhere.

Theresa Thompson has been furloughed from her position as a catering and

None of them knows anyone local who has been sickened by the virus.

In corners of the United States facing financial ruin, but where the
coronavirus hasn’t arrived in full, [a New York Times
analysis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/06/06/business/economy/high-unemployment-few-coronavirus-cases.html)
of economic and infection data helps explain why some see reopening as
long overdue. The sharp disconnect between extreme economic pain and
limited health impact presents local officials and businesses with
difficult choices, even after [Friday’s encouraging jobs
report](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/business/economy/jobs-report.html)
suggested more of the country was returning to work.

“In the first two weeks when they said this was coming, I was like,
‘Let’s all stay in, hunker down, and if we all do this, that can
help while we figure out what is going on,’” said Stephanie Anderson, a
real estate agent in Satellite Beach, Fla.

But since “places here aren’t producing mass death,” she said, “don’t
tell me I can’t open my business in a responsible manner.”

Some business owners and workers in these communities have embraced
reopening because of their firsthand experiences. Many are angry or
confused. Others plead for caution. But most agree the virus has not
posed the local public health threat that so many were expecting — even
while acknowledging that [things could get
worse](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-reopening-50-states.html)
and the numbers would most likely already be higher with more testing.

The weekend ahead of New York City’s start of gradual reopening, Gov.
Andrew M. Cuomo reported 35 new coronavirus deaths statewide, a drop of
seven from the day before and the lowest daily total in the last two
months.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is really, really good news compared to where we were,” Mr. Cuomo
said Saturday during his daily briefing in Albany. “This is a big sigh
of relief.”

Under Phase 1 of reopening, set to begin Monday, retail stores will be
allowed to open for curbside or in-store pickup, and nonessential
construction and manufacturing can resume, returning as many as 400,000
people to the work force.

“You want to talk about a turnaround — this one, my friends, is going to
go in the history books,” Mr. Cuomo said. “There is no state in the
United States that has gone from where we were to where we are.”

Mr. Cuomo also announced he was expanding the occupancy guidelines for
houses of worship, which could now admit up to 25 percent of the
building’s occupancy. It is unclear if the measure applies statewide or
only in locations that have reached Phase 2. All regions of the state
except New York City [are in the first or second phase of
reopening](https://forward.ny.gov/).

Across the Hudson River, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced
60 new virus-related deaths Saturday via [social
media](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1269316516962545666?s=20),
bringing the state’s toll to 12,106. The figure was a drop from the 79
new deaths reported the previous day. He also reported 606 new confirmed
positive cases, totaling 163,893 cases in the state.

While New York City’s shutdown has successfully flattened the number of
infections, [a study has
found](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/06/business/economy/coronavirus-closings-strategy.html)
that the economic cost could have been reduced by a third or more by
strategically choosing neighborhoods to close, calibrating the risk of
infection for local residents and workers with the impact on local
jobs.

For the first time in three months there is a scent of economic optimism
in the air. Employers added millions of jobs to their payrolls in May,
and the jobless rate fell, a big surprise to forecasters who expected
further losses. Businesses are reopening, and the rate of coronavirus
deaths has edged down. The Trump administration has begun pointing to
what are likely to be impressive growth numbers as the economy starts to
pull out of its deep hole.

All of that is good news. But there are clear signs that the collapse of
economic activity has set in motion problems that will play out over
many months, or maybe many years. If not contained, they could cause
human misery on a mass scale and create lasting scars for families.

The fabric of the economy has been ripped, with damage done to millions
of interconnections — between workers and employers, companies and their
suppliers, borrowers and lenders. Both the historical evidence from
severe economic crises and the data available today point to enormous
delayed effects.

While the government can’t wave a wand and bring back industries that
are semi-permanently shuttered, it can act — and has acted — to try to
keep demand for goods and services at pre-crisis levels. That, in turn,
can smooth the path for other sectors to grow so that there is not a
prolonged depression of jobs, income and investment, with a resulting
reduction in the economy’s long-term
potential.

How the coronavirus might affect pregnant women and newborns has been a
major concern since the outbreaks began. A [new report in the medical
journal

has both reassuring and worrisome findings, with caveats that there is
limited data and still much unknown.

So far, compared to the general population, pregnant women do not seem
to have an increased risk of severe illness if they contract the virus,
the report said. Of 147 pregnant women with Covid-19 in China, 8 percent
had severe disease and 1 percent had critical illness — rates that were
actually lower than those in the rest of the population, where 14
percent had severe disease and 6 percent were critically ill. In New
York City, a report on 43 pregnant women with Covid-19 found that their
rates of severe disease were similar to those in other
adults.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your

But whether the infection can cause birth defects, miscarriage,
premature birth or stillbirth is not yet known. Newborns have become
infected, but it’s not clear whether they contracted the virus before,
during or after birth, or if breastfeeding can transmit the virus.

Even so, the report says that for women who are wondering whether this
is a safe time to conceive, “based on limited data, there does not seem
to be a compelling reason to recommend delaying
pregnancy.”

For years, Gildo Negri visited schools to share his stories about
blowing up bridges and cutting electrical wires to sabotage Nazis and
fascists during World War II. In January, the 89-year-old made another
visit, leaving his nursing home outside Milan to help students plant
trees in honor of Italians deported to concentration camps.

But at the end of February, as Europe’s first outbreak of the

him, too.

The virus, which is so lethal to the old, has hastened the departure of
these last witnesses and forced the cancellation of commemorations. It
has also created an opportunity for rising political forces who seek to
recast the history of the last century in order to play a greater role
in remaking the present one.

Throughout Europe, radical right-wing parties with histories of
Holocaust denial, Mussolini infatuation and fascist motifs have gained
traction in recent

Much of the attention to the toll Covid-19 has taken on older adults has
rightly focused on long-term care facilities. Their residents and
employees account for almost 40 percent of the nation’s deaths,
according to an updated [New York Times
analysis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/09/us/coronavirus-cases-nursing-homes-us.html).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

But far more Americans — nearly six million, [by one
estimate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052697/) — rely
on paid home care than live-in nursing homes and assisted living
combined. And both workers and clients have cause for worry.

Even more than nursing home employees, home care workers are poorly paid
hourly workers and often lack health insurance; half rely on some form
of public assistance. Not only do many home care workers serve several
clients each week, but to piece together a living they may
simultaneously work for several agencies or for nursing homes, or hold
outside jobs.

Those conditions increase infection risks, and not only for their frail
older clients. Almost a third of home care workers, a heavily female
work force, are themselves over 55, and most are black or Hispanic,
groups that have proved particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.

Personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., has proved hard to acquire,
however. With hospitals and nursing homes scrambling for supplies, “this
was the forgotten sector,” said Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician at the
University of Toronto.

“Home care workers are probably unknowingly involved in the transmission
of Covid-19, especially when they’re not equipped with sufficient
P.P.E.,” he
added.

When the country was under lockdown, at least the rules were mostly
clear. Essential workers ventured out; everyone else sheltered in.

Now states are lifting restrictions, but detailed guidance about
navigating the minutiae of everyday life is still hard to come by — and
anyway, there’s never going to be a ready solution to every problematic
circumstance you may encounter.

As you tiptoe toward normalization — whatever that is, given these times
— try to follow three precautions: avoid contact, confinement and
crowds. And make realistic choices.

### Contact

You need to continue with social distancing precautions. That means
wearing masks, washing hands well and often, and keeping a six-foot
distance from one another. No hugs, no handshakes.

Any 15-minute face-to-face conversation between people who are within
six feet of one another constitutes close contact, said Dr. Muge Cevik,
an expert on infectious diseases and virology at University of Saint
Andrews School of Medicine in Scotland.

### Confinement

Indoor activities in confined enclosed spaces, even large ones, are more
conducive to spreading the virus than events held outside, especially if
the air inside the building is being recirculated or the windows don’t
open.

### Crowds

Large groups are risky, even outdoors. They mean more people, more
contacts — and more potential sources of infection.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### Choices

People at [high risk for developing severe disease if they become
infected with the
coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html)
— including those 65 and over, residents of nursing homes and long-term
care facilities, people with compromised immune systems, chronic lung or
kidney disease, heart conditions or severe obesity — will want to take
the greatest of precautions.

But young healthy adults and children should also consider the
protection of people around them, including family members, colleagues
or friends who are vulnerable, said Dr. Barbara Taylor, an infectious
disease specialist at The University of Texas Health Science Center at
San
Antonio.

President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil has enabled increased razing of the
Amazon rainforest. The coronavirus has accelerated that destruction.

Illegal loggers, miners and land grabbers have cleared vast areas of the
Amazon with impunity in recent months as law enforcement efforts were
hobbled by the pandemic.

The fallout from the pandemic has exacerbated the [ecological

Bolsonaro](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/19/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-amazon-indigenous.html),

Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, a government agency

Already last year, deforestation in the Amazon had reached levels not

As Covid-19 cases took off in New York in March, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo
imposed a lockdown of nonessential businesses to slow the spread of the
coronavirus, calling it “[the most drastic action we can
take](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/ny-ca-stay-home-order.html).”

Now researchers say more targeted approaches — in New York and elsewhere
— might have protected public health with less economic pain.

Businesses in New York City, where an initial phase of reopening is set
to begin Monday, have been mostly shut down for 11 weeks. But a study
has found that the economic cost could have been reduced by a third or
more by strategically choosing neighborhoods to close, calibrating the
risk of infection for local residents and workers with the impact on
local
jobs.

As part of Britain’s effort to contain the spread of the virus, the
government required local councils in England and Wales to provide
emergency accommodation in budget hotels to every homeless person living
on the streets.

Since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown, more than 90 percent of
people sleeping on the street have been offered a place to stay,
[according to government
statistics.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/6-000-new-supported-homes-as-part-of-landmark-commitment-to-end-rough-sleeping)

Homeless charities say the initial success of the program has proved
what they have long maintained: that an injection of funding and support
from the government can quickly and effectively bring people off the
streets.

“It was an amazing effort, and it shows what you can do when you have
the political will and a willingness to spend the money,” said Dominic
Williamson, the executive director of strategy and policy for the
British homeless charity [St.
