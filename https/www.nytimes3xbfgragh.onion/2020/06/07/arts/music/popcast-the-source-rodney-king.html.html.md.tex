The Source, which was founded in the late 1980s and billed itself as
``The Magazine of Hip-Hop Music, Culture \& Politics,'' was still in its
infancy when the police officers who were filmed beating Rodney King
after a 1991 traffic stop were not convicted at trial.

James Bernard, then a senior editor at the magazine, got on a plane the
following morning and spent the subsequent days and nights reporting on
the uprisings, focusing on interviewing locals and emerging with an
article very different from much of the mainstream press coverage of the
events.

On this week's Popcast, a conversation about how The Source wrote about
the Los Angeles uprisings as part of its efforts to cover everything
under hip-hop's umbrella, and the moral and journalistic
responsibilities of entertainment-focused media to address the political
issues brought up by the art it seeks to cover.

Guests:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  James Bernard, former senior editor of The Source
\item
  Reginald Dennis, former music editor of The Source
\end{itemize}
