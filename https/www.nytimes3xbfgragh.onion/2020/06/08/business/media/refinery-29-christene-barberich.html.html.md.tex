\section{Refinery29 Editor Resigns After Former Employees Describe
`Toxic
Culture'}\label{refinery29-editor-resigns-after-former-employees-describe-toxic-culture}}

The editor, Christene Barberich, said she had decided to leave after
reading accounts by black women and other women of color who said they
had faced discrimination at the company.

The women's lifestyle publication
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/02/business/vice-media-refinery29.html}{Refinery29}
is the latest media organization to undergo a change in leadership
during the cultural reckoning that has accompanied the widespread
protests against racism and police violence.

Christene Barberich, the top editor and a co-founder of the 15-year-old
site, said on Monday that she would step down after a number of former
Refinery29 employees came forward on social media in recent days to
describe discrimination they experienced while working at the company.

``I've read and taken in the raw and personal accounts of Black women
and women of color regarding their experiences inside our company at
Refinery29,'' Ms. Barberich wrote in a
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CBLToSInUcb/}{post} on Instagram.
``And, what's clear from these experiences, is that R29 has to change.
We have to do better, and that starts with making room. And, so I will
be stepping aside in my role at R29 to help diversify our leadership in
editorial and ensure this brand and the people it touches can spark a
new defining chapter.''

Ms. Barberich, 51, will step down from her job immediately but will stay
on as an adviser until the fall, according to two people with knowledge
of the matter. Ms. Barberich did not reply to a request for comment.

The writer Ashley C. Ford was one of the former employees who described
her experience
\href{https://twitter.com/iSmashFizzle/status/1268334753608065026}{on
Twitter}. ``I worked at Refinery29 for less than nine months due to a
toxic company culture where white women's egos ruled the near
nonexistent editorial processes,'' she wrote. ``One of the founders
consistently confused myself and one our full-time front desk associates
\& pay disparity was atrocious.''

A former Refinery29 senior editor, Ashley Alese Edwards, who now works
at Google,
\href{https://twitter.com/AshleyAlese/status/1269769432513077250?s=20}{wrote
on Twitter} that the concerns she raised were routinely ignored and that
her job title did not reflect her experience or duties at the company.

``I'm happy to see this,'' Ms. Edwards said after Ms. Barberich's
departure. ``It's a step in the right direction. I hope this sparks
conversation and change in other newsrooms as well, because this is not
an issue unique to just Refinery29.''

There has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/07/business/media/new-york-times-washington-post-protests.html}{a
reckoning} at media organizations as hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators in the United States and abroad have joined the protests
prompted by the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died last month
in Minneapolis after a white police officer handcuffed him and pinned
him to the ground with his knee.

The editorial page editor of The New York Times, James Bennet,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/07/business/media/james-bennet-resigns-nytimes-op-ed.html}{resigned
on Sunday} after Times staff members and readers objected to the
publication of an essay by a United States senator calling for the
military to quell protests in American cities.

The top editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, Stan Wischnowski,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/06/business/media/editor-philadephia-inquirer-resigns.html}{resigned
on Saturday} after dozens of staff members walked out in response to an
Inquirer article with the headline ``Buildings Matter, Too,'' a
reference to the slogan ``Black Lives Matter,'' a rallying cry for civil
rights activists.

Vice Media acquired Refinery29 and its ancillary businesses in October
in a deal valued at about \$400 million. Vice Media's chief executive,
Nancy Dubuc, said in an email Monday to the staffs of Vice and
Refinery29 that the company would overhaul its hiring and retention
practices to ``ensure equal opportunity and an inclusive culture.''

Ms. Dubuc added that Ms. Barberich's move was ``an acceleration of a
conversation Christene and I have been having since Vice's acquisition
of R29 and she asked that we make the change immediately over the past
few days.''

The Refinery29 Union, part of the Writers Guild of America, East, said
in a statement that it supported the departure of Ms. Barberich. ``Our
list of demands is long,'' it added, ``and we're working with management
to also address the systemic issues that hinder and hurt our past and
present employees.''
