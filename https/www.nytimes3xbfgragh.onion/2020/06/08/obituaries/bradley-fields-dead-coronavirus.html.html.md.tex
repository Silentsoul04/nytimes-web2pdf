\section{Bradley Fields, Magician Who Favored Warmth Over Flash, Dies at
68}\label{bradley-fields-magician-who-favored-warmth-over-flash-dies-at-68}}

Mr. Fields was an actor, mime, illusionist and educator who equated
magic with pure wonder, not trickery. He died of the coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

When Bradley Feldstein was 13 or 14 and practicing simple magic tricks
at school in Queens, his mother ran an answering service. One of her
customers was
\href{https://www.magicana.com/news/blog/jack-adams-aka-merlin}{Jack
Adams}, a magician. ``You must meet my son,'' Rosalind Feldstein told
her client, and soon Bradley became the magician's assistant, working
for five dollars a show. His future was set.

Bradley Fields, as he called himself, spent the next 55 years honing a
career as an illusionist, actor and educator, often using magic to teach
math to children.

In April, at home in Washington, he developed a sore throat. ``I hope
it's just a cold,'' he texted his longtime girlfriend, Stephanie
Chaikin, in New York. He died of Covid-19 at MedStar Washington Hospital
Center on May 5, Ms. Chaikin said. He was 68.

Mr. Fields was born in Spring Valley, N.Y., on July 24, 1951, the oldest
of three children. His father, Robert, was a registered nurse, singer,
and actor; his mother became a psychologist.

After apprenticing with Mr. Adams, Mr. Fields earned a B.A. in
philosophy in 1973 at what was then the State University of New York at
Purchase, then studied acting and directing at the
\href{https://stellaadler.com/}{Stella Adler Studio}in New York and mime
in Paris with
\href{https://mimecorporel.com/etienne-decroux-and-corporeal-mime/}{Etienne
Decroux}.

He called his early act the Magic Theater and Illusion Show. Ms. Chaikin
said that onstage, Mr. Fields was ``an antique guy in a modern world,''
appearing in a derby and vest and performing illusions from the
vaudeville era: classic tricks with steel rings or handkerchief,
dividing an assistant into thirds.

He got his start in the folk clubs of Greenwich Village, opening for
musicians like Dion or
\href{https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tim-hardin-songwriter-dylan-once-called-the-greatest-set-for-revival-117002/}{Tim
Hardin}, then graduated to headlining around the country and abroad.
Like Mr. Adams, he emphasized stories and an emotional connection with
the audience over flashy spectacle. ``He was never a fan of that type of
magic,'' his son Noah said. Often he played to young audiences in the
daytime and adults in the evening.

After Noah and his brother, Jonathan, were born, Mr. Fields spent a year
teaching elementary school in Manhattan's Chinatown, which inspired him
to create \href{http://www.mathemagic.com/site/}{MatheMagic}, a show for
children that he performed up to 200 times a year.

``He chose to do these children's shows rather than go to Vegas, where
he could have made more money'' said William Stixrud, a friend from
\href{https://www.ostns.org/}{Ohev Sholom - the National Synagogue}, in
Washington, who shared Mr. Fields's interests in
\href{https://www.tm.org/}{Transcendental Meditation},
\href{https://bikramyoganyc.com/bikram/}{Bikram yoga}, singing and
playing guitar.

Along with his sons and Ms. Chaikin, Mr. Fields is survived by his
brother, Jeffrey Feldstein, and sister, Nancy Lloyd.

In an
\href{https://vaudevisuals.com/category/tribute-to-bradley-fields-magician-director-and-mime/}{interview}with
Jim R. Moore for the website Vaudevisuals.com, Mr. Fields talked about
the relationship between theater and magic, saying that magic was not
about fooling people, but rather about immersing them in wonder.

``Regular theater is about the real world,'' he said. ``Magic has the
extra added dimension of what's beyond this world, what you can
imagine.''
