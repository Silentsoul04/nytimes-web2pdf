Crowds will gather again in New Zealand’s restaurants. Weddings will
include as many hugs and guests as the happy couple wants — and even
social distancing will not be needed.

New Zealand has no active coronavirus cases and no new cases, officials
said on Monday, declaring that life could return to a form of
pre-pandemic normal. Since the pandemic began, the country has reported
1,504 cases and 22 deaths nationally, and has been widely praised for
its stringent approach to combating the virus.

“While the job is not done, there is no denying this is a milestone,”
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, adding: “Thank you, New Zealand.”

The country of five million people is one of only a few nations that
appear to have eradicated the virus, at least for now. [Iceland is
another](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/how-iceland-beat-the-coronavirus).

Ms. Ardern, who led an approach she described as “go hard, go early” —
with [a severe lockdown that began in late
March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/world/asia/jacinda-ardern-coronavirus-new-zealand.html)
— said the country could now focus on economic recovery and bolstering
local businesses. She also noted that she “did a little dance” when she
heard the news that the virus had been eliminated in the country.

The country had already begun to ease some initial measures first put in
place on March 25 when it shut most businesses, closed schools and
required residents to stay at home. At the time, the country outlined a
four-stage plan to move toward some semblance of normalcy.

Those restrictions were walked back over the past five weeks, moving to
Level 3 in April, and then Level 2 in mid-May. The move to Level 1 had
been planned for June 22, but was brought forward when no new cases were
reported. The restrictions lifted at midnight Monday.

Many have applauded the announcement, including Helen Clarke, a former
prime minister of New Zealand, [who posted on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/HelenClarkNZ/status/1269912138090336258):
“Clear leadership & an engaged public have produced this result.
Principles of inclusion, resilience & sustainability should now guide
recovery in NZ & globally.”

The return to freedom of movement, however, is not quite complete. With
the pandemic continuing to rage elsewhere, the country’s borders are
still closed. [Plans for a “travel
bubble”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/world/australia/coronavirus-travel-bubble.html)
with
[Australia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/world/australia/melbourne-coronavirus-outbreak.html)
are in the works, but moving slowly.

Ms. Ardern also announced that QR codes would be appearing wherever
people gather. She asked businesses to remind people to scan the codes
into the government’s contact tracing app to make any future outbreak
easier to track and isolate.

“This is a key new habit we’re asking all New Zealanders to adopt,” she
said.

Ms. Ardern has been praised internationally for her approach to New
Zealand’s outbreak, [which was among the most stringent in the
world](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/world/asia/jacinda-ardern-coronavirus-new-zealand.html).
Her live video updates on Facebook, streamed from her own home, offered
a relatable understanding of the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on
the lives of New Zealanders, but a firm resolve to eradicate the disease
from the
country.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Her approach focused on framing the effort of the nation as one of
cooperation, often referring to her fellow New Zealanders as a “team of
five million” tasked with keeping each other healthy.

But despite her clear elation about reaching the goal of no active
cases, she urged vigilance as the country moved ahead.

“The virus will be in our world for some time to come,” she said on
Monday. “We are confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus
for now, but elimination is not a point in time; it is a sustained
effort.”

Covid-19 was released 12 days ago.

“This is really good news for the person concerned, and it’s also
something the rest of New Zealand can take heart from,” Dr. Ashley
Bloomfield, the director general of health, [said in a
statement](https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/no-active-cases-covid-19).

While Dr. Bloomfield called the moment a “significant mark in our
journey,” he warned that the “ongoing vigilance” against the virus would
be essential going forward.
