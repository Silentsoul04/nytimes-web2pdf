Samira Nasr, a former Vanity Fair fashion director, is leaving Condé
Nast to take a key job at Hearst Magazines.

Hearst Magazines named Samira Nasr as the next editor of the U.S.
edition of Harper's Bazaar on Tuesday, the first time that a woman of
color will hold the top job at the 153-year-old fashion publication.

Ms. Nasr, who will start on July 6, previously worked as the fashion
director of the Condé Nast magazine Vanity Fair, where she oversaw the
magazine's presentation of celebrities including Renée Zellweger,
Jennifer Lopez and Eddie Murphy for the annual Hollywood issue.

In a video message on the
\href{https://www.instagram.com/harpersbazaarus/?hl=en}{@Harpersbazaarus
Instagram account}, Ms. Nasr spoke of running an inclusive publication
and expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

``As the proud daughter of a Lebanese father and Trinidadian mother, my
worldview is expansive and is anchored in the belief that representation
matters,'' she said. ``My lens by nature is colorful and so it is
important to me to begin a new chapter in Bazaar's history by shining a
light on all individuals who I believe are the inspiring voices of our
time.

``I will work to give all voices a platform to tell stories that would
never have been told,'' she added.

Ms. Nasr also offered a message to those taking part in the worldwide
protests prompted by the killing last month of George Floyd, a black man
who died after being pinned to the ground by a white police officer in
Minneapolis.

``I see you, I thank you, and I hope we can join forces to amplify the
message of equality, because Black Lives Matter,'' she said.

Ms. Nasr succeeds
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/17/style/harpers-bazaar-glenda-bailey.html}{Glenda
Bailey}, the anti-elitist editor who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/style/glenda-bailey-harpers-bazaar.html}{stepped
down in February} after nearly two decades. Ms. Bailey was credited with
making the glossy --- defined by its boundary-pushing photography in the
1950s and '60s --- into something more accessible to readers in the age
of the Instagram influencer, when fashion magazines have lost some of
their old power to declare what is in and what is out.

Ms. Nasr's appointment followed a number of editorial changes in the top
ranks of Hearst Magazines under
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/business/media/hearst-harassment-troy-young.html}{Troy
Young}, who became the company's president in 2018 after leading its
digital division.

``Samira's important voice will continue to evolve the brand's distinct
position as a style touchstone for fashion's most discerning,'' Mr.
Young said in a statement.

Before her time at Vanity Fair, Ms. Nasr oversaw fashion at Elle, a
Hearst publication, and InStyle. She also worked on campaigns for
fashion, luxury and beauty brands including Tory Burch, Laura Mercier
and Tiffany \& Company.

The New York Post earlier reported Ms. Nasr's appointment, which comes
at a moment of upheaval in the media industry. Journalists, frustrated
by some of the coverage of the protests after Mr. Floyd's killing, have
been emboldened to question issues of systemic racism and bias in their
own institutions. The executive editor of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/06/business/media/editor-philadephia-inquirer-resigns.html}{The
Philadelphia Inquirer} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/07/business/media/james-bennet-resigns-nytimes-op-ed.html}{the
editor of The New York Times's opinion section} resigned in recent days
after staff protests.

Condé Nast lost Ms. Nasr to one of its main rivals one day after
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/dining/bon-appetit-adam-rapoport.html}{Adam
Rapoport}, the longtime top editor of the Condé Nast food magazine Bon
Appétit, resigned under pressure because of a photograph that appeared
online showing him dressed in a costume derogatory to Puerto Ricans.

On the same day,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/business/media/refinery-29-christene-barberich.html}{Christene
Barberich}, the top editor of the women's lifestyle site Refinery29,
stepped down after former employees posted descriptions on social media
of a workplace culture that discriminated against black women and other
women of color.

A spokeswoman for Harper's Bazaar said Ms. Nasr was not available for
interviews. In her Instagram video, she described her approach to
fashion. ``Great style is about more than the way we wear our clothes,''
she said. ``It is also how we see and occupy space in the world around
us.''
