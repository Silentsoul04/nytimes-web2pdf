# Trump Administration Revives Banned Hunting Techniques in Alaska

</div>

The move reverses an Obama-era ban on hunting methods like baiting bears
with doughnuts and shooting swimming caribou.

WASHINGTON — Baiting grizzly bears with doughnuts soaked in bacon
grease. Using spotlights to blind and shoot hibernating black bear
mothers and their cubs in their dens. Gunning down swimming caribou from
motorboats.

Hunting methods that for years were decried by wildlife protectors and
finally banned as barbaric by the Obama administration will be legal
again on millions of acres of Alaskan wilderness in time for the warm
July weather.

The National Park Service policy [published the new
rules](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/09/2020-10877/alaska-hunting-and-trapping-in-national-preserves)
in the Federal Register on Tuesday, reversing Obama administration rules
and giving trophy hunters, outfitters and Alaskans 30 days to prepare to
return to national preserves in Alaska with the revived practices. Among
the reinstated tactics: killing wolves and coyotes, including pups,
during the season when mothers wean their young, and using dogs to hunt
bears.

Expanding hunting rights on federal lands has been a priority under the
Trump administration, and an issue championed by the president’s son,
Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter. In February the Safari Club
International, which promotes big-game hunting, auctioned a weeklong
“[dream

through Alaska with the president’s son as part of its annual
convention.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hunting advocates and Alaska state leaders had opposed the Obama-era
restrictions as an encroachment on states’ rights and an infringement on
their livelihoods. Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, a Republican, accused
the previous administration of leading an “attack on our unique game
management authority” protected under state and federal
law.

Eddie Grasser, director of wildlife conservation for Alaska Department
of Fish and Game, said the tactics would be used sparingly, and mainly
by subsistence hunters.

“Most of our towns and villages are not real connected,” he said. “You
have to fly in and fly out. Living off the land is a critical component
of rural Alaska lifestyle, so those methods that people are upset about,
and I understand why and I understand the misconception, the fact is
those are primarily methods that are used by subsistence users in the
state of Alaska.”

“The regular hunters in the state don’t hunt that way and neither do the
residents that are coming in especially ones that are guided,” he said.

Animal rights and wildlife protection groups condemned the rule as
allowing inhumane trophy hunting of wild brown and black bears.

“This would allow extreme cruel killing methods on over 20 million acres
of national preserves in Alaska,” said Laura Smythe, a staff attorney
with the Humane Society of the United States.

The initial dispute stemmed from conflicting approaches over how Alaska
manages predators in the state. The Alaska board of game allows such
baiting tactics to kill bears and wolves in order to ensure enough
moose, caribou and other game are available for hunters. The National
Park Service, however, is charged with protecting wildlife populations
including predators like bears.

In 2015 the Obama administration codified the Park Service’s role by
enacting a rule that eliminated sport hunting and trapping on federal
public lands in Alaska. The new rule says state hunting regulations
should take priority over federal ones.

“This rule acknowledges this longstanding deference to state law
required by statute in removing the hunting and trapping prohibitions
identified in this rule,” the Park Service rule said.

President Trump’s first interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, a former Montana
congressman who displayed a stuffed bear in his Washington office,
signed an order to expand recreational opportunities on public lands,
including hunting and fishing. Park service officials later cited that
order as the reason for overturning the ban.

The rule was opposed by a [bipartisan
group](https://jayapal.house.gov/2018/08/09/jayapal-and-colleagues-urge-zinke-protect-alaskan-wildlife/)
of 79 members of Congress and hundreds of
[scientists](https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/sites/default/files/attachments/8_23_colleague_letter_on_ak_national_preserves.pdf)
who said there was “little scientific evidence” that relaxing hunting
rules for predators and allowing baiting techniques would increase the
availability of other game.

“We have never opposed hunting, but this can hardly be considered
hunting,” said Theresa Pierno, president and chief executive of the
National Parks Conservation Association. “To be going into dens of
hibernating bears and killing cubs and killing moms certainly is, I
don’t think, the picture most people have of hunting.”

The Safari Club, which lobbied in favor of the rule, did not respond to
a request for comment.

In 2017 Mr. Trump condemned trophy hunting as a “horror show.” But in
the years since his administration [reversed Obama-era
restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/07/science/trump-elephant-trophy-hunting.html)
on the import of elephant and lion trophies from some African countries.
