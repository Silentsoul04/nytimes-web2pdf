From around the third century B.C. to the second century A.D., incense
was sufficiently sought after to warrant its own trade route, the
Incense Route, on which frankincense and myrrh were ferried from
Ethiopia, Somalia and southern Arabia and through the Negev Desert to
various Mediterranean and Asian destinations, and has by now spent
millenniums as a fixture of myriad countries and cultures. In ancient
Egypt, it was used to ward off evil forces. Buddhist monks, too, relied
(and still rely) on incense to purify their meditation spaces, while in
Japan, the Koh-Do (incense ceremony) has been popular since courtiers
and samurai took it up in the 16th century. Of course, incense also just
smells nice, its scent hanging in the room even after the physical
material has burned to a tidy pile of ash. But protection and
cleanliness feel like particularly appealing aims right now, as does the
idea of creating a ritual, and thus imposing a modicum of regularity and
intention amid so much
uncertainty.

### **[Nag Champa by Satya Sai Baba](https://www.iherb.com/pr/Sai-Baba-Satya-Nag-Champa-Agarbatti-Incense-Sticks-100-g/37611?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpfLruoXG6QIVTLLICh2AEwCkEAQYAiABEgIdYvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)**

In college, I worked at a feminist bookseller called Sisterhood
Bookstore in Los Angeles. It was opened in 1972 by two former
sisters-in-law, both of whom divorced the brothers. As one can imagine,
the store was small, being that it was filled only with books for and
about women, so when I worked there, I worked alone. But during my
training, I remember Julie, the manager, showing me how to open. After
unlocking the door, she instructed, I would walk into the bathroom and
fire up a stick of [Nag Champa
incense](https://www.iherb.com/pr/Sai-Baba-Satya-Nag-Champa-Agarbatti-Incense-Sticks-100-g/37611?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpfLruoXG6QIVTLLICh2AEwCkEAQYAiABEgIdYvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
($10.85). I’d watch the smoke waft out of the restroom and into the
front of the store. The first hint of sandalwood was followed by the
sweetness of plumeria, and it took a while for the full scent to fill
the space. Incense smells best after it’s finished burning, when it’s a
lingering note that has permeated your clothing, your skin, your hair,
and you can’t quite recall why everything smells the same. But for me,
during those solo eight-hour shifts, it was also a marker of time. Once
I realized the smoke had stopped, I’d light up another one. — MINJU PAK

### **[Ground by Bodha](https://bodha.com/shop/ground-ritual-incense)**

Incense stimulates my senses in a way that makes me feel more grounded
and alert, so it’s fitting that I favor [Bodha’s Ground
variety](https://bodha.com/shop/ground-ritual-incense) ($32). I
discovered it one day in the dead of winter in a small West Village
boutique. As soon as I passed through the door, my nose was struck with
the warming scents of hinoki, cedar wood and frankincense, and I knew I
needed the smell in my home. Another thing I like about these sticks,
which are made in Japan with some of the best organic woods and
essential oils, is that the burn is smokeless. As a result, I feel good
about what I’m inhaling and consider them a sort of antidote to the
pollution that comes with city living and inevitably seeps in from
outdoors. — KRISTINA

### **[Sandalwood by Hayashi Ryushodo and Commune](https://www.communedesign.com/shop/objects/commune-incense-sticks-4405788377146/)**

I’ve collected artisanal incense during travels to many of its
modern-day capitals — from Big Sur to Baja, Mexico, to Tokyo — but [my
current
favorite](https://www.communedesign.com/shop/objects/commune-incense-sticks-4405788377146/)
comes from the Los Angeles-based design firm Commune. Working with the
incense master Keijirou Hayashi, who runs Hayashi Ryushodo, his family’s
186-year-old shop in Kyoto, they packaged more than 100 hand-rolled
incense sticks into a vibey, minimalist white box ($32) that’s taken
pride of place on one of my bookshelves. I love the sandalwood scent,
which is musty and a bit mustardy; it’s one of the purest expressions of
the aromatic wood that I’ve smelled in my lifetime — and the sticks are
a pleasure to burn in late spring, when they make my entire small
apartment smell like an ancestral forest after it’s rained. — KURT
SOLLER

### **[Yakushima by Astier de Villatte](https://www.johnderian.com/products/yakushima-incense)**

Even before [I
visited](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/17/t-magazine/yakushima-japan-hayao-miyazaki-princess-mononoke.html)
the Japanese island of Yakushima for myself, I had already seen it,
thanks to Hayao Miyazaki’s “Princess Mononoke” (1997), whose enchanted
forest is based on the old-growth cedar forest that dominates the isle.
I’d also smelled it — an ancient, green, haunted scent, of millennia-old
cedar trees and moss — thanks to [this
incense](https://www.johnderian.com/products/yakushima-incense) ($50),
which I burn year-round. It makes winters darker and cozier, and in the
summer, it keeps bugs away. I also like to give it to people who’re nice
enough to let me stay at their country houses; you can just put a few
sticks in a jar or glass and take it outside to burn the night away. —

### **[Côte d’Azur by Oribe](https://www.oribe.com/oribestorefront/oribe/en/Shop-All/Body-%26-Fragrance/C%C3%B4te-d%27Azur-Incense/p/400623)**

Long ago, my good friend worked at a store called Sunshine Daydream.
Ever since, the smell of patchouli has reminded me of chatting with her
over the case of handblown glass pipes and then, whenever her boss
appeared, pretending to shop for a tie-dye tapestry. Fond as those
memories are, my preference is for less earthy scents, and I recently
discovered that, two years ago, the hair-care brand Oribe, along with
the help of artisans on the Japanese island of Awaji, reconceived its
signature Côte d’Azur scent [in incense
form](https://www.oribe.com/oribestorefront/oribe/en/Shop-All/Body-%26-Fragrance/C%C3%B4te-d%27Azur-Incense/p/400623)
($65). The blend balances floral notes including Calabrian bergamot,
tuberose and butterfly jasmine with those of sandalwood and amber, and
its smooth scent feels especially perfect for this summer, when I
probably won’t be going to a salon, let alone the French Riviera. — KATE

### **[Frankincense Resin from Mountain Rose Herbs](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/frankincense-resin/profile)**

A couple of years ago, I found myself struggling with daily anxiety that
would pop up right as I got home from work, giving me way too many
sleepless nights. I’m a huge supporter of seeking professional help when
it comes to mental health, but I was also curious about CBD and other
natural alternatives as a starting point. After trying a few products
that didn’t prove all that effective, I happened to read **** an article
about archaeology and stumbled across a paragraph on [how
frankincense](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/frankincense-resin/profile)
(from $9.25) has been used for centuries to combat stress and
depression. Archaeology nerd that I am, I had to try it, and found that
not only did it settle my mental state, but that I also loved the aroma,
which is how I imagine Arrakis, the spice-rich planet of Frank Herbert’s
1965 science fiction novel “Dune,” might smell. I have since learned,
however, that we’re losing [Boswellia sacra
trees](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/05/science/frankincense-trees-collapse.html),
from which frankincense is harvested, at an alarming rate, and am now on
the hunt for an ecologically sustainable source or alternative. — CARTER

### **[Oulan Bator by Astier de Villatte](https://www.johnderian.com/products/oulan-bator-incense)**

I am not a frequent incense burner, but I have never been able to help
myself with Astier de Villatte, in part because their earthenware
incense holders are so beautiful. I prefer to burn [Oulan
Bator](https://www.johnderian.com/products/oulan-bator-incense) ($50) —
which is evocative of leather and ambergris — but I’ve also been
intrigued by another one of their scents, Atelier de Balthus, which nods
to the 20th-century Polish-French artist and promises, with the smell of
turpentine mixed with smoke, honey, tobacco and cedar wood, to transport
you to a beautiful studio with big windows that overlook the meadows. —

FORCE

### **[Sandalwood from the Good Liver](https://good-liver.com/products/incense-sandalwood)**

I don’t quite remember how I first came across [this
incense](https://good-liver.com/products/incense-sandalwood) ($16), but
for the past two years or so, I’ve regularly bought boxes of it online
from the Los Angeles general store the Good Liver. It’s a traditional
Japanese sandalwood incense that smells something like a forest floor
and is made with natural ingredients in the Shiga Prefecture. According
to the store’s website, it is burned “at well regarded temples in Shiga
and Kyoto,” and something about the fact that it has a sacred usage and
is seemingly only available in the States at this one shop makes me feel
like a little princeling whenever I order it (even though it’s
relatively inexpensive). But I intersperse burning it with phases of
using Muji’s Japanese Scents incense, which costs even less and has a
slightly lighter, more powdery scent — plus, the sticks are just a
couple of inches in length, so they never burn long enough to give you a
headache. — ALICE
NEWELL-HANSON

### **[12AM by Cinnamon Projects](https://www.cinnamonprojects.com/product/incense-solo-12am/)**

Because I gravitate toward crisp fragrances, I’ve generally chosen
candles or essential oils for scenting a space — incense always felt
like something better suited to a head shop than my living room.
However, [this warm, woody
blend](https://www.cinnamonprojects.com/product/incense-solo-12am/)
($30) from the New York creative agency Cinnamon Projects has completely
changed my perspective. Made according to traditional methods in Japan
with notes of amber and clove, its scent is cozy but, thanks to
additional notes of lavender and oakmoss, not cloying. Plus, the brand’s
handcrafted bronze and semiprecious stone burners make using it feel
ceremonial in a way that lighting a candle simply does not. — CAITIE
