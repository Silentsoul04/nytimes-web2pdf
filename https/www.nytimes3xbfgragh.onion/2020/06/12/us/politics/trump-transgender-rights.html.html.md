# Trump Administration Erases Transgender Civil Rights Protections in Health Care

</div>

A rule finalized on Friday by the Department of Health and Human
Services means that the federal government no longer recognizes gender
identity as an avenue for sex discrimination in health care.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday finalized [a
regulation](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/1557-final-rule.pdf)
that will erase protections for transgender patients against
discrimination by doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies, a
move announced on the [four-year
anniversary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/13/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting.html)
of the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando and in the middle of Pride
Month.

The rule, which does not differ much from a proposed version [released
last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/24/us/politics/donald-trump-transgender-protections.html),
is part of a broad Trump administration effort across multiple areas of
policy — including
[education](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html),
[housing](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201904&RIN=2506-AC53),
and
[employment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/22/us/politics/supreme-court-gay-transgender-employees.html),
as well as health care — to narrow the legal definition of sex
discrimination so that it does not include protections for transgender
people.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law often known as Obamacare,
established broad civil rights protections in health care, barring
discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or
disability in “any health program or activity” that receives federal
financial assistance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Obama administration interpreted the provision about sex
discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of “gender
identity.” Under the original 2016 rule, health care providers and
insurers [would have been
required](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/04/us/health-care-rules-proposed-to-shield-transgender-patients-from-bias.html)
to provide and cover medically appropriate treatment for transgender
patients.

Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the
Department of Health and Human Services, the unit responsible for the
rule, said in an interview Friday that the move was “equivalent to
housekeeping,” and that the federal government was “updating our books
to reflect the legal reality” that sex discrimination language does not
explicitly refer to the legal status of transgender people.

The Obama rule has been tied up in litigation for several years, and the
Trump administration has declined to enforce it, citing a court ruling
from a judge in Fort Worth. That means that the final rule does not have
any immediate practical effects. Other courts that considered identical
legal questions found in favor of the Obama administration’s
interpretation.

Mr. Severino, who attained prominence as a social conservative before
joining the Trump administration, said that health providers were still
free to adopt their own gender identity policies, as were health
insurers.

“It’s not the role of the federal bureaucrat to impose their own
meanings on the words that their representatives have enshrined into
law,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Severino defended the timing of the rule’s release during Pride
Month and on the Pulse massacre anniversary, saying it was “purely
coincidental.”

Transgender rights advocates criticized the timing for another reason:
the coronavirus.

“It’s really, really horrendous to not only gut nondiscrimination
protections, but to gut nondiscrimination protections in the middle of a
pandemic,” said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the deputy executive director of
the National Center for Transgender Equality. “This rule opens a door
for a medical provider to turn someone away for a Covid-19 test just
because they happen to be transgender.”

The announcement also prompted an outcry from the Human Rights Campaign,
a prominent lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer advocacy
group, which said it plans to sue the Trump administration.

“We will not let this attack on our basic right to be free from
discrimination in health care go unchallenged. We will see them in
court, and continue to challenge all of our elected officials to rise up
against this blatant attempt to erode critical protections people need
and sanction discrimination,” the organization said in a statement.

Mr. Severino, who spent seven years in civil-rights enforcement at the
Justice Department and once oversaw the DeVos Center for Religion and
Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation, said that the Trump
administration would defend the decision in court.

Mr. Severino has [extensive
experience](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-man-behind-trumps-religious-freedom-agenda-for-health-care/528912/)
litigating religious liberty cases. His current office is responsible
for investigating discriminatory violations in health care.

Katie M. Keith, who teaches health law at Georgetown University and has
closely tracked this area of civil rights law, said the rule finalized
Friday needed to be seen as part of a broad pattern of regulatory
changes that eliminate civil rights protections for transgender people
and establishes a definition of sex as being biologically determined at
birth. That idea “is what they are pushing forward on all of these
different policy angles across different agencies,” she said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rolling back the health care rule has been a cause for social
conservatives since its implementation, including Mr. Severino, who
[criticized
it](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/proposed-obamacare-gender-identity-mandate-threatens-freedom-conscience)
while at the Heritage Foundation. They have accused the Obama
administration of [coercing
doctors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/29/this-is-cruelest-thing-trump-administration-has-done-trans-people-yet/)
into sexual reassignment operations, procedures that are typically
handled by specialists. Another rule issued by Mr. Severino’s office
last year would [provide additional “conscience”
protections](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/02/upshot/conscience-rule-trump-religious-exemption-health-care.html)
for health care workers with religious or moral objections to certain
types of care. That rule has been
[voided](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/06/upshot/trump-conscience-rule-overturned.html)
by several federal courts.

The rule also reverses other provisions of the original
Obama-administration interpretation of the statute. It eliminates
anti-discrimination protections for patients with a history of pregnancy
termination. And it rolls back requirements that providers and insurers
must routinely notify patients about the availability of foreign
language translations of important documents.
