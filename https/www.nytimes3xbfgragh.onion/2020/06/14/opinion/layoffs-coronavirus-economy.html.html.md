Years ago, I stumbled across some startling research by economists in
England and Australia: It takes [longer to
adapt](https://books.google.com/books?id=E1Ic-dZtrBIC&pg=PT101&lpg=PT101&dq=andrew+oswald+unemployment+death+of+a+spouse&source=bl&ots=gfUL7Y4GvI&sig=ACfU3U2KXUi5OPsW78e0CwyFsEdFNB6aZg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwie2qna_P7pAhWuTTABHfoIBmwQ6AEwBnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=andrew%20oswald%20unemployment%20death%20of%20a%20spouse&f=false)
to the pain of unemployment than to losing a loved one.

The notion completely violated my intuition, at first. Then I considered
how very personal getting fired is — it’s often taken as a referendum on
your character, your competence — and what kind of crisis of meaning it
can create (What am I here for?), and how thoroughly depleting debt and
chronic economic insecurity can be. It really wasn’t so strange at all.

It’s time to talk about layoffs. They wound people not just
economically, but emotionally and spiritually, and it looks like we’re
due for another round. [Bloomberg
Economics](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-how-many-more-jobs-will-be-lost/)
predicted as much in early June, and last week, we began to see it, with
entities as diverse as
[BP](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-jobs-exclusive/exclusive-bp-to-cut-15-of-workforce-sources-idUSKBN23F1D9),
the [University of
Denver](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/09/university-denver-layoffs-salary-cuts-covid/)
and the [city of
Peoria](https://week.com/2020/06/09/peoria-city-council-makes-first-round-of-job-cuts/)
shedding employees.

Thursday, the Labor Department reported that more than [1.5
million](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/business/economy/unemployment-claims-coronavirus.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20200612&instance_id=19339&nl=the-morning&regi_id=78243797&segment_id=30751&te=1&user_id=271fccc23f80ce773b97febcc97e1904)
Americans had filed new state unemployment claims. A grim [Friday
report](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/business/economy/federal-reserve-economy-coronavirus.html)
from the Federal Reserve to Congress noted, “The path ahead is
extraordinarily uncertain.”

One of the many unwelcome lessons we’ve already learned during this
recession is just how terrible companies are at firing people. Last
month, WW International, the company formerly known as Weight Watchers,
laid off employees in an [arpeggio of simultaneous Zoom
calls](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/business/weight-watchers-firings-zoom.html)
lasting just three minutes
each.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A few weeks before that, Bird, the Santa Monica-based scooter rental
company, lured 406 employees to a mysterious Zoom “webinar” only to have
them stare at a slide that read “Covid-19” while [a disembodied female
voice](https://dot.la/bird-layoffs-meeting-story-2645612465.html) told
them their services were no longer required. “It felt like a Black
Mirror episode,” [said a former
employee](https://dot.la/bird-layoffs-meeting-story-2645612465.html).
(If only. At least there’d have been the possibility of a [star turn by
Jon
Hamm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/12/22/arts/television/jon-hamm-stars-in-black-mirror-christmas-special.html).)

Letting people go is not a natural instinct, even if you’re a sadist.
Our own president, who achieved household fame as the guy who fired
people on TV, [is a boneless chicken about it in real
life](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/25/president-trump-is-afraid-fire-people/),
deputizing the unpleasant task to underlings or doing the deed by
letter, even by
[tweet](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/10/bolton-trump-fires-national-security-advisor-via-twitter/).

But there is a right way and a wrong way to pink-slip someone, and every
boss in America should be trained in the art of having this difficult
conversation. As Joel Brockner, a professor of organizational behavior
at Columbia Business School, explained to me, layoffs take a less
extreme toll if there’s “procedural fairness” associated with them — if
employees are given reasonable advance notice, for instance, and the
resources to ask follow-up questions and find new job leads. Artless
layoffs, he added, don’t just devastate those who’ve been let go, but
the survivors left behind.

“It can be devastating to productivity, devastating to morale,” he told
me. The more fair layoffs are, he’s found, the happier and more
committed the remaining workers are six months later.

And this, perhaps, is where the logic of these pandemic layoffs must
itself be called into question. That’s what I discovered after speaking
to Wayne Cascio, a management professor at the University of Colorado,
Denver. He and two colleagues recently completed a study of every
publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange from 1980 to
2016. The companies that delayed layoffs as long as they could — whether
by cutting salaries, furloughing employees, or even running in the red —
saw higher stock returns, two years later, than comparable companies
that fired people from the start.

Businesses currently mulling layoffs should remember this.

Sometimes layoffs can’t be helped, obviously: A restaurant closes; its
staff must go. But if a business or institution endures, there’s a whole
body of literature suggesting that layoffs don’t ultimately help the
bottom line once the economy heats back up. Experienced and dedicated
humans are hard to replace.

Recently, I called James Guthrie, a co-author of one of the most
accessible and often-cited papers that argued as much. (It’s called
“[Dumb and
Dumber](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/inmororsc/v_3a19_3ay_3a2008_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a108-123.htm).”)
He’s an associate dean at the school of business at the University of
Kansas — which, like many universities in the United States, is
struggling to stay afloat. Yet I discovered it wasn’t economic
efficiencies that interested him most at this moment. It was fairness.
Now, he told me, is the time for every organization to express its
values.

“If we at the university had to resort to layoffs, we’d be laying off
some of the most vulnerable staff — who happen to be the lowest-paid
employees: the custodians, the maintenance crew, the receptionists,” he
told me. He finds the thought quite troubling. He’s started arguing for
pay cuts and furloughs of the better-heeled faculty and administrators
instead. “It’s both more effective,” he said, “and more just.”

A number of cautionary tales are going to emerge during this annus
horribilis. But if we want to survive this recession with our dignity
and our sanity intact, it’s clear we should keep two things in mind: How
people are laid off matters. And layoffs should be a last resort.
They’re often the lazy way out.
