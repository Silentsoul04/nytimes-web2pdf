# A Stimulus Backlash Delivers a Global Warning: Value Female Workers

Australia is pouring millions into the male-dominated construction

SYDNEY, Australia — Shelley Duggan became an essential worker when
Australia declared that her job at a suburban child care center must be
preserved so that doctors and nurses would have a place to send their
children during the coronavirus outbreak.

Australia even made child care free, subsidizing wages and leading Ms.
Duggan to believe that the country was finally learning to respect her
work in a multibillion-dollar industry that is overwhelmingly female.

Now, though, that faith is shattered. With the country striding back
toward normalcy, the first industry that the government is cutting from
the subsidy program is Ms. Duggan’s. And just as free child care is
ending, extra stimulus will be pumped into the construction industry — a
contrast that many say reflects old sexist biases.

“They’ve thrown us under the bus,” said Ms. Duggan, 41, a mother of
three with degrees in education and psychology. “I’ve been working
through the whole thing while trying to home-school my children as well.
It just goes to show that they are not valuing what we do.”

As countries [relax coronavirus
lockdowns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-reopenings.html)
and redouble efforts to bring their economies back to life, Australia’s
throwback approach to stimulus spending has prompted a furious outcry.
The message for nations a step behind Australia on the path to reopening
comes from many sectors of society: This is not
[the 1930s](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wpa-flawed-model-women-inspiration-progress/)
or 1950s; economic priorities must match the times and account for
women’s essential roles and sacrifices.

“One thing the Covid crisis has shown us is how important women’s work
really is,” said Rae Cooper, a professor of gender, work and employment
relations at the University of Sydney Business School. “They’ve kept us
alive and kept our society running. Policy needs to catch up with what
women are doing.”

The pandemic has placed a disproportionate burden on women. They have
put themselves on the contagion’s front lines, in health care, in caring
for older adults and in education, outnumbering men at almost every
turn. Their [unpaid
work](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/women-economy-jobs-coronavirus-gender.html)
managing families has expanded. And studies show that they are
[suffering higher
unemployment](https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jobs-Day-April-Factsheet.pdf)
because they are overrepresented in retail, restaurants and other
service industries crippled by lockdowns.

The trend lines are global. The coronavirus has weakened the already
precarious position of women in the economies [of countries such as
India](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/asia/india-coronavirus-women-economy.html)
and

and threatens to reverse their economic gains in many places, including
the [United

and Europe.

Most Australians had to blink twice when their conservative prime
minister, Scott Morrison, moved to protect the early childhood education
sector in April. The cost of care for children under 5 had been [surging
for years](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/cat/4402.0) without
much interest from Parliament, and Mr. Morrison has often been
criticized for his macho “rugby bloke” manner. He was scorned last year
after saying that women should rise at work only [if their gains didn’t
come at the expense of
men](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/scott-morrison-says-the-rise-of-women-should-not-come-at-the-expense-of-men).

And yet, as he turned to scientists for the country’s public health
response to the virus, Mr. Morrison — the father of two school-age
daughters — yielded to crisis logic for an industry in which 91 percent
of the workers are women. As parents pulled their children out of child
care centers, the government agreed to cover half of the fees, included
child care in its national [wage subsidy
program](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/jobkeeper-payment/) and declared
care would be free for all.

The decision meant that many doctors, nurses and other essential workers
could put in extra hours. Working parents nationwide, including Fernanda
Fain-Binda, 37, a freelance writer in Melbourne, let out sighs of
relief.

“When the child care fees became free, it was this incredible weight off
our mind,” said Ms. Fain-Binda, who has a 5-year-old daughter and a
2-year-old son. “The moment the lockdown started, we actually increased
my son’s days because we knew we needed
that.”

The government did not exactly make it easy for the industry. In most
cases, federal assistance failed to match pre-pandemic revenue. Many
workers had their hours cut. Ms. Duggan, who works in a suburb of
Melbourne, said she took a pay cut even with the government support,
leaving her with a wary appreciation for Mr. Morrison’s assistance.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It was a backhanded compliment,” she said. “‘We really need you, and
the economy needs you, but we don’t want to pay you, because we don’t
think you’re that important.’”

Eventually, the soft whisper of disrespect started to sound like a
shout. One after another, federal and state officials crowed about plans
to prioritize infrastructure projects and bolster manufacturing and
construction — industries that are 70 percent to 95 percent male.

On June 4, Mr. Morrison announced a plan to support builders with 688
million Australian dollars, about $475 million, in grants for the
construction or renovation of homes.

Four days later, his government announced the end of free child care and
subsidies for early-childhood educators, despite promises that the
program would last until September.

Asked how she felt about the pairing, Dana Lightbody, 42, a single
mother of 3-year-old twins in Sydney, offered a common response: “Aw
mate, it’s anger, seething
anger.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

The conference and training company she co-owns has lost most of its
business. In the past few weeks, she said she had sold a garage’s worth
of old baby accessories to make ends meet. In July, she will again
confront child care charges of more than $200 a day for her
toddlers.

Professor Cooper, the gender and employment specialist, said that many
Australians are outraged by the government’s approach. “It’s absolutely
valuing men’s work over women’s work,” she said. “It is so obvious and
so clear to the public that it’s really quite shocking.”

Mr. Morrison, for his part, seemed surprised by the indignation. “When
we put the new arrangements for child care in place during the worst
parts of this crisis, we were very clear that it would not be a
permanent arrangement,” he said in Parliament on Wednesday. He noted
that the usual subsidies, on a sliding scale for income, would soon
return.

But critics say that the prime minister is missing the point. The
Australia Institute, an independent think tank, [recently
found](https://www.tai.org.au/content/new-analysis-more-women-unemployed-yet-stimulus-favours-male-dominated-industries)
that stimulus spending on construction would create fewer jobs for both
men and women than spending a similar amount on health, education and
tourism or entertainment, which are expected to be future growth areas
for economies worldwide.

The focus on hard-hat workers also ignores the fact that 55 percent of
the newly unemployed in Australia are women — and that in [survey after
survey](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-30/working-mothers-more-stressed-than-fathers-report-finds/11365632),
women report that high-quality, affordable child care is one of the most
important factors shaping their careers.

For years, Australians have [envied Scandinavian countries of similar
wealth](https://www.smh.com.au/education/looking-to-swedish-model-of-childcare-and-education-20150518-gh48hj.html)
that offer free universal care from [as early as eight months of
age](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/nordic-nations-best-places-for-parents-children/#:~:text=Finland%20provides%20free%20universal%20daycare,formal%20education%20at%20age%20seven.&text=In%20Sweden%2C%20parents%20are%20entitled,at%2080%25%20of%20their%20salary)
— and for a brief moment, they had it.

“We saw for a couple of months that it’s possible to think more broadly
than we have in the past and possibly change the gender dynamics,”
Professor Cooper said. “And now it’s gone. It’s a real slap in the face
to be removing stimulus in female-dominated areas at precisely the
moment when women are dealing with an additional burden.”

Ms. Duggan said that even now, after Australia has mostly stamped out
the coronavirus, the public health crisis and economic struggles for
women have lingered. At her child care center, roughly a quarter of the
work force was stuck at home this week waiting for results from Covid-19
tests for themselves or for their children, she noted. Many have already
used their sick leave to get through April and May.

“We’re told we’re essential because people need to go to work and keep
the economy running,” she said. “But once the economy starts running
again, then we go back to being unimportant.”
