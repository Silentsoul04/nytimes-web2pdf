The ongoing
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles}{protests
against police brutality} in the United States are beginning to bring
wider change and reflection. Over the last two weeks, that's meant that
the music business, long a site of racial inequity, has been the subject
of a reckoning. One of the first old structures to fall has been the
category ``urban'' music, a quirk of nomenclature that goes back more
than four decades, and has become such an elastic term that it's almost
lost all meaning.

The notion of an ``urban contemporary'' approach to music dates back to
the 1970s, when Frankie Crocker, the pioneering D.J. on New York's
WBLS-FM, was pushing his station beyond the soul and jazz favored by his
generational predecessors. He played club music, soul, and sometimes
music by white artists, too. By the 1990s and 2000s, however, ``urban''
had become an umbrella --- and a euphemistic one, too --- for black
music, used to name departments at record labels, charts and awards.

On this week's Popcast, a discussion of the long and twisted path taken
by the term ``urban.'' Also, a brief conversation about the pioneering
music journalist and early hip-hop producer

(Rocky) Ford Jr}, who died in May.
