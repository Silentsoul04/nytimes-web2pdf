*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

Baruch Haviv, a pilot, operaphile and New York City landlord, pursued
his loves with a mathematician’s specificity.

He arranged his flight routes around European opera schedules. He bought
apartment buildings in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood because
it was near Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Opera House.

And he loved his red 1964 Ford Falcon just the way it was, which is to
say, not exactly mint. When his daughter Elana complained that the
brakes took their time about stopping the car, he told her: “Elana,
think of it like an airplane. You hit the runway and ease the breaks to
slow it down.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That vehicle appeared in the HBO series “The Deuce,” set during Times
Square’s seedier days in the 1970s and ’80s. The car, his four children
agreed, will outlive them all.

In recent years Mr. Haviv took up piano lessons and was preparing for a
June recital when the city went into lockdown. He died on May 24 at his
home in Manhattan after being ill with the coronavirus for two months,
his children said. He was 82.

He was born Baruch Chybovsky on Nov. 7, 1937, in the city of Haifa in
what was then Palestine and now Israel, the first of two children of
Shoshana and Aaron Chybovsky, who had fled Poland ahead of the
Holocaust. His father, a merchant marine, died at sea when Baruch was 4,
leaving the family destitute.

He lived on a kibbutz until he was kicked out at age 7 or 8 for teaching
the other boys how to smoke cigarettes; he was moved to an orphanage.
Unable to afford high school, he worked as a mechanic and then joined
the Israeli military, becoming a fighter pilot and flight instructor.

He changed his surname in the military, later offering various
explanations, including that Chybovsky belonged to the feudal landowners
on whose property his ancestors had worked.

Mr. Haviv left for the United States in 1962 — “to live the American
dream,” his daughter Talia said — losing much of what little money he
had in a bridge game during a layover in France. Arriving in Harlem, he
worked as a painter and carpenter, earning a high school equivalency
diploma and enrolling at Columbia University, where he earned a
bachelor’s degree in mathematics. He was on his way.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Drawing on his military experience, Mr. Haviv took a job giving flight
lessons at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, then became an international
pilot for American Airlines. At one point he turned down an opportunity
to fly to Japan because it conflicted with his opera outings, on which
he often treated the whole flight crew, his children said.

Music filled his dreams. He would wake up humming newly invented tunes
to his wife, Suzanne, a speech therapist and teacher — they had met on a
blind date — until she bought him a tape recorder to preserve his
melodies.

Nothing became of these songs, said his daughter Tamar, a
singer-songwriter.

Mr. Haviv, who lived for years with his wife in a home in Demarest,
N.J., began his forays into Hell’s Kitchen real estate in 1979, when the
neighborhood lived up to its name. His first building, at 431 West 45th
Street, was occupied by unsavory characters whom he paid to leave, his
son Ron said.

Mr. Haviv eventually owned or co-owned five buildings in the Hell’s
Kitchen neighborhood, now also known as the Clinton section. And until
age 75, Barry Haviv, as many knew him, continued to do some minor
building work himself.

“He said, ‘You can bury me in 431,’” Tamar Haviv said.

“But we didn’t,” said her
brother.
