# Reconsidering the Past, One Statue at a Time

From Virginia to New Mexico, protests over police brutality have brought

The boiling anger that exploded in the days after [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/george-floyd-who-is.html)
gasped his final breaths is now fueling a national movement to topple
perceived symbols of racism and oppression in the United States, as
protests over police brutality against African-Americans expand to
include demands for a more honest accounting of American history.

In Portland, Ore., demonstrators protesting police killings [turned
their ire to Thomas
Jefferson](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/06/protesters-take-down-thomas-jefferson-statue-in-front-of-portlands-jefferson-high-school.html),
toppling a statue of the founding father who also [enslaved more
than 600
people](https://www.monticello.org/slavery/slavery-faqs/property/).

In [Richmond,
Va.,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/christopher-columbus-statue-boston-richmond.html)
a statue of the Italian navigator and colonizer Christopher Columbus was
spray-painted, set on fire and thrown into a lake.

</div>

</div>

<div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And in Albuquerque, tensions over a
[statue](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/world/europe/bristol-statue-black-lives-matter.html)
of Juan de Oñate, a 16th-century colonial governor exiled from New
Mexico over cruel treatment of Native Americans, [erupted in street
skirmishes and a blast of
gunfire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/us/conquistador-onate-albuquerque-new-mexico-unrest.html)
before the monument was removed on Tuesday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Across the country, monuments criticized as symbols of historical
oppression have been defaced and brought down at warp speed in recent
days. The movement initially set its sights on [Confederate
symbols](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/style/statue-richmond-lee.html)
and examples of racism against African-Americans, but has since exploded
into a broader cultural moment, forcing a reckoning over such issues as
European colonization and the oppression of Native Americans.

In New Mexico, it has surfaced generations-old tensions among
Indigenous, Hispanic and Anglo residents and brought 400 years of
turbulent history bubbling to the surface.

“We’re at this inflection point,” said Keegan King, a member of Pueblo
of Ácoma, which endured a massacre of 800 or more people directed by
Oñate, the brutal Spanish conquistador and colonial governor. The Black
Lives Matter movement, he said, had encouraged people to examine the
history around them, and not all of it was merely written in books.

“These pieces of systemic racism took the form of monuments and statues
and parks,” Mr. King said.

The debate over how to represent the uncomfortable parts of American
history has been going on for decades, but the traction for knocking
down monuments seen in recent days raises new questions about whether it
will result in a fundamental shift in how history is taught to new
generations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It is a turning point insofar as there are a lot of people now who are
invested in telling the story that historians have been laying down for
decades,” said Julian Maxwell Hayter, a historian and associate
professor at the University of Richmond.

He said that statues removed from parks and street corners could be
teaching points if they are placed in museums, side-by-side with
documents and first-person accounts from the era.

“Let’s say you put a Columbus statue in a museum and you show students
the way Columbus was lionized in a history textbook and you have them
read ‘Devastation of the Indies’ by de Las Casas,” he said. “Then you
have to ask, why were people invested in telling this particular version
of Christopher Columbus’s history?”

The calls to bring down monuments have spanned far and wide, in large
cities like Philadelphia and rural places like Columbus, Miss., touching
both relatively obscure historical figures and deeply revered cultural
symbols.

In Raleigh, N.C., the statue of a former newspaper publisher who was
also a white supremacist [was removed on
Tuesday](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article243559272.html?).
In Sacramento, a tribute to John Sutter, a settler famous for his role
in the California gold rush who enslaved and exploited Native Americans,
[was taken
down](https://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/06/15/sutter-health-removes-john-sutter-statue-amid-complaints-about-racial-history/)
this week. And in Dallas, construction crews [recently
removed](https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/visual-arts/2020/06/03/the-statue-of-the-texas-ranger-at-love-field-may-be-coming-down/)
a statue of a Texas Ranger, long seen as a mythical figure in Texas
folklore, amid concerns over [historical episodes of police brutality
and
racism](https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/visual-arts/2020/06/03/the-statue-of-the-texas-ranger-at-love-field-may-be-coming-down/)
within the law enforcement agency.

The push has largely been welcomed by activists from the Black Lives
Matter movement who see Confederate and other monuments as reminders of
the oppressive history that created the reality they are battling today.
But some of them worried that the focus on historic symbols would do
little to keep attention on the more pressing issue of ending the brutal
treatment of many African-Americans by the police.

“I don’t know if I would say a distraction, because I think people
definitely have the ability to be nuanced,” said **** Alisha Sonnier, a
24-year-old mental health advocate from St. Louis who is concerned that
taking down statues could be an “easy appeasement.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The statue being removed is not going to keep anyone from dying,” she
said. “It’s not going to save a life.”

Cleon Jones, a 77-year-old activist in Africatown, Ala., formed on
Mobile Bay by the last known shipment of slaves to the United States
from Africa, said he felt frustrated by the notion that progress toward
equality could be stalled by rancor over Confederate monuments.

“We’ve got to move forward, not look back,” he said. “As long as we are
dealing with these statues, we’re not moving forward.”

The focus on removing statues has revealed deep civil divisions far
outside the Black Lives Matter movement that are hundreds of years in
the making. It has spurred a backlash among Italian-Americans who have
long regarded Columbus as a point of pride, and also among some
Hispanics in New Mexico, who celebrate an era when Anglos did not
dominate public life.

“We need to have a broader discussion about our history,” said Christine
Flowers, a 58-year-old Italian-American immigration lawyer, who was
among a group that gathered to protect a statue of Columbus in
Philadelphia.

But she added, “It is indefensible to try to erase that history by
pulling down something that is very dear and very symbolic for the
culture of Italian-Americans in Philadelphia.”

In Columbus, Miss., a largely African-American town, county officials
voted on Monday to keep a towering monument to Confederate soldiers —
“our heroes,” it calls them — on the courthouse lawn despite mounting
calls for its removal.

“It’s a good time to learn some history,” said Trip Hairston, a white
county supervisor who opposed removing the monument. “I don’t agree with
all that history, of course, but it is what it is — it’s history.”

It was an argument that left many of those pushing to remove the statue
perplexed. “It’s commemorating and celebrating a lost battle — I don’t
understand,” said David Horton, 28, a lifelong resident of Columbus who
first fought against a Confederate monument as a 7th grader at Robert E.
Lee Middle School.

“These are things I have to endure all my life as a young
African-American man living in Mississippi,” he said. “It’s always made
me feel inferior, it’s always made me feel like I shouldn’t hold my head
up.”

Symbols of the Confederacy and its legacy of slavery have long been at
the center of the reckoning over historic racism in the country.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At least 114 Confederate symbols were removed in the years after a white
supremacist killed nine people at a historic African-American church in
Charleston, S.C., in 2015, [according to a 2019
report](https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy)
by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The killing of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis re-energized that movement, as
demonstrators chipped[away at a 52-foot Confederate
obelisk](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/us/george-floyd-birmingham-confederate-statue.html)
in Birmingham, Ala., and [toppled a statue of Jefferson
Davis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/us/Jefferson-Davis-Statue-Richmond.html),
the president of the Confederacy, in Richmond, Va.

The statues debate has once again focused attention on Columbus, the
voyager who emerged as a symbol of Italians’ contribution to American
history in the late 1800s, a time when discrimination against Italians
was rampant. But many in recent days are also talking about how his
arrival signaled the beginning of a violent European colonization that
resulted in a cross-Atlantic slave trade and the genocide and
displacement of many Indigenous peoples.

Columbus statues from Boston to Miami have been brought down or defaced
by protesters. A large Columbus statue was defaced with red graffiti in
Kenosha, Wis., and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York defended a towering
monument to the explorer at Columbus Circle in Manhattan.

In Philadelphia, supporters went to court to block the removal of a
Columbus statue after another statue, of Frank L. Rizzo, a former mayor
known for discriminatory policies, was removed by the city this month in
the middle of the night. “You just can’t let the mob rule,” said George
Bochetto, a lawyer who filed the petition.

Tensions over the Oñate monument came to a boil Monday night in
Albuquerque, when dozens of protesters engaged in shouting matches, some
seeing the brutal Spanish governor as a symbol of repression, while
others saw him as a positive symbol of a time before Anglos came to
dominate the Southwest. Then a group of white militia members, on a
self-appointed mission to protect the statue, showed up with guns.

In the mayhem that ensued, a man pulled out a weapon and shot one of the
protesters, critically injuring him.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

On Tuesday, the authorities in Bernalillo County filed a charge of
aggravated battery with a deadly weapon against the man with the gun,

year.

In Minneapolis, where the demonstrations over Mr. Floyd’s death ignited
new protest movements in dozens of cities, many said they never expected
them to grow into an international reckoning over racist symbols. Still,
they said, it was only a matter of time before the latest police killing
of a black man led to something more lasting than previous protests.

“It’s kind of like a wound that has a scab,” said Teron Carter, 49,
standing [across the street from Cup
Foods](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/us/cup-foods-minneapolis-george-floyd.html),
the deli near Mr. Floyd’s fatal encounter with the police. “A wound that
has a scab is still a wound, it’s just that the scab is on top. And if
you scrape that scab a certain way, it reopens the wound.”

He attributed the scope of the burgeoning movement to built-up grief and
to the energy of young people who simply are not willing to put up with
walking by Confederate and other statues each day.

“It’s not just an isolated city event,” Mr. Carter said. “Now everybody
saw the opportunity and said, ‘If we don’t get in there and talk like
Minneapolis is talking, then we aren’t going to be heard.’”
