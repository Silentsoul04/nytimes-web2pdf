[Mitch
McConnell](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-kentucky-primary.html)
is up for re-election this year, and the idea of him losing is as
seductive as — oh, I don’t know. Dinner in a real restaurant?

Obviously, it’s hard to pay attention to anything but the presidential
race when [John Bolton is
revealing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/us/politics/bolton-book-trump-impeached.html)
that Donald Trump did not seem to know Britain was a nuclear power and
wondered if Finland was part of Russia.

But next week Democrats are going to pick a nominee to run against
McConnell, and it’s a real contest, full of all the same battles we went
through over Biden versus Bernie. I think it would be a good idea for us
to take a look at what’s going on.

Really, your friends know you pay attention to this stuff and they are
going to expect you to be able to give them a quick briefing over
cocktails, if we ever reinvent cocktail parties.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Kentucky went for Trump by 30 points in 2016. But last year voters
elected a Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, who had the advantage of
running against a truly terrible incumbent, Matt Bevin. (After Bevin
lost, he famously rewarded big donors by [issuing 428 pardons and
commutations](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/11/bevin-issued-hundreds-pardons-and-commutations-final-day/4399770002/)
to folks who had been convicted of everything from raping a child to
murdering a parent.)

Details, details.

The Democratic Party leaders feel they have a Senate winner in [Amy
McGrath](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/politics/charles-booker-amy-mcgrath-kentucky-adverstising.html),
a moderate former Marine fighter pilot. In passing we’ll mention that
McConnell dodged military service on a medical issue — something called
optic neuritis.

“Those things used to matter,” said [John
Heyrman](https://www.berea.edu/psc/faculty-and-staff/dr-john-heyrman/),
a political-science professor at Berea College. But now, he said, it
never comes up. And optic neuritis certainly doesn’t sound any more
questionable than bone spurs.

Still, McGrath has run some [terrific
ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcjG2fK7kNk) about her youthful
dream to “fly fighter jets,” her discovery that girls couldn’t get those
kinds of jobs, and the letter she sent seeking help from her senator
(guess who), which was never answered.

Her campaign started with a splash, drawing in tons of donations from
hopeful Democrats around the country. But the follow-up was a bit mixed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For instance, when Brett Kavanaugh was up for Supreme Court nomination,
McGrath first told a local paper that she would have supported him if
she was in the Senate. Hours later she [changed her
tune](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/10/amy-mcgrath-brett-kavanaugh-1405832)
“upon further reflection.”

“Talking to her, she’s pretty good one-on-one,” said [Ryland
Barton](https://www.wkyufm.org/people/ryland-barton#stream/0), the state
capitol bureau chief for Kentucky Public Radio Network. But, he added,
“she kind of seems consulted to death.”

Meanwhile, up popped — [Charles
Booker](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/politics/charles-booker-amy-mcgrath-kentucky-adverstising.html),
a 35-year-old African-American state legislator. Candidate of the Bernie
Bros and [endorsed by
A.O.C](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2020/06/09/bernie-sanders-endorses-charles-booker-kentucky-senate-primary/5326417002/).
He’s been running a more exciting campaign, and Kentucky’s two largest
newspapers have endorsed him, mainly on the basis of his being … not
boring. But it’s hard to know how Kentucky will take to Medicare for All
and a Green New Deal.

“It’s certainly gotten a lot more interesting,” said Barton.

Can a black progressive rally a huge turnout of liberals and minorities
that compensates for any fallout in the middle? If there’s a moment, it
might be now. Kentucky is another state with a hideous racial incident
in its recent past — [Breonna
Taylor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/breonna-taylor-police.html),
a 26-year-old black emergency medical technician, was shot eight times
by the police who broke into her home while she slept, searching for a
drug suspect who wasn’t there.

Either candidate could certainly run a smart campaign, and it’s hard to
know how all the national trauma is affecting voters’ attitudes.
“There’s been no polling. Nobody really knows what the state of the
race is,” said Heyrman.

Here we have the classic dilemma for the 2020 Democrats. Who would you
want nominated for this difficult race in a purple-to-red state?

A) Moderate with a really good résumé.

B) Exciting newcomer who might be able to move the public left.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

C) Anybody who can beat Mitch McConnell and I don’t care if it’s [Mr.
Pokee](https://www.instagram.com/mr.pokee/?hl=en) the Instagram
Hedgehog.

OK, you’re right. Mr. Pokee would be an improvement. McConnell is, of
course, the guy who brags about having refused to schedule even a
hearing for almost any judicial nominees during the Obama
administration. Whose race to fill up the vacant court seats with Trump
appointees should climax this week when he makes his Republicans [vote
to confirm Justin
Walker](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/us/judge-justin-walker-nomination-senate.html),
a 38-year-old family friend with minimal experience, to the
second-highest court in the land.

McConnell, whose wife, a member of a family that controls a massive
shipping organization, was conveniently named Trump’s secretary of
transportation.

This is hardly the only Senate race you’re going to want to pay
attention to this year. The Democrats have a bunch of exciting
candidates. (And, as usual, a few accidents they’ll just ignore. I’m
thinking of [the nominee they’re trying to get rid
of](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/us/politics/chris-janicek-nebraska-senate.html)
in Nebraska — the owner of a cupcake bakery who sent out a group text to
his team describing how he imagined one of the staffers would behave
during group sex.)

So, who can maul Mitch? I know you’re focused on the presidential race —
who isn’t? But this will give you something to think about once you’ve
exhausted your contemplation of Donald Trump’s sense of geography.
