SAN FRANCISCO — As [the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu)
spread in March, Vroom, a start-up that sells used vehicles online,
shelved its plans to go public and rushed to shore up its operations.

But with many dealerships closed under shelter-in-place orders, people
started buying more cars online, benefiting Vroom with record sales in
March and April, the company said.

“We saw the whole world stabilizing,” said Paul Hennessy, the chief
executive. “At the end of April, we said, ‘OK, maybe we should actually
go on the offensive here.’”

Vroom, which is based in New York, capped that offensive by going public
last week. Its share price more than doubled on the first day of trading
as the company raised $495 million from its offering.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Vroom is part of a group of start-ups that have moved quickly to go
public as the initial shock of the coronavirus has worn off. The stock
market, which plummeted when the outbreak swept the United States, has
[rallied strongly in recent
weeks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/business/recession-stock-market-coronavirus.html).
Since its nadir in late March, the S\&P 500 index has climbed 40
percent.

Lemonade, an insurance start-up valued at $2.1 billion, announced last
week that it had confidentially filed to go
public.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>DoubleDown Interactive,
a mobile gaming company, also filed to go public this month.

Some of the biggest Silicon Valley start-ups are taking steps toward an
I.P.O., too. Airbnb, the home rental start-up valued at $31 billion,
said it hadn’t ruled out going public this year. Palantir, a digital
surveillance company valued at $20 billion, is preparing to file for an
I.P.O. in the coming weeks, said a person briefed on the start-up’s
plans, who declined to be named because the talks were private.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Palantir declined to comment; Bloomberg
[reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/palantir-is-said-to-file-ipo-in-weeks-for-possible-fall-debut)
earlier on its I.P.O. plans.

“The window is open,” said Previn Waas, a partner focused on I.P.O.s at
the professional services firm Deloitte. “Everyone has figured out that
a virtual I.P.O. is possible. There’s an appetite for companies to go
public.”

Jeff Thomas, head of West Coast listings and capital markets at the
Nasdaq stock exchange, said, “Everybody who was in process is gearing
back up.”

Morgan Stanley had spent the last few months helping companies affected
by the coronavirus find financing in every form — except public
offerings, said Colin Stewart, Morgan Stanley’s head of technology
equity capital markets. The market was too volatile, and companies had
to assess how the virus had changed their financial forecasts, he said.

But now with the stock market more stable, the situation has changed.
“It’s clear there is a lot of pent-up investor demand to look at
I.P.O.s,” Mr. Stewart said.

Wall Street is embracing them even though many of the companies are
losing money. Vroom lost $143 million last year on $1.2 billion in
revenue, according to its disclosures. The food delivery start-up
DoorDash, which [filed in February to go
public](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/04/technology/doordash-ipo.html)
and has seen increased use in the pandemic, has also burned through
hundreds of millions in cash and is unprofitable.

Last year, high-profile money losers such as Uber and Lyft also went
public — and promptly skidded in the stock market. Their disappointing
performances and the failed I.P.O. of WeWork [set off a wave of prudence
across the start-up
world](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/08/technology/silicon-valley-startup-profit.html).

But excitement for new listings — especially for fast-growing tech
companies — has sidelined the question of profitability. Investors have
become more tolerant of money-losing companies because the virus has
accelerated the adoption of technology like e-commerce, virtual
learning, streaming, telehealth and delivery, said Gavin Baker, chief
investment officer at Atreides Management, which invests in private and
public companies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Covid pulled the world into 2030,” Mr. Baker said.

Not all of the companies that were on track to go public this year may
make it, given how the economy is reeling from the pandemic. In early
March, EquityZen, an investment service that tracks I.P.O.s, published a
list of nine potential candidates for the year. Four — including the
home rental company Vacasa, the 3-D printing company Desktop Metal and
Velodyne Lidar, which makes technology for driverless cars — have since
laid off staff because of the coronavirus.

“If we wrote the list today, it would have a very different set of
components,” said Phil Haslett, a co-founder of EquityZen.

Airbnb, which had said it would go public this year, was [hit especially
hard](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/technology/airbnb-coronavirus-valuation.html)
by the travel shutdown. It raised new funding in April and cut a quarter
of its staff. Asked about going public this year, Brian Chesky, its
chief executive, said in a recent interview: “You can deal with some
volatility, but there is a threshold. We’re kind of feeling out where
that threshold is.”

The window for I.P.O.s right now may be small. A second wave of
virus-related shutdowns could send the stock market into another
tailspin. Companies also need to navigate disclosing their
second-quarter financials, as well as holidays like Labor Day and Yom
Kippur. Plus there is the November presidential election, which may
create volatility in the market.

As a result, more companies than usual are aiming to go public in
August, a month they traditionally avoided because people were often on
vacation, Mr. Thomas of Nasdaq said. The exchange is telling companies
to be ready to go public any time, he said, and to have alternative
financing ready in case they can’t.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For chief executives trying to take their companies public now, the
timing is a nail-biter. Henry Schuck, founder and chief executive of
ZoomInfo, had been planning to get his company out to the stock market
in late March. But when the virus hit, he started checking the VIX, an
index that measures stock market volatility, every day. The index had
rarely topped 20 over the past decade, but in March, it topped 80.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The market was just not in a place to have an I.P.O. come out,” he
said.

In May, after the market had stabilized, Mr. Schuck decided to go for
it. But there were other challenges. While executives typically go on a
“roadshow” to pitch their company’s shares to investors, he was stuck
at home.

So he crammed back-to-back virtual meetings with investors into a week.
Even though he was at home, he said, he made sure to dress up and even
wear shoes. On the morning of ZoomInfo’s I.P.O. on June 4, Mr. Schuck
hit a ceremonial virtual button to open trading, alongside his wife and
4-year-old daughter. ZoomInfo’s shares rose more than 60 percent on the
first day of trading.

Mr. Hennessy of Vroom also held a virtual roadshow, taking meetings with
investors via teleconference from his home in Suffern, N.Y. He said he
appreciated the efficiency of the roadshow, which would normally have
lasted two weeks across multiple cities.

On the day of the I.P.O. on June 9, Mr. Hennessy and his executive team
could not travel to Nasdaq, where Vroom was listing, to press the
opening buzzer since the exchange was not open to visitors. Nasdaq
provided Vroom’s employees with an app to upload photos of themselves,
which the exchange displayed on its tower in New York’s Times Square.

Vroom’s office, nearby at 37th Street and Broadway, remained closed, but
a few employees in masks went to see their faces displayed on the tower,
Mr. Hennessy said. He said he had preferred it to an in-person ceremony,
since people in the whole company got to participate by sending in
photos and sharing screenshots of themselves on the tower.

“Those Nasdaq moments are over in a few minutes with some confetti,” he
said. “This lasted a couple of hours.”
