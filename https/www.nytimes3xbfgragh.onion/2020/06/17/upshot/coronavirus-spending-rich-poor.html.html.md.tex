In the Manhattan restaurants around Lincoln Center, the tips often rose
and fell with the changing playbill. A popular classic musical could
mean more preshow diners, and more income. A more famous actress as
Eliza Doolittle could do the same. The end of a big run, like ``My Fair
Lady,'' meant the opposite: Tips would be down for a while.

``We were dependent on how well shows were doing at Lincoln Center, and
we really did pay attention,'' said Emma Craig, who was a server at the
Atlantic Grill a block away before the coronavirus crisis. She has not
returned to that job yet, or to another singing at a private supper club
downtown. In both jobs, she said, ``I am dependent on the trickle
down.''

The recession has crushed this kind of work in particular: service jobs
that depend directly on the spending --- and the whims --- of the
well-off.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/06/18/business/18up-up-richpooreconomy1/merlin_173569083_7954cc26-d64c-452a-bb5c-60334ad7d787-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Economists at the Harvard-based research group
\href{https://opportunityinsights.org/}{Opportunity Insights} estimate
that the highest-earning quarter of Americans has been responsible for
about half of the decline in consumption during this recession. And that
has \href{https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/tracker/}{wreaked havoc
on the lower-wage service workers} on the other end of many of their
transactions, the researchers say.

``One of the things this crisis has made salient is how interdependent
our health was,'' said Michael Stepner, an economist at the University
of Toronto. ``We're seeing the mirror of that on the economic side.''

As income inequality has grown in America, so
\href{https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.30.2.3}{has
inequality in consumption}. That means that when the rich spend money,
they drive more of the economy than they did 50 years ago. And more
workers depend on them.

Put another way, this particular economic shock --- one that has halted
much in-person spending, even by rich people who never lost their jobs
--- has been devastating for an economy in which many low-wage workers
count on high-income people spending money.

Mr. Stepner and the economists Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren and John
Friedman have collected data from credit card processors, payroll firms
and other private
companies\href{https://tracker.opportunityinsights.org/}{tracking how
and where people spend their money}, and how businesses and their
workers have been affected as a result. By tying debit and credit card
spending back to the home ZIP codes of millions of anonymized
cardholders, they estimate that households in the bottom quarter of ZIP
codes by income cut their spending by about 30 percent from
pre-coronavirus levels at the lowest point in late March. Now, with the
help of government stimulus, low-income spending is down only about 5
percent.

For the highest-income quarter, spending has recovered much more slowly,
after falling by 36 percent at the lowest point.

``It's not just that it's somewhat bigger in percentage terms,'' Mr.
Chetty said of shifts by the rich. ``In absolute dollars, that's like
half of the game.''

The researchers point to several curious patterns tied to that fact:
Unemployment claims have been high in rich counties that were largely
immune to the last recession. And lower-income Americans living in those
richer counties have been hit particularly hard. Their spending fell
further than the spending of lower-income workers in poorer counties.

At the ZIP code level for small businesses, the steepest declines in
revenues and hours worked have been in the highest-income neighborhoods.
That's a pattern that can't fully be explained by differences in
coronavirus cases.

In the ZIP code where Ms. Craig worked, near Lincoln Center,
small-business revenue fell by 72 percent at the lowest point. It's
still down by half.

\subsection{The rare service-sector
recession}\label{the-rare-service-sector-recession}}

In past recessions, the service sector has been one of the most
resilient parts of the economy. In down times, consumers typically cut
back on big durable goods, like a new washing machine or an upgraded
car. But while you can drive your car a little longer, you may not be
able to stretch out your next trip to the dry cleaners for a year or
two.

The restaurant industry has even been the place where laid-off workers
in other parts of the economy have found work in the past.

So we have never seen anything
\href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/fd1i4r6xqhfjlfx/The\%20Coronavirus\%20crisis\%20will\%20be\%20the\%20first\%20services\%20recession.pdf?dl=0}{that
looks quite like this service-sector recession} --- one where the
bartenders lost their jobs before the construction workers, where
previously thriving restaurants and salons have experienced the steepest
losses.

The service sector had also been expanding over time,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/11/upshot/big-cities-low-skilled-workers-wages.html}{replacing
blue-collar jobs in manufacturing} that were more stable and paid more.
Especially in big, expensive cities, the vast service sector is now the
place where the rich and the poor meet.

``What we've seen with rising inequality of the last few decades is that
more and more modest-income individuals survive because they're serving
where the consumption has been,'' said Lawrence Katz, an economist at
Harvard, who has reviewed his colleagues' findings. And that
consumption, he added, has been in the hands of households at the top.

If we'd had this same kind of economic shock 50 years ago, Mr. Katz
said, the magnitude of the ripple effects from the rich to the poor
would have been much smaller. There simply weren't as many links between
them. (Fifty years ago, the rich also couldn't have counted on working
from home, keeping their incomes intact.)

Now, cities like Washington that were relatively unscathed by the Great
Recession --- thanks to their high median incomes and all their service
jobs --- stand to be hurt far more deeply in the coronavirus recession.
Initial unemployment data bears this out.

Through April, Washington lost 10 percent of its jobs. During the Great
Recession, the city increased employment by 3 percent.

San Francisco and San Mateo counties have lost 16 percent of their jobs
during the pandemic, roughly in line with job losses nationwide. During
the previous recession, those counties gained jobs while employment in
the rest of the country fell 3 percent over all and nearly 5 percent in
the poorest counties. Unemployment was even more uneven in the 2001 and
1991 recessions, with steeper job losses in poorer counties.

In other words, in good times --- or even in more typical downturns ---
proximity to the rich affords lower-wage workers a higher degree of job
security. In this peculiar coronavirus moment, that arrangement appears
remarkably precarious,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/us/unemployment-coronavirus-women.html}{particularly
for women} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/13/upshot/coronavirus-america-job-losses-slowing-tracker.html}{black

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground

    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

``It's completely a house of cards,'' said Ai-jen Poo, the executive
director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. ``So much of our
essential work force that keeps us safe and literally has kept this
country from collapsing are poverty-wage jobs that were completely
invisible to most people before the pandemic.''

In the restaurant industry, the thread connecting the rich and the poor
is clearer. Higher-income diners hand servers their primary income.

``They are directly, directly, directly reliant on those tips,'' said
Saru Jayaraman, the president of One Fair Wage, a group pushing to end
sub-minimum wages for tipped workers. ``They are so at the mercy of
those upper classes.''

These workers have learned to be familiar with the rhythms of rich
consumption. Bad weather --- too hot, too cold, too rainy --- means
fewer tips. January and February, after the glut of holiday spending,
bring fewer hours and less money. For hotel workers, incomes are tied to
convention season. For bartenders, it may be the theater calendar.

In recent weeks, spending by the poor has nearly rebounded to pre-crisis
levels, thanks to federal stimulus checks --- low-income consumption
shot up after April 15 the moment they were deposited --- and to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-stimulus-coronavirus.html}{expanded
unemployment benefits}. But the jobless rate remains at its highest
level since the Great Depression. High-income spending has been much
slower to return. Some consumption has also shifted online, which
doesn't help local businesses.

For Washington policymakers, it is hard to coax more spending out of
people wary of leaving their homes, and to steer that spending to the
businesses and workers affected most.

``If the underlying problem is that people are afraid of interacting in
close proximity, and they're afraid to go shopping in certain ways, then
the only way to get things back to normal is going to be to solve the
public health problem,'' said Mr. Friedman, an economist at Brown and a
researcher on the project.

That may mean expanding the safety net for low-wage workers, the
researchers suggest, to help them survive until that moment comes.

Patricia Namyalo, a server in a hotel restaurant on Capitol Hill in
Washington, is gloomy about what's ahead. She recalls when business
began to dwindle in early March, before the city's shutdown went into
effect, and well before members of Congress, who sometimes dine at the
hotel, recessed for the crisis.

``There were days when we went to work and had a total of eight tables
come in for brunch,'' said Ms. Namyalo, a 38-year-old immigrant from
Uganda. ``And that's supposed to be shared among four people.''

No one wanted to go home because they were guaranteed \$11 an hour in
her unionized hotel, and they had to keep those hours in an empty
restaurant to make up for lost tips. In retrospect, Ms. Namyalo believes
her customers knew what was coming. They were following the news from
Asia, the headlines out of Europe.

``The upper class was already aware that America was going to follow
suit,'' she said. ``And people like myself --- I didn't quite get it at
the time.''

She suspects the same is true now. Higher-income consumers know they
won't be back to their old levels of dining out or spending any time
soon, even with all the talk of cities reopening. Meanwhile, lower-wage
workers wait, hoping for the call back to work.
