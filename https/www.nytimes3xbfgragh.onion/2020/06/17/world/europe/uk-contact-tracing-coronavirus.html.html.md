# England’s ‘World Beating’ System to Track the Virus Is Anything But

Like a lot of the country’s pandemic response, contact tracing has been

LONDON — Prime Minister [Boris
Johnson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html)
of
[Britain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html)
unveiled last month a [“world beating”
operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdlIVAwWmB8) to track down
people who had been exposed to the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html),
giving the country a chance to climb out of lockdown without losing
sight of where infections were spreading.

As with much of the [government’s response to the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/25/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-nursing-homes.html),
however, the results have fallen short of the promises, jeopardizing the
[reopening of Britain’s hobbled
economy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson.html)
and risking a second wave of death in one of the countries [most
debilitated by the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).

In almost three weeks since the start of the system in
[England](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/world/europe/britain-quarantine-us-coronavirus.html),
called [N.H.S. Test and
Trace](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/nhs-test-and-trace-if-youve-been-in-contact-with-a-person-who-has-coronavirus/),
some contact tracers have failed to reach a single person, filling their
days instead with internet exercise classes and bookshelf organizing.

Some call handlers, scattered in offices and homes far from the people
they speak with, have mistakenly tried to send patients in England to
testing sites across the sea in Northern Ireland.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And a government minister threatened on a conference call to stop
coordinating with local leaders on the virus-tracking system if they
spoke publicly about its failings, according to three officials briefed
on the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of
retribution.

Contact tracing was supposed to be the bridge between lockdown and a
vaccine, enabling the government to pinpoint clusters of infections as
they emerged and to stop infected people from passing on the virus.
Without it, a [World Health Organization official said
recently](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/who-cautions-against-further-lifting-lockdown-england),
England would be remiss in reopening its economy.

But the system, staffed by thousands of poorly trained and low-paid
contact tracers, was rushed out of the gate on May 28 before it was
ready, according to interviews with more than a dozen contact tracers,
public health officials and local government leaders. At the time, the
government was making a barrage of announcements while also trying to
douse a scandal involving [Mr. Johnson’s most senior aide, who had
violated lockdown
orders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/world/europe/dominic-cummings-lockdown.html).

The troubled rollout has left public health officials across England
trying to battle a virus they still cannot locate. Test results from
privately run sites, now [numbering in the tens of thousands
daily](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public),
were not being reported at a local level as recently as last week,
leaders in six councils said. Public health officials say they catch
wind of outbreaks from the news. And while the virus is cooling off in
London, infection rates remain high in other parts of England, [notably
the
northwest](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/what-is-coronavirus-r-number-and-is-it-rising-in-uk).

Other nations in Europe are building their public sectors to support
contact-tracing systems that might be needed for years to come. Germany,
for instance, has hired contact tracers in 375 public health

But in England, where [a decade of
austerity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/24/world/europe/britain-austerity-may-budget.html)
has [starved public health
departments](https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/LGA%20briefing%20-%20health%20and%20local%20public%20health%20cuts%20-%20HoC%20140519%20WEB.pdf)
of workers who used to regularly track illnesses, Mr. Johnson has
entrusted the job largely to Serco, an outsourcing giant that was
recently obliged to pay the government a hefty fine for fraud on a
previous, unrelated contract. The New York Times has learned that the
contact-tracing contract, awarded in a secretive procurement process,
cost 108 million pounds, or about $136
million.

Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University,
said, “The government has dismantled, fragmented and eviscerated so much
of its health service over the last 20 years that it was much more
difficult to get a coordinated system.”

“They’re basically trying to build a centralized, parallel, privatized
system,” she added.

As a result, she said, “We’ve had far more deaths than we should have.
And lockdown has had to go on much longer than in other countries
because we’ve let the virus rip for so long.”

Asked for comment, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Social
Care said that its contact-tracing system was already helping to save
lives by curbing the spread of the illness.

“In the first week, tens of thousands of people have engaged with the
N.H.S. Test and Trace service,” the spokesman said. “We are working to
reach more people and making improvements to the service to do that.”

Garry Robinson, Serco’s customer services director for Britain, said in
a statement that the company was “committed to supporting the
government’s test and trace program” and had successfully mobilized
10,500 contact tracers in four weeks, which he called a “significant
achievement.”

The first part of contact tracing involves health professionals calling
people who test positive for the virus and obtaining a list of their
recent contacts. Then, a lower-level tier of workers call those contacts
to ask them to isolate themselves.

But in the first week of virus tracking in England, [government figures
show](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/891703/NHS_test_and_trace_bulletin__England__-_28_May_to_3_June_2020.pdf),
thousands of infected patients were overlooked: Callers reached 5,407
people with the virus, while missing another 2,710 positive cases that
had been transferred into the system — along with an unspecified number
that had not.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

At the same time, contact tracers have waited to be assigned cases that
never came, a problem that officials have ascribed to low numbers of new
cases and infected people submitting their contacts online instead. One
employee, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear
of being fired, said that most days he watched three films, one after
the next, at a salary of about $11 per hour.

Local public health officials were asked to make plans by the end of
June for possible tailor-made shutdowns around clusters of infections.
But they say they still have neither the powers to do that nor the
testing data to pinpoint infections.

“We are kind of driving the car while building it,” said Dominic
Harrison, the director of public health in Blackburn, in northwest
England. “There are still enormous problems to be resolved.”

The troubled rollout bears the hallmarks of Britain’s [disastrous
efforts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/world/europe/coronavirus-antibody-test-uk.html)to
respond to the coronavirus: haphazard data, an emphasis on political
theater and a heavy dependence on the private sector. With [deaths
nearing 50,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-casualties/uk-covid-19-death-toll-tops-47000-as-pressure-heaps-on-pm-johnson-idUSKBN23211E),
Britain sits alongside the United States and Brazil among the countries
suffering the greatest blows from the coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After working to trace contacts in the early days of the pandemic,
Britain largely scrapped that plan by March 12, with [government
scientists saying it was no longer
practical](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886989/s0007-spi-m-o-consensus-view-impact-interventions-030220-sage4.pdf).
Eleven days later, [Mr. Johnson declared a
lockdown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson.html).

The government has denied that contact tracing was ever stopped, and
said that to claim otherwise would be entirely wrong. However, in
internal notes mistakenly forwarded to The New York Times in response to
questions about why it initially ended contact tracing in March,
government officials wrote: “The answer to this is we basically didn’t
have the testing capacity.”

By April, with the death toll soaring, [the government reversed
course](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again)
and promised to reconstitute the system for England.

Other nations within the United Kingdom, including Wales and Scotland,
which are in charge of their own contact tracing, appointed public
health officials to run their programs.

For England, however, Mr. Johnson’s government contracted Serco and
another company to hire most of its 25,000 contact tracers, despite
[Serco having recently been fined £19
million](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48853870) over claims
involving a separate contract that it had charged the government for
monitoring convicts who were dead, jailed or living outside the country.

The government said that Serco was regularly monitored and that no
concerns had been raised about the company before it was awarded the
test and trace
contract.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

But it is trying to do contact tracing on the cheap. While some American
states are paying tracers salaries of around $50,000 a year, many
English tracers said in interviews that they were paid £8.72 an hour,
barely above the minimum wage, a figure equivalent to less than $24,000
a year. Some of them were teenagers who had never held jobs before.

After answering online ads for generic customer service jobs, they
started work with little or no training. One Serco-employed contact
tracer said that at least a third of his 40 or so colleagues in London
had not received any online training before starting.

“We weren’t talked through how a conversation could go or anything,”
said a tracer working in Sheffield, England.

Details of the procurement process, shared by a senior civil servant,
suggest a possible reason for the low pay and sketchy training: Serco
offered to provide the service at an extraordinarily tight profit margin
of less than 5 percent, roughly half the margin of the next cheapest
contender.

The contract was awarded without any real competition, the senior civil
servant said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a
confidential process.

“Serco are pretty much the only people who can stand up a work force in
that time, and love them or hate them, it is about having the numbers,”
the civil servant said.

The virus-tracking system was supposed to be augmented by a smartphone
app that automated some tracing. But the tool, promised initially by
mid-May, has been [shadowed by fears about technical glitches and data
breaches](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing.html),
and the government said it was now [trying to introduce the app before
winter](https://twitter.com/rowlsmanthorpe/status/1273276669541916674).

Even some of the more experienced, higher-paid contract tracers who
speak to infected people said they were feeling underutilized. Gerry, a
former nurse, said she had expected to begin work as a contact tracer in
early June. Instead, at 10:30 p.m. on May 27, she received an email
telling her the program would begin the next day. The computer system
crashed as thousands of contact tracers tried to log on.

More than two weeks later, she still has not spoken to a single contact.
Other contact tracers complained on a private Facebook group that they
were still waiting for login details two weeks after the start date,
according to screenshots from the group.

Some contact tracers also said they were unaware of any translation
services, a problem that could keep England from tracking the virus
through [migrant and ethnic minority
communities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/world/europe/coronavirus-doctors-immigrants.html),
which have [suffered
disproportionately](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-black-britons.html).

“It’s a total shambles,” said Ben Bradshaw, an opposition Labour
lawmaker, who has spoken to government officials about contact tracing.

“Everyone has accepted all the way through this crisis that the
countries that have dealt with it best have always had effective track
and trace systems in place, and that any country wishing to emerge from
lockdown and live with this virus for the foreseeable future will need
an effective track and trace system,” he said. “Yet, the history of this
in Britain is a catalog of
disasters.”
