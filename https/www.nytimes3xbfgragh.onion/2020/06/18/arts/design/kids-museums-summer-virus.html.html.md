Museums have become extraordinarily creative in throwing open their
virtual doors to young people still on lockdown. Educators are providing
at-home opportunities to emulate renowned artists, go on odysseys to the
stars, collaboratively create a picture book on women’s history and even
chill out with a skink. Here’s a selection of offerings, many of them
free.

Almost as soon as quarantine began, the **[Children’s Museum of
Manhattan](https://cmom.org/)** instituted [CMOM at
Home](https://athome.cmom.org/), a daily series with themes — from
Magical Monday to Surprise Sunday — and related projects and videos. The
over 80 selections now online include instructions for doing [a dinosaur
march](https://athome.cmom.org/join-the-dinosaur-march-with-laurie-berkner/)
with the musician Laurie Berkner and [saying hello in multiple
languages](https://athome.cmom.org/ways-to-say-hello-with-mumu-fresh-and-callaloo-kids/)
with the organization [Callaloo Kids](http://www.callalookids.com/).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re showing the world to children every day — different ways of
cooking or dancing or talking,” said Leslie Bushara, the museum’s deputy
director for education and exhibitions. The CMOM at Home on June 28 will
celebrate Pride with the band Queer Kids and a rainbow-wand art project.
A later episode will focus on the artist [Delano
Dunn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A90E3QuF0Hw). “It will be an
activity where children can explore racial identity,” Ms. Bushara said.

**[The Sugar Hill Children’s Museum of Art &
Storytelling](https://www.sugarhillmuseum.org/)** also plans to raise
young people’s social consciousness. On July 28, [this Manhattan
institution](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/25/arts/design/sugar-hill-museum-art-to-new-yorks-youngest.html)
will commemorate the anniversary of one of the earliest civil rights
marches, [the Silent Protest Parade
of 1917](https://naacp.org/silent-protest-parade-centennial/) (in
response to deadly attacks on black residents by white mobs in
Illinois), with the virtual “Children’s Art Exhibition for Justice.” The
event will incorporate a video history of the march, works by children,
spoken-word pieces and art collaborations by preteens, teenagers and the
artist Dionis Ortiz.

Parents can find more ways to help their children understand the efforts
to end inequality in the [Online Resources for Families Regarding Racial
Injustice](https://cmany.org/blog/view/online-resources-families-regarding-racial-injustice/),
posted by the **[Children’s Museum of the Arts](https://cmany.org/)**.
This New York museum, which still has spaces in its weeklong [Online
Summer Art Colony
Camps](https://cmany.org/classes-and-activities/art-colony/summer-103-charlton/),
also offers free video art lessons, craft projects and storybook
readings. Next Thursday it will host a [low-cost virtual
tour](https://cmany.org/classes-and-activities/events/rico-gatson-virtual-studio-tour/)
of the artist Rico Gatson’s studio.

And don’t forget web pages of activities like [Recipes for Play at

However old the art fan, virtual galleries await. **** On June 29,
**[the Museum of Modern Art](https://www.moma.org/visit/families)** will
initiate the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Family Art Lab at Home, a series
of creative videos and prompts based on MoMA’s collection. The
**[Whitney Museum of American Art](https://whitney.org/)**’s [Kids Art
Challenge](https://whitney.org/families/kids-art-challenge), which began
in April, continues to add six projects every two weeks: Click on a
Whitney work and discover ways to explore its themes.

“We tried for a mix of old favorites, like [Calder’s
‘Circus](https://whitney.org/families/kids-art-challenge/alexander-calder),’
as well as newer works,” like “Liberty (Liberté),” a Statue of Liberty
riff by the performance artist [Puppies
Puppies](https://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/material-art-fair-2016/puppies-puppies-interview-53446),
said Heather Maxson, the Whitney’s director of school, youth and family
programs. The museum also offers [downloadable
images](https://whitney.org/whitney-from-home/hopper-coloring) of Edward
Hopper’s art to color; his “Early Sunday Morning” (1930) has inspired
both [an art
challenge](https://whitney.org/families/kids-art-challenge/edward-hopper)
and a coloring page.

On July 6, Ms. Maxson will introduce Whitney Summer Studio, a six-week
program of free 40-minute Zoom art classes, with a family session on
Saturdays. “We’re going to work on ways to connect families that are
separated by distance,” she said, “so you can work with your grandma in
Florida.”

**[The Guggenheim Museum](https://www.guggenheim.org/)** created its
interactive [Family Tours at
Home](https://www.guggenheim.org/event/guggenheim-family-tours-at-home),
on select summer Saturdays, with a similar goal in mind. It has also
turned “[A Year With
Children 2020](https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/a-year-with-children-2020),”
its annual show of New York City student artwork, into an e-book.

Little bookworms will especially appreciate virtual visits to the
**[Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book
Art](https://www.carlemuseum.org/)** in Amherst, Mass. Fans of Carle’s
titles like “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” will devour this museum’s
offerings, among them [a virtual
exhibition](https://sway.office.com/4gm5EH94jhEswJ7z) featuring 21
children’s book illustrators.

Finicky adolescents will find programs, too, including [collage
workshops](https://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/teens/teen-studio)
next month at the **[Metropolitan Museum of
Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/)**, followed by a [Career
Lab](https://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/teens/career-labs). And
the **[Museum of the Moving Image](http://www.movingimage.us/)** in
Queens offers a summer-long bonanza: media camps, Town Halls for Teen
Media Makers and a [Teen Film
Festival](http://www.movingimage.us/education/teencouncil). Both tweens
and teens will enjoy the museum’s continuing series “Jim Henson’s
World,” which presents [an online conversation with four
puppeteer-filmmakers](http://www.movingimage.us/visit/calendar/2020/06/20/detail/jim-hensons-world-new-visions-of-puppets-on-screen)

The Smithsonian’s **[National Museum of African American History and
Culture](https://nmaahc.si.edu/)**, in Washington, and its **[National
Museum of the American Indian](https://americanindian.si.edu/)**, in
Manhattan and Washington, offer multimedia digital materials
illuminating the country’s reckoning with racism. The African-American
[museum’s new web
portal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/arts/design/museums-protests-race-smithsonian.html),
[Talking About Race](https://nmaahc.si.edu/learn/talking-about-race), is
especially helpful in starting difficult conversations. “We talk a lot
about the danger of silence,” said Candra Flanagan, the museum’s
director of teaching and learning. “When we’re silent, it forces kids to
figure things out on their own.”

This museum’s online programs include a [Juneteenth
celebration](https://nmaahc.si.edu/event/juneteenth-celebration-resilience?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D145373621),
marking the end of slavery in the United States, on Friday and Saturday,
and a [virtual student documentary
showcase](https://nmaahc.si.edu/event/nhd-nmaahc-virtual-student-documentary-showcase?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D143246785),
which runs through Wednesday. From Aug. 3 to 7, the museum will host
[Young Historians Institute: The Virtual
Remix](https://nmaahc.si.edu/learn/students/young-historians-institute-virtual-remix).
A selective program for high school students that requires applications
and tuition, it will explore the African-American experience in the
Revolutionary era.

In New York, **[the Museum of Jewish Heritage — a Living Memorial to the
Holocaust](https://mjhnyc.org/)** presents its own online resources to
introduce children gently to a devastating history. One highlight, the
HBO documentary “[The Number on Great-Grandpa’s
Arm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/19/arts/events-for-children-in-nyc-this-week.html),”
offers an uplifting look at a relationship between a child and a
Holocaust survivor.

More virtual avenues beckon at the **[New-York Historical
Society](https://www.nyhistory.org/)**, whose free [Reading Into History
@
Home](https://www.nyhistory.org/childrens-museum/family-programs?reading-history-home-high-five-glenn-burke/june/28/2020)
book club on June 28 hosts Phil Bildner, author of “A High Five for
Glenn Burke,” about the first professional baseball player to come out
as gay. The society, which will continue its Living History Zoom
sessions with costumed interpreters, also offers [Camp History @
Home](https://www.nyhistory.org/childrens-museum/family-programs?camp-history-home-women-march/july/20/2020)
from July 20 to Aug. 13. It will center on the suffragist exhibition
“[Women March](https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/women-march)” and
the book “Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History,” by Vashti
Harrison. Participants will collaborate on a picture e-book of women’s
rights activists (and receive a physical copy later).

**[The Tenement Museum](https://www.tenement.org/)** **** offers ****
another window onto New York history. Known for using actors to portray
real immigrants on its historical properties, it is [continuing the
practice virtually](https://www.tenement.org/events/). Twice this
summer, children can visit 1916 with [Victoria
Confino](https://www.tenement.org/events/virtual-family-event-meet-victoria-confino-june-24/),
a Sephardic Jewish teenager who immigrated from Kastoria, a city that
today is part of Greece. Another program, [Building a
Community](https://www.tenement.org/events/virtual-family-event-building-a-community-july-8/),
uses video and oral history to introduce the Puerto Rican [Saez Velez
family](https://www.tenement.org/events/virtual-family-event-building-a-community-july-8/)
in the 1950s and later.

“I truly believe one silver lining that will come out of this crisis
will be an entire generation of children with an increased interest in
science and innovation,” Crystal Bowyer, the president and chief
executive of the new science-oriented **[National Children’s

about the Covid-19 pandemic in an email. “Children are home right now
thinking about what they can do.”

an engrossing interactive graphic novel inspired by the 1999 West Nile

Although not virus-related, the “[Live From

from the **[Liberty Science Center](https://lsc.org/)** in Jersey City
are just as compelling. Those who aren’t squeamish can check the

robotic procedure on a kidney.

the[](https://www.amnh.org/)**[American Museum of Natural
History](https://www.amnh.org/)**, **** [virtual
adventures](https://www.amnh.org/explore) include live YouTube watch
parties like [Field Trip: Mapping the
Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUCC6ae0XZA&feature=youtu.be),
on Friday, and an [exploration of bat
biodiversity](https://www.amnh.org/calendar/in-the-field-bats) on June
26. The museum’s website and app for children,
[OLogy](https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology), also has enough games,
projects and videos to keep the young and the restless busy all summer.
Check out its zoology section to [play the role of a queen
wasp](https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/zoology/you-are-the-queen) or
learn what [a
tardigrade](https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/zoology/what-s-this-life-at-the-limits)
is.

Speaking of funky creatures, on Monday the **[Natural History Museum of
Los Angeles County](https://nhm.org/)** will begin offering a 360-degree
tour of its online show “[Spiky, Hairy, Shiny: Insects of
L.A](https://nhm.org/spiky-hairy-shiny-insects-la).,” whose bugs appear
in colorful close-ups. And don’t miss the museum’s “[Walk on the Wild
Side” videos](https://nhmlac.org/connects), in which children can [meet
that skink](https://nhmlac.org/stories/chill-out-tallulah-skink). Her
name is Tallulah, and she’s surprisingly sociable.
