There may not be group hikes and s'mores, but that doesn't mean there
won't be adventure, songs, comedy, art and dance. Here are some programs
taking place online.

Children may not be able to sing around a campfire, but they can
certainly belt out Broadway numbers or dig into crafts at home. Here's a
sampling of the many arts camps that have gone virtual. (Most charge
fees, but financial aid may be available.)

\textbf{Los Explorers Virtual Dance Camp: Cuba:}
\href{https://www.ballethispanico.org/school/b-learning-online/virtual-los-explorers}{This
five-day program} next week from Ballet Hispánico welcomes both little
boys and girls --- ages 3 to 8 --- to explore Cuban culture through
rhythm and song. (There's also a two-day minicamp.)
\href{https://www.ballethispanico.org/}{\emph{ballethispanico.org}}

\textbf{Harlem Summer Arts Experience:} Starting on July 6, the
\href{https://hsa.asapconnected.com/?org=4795\#ProgramID=5948}{Harlem
School of the Arts} will offer a monthlong immersion in the spirit and
creativity of the Harlem Renaissance. With sessions for ages 5 to 18,
the multidisciplinary camp includes programs in art, ballet, hip-hop,
jazz, tap, song and theater.\\

of the activities and material online}. Youngsters --- there are
separate sessions for Grades 3 to 6 and 7 to 12 --- can jump in to

half-day or drop-in sessions. In addition to arts like filmmaking,
photography and musical theater, the camp includes sports (modified for
the home, the website says).\\
