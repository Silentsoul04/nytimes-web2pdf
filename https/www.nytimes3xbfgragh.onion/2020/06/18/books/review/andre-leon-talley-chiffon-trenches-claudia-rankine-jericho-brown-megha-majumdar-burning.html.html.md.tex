It's been 17 years since André Leon Talley, the former Vogue editor at
large, published his first memoir, ``A.L.T.'' On this week's podcast,
Talley talks about
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/books/review/the-chiffon-trenches-andre-leon-talley.html}{``The
Chiffon Trenches,''} his new book about his time in the highest reaches
of the fashion world.

``The first book was clearly a memoir about my grandmother and Diana
Vreeland. Both these ladies were very important in my life,'' Talley
says. ``I did cover some of the things of my upbringing, my background,
but I did not go into the depths of what I have gone into in `The
Chiffon Trenches.' In `The Chiffon Trenches,' it is my epistle of love
to the important narrative of my life, beginning from my humble
upbringing in North Carolina, all the way to 2020. I go through the
decades of when I was at the top of my career at Vogue, and sitting in
the front row in Paris, experiencing racism, sexism, ageism, all of
that. I decided I had to be very, very raw and honest.''

The Book Review recently asked the prominent American poets Claudia
Rankine and Jericho Brown to write original poems responding to this
historic moment in our country. On this week's episode, Rankine reads
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/books/review/claudia-rankine-weather-poem-coronavirus.html}{``Weather,''}
and Brown reads
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/books/review/jericho-brown-say-thank-you-say-im-sorry-poem-coronavirus.html}{``Say
Thank You Say I'm Sorry.''}

Megha Majumdar also visits the podcast to talk about her
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/books/review/a-burning-megha-majumdar.html}{highly
acclaimed debut novel, ``A Burning.''} The book, set in contemporary
India, captures the state of longstanding issues of oppression there in
the face of ascendant right-wing politics. Majumdar talks about how the
book's central characters correspond to ``three particular questions''
that interest her. ``One was: How does somebody who gets a little taste
of political power --- in a country where most people feel that the
government and the country's systems do not serve them --- how does such
a person respond to that proximity to power? What are they willing to do
in order to gain even more power?''

Also on this week's episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the
publishing world; and Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai talk about books
they've recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.

Here are the books discussed by The Times's critics this week:
