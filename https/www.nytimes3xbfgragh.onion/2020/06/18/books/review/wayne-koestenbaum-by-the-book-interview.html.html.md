*“When I was younger, I craved novels,” says the poet and cultural
critic, whose latest book, “Figure It Out,” is a collection of essays.
“Now I read more poetry and nonfiction.”*

**What books are on your nightstand?**

A formidable pile. Alejandra Pizarnik, “Diana’s Tree” (translated by
Yvette Siegert). Jakov Lind, “Ergo” (translated by Ralph Manheim).
Mónica de la Torre, “Repetition Nineteen.” Hannah Arendt, “The Origins
of Totalitarianism.” Oyinkan Braithwaite, “My Sister, the Serial
Killer.” George Oppen, “Selected Prose, Daybooks, and Papers” (edited
by Stephen Cope). Joon Oluchi Lee, “Neotenica.” Hervé Guibert, “Written
in Invisible Ink: Selected Stories” (edited and translated by Jeffrey
Zuckerman). Lara Mimosa Montes, “Thresholes.” Abigail Child, “This Is
Called Moving: A Critical Poetics of Film.” Renee Gladman, “Calamities.”

**What’s the last great book you read?**

Magda Szabo, “Katalin Street,” translated by Len Rix. A dead girl comes
back to semi-existence and hovers near the homes of neighbors who never
treated her nicely enough while she was alive. Earlier this year, to
school myself on the history of innovative celluloid magic, I finally
read P. Adams Sitney’s “Visionary Film.”

**Are there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first
time?**

Does the “Aeneid” count as a novel? I read the Robert Fagles
translation. Dido, the “tragic queen of Carthage,” had long been part of
my bloodstream, but I needed to confront her sorrow up close, in the
verse that is her homeland.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Can a great book be badly written? What other criteria can overcome
bad prose?**

Some world-altering books arrive wrapped in dense, difficult prose,
requiring prolonged mastication. I’ve never been able to make it through
Hegel’s “Phenomenology of Spirit.” I’m being judged, not Hegel.

**Describe your ideal reading experience.**

While temping as a Kelly Girl in 1982, I gulped down Charles Dickens’s
“Dombey and Son.” I was working for a week as a receptionist, but no
customers or clients showed up. Sometimes the phone would ring. But
mostly I was on my own with Dickens.

**What’s your favorite book no one else has heard of?**

Stephen Rodefer’s “Four Lectures” (published in 1982 by the Figures, a
magnificent press run by Geoffrey Young) changed the tempo of my
poetry-writing life. I was inspired by Rodefer’s non sequiturs, by his
distractibility, by his diction’s obstreperousness — road blocks that
made me giddy.

**Which writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets —
working today do you admire most?**

Impossible question to answer succinctly. I depend — for nourishment,
ideas, ecstasy — on hundreds. Among my favorite living poets is
Friederike Mayröcker. Close to my heart, always, as role model, is Joyce
Carol Oates. Jamaica Kincaid, Hilton Als, Joan Didion:
style-triumvirate. Slide into my DMs if you want more recommendations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What book, if any, most contributed to your artistic development?**

“The Collected Poems of Frank O’Hara.” He taught me how to be quick.

**Do you count any books as guilty pleasures?**

I love reading movie-star biographies, a genre I take seriously.
Patricia Bosworth’s biography of Montgomery Clift is a classic: terse
yet juicy.

**Has a book ever brought you closer to another person, or come between
you?**

I received, when I was 20, a slim edition of Wordsworth’s selected
poems, as a gift from a young man I loved. I didn’t dare to hope that he
loved me back. But his inscription gave me a foretaste.

**What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?**

From Jackie Wang’s “Carceral Capitalism,” I learned about the sinister
existence of a predictive policing software called PredPol. Don’t Google
it, or ads for PredPol will start showing up on your Twitter feed.

**Which subjects do you wish more authors would write about?**

Their inner filth. But, please, in clean sentences. I can’t say it’s
radical to wish for more writers to describe *accurately* their sexual
fantasies; but my appetite for carnal truth is unsated.

**Have you ever changed your opinion of a book based on information
about the author, or anything else?**

I should have changed my mind about Ezra Pound’s poems, but I didn’t. I
can’t erase, from my ear, his elegiac line “Quick eyes gone under
earth’s lid.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**How do you organize your books?**

Prose and poetry dwell in separate areas, alphabetized by author.
Certain writers defect from category. Boris Pasternak’s prose memoir
“Safe Conduct” lives next to his book-length poem “My Sister — Life”
in the poetry section. Books in French have their own cul-de-sac. I keep
together the books of certain publishers: all of my Green Integer books,
for example, are on one shelf. On another set of shelves — the *salon
des refusés* — are the books that depress me too much, or are too
miscellaneous and dreary, to be included in the regular area. But I
can’t discard these wastrels.

**What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?**

Thich Nhat Hanh, “Happiness.” Are you shocked? I was going to mention
“For Every Young Heart: Connie Francis Talks to Teenagers,” but that
didn’t seem surprising enough.

**What’s the best book you’ve ever received as a gift?**

My parents gave me a Gallimard “Collection Folio” paperback of André
Gide’s “L’immoraliste” for Christmas when I was a teen. I didn’t read it
until much later. Some messages take time to detonate.

**How have your reading tastes changed over time?**

When I was younger, I craved novels: “Jane Eyre” and “Sons and Lovers”
schooled me in ambivalence, flame, escape. Now, I read more poetry and
nonfiction. I seek out books that are odd, unpopular and reticent. But a
fluent novel — especially a monologue, in the maniacal mode of Thomas
Bernhard — can still sock it to me.

**You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead
or alive, do you invite?**

Jean Rhys, Emily Dickinson, Max Jacob.

**Disappointing, overrated, just not good. What book did you feel as if
you were supposed to like, and didn’t?**

Edmund Spenser’s “The Faerie Queene” is entrancing, but I was
disappointed to discover that it was not about fairies and queens.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?**

Thomas Mann, “The Magic Mountain*.”* Thomas Mann, “Buddenbrooks*.”*
Thomas Mann, “Doctor Faustus*.”* But I will make amends — as soon as
Susan Bernofsky publishes her new translation of “The Magic Mountain.”

**What do you plan to read next?**

Whim will determine what’s next. Many offerings entice. Cathy Park Hong,
“Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning.” Douglas A. Martin,  
“Wolf*.”* Asiya Wadud, “Syncope*.”* I might start with Steve Benson’s
“Blue Book”; I’m late to its idiosyncratic party. I open it and
discover these lines: “he’s up on the wall nude his arms / wrapped
around his head talking like / or about David Hockney David Cassidy.”
How could I resist?
