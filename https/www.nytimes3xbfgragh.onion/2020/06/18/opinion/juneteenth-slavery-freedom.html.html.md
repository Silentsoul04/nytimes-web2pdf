Neither Abraham Lincoln nor the Republican Party freed the slaves. They
helped set freedom in motion and eventually codified it into law with
the 13th Amendment, but they were not themselves responsible for the end
of slavery. They were not the ones who brought about its final
destruction.

Who freed the slaves? The slaves freed the slaves.

“Slave resistance,” as the historian Manisha Sinha points out in “[The
Slave’s
Cause](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300227116/slaves-cause): A
History of Abolition,” “lay at the heart of the abolition movement.”

“Prominent slave revolts marked the turn toward immediate abolition,”
Sinha writes, and “fugitive slaves united all factions of the movement
and led the abolitionists to justify revolutionary resistance to
slavery.”

When secession turned to war, it was enslaved people who turned a narrow
conflict over union into a revolutionary war for freedom. “From the
first guns at Sumter, the strongest advocates of emancipation were the
slaves themselves,” the historian Ira Berlin
[wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1992/12/27/how-the-slaves-freed-themselves/7d58b82c-3446-4f96-a07d-52fc868eb960/)
in 1992. “Lacking political standing or public voice, forbidden access
to the weapons of war, slaves tossed aside the grand pronouncements of
Lincoln and other Union leaders that the sectional conflict was only a
war for national unity and moved directly to put their own freedom — and
that of their posterity — atop the national agenda.”

All of this is apropos of
[Juneteenth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/06/18/style/juneteenth-celebration.html),
which commemorates June 19, 1865, when Gen. Gordon Granger entered
Galveston, Texas, to lead the Union occupation force and delivered the
news of the Emancipation Proclamation to enslaved people in the region.
This holiday, which only became a nationwide celebration (among black
Americans) in the 20th century, has grown in stature over the last
decade as a result of key anniversaries (2011 to 2015 was the
sesquicentennial of the Civil War), trends in public opinion (the
[growing racial
liberalism](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020)
of left-leaning whites), and the rise of the Black Lives Matter
movement.

Over the last week, as Americans continued to protest police brutality,
institutional racism and structural disadvantage in cities and towns
across the country, elected officials in New York and Virginia have
announced plans to make Juneteenth a paid holiday, as have a number of
prominent businesses like Nike, Twitter and the NFL.

There’s obviously a certain opportunism here, an attempt to respond to
the moment and win favorable coverage, with as little sacrifice as
possible. (Paid holidays, while nice, are a grossly inadequate response
to calls for justice and equality.) But if Americans are going to mark
and celebrate Juneteenth, then they should do so with the knowledge and
awareness of the agency of enslaved people.

Emancipation wasn’t a gift bestowed on the slaves; it was something they
took for themselves, the culmination of their long struggle for freedom,
which began as soon as chattel slavery was established in the 17th
century, and gained even greater steam with the Revolution and the birth
of a country committed, at least rhetorically, to freedom and equality.
In fighting that struggle, black Americans would open up new vistas of
[democratic
possibility](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/black-history-american-democracy.html)
for the entire country.

To return to Ira Berlin — who tackled this subject in “[The Long
Emancipation](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286085):
The Demise of Slavery in the United States” — it is useful to look at
the end of slavery as “a near-century-long process” rather than “the
work of a moment, even if that moment was a great civil war.” Those in
bondage were part of this process at every step of the way, from
resistance and rebellion to escape, which gave them the chance, as free
blacks, to weigh directly on the politics of slavery. “They gave the
slaves’ oppositional activities a political form,” Berlin writes,
“denying the masters’ claim that malingering and tool breaking were
reflections of African idiocy and indolence, that sabotage represented
the mindless thrashings of a primitive people, and that outsiders were
the ones who always inspired conspiracies and insurrections.”

By pushing the question of emancipation into public view, black
Americans raised the issue of their “status in freedom” and therefore
“the question of citizenship and its attributes.” And as the historian
Martha Jones details in “[Birthright
Citizens](https://marthasjones.com/birthright-citizens/): A History of
Race and Rights in Antebellum America,” it is black advocacy that
ultimately shapes the nation’s understanding of what it means to be an
American citizen. “Never just objects of judicial, legislative, or
antislavery thought,” black Americans “drove lawmakers to refine their
thinking about citizenship. On the necessity of debating birthright
citizenship, black Americans forced the issue.”

After the Civil War, black Americans — free and freed — would work to
realize the promise of emancipation, and to make the South a true
democracy. They abolished property qualifications for voting and
officeholding, instituted universal manhood suffrage, opened the
region’s first public schools and made them available to all children.
They stood against racial distinctions and discrimination in public life
and sought assistance for the poor and disadvantaged. Just a few years
removed from degradation and social death, these millions, wrote W.E.B.
Du Bois in “[Black Reconstruction in
America](http://www.webdubois.org/wdb-BlackReconst.html), “took decisive
and encouraging steps toward the widening and strengthening of human
democracy.”

Juneteenth may mark just one moment in the struggle for emancipation,
but the holiday gives us an occasion to reflect on the profound
contributions of enslaved black Americans to the cause of human freedom.
It gives us another way to recognize the central place of slavery and
its demise in our national story. And it gives us an opportunity to
remember that American democracy has more authors than the shrewd
lawyers and erudite farmer-philosophers of the Revolution, that our
experiment in liberty owes as much to the men and women who toiled in
bondage as it does to anyone else in this nation’s history.
