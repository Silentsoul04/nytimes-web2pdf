\section{While Theaters Are Dark, These Virtual Stages Deliver Actual
Fun}\label{while-theaters-are-dark-these-virtual-stages-deliver-actual-fun}}

From shows based on children's books to productions that introduce
children to global cultures, companies are offering a range of options.

Online stages have the spotlight now that real ones are dark. The
following companies enable children to watch, perform or learn about
theater remotely.

\textbf{ArtsPower National Touring Theater:} For \$15, families can
stream a show from the company for an unlimited time as part of its new
on-demand service. All based on children's books, the hourlong musicals
include extras like author interviews and how-to-dance videos. The
service's first title,
``\href{https://artspowerondemand.teachable.com/courses}{Chicken
Dance},'' adapts Danny Schnitzlein's comic barnyard tale.\\
\href{https://artspowerondemand.teachable.com/}{\emph{artspowerondemand.teachable.com}}

\textbf{Beat by Beat Press:} This theater publisher has created two
musicals for ages 7 to 14 that camps, schools and youth groups can
rehearse and present virtually. After buying a license (\$149.50 until
Sept. 1, but organizations with low funds can pay less), the group
downloads scripts, recorded accompaniment and other materials. Actors
individually record and upload their numbers, which, when viewed
successively, coalesce into a show. The choices:
``\href{http://www.bbbpress.com/musicals/the-show-must-go-online/}{The
Show Must Go Online!}'' or
``\href{http://www.bbbpress.com/musicals/super-happy-awesome-news/}{Super
Happy Awesome News!}''\\
\href{http://www.bbbpress.com/}{\emph{bbbpress.com}}

\textbf{Chicago Children's Theater:}
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClI9nwq0sLwmxnSC8xvN9lw}{CCTv},
this troupe's YouTube channel, just made its debut with
``\href{https://chicagochildrenstheatre.org/performance/frederick-puppet}{Frederick,
A Virtual Puppet Performance}.'' An adaptation of
\href{https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/books/frederick-by-leo-lionni/}{Leo
Lionni's picture book} about field mice, it features a surprising
narrator: the actor Michael Shannon. On Saturday the theater's
\href{https://chicagochildrenstheatre.org/boing-2020/}{Boing! festival}
will include the premiere of ``Doll Face Has a Party!,'' based on the
picture book written by Pam Conrad and illustrated by Brian Selznick.\\
\href{https://chicagochildrenstheatre.org/}{\emph{chicagochildrenstheatre.org}}

\textbf{Funikijam World Music:} Offering classes and shows that
introduce children 9 and under to a variety of global cultures, the
company has presented its menu in a virtual format. In its Totally
Awesome Summer program, families can find music videos, online
activities, excerpts from recorded performances and
\href{https://www.funikijam.com/find-a-class}{many free classes}.\\
\href{https://www.funikijam.com/}{\emph{funikijam.com}}

\textbf{The New Victory Theater:} Normally the home of international
productions, the theater has devised
\href{https://newvictory.org/stories/category/family-engagement/new-victory-arts-break/}{New
Victory Arts Break}, a free weekly series of activities to do from
Monday to Friday. Each package --- they're all on the website --- has a
theme, like songwriting or tap dance.
\href{https://www.newvictory.org/stories/new-victory-arts-break-juneteenth/}{This
week's edition} honors Juneteenth with songs, readings, history and
drama.\\
\href{https://newvictory.org/}{\emph{newvictory.org}}

\textbf{The Paper Bag Players:} The troupe that makes stories out of
cardboard and paper teaches small children to do the same. Its webpage
\href{https://thepaperbagplayers.org/activities-for-kids-at-home/}{Activities
for Kids at Home}features weekly video installments with clips from past
performances and projects like how to
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=34\&v=yR1Q1pVj6pc\&feature=emb_title}{turn
a box into a car}.\\
\href{https://thepaperbagplayers.org/}{\emph{thepaperbagplayers.org}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/06/18/arts/18kids-theater-3/merlin_173616828_26175cc3-2180-4430-bf04-f789da36e80c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

\textbf{TheaterWorksUSA:} This national company offers
\href{https://twusa.org/shows-artists/on-tour/anywhere/}{TheaterWorks
Anywhere}, a webpage with free activities, behind-the-scenes information
and video clips of musical adaptations of books like ``Charlotte's Web''
and
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/09/theater/review-dog-man-the-musical.html}{Dog
Man: The Musical}.'' (Monthly subscriptions, starting at \$5, provide
access to more content.) It recently introduced
\href{https://twusa.org/academy/}{TheaterWorksUSAcademy}, a fee-based
program of skill lessons and master classes, including a
\href{https://twusa.org/academy/diy-family-musicals/}{DIY: Family
Musicals! course} that begins on Saturday.\\
\href{https://twusa.org/}{\emph{twusa.org}}

\textbf{Trusty Sidekick:} Children can view free videos of nine of
\href{https://www.trustysidekick.org/the-shows}{the troupe's shows}, a
smorgasbord for different ages, on its website through June. But
\href{https://www.trustysidekick.org/studio}{Sidekick Studio}, its
series of mini-classes, will remain online all summer. So will a video
of the company's latest experiment,
``\href{https://www.trustysidekick.org/planetarycensus-view}{The
Planetary Discovery Census},'' an intergalactic adventure featuring cast
members and the audience interacting on Zoom.\\
