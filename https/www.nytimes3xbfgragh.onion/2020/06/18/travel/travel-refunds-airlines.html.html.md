I’ve received thousands of emails from Times readers since the
coronavirus put the brakes on travel in mid-March. And if there’s one
thing that’s obvious, it’s that the aftershocks of canceled trips
persist. Unclear policies, confusing customer-service protocols and
not-yet-fulfilled refunds continue to be an issue — months later, and
even as the world reopens.

This week, I dipped into my email inbox, grab-bag style, for three
questions to tackle in brief. Have your own? Ask me at
<travel@NYTimes.com>.

### **Dear Tripped Up,**

In early February, I used Orbitz to book a round-trip Qantas Airways
flight from San Francisco to Melbourne, scheduled to depart in April.
The flight was canceled. Who should one lobby for refunds in this case:
the online travel agency or the airline? Meredith

### Hi Meredith,

I’ve gotten a lot of questions about this issue. Many readers report
being herded like cattle from an online travel agency to an airline, and
back — then around again.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Always start with the company that sold you the ticket. O.T.A.s like
Orbitz can change most reservations (save for certain types on some
low-cost carriers), so you’re well within reason to let the customer
service representative do your bidding with the
airline.

I’ve [said it
before](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/travel/trip-refund-airlines.html)
and I’ll say it again: When a flight to, from or within the United
States is canceled because of the pandemic, you’re entitled to a cash
refund. And if you’re not getting that as an initial option from sites
like Orbitz, it’s because they can only process refunds after they’ve
been granted that right by the end provider; here, the airline. That’s
why [getting refunds
from](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/travel/coronavirus-refund-travel-ota.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimestravelhttps://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/travel/coronavirus-refund-travel-ota.html)O.T.A.s
can be complicated, especially during this global crisis. These agencies
are squished between an unprecedented number of consumer requests and
airlines that stall or stonewall — or perhaps never pick up the phone.
If you’re hitting roadblocks like these, ask that your case be escalated
(Orbitz and other O.T.A.s have a hierarchy of urgency). Don’t be shy
about following up.

That persistence seemed to work for you, even without my help: By the
time I emailed Orbitz, a spokeswoman confirmed that the refund was
already in process. Yes, it’s now June, and although call volumes in
March and April have leveled off for most agencies by now, the current
environment is still far from normal — patience is key.

### **Dear Tripped Up,**

I have a flight to France coming up next month. Delta rebooked me on a
different flight on my original departure date, which seemed fine — I
understand flexibility is key nowadays. But when I hopped online to
double-check my options, I didn’t see the new flight on Delta’s
schedule. In fact, it didn’t appear until a few days later. What’s the
story? Sabine

### Hi Sabine,

Although airline technology has improved in recent years, the pandemic
has placed extraordinary stress on the system.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even as the world begins to open up, flight schedules will be slimmer
than normal this summer. Delta, like all airlines, has been compressing
its schedule into fewer flights, so it’s possible that the flight you
were rebooked on was kept “off-sale” to give already-booked passengers
dibs before being made available to new passengers. It’s also possible
that the new flight was full for a period of time, during which time it
wasn’t appearing for sale online.

There are complexities to publishing and adjusting airline schedules,
for sure, but there is one upside to a system that’s so in flux: mistake
fares, or bargain-basement price glitches, that eagle-eyed consumers can
score before they’re corrected. There are several websites that comb for
these deals, including [Secret Flying,](https://www.secretflying.com/)
[Scott’s Cheap Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/) and
[Airfarewatchdog.](https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/)

### **Dear Tripped Up,**

I paid a $125 “miles redeposit fee” when I canceled my United Airlines
reward flight a couple of months ago. How can I get that money back? Jen

### Hi Jen,

Save for the famously flexible Southwest, most airlines have long
imposed some sort of fee — usually between $75 and $150 — when
passengers change or cancel tickets booked with miles. These so-called
“restocking fees” tend to lessen or disappear with elite
status.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Although commonplace in normal times, these fees felt particularly
out-of-step at the start of the pandemic. Facing increased pressure in
March, many carriers waived them; United took a bit longer than some
others to reverse its policy but eventually fell in line. On June 1, the
airline announced that it will continue to waive redeposit fees on all
award tickets with 2020 departure dates.

Refunds and waivers [have been a moving
target](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/11/travel/coronavirus-travel-trip-refunds.html)
since the pandemic started, and if you got ensnared in an unfavorable
policy before it changed for the better, you have plenty of company. If
you’re committed to getting that restocking fee reversed, your best bet
is to call the airline — a United spokeswoman wouldn’t commit to this as
an across-the-board option, but she said the company will address the
issue on a case-by-case basis.
