Color}\label{klobuchar-drops-out-of-bidens-vp-search-and-backs-picking-a-woman-of-color}}

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was considered a strong contender to
be Joe Biden's running mate until protests over racial justice prompted
renewed scrutiny of her former role as a prosecutor.

WASHINGTON --- Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota announced late
Thursday that she was withdrawing from consideration to be the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html}{running
mate} to former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.} on the Democratic ticket.

Ms. Klobuchar, who mounted her own campaign for the presidency before
dropping out and becoming one of Mr. Biden's most spirited surrogates,
said during an MSNBC interview that she called Mr. Biden on Wednesday
night and told him he should choose a woman of color to be his running
mate.

Ms. Klobuchar, a moderate and veteran of the Senate like Mr. Biden, was
known to have a strong rapport with the presumptive Democratic nominee,
and was an early favorite of a significant number of his donors and
supporters. But her case for being
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/politics/biden-vice-president-voters.html}{Mr.
Biden's running mate} was badly damaged after the Memorial Day killing
of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police officers. The
death, which has prompted weeks of demonstrations and protests against
police violence across the country, led to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/politics/klobuchar-minneapolis-george-floyd.html}{renewed
scrutiny} of Ms. Klobuchar's career as a local prosecutor in
Minneapolis.

``After what I've seen in my state and what I've seen across the
country, this is a historic moment and America must seize on this
moment,'' she said. ``I truly believe, as I told the vice president last
night, that I believe that this is a moment to put a woman of color on
that ticket.''

In a Twitter post late Thursday, Mr. Biden praised Ms. Klobuchar and
described her as a key ally in the contest to beat President Trump in
November.

Mr. Biden
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-female-vice-president.html}{committed
to naming a woman as his vice-presidential pick} during a debate with
Senator Bernie Sanders on March 15. His team's search committee has
contacted
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html}{roughly
a dozen women}, and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/13/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president.html}{eight
or nine are being vetted more intensively}, according to people familiar
with the process.

Senator Kamala Harris of California, who also ran against Mr. Biden and
is the only black woman in the Senate, is widely regarded as a strong
candidate for the vice-presidential slot. Several other black women are
being vetted by Mr. Biden's search committee, including two whose
prospects have risen as the national debate over racial justice
amplifies calls for him to select a woman of color:
\href{https://demings.house.gov/}{Representative Val Demings of Florida}
and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta. Mr. Biden is also considering
Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser under President
Barack Obama, the people familiar with the process have said.

Ms. Klobuchar was still being vetted until her Wednesday night phone
call to Mr. Biden, according to a person familiar with Mr. Biden's
running mate selection process. But in conversations earlier this week,
Ms. Klobuchar suggested to friends that she recognized that her own
history made it difficult for Mr. Biden to select her, given the
widespread Black Lives Matter protests.

As the district attorney in Hennepin County, which encompasses
Minneapolis, Ms. Klobuchar
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/us/klobuchar-prosecutor-myon-burrell.html}{developed
a tough-on-crime reputation 20 years ago} that is a difficult fit with
modern Democratic Party politics. Though she has rebutted criticism that
she failed to prosecute police misconduct, her record was scrutinized
during the presidential campaign and would quite likely have become a
major headache for Mr. Biden's campaign had he selected her as the
running mate.

One person she spoke with on Monday said Ms. Klobuchar relayed then that
she understood she would not be selected, and said she cited the
scrutiny of her record as prosecutor. A Klobuchar spokeswoman disputed
the recollection of the call.

Ms. Klobuchar's declaration that Mr. Biden should choose a woman of
color created something of an awkward political dynamic for Senator
Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another former presidential rival who
is being considered by Mr. Biden as a possible running mate. Ms. Warren
is the most prominent and formidable white candidate in the running, and
she is far along in the vetting process.

Other white candidates under consideration include Senator Tammy Baldwin
of Wisconsin, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gov. Gina Raimondo
of Rhode Island.

Asked by the MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell if her past record as a
prosecutor would have made it difficult for her to ``function'' as Mr.
Biden's running mate, Ms. Klobuchar said it was not a factor in her
decision.

``I think I could have functioned fine,'' she said. ``There's a lot of
untruths out there about my record and now is not the time to debate
them.''
