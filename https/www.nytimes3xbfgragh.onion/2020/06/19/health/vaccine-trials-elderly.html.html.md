Picture the day — in six months, a year and a half or in 2023 — when
university researchers or a pharmaceutical company announces a
breakthrough against the virus that causes Covid-19.

Maybe it’s a successful vaccine or an effective treatment, a discovery
that brings hope and relief — especially to the older adults most
vulnerable to the disease, eager to return to their pre-pandemic lives.

Imagine, however, that the researchers neglected to enroll many people
in their 70s or 80s in the clinical trials that established the
effectiveness of this treatment. As a result, it’s unclear how much the
treatment will benefit older people, what risks it might pose, or if the
dose that works for younger people is the best one for an older
population.

Could that really happen? Certainly there is [a long
history](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03032.x)
of older people being excluded from clinical trials, even when the
diseases in question disproportionately affected this group. They have
been underrepresented, for instance, in studies of [heart
disease](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.14833),
[cancer](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2003.08.010),
[diabetes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jgs.12215)
and
[osteoporosis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jgs.14840).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Ideally, the patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial reflect
the demographics of the disease,” said Dr. Mark Sloan, a hematologist
leading a Covid-19 drug study at Boston Medical Center, in an email.
“Unfortunately, this is seldom the case.”

Now, Dr. Sharon K. Inouye, a geriatrician at Harvard Medical School and
Hebrew SeniorLife, is sounding an alarm. She points out that in the race
to find drugs and vaccines to fight the pandemic — in which [80 percent
of
American](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex)
deaths have occurred in people over age 65 — a substantial proportion of
studies may be excluding older subjects, purposely or inadvertently.

“A year from now, when these trials are published, I don’t want to see
that there’s no one in them over 75,” she said. “If they create a drug
that works really well in healthy 50- and 60-year-olds, they’ve missed
the boat.”

She and her team have reviewed 241 interventional Covid-19 studies
undertaken in the United States and listed on clinicaltrials.gov, a site
maintained by a division of the National Institutes of Health.

They found that 37 of these trials — testing drugs, vaccines and devices
— set specific age limits and would not enroll participants older than
75, 80 or 85. A few even excluded those over 65.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another group of 27 trials set no maximum age but used study designs
that could nevertheless disqualify many older
adults.

Some excluded people with illnesses common among the older population,
like hypertension or diabetes, even if participants controlled the
disease through medication. “Surrogates for age exclusion,” Dr. Inouye
said.

In other cases, broad exclusion criteria gave the investigator
inordinate discretion. Dr. Inouye pointed to one trial barring subjects
with “any physical examination findings, and/or history of any illness,
concomitant medications or recent live vaccines that, in the opinion of
the study investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose
an additional risk to the participant.”

That allows investigators to exclude people for reasons ranging from
legitimate safety issues to the researchers’ own convenience. One
scenario that worried Dr. Inouye: “If you have an older adult who
appears hard of hearing, and it takes twice as long to explain the study
and obtain consent, the investigator just won’t do it.”

Other studies, relying on digital technology, might rule out people who
lack smartphones or the ability to use email.

Overall, when Dr. Inouye compiled preliminary results, which have not
yet been published, she found that about one-quarter of interventional
trials in the United States could exclude or underrepresent older
adults.

“To have them be this gravely impacted and not include them is immoral,”
said Dr. Louise Aronson, the author of the best-selling book “Elderhood”
and a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. “It
seems crazy.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In response to similar concerns, the N.I.H. began last year to require
the studies it funds to include “[individuals across the life
span,](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-116.html)”
unless investigators provide an “acceptable justification” for
exclusion. If they cannot, N.I.H. won’t award the grants.

“It’s a pretty visible guidepost, reflecting national standards,” Dr.
Aronson said. But most clinical trials are privately funded and need not
follow N.I.H. policy.

Although Dr. Inouye systematically reviewed only American trials, her
team also noticed age limits in Covid-19 studies in France, Italy,
China, Colombia and other countries, some set as low as age 60.

Whether such trials will actually exclude many older subjects probably
will not be clear for some time. Several investigators, asked about the
number of enrolled participants over age 80, said they were only
starting recruitment or could not yet provide data.

Some investigators might make accommodations. A study at the University
of California, San Francisco, for example, examining the use of the
antibiotic azithromycin, drew Dr. Inouye’s attention because
participants had to submit questionnaires online. But Catherine
Oldenburg, a co-principal investigator, explained in an email that
researchers would also allow participants to complete interviews by
phone or have a proxy submit the online
forms.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Still, the rush to learn more about the deadly coronavirus could
exacerbate the problem, because including older people can make research
slower, more complicated and more expensive.

In clinical trials, “you want to control as many factors as possible,”
Dr. Aronson said. Most older adults have other illnesses and take
multiple medications, so-called confounding variables that make it
difficult to distinguish the effects of the drug or vaccine being
studied.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Older people also suffer more side effects. “Nearly all drugs are less
toxic when given to younger, healthier people,” Dr. Sloan said in an
email. Focusing on them produces fewer adverse effects that must be
reported, “and thereby improves chances for F.D.A. approval.”

Physical disabilities, which make it harder for seniors to reach study
sites, or hearing and vision impairments requiring large-print forms or
audio amplification, can further decrease participation. Investigators
may need to take the extra step of obtaining family consent if a patient
is incapacitated.

“The same things that put you at higher risk for Covid make it harder to
study you,” Dr. Aronson said.

But that shouldn’t prevent researchers from incorporating the population
most at risk from the coronavirus. “If that’s the real-world scenario,
you’ve got to deal with it,” said Susan Peschin, the president of the
nonprofit Alliance for Aging Research.

The Alliance wants the F.D.A., which is now preparing guidance for
including [older adults in cancer
research](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/inclusion-older-adults-cancer-clinical-trials),
to issue guidelines covering all medical products for conditions that
primarily impact the elderly.

The F.D.A. has issued this kind of guidance as far back as 1993, and it
released additional guidelines in 2012 and again [last
year](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enhancing-diversity-clinical-trial-populations-eligibility-criteria-enrollment-practices-and-trial),
said Dr. Harpreet Singh, a division director at the agency’s Oncology
Center of Excellence — although such guidance is not legally binding or
enforceable.

Dr. Singh, a geriatrician and oncologist, acknowledged in an interview
that the agency could do more to promote the inclusion of seniors. And
when there is reason to suspect that trials are overlooking them, “it
should be called out and examined.”

That’s what Dr. Inouye has undertaken, although she worries that she may
be too late. Covid-19 studies already underway can still revamp their
criteria to include older participants — there are reliable strategies
to achieve that — but investigators are working at an accelerated pace,
under great pressure to produce results.

For researchers, the professional and financial stakes are high. But
they are even higher for older Americans.

“These are the people getting very ill from Covid and dying from it,”
Dr. Inouye said. “If people are genuinely committed to inclusion, let’s
do what we need to do.”
