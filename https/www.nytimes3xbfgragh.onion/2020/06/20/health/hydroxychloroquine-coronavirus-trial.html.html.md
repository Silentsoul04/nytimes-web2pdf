The National Institutes of Health said Saturday that it had stopped two
clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug that President
Trump promoted to treat and prevent the coronavirus, one because the
drug was unlikely to be effective and the other because not enough
patients signed up to participate.

The agency halted a trial that had aimed to enroll more than 500
patients after an independent oversight board determined that the drug
did not appear to benefit hospitalized patients. The same day, the
N.I.H. said it had closed another trial — of hydroxychloroquine and the
antibiotic azithromycin — because only about 20 patients had enrolled in
the planned study of 2,000 people.

The two trials the N.I.H. shut down represent the latest evidence that
hydroxychloroquine has not lived up to its early promise of fighting the
coronavirus.

[The N.I.H. said
Saturday](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-halts-clinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine)
that an independent oversight board that monitors safety met late Friday
to discuss the 500-patient trial and “determined that while there was no
harm, the study drug was very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized
patients with Covid-19,” the disease caused by the virus.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“In effect, the drug didn’t work,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a
professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
who was not involved in the research. “I think we can put this drug
aside and now devote our attention to other potential
treatments.”

Mr. Trump had called the drug a “game changer” and [took it
himself](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-coronavirus.html)
in hopes of protecting himself from infection with the coronavirus.
Drugmakers donated millions of doses to the federal stockpile, which
distributed them to hospitals around the country, where doctors with
[few other
options](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/health/trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html)
administered the drug to severely ill patients.

On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration [revoked the emergency
authorization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html)
it had granted to hospitals to give hydroxychloroquine and a related
drug, chloroquine, to patients. The agency said that the drugs were
unlikely to be effective and could carry potential risks.

While the N.I.H. said it did not identify safety concerns as part of its
review of the 500-patient trial, others have concluded that
hydroxychloroquine carries potential risks. This spring, the F.D.A.
issued a [warning that the drugs could cause dangerous heart arrhythmias
in Covid-19
patients.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html)

The planned trial, which was being run by the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute, a division of the N.I.H., had enrolled more than 470
patients when the study was stopped. The study sought to learn whether
the drug benefited hospitalized patients and those who visited the
emergency room, as well as people who were likely to be admitted to the
hospital. It was one of several placebo-controlled studies that had been
organized to test the drug after a series of small, poorly controlled
trials showed early signs of a benefit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The other trial that was halted, involving hydroxychloroquine and
azithromycin, was testing [whether the
drugs](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-begins-clinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin-treat-covid-19),
given together earlier in the disease, could prevent hospitalization and
death from Covid-19. That study, led by the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an arm of the N.I.H., “sought to fill
this knowledge gap by testing it in a randomized, placebo-controlled
trial — considered the gold standard for determining whether an
intervention can benefit patients,” [the agency said in a
statement](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/bulletin-nih-clinical-trial-evaluating-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-covid-19).

The agency said it did not find any safety problems, but concluded that
the recent decision by the F.D.A. to revoke its emergency authorization
of hydroxychloroquine “could further dampen enthusiasm for enrollment in
studies evaluating these drugs.”

Several other large trials of hydroxychloroquine have been stopped or
have not shown the drug to be effective.

“No surprise,” said Dr. David R. Boulware, an infectious disease
specialist at the University of Minnesota, who is studying
hydroxychloroquine as a preventive and an early treatment against the
coronavirus. He said the evidence is increasingly clear that the drug
does not work in hospitalized patients. “Whether there is any benefit
for pre-exposure prophylaxis or early treatment is as yet unknown, but
the role of hydroxychloroquine — if any — appears increasingly
doubtful.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

On Wednesday, the [World Health Organization
said](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments)
it was stopping the hydroxychloroquine arm of a large clinical trial
that is testing several treatments against the virus because evidence —
[including results from a large
study](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19)
in the United Kingdom — showed it did not reduce mortality rates of
hospitalized patients.

And on Friday, the Swiss drugmaker [Novartis said it was halting its
clinical
trial](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/06/19/world/europe/19reuters-health-coronavirus-novartis-hydroxychloroquine.html)
because it could not recruit enough patients to sign up. Only a handful
enrolled even though the company had planned for a study involving 440
people.

Other researchers are still studying whether hydroxychloroquine could be
used earlier in the course of the illness, or to prevent people from
getting infected from the virus. While some of those studies are still
underway, [one such trial — led by Dr. Boulware — concluded earlier this
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html)
that hydroxychloroquine was not effective in preventing infections after
someone had been exposed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That trial included 821 people and looked at whether those who were
exposed to the virus, such as health care workers or family members of
people who had been infected, were less or more likely to be infected
themselves if they were given the drug. It found that there was not a
meaningful difference.
