Lil Baby began his rap career reluctantly, but in just three years has
grown into an evocative and consistent hitmaker. His second studio
album, ``My Turn,'' topped the Billboard album chart on two separate

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/arts/music/playlist-lil-baby-6ix9ine-nicki-minaj.html}{recently
released ``The Bigger Picture,''} among the best of the recent spate of
protest songs. It marked a high point in his evolution from
