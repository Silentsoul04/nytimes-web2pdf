New York City’s ambitious contact-tracing program, a crucial initiative
in the effort to curb the coronavirus, has gotten off to a worrisome
start just as the city’s [reopening enters a new phase on
Monday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/nyregion/phase-2-reopening-nyc.html),
with outdoor dining, in-store shopping and office work resuming.

The city has hired 3,000 disease detectives and case monitors, who are
supposed to identify anyone who has come into contact with the hundreds
of people who are still testing positive for the virus in the city every
day. But the first statistics from the program, which began on June 1,
indicate that tracers are often unable to locate infected people or
gather information from them.

Only 35 percent of the 5,347 city residents who tested positive or were
presumed positive for the coronavirus in the program’s first two weeks
gave information about close contacts to tracers, the city said in
releasing the first statistics. The number ticked up slightly, to 42
percent, during the third week, Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman to Mayor Bill
de Blasio, said on Sunday.

Contact tracing is one of the few tools that public health officials
have to fight Covid-19 in lieu of a vaccine, along with widespread
testing and isolation of those exposed to the coronavirus. The early
results of New York’s program raise fresh concerns about the
difficulties in preventing a surge of new cases as states across the
country reopen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The city has successfully done contact tracing before, with diseases
like tuberculosis and measles. But as with much involving the
coronavirus outbreak, officials have never faced the challenge at this
scale, with so many cases across the five boroughs.

The city’s program has so far been limited by a low response rate, scant
use of technology, privacy concerns and a far less sweeping mandate than
that in some other countries, where apartment buildings, stores,
restaurants and other private businesses are often required to collect
visitors’ personal information, which makes tracking the spread easier.

China, South Korea and Germany and other countries have set up extensive
tracking programs that have helped officials make major strides in
reducing the outbreak. In South Korea, for example, [people at weddings,
funerals, karaoke bars, nightclubs and internet-game parlors write
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-second-wave.html)
their names and telephone numbers, and the authorities have been able to
draw on cellphone location data, credit card transactions and even
closed-circuit video footage to identify and isolate potential contacts.

Dr. Ted Long, head of New York City’s new [Test and Trace
Corps](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/test-and-trace/), insisted
that the program was going well, but acknowledged that many people who
tested positive had failed to provide information over the phone to the
contact tracers, or left interviews before being asked. Others told the
tracers they had been only at home and had not put others at risk, and
then did not name family members.

Dr. Long said one encouraging sign was that nearly all the people for
whom the city had numbers at least answered the phone. He added that he
believed that the tracers would be more successful when they start going
to people’s homes in the next week or two, rather than just relying on
communication over the phone.

The city has made major strides in reducing the outbreak since the
shutdown began in March, [with only 327 new cases reported on
Thursday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/nyregion/new-york-city-coronavirus-cases.html#cases),
down from several thousand cases a day during the peak. But Phase 2 of
the reopening on Monday presents new risks, with 300,000 people likely
returning to their jobs.

Perry N. Halkitis, dean of the School of Public Health at Rutgers
University, which is guiding an effort to bring on thousands of tracers
in New Jersey, called New York City’s 35 percent rate for eliciting
contacts “very
bad.”

“For each person, you should be in touch with [75 percent of their
contacts](https://covidlocal.org/assets/documents/COVID%20Local%20Metrics%20overview.pdf)
within a day,” he said.

He suggested that the poor showing stemmed in part from the inexperience
of the contact tracers and insufficient hands-on training.

“This is a skill,” he said. “You need to practice.”

Across the world, the authorities have rushed to set up contact-tracing
programs, hiring hundreds of thousands of people, including many without
experience doing such work. While the goal is to reach all of a sick
person’s contacts, and get them to effectively quarantine for two weeks,
the reality is often much messier.

In Massachusetts, which has one of the most established tracing programs
in the country, health officials said in May that only[about 60
percent](https://www.boston25news.com/news/health/more-than-60-percent-mass-contact-tracing-calls-answered/4NK2EEGVEVCDFBMICEKZXFCXR4/)
of infected patients were picking up the phone. In
[Louisiana](https://www.governing.com/now/Louisiana-Struggles-to-Get-Contact-Tracer-Calls-Answered.html),
less than half were answering. In England, the program has struggled to
[show results with a low-paid, inexperienced work
force](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/world/europe/uk-contact-tracing-coronavirus.html).

An[increasing number of
countries](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-contact-tracing-apps-launch-across-europe-amid-hopes-for-broad-adoption-11592319612)
are using phone applications to help track and trace people who test
positive. Several states in the United States, including North Dakota,
that have tried using digital applications have [run into privacy
issues](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/21/care19-dakota-privacy-coronavirus/).

But in New York, as in most of the country, contact tracers are
typically using only low-tech tools like phone calls and a
questionnaire, in part to allay privacy concerns.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The tracers are seeking the names and phone numbers of each person a
confirmed-positive patient has been in close contact with from a few
days before the onset of symptoms, defined as within six feet for at
least 15 minutes. Each contact is then called, told that he or she may
have been exposed to the virus, and asked to quarantine.

The relative silence from virus patients in New York City is one of
several issues troubling the contact-tracing program.

Mr. de Blasio, who has had tense relations with senior officials in his
own Department of Health, stripped the department of oversight for the
program in May, moving it [under the umbrella of the city’s public
hospitals
agency](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/nyregion/coronavirus-contact-tracing-nyc.html).
That has led to concerns among some former health officials that
expertise would be lost in the process.

Dr. Long said 50 experts from the Department of Health — the city’s
contact tracers before Covid-19, who have handled epidemics such as
measles and Ebola — are guiding the work of the tracing corps, but are
not tracing themselves.

Dr. Long is a primary care physician and vice president of ambulatory
care at the public hospitals corporation. The Health Department’s
tracing effort was led by
[epidemiologists](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/sa3217).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I challenge anyone to show me how we are not collaborating,” he said of
the relationship between the two agencies. “They have been nothing short
of partners.”

The city has had more success with its testing program, which is ahead
of schedule, with a target of 50,000 tests per day expected to be
reached in July, instead of August, officials said.

But an initiative to set aside hotel rooms for people who have tested
positive to isolate from families is not popular. Though the city rented
1,200 hotel rooms for free use by virus patients, only 60 to 80 rooms
have been occupied in recent weeks, city officials said. And in the two
and a half weeks since tracing began, only 40 patients have requested
rooms through the tracing program, Dr. Long
said.

Over 1,000 virus patients have instead asked for support to isolate at
home, such as assistance with grocery and medicine deliveries, because
they preferred to remain with their families, he said.

In an effort to build a connection between contacts and tracers, half of
all tracers hired live in communities hard-hit by the virus, which are
predominately black and Hispanic, Dr. Long
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an

        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Sivanthy Vasanthan, 23, who just graduated from Columbia University’s
Mailman School of Public Health, said recruiters reached out to her
based on her [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sivanthyvasanthan/)
profile, which emphasizes her interest in public health and human
rights.

After about two weeks of training, Ms. Vasanthan, who lives in
Manhattan’s Washington Heights neighborhood, began calling positive
patients just over a week ago. “Most of the people who I have talked to
have already been aware of their test results and have been at home,”
she said.

The city gave no metrics for whether it was successfully persuading
those contacted to get tested or to quarantine.

Experts said that while tracing in the city was not where it should be,
the program was clearly beneficial and should push forward.

“It’s tough to look at these numbers and say it’s a roaring success,”
said Dr. Crystal Watson, an expert on contact tracing at the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “But I do think it is a
beginning and it will build on itself.”

Dr. Halkitis at Rutgers said he thought the low cooperation rate was
likely due to several factors, including the inexperience of the
tracers; widespread reluctance among Americans to share personal
information with the government; and Mayor de Blasio’s decision to shift
the program away from the city’s Department of Health.

“You have taken it away from the people who actually know how to do it,”
he said. “The D.O.H. people, they are skilled. They know this stuff.”

On Tuesday, the city laid out strategies to close the gap in tracing.
For the 15 percent of positive cases that have come in without an
accurate phone number, Dr. Long said, tracers have begun reaching out to
doctor’s offices and doing database research to get that information.

And for people who have tested positive and are unresponsive to phone
calls, field workers like Daniel Okpare, a public health student in East
Harlem, will soon try to interview them in person.

Mr. Okpare, 30, is still in training, but has been told he will mostly
be visiting patients in Harlem, near where he lives. He said he hoped
[his background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/domph/) as a former
podiatry student who is enrolled in New York University’s School of
Global Public Health, as well as his being an immigrant from Nigeria,
would help put people at ease.

Wearing personal protective equipment, and carrying a city-issued iPad
and a cellphone, he will be working alone while knocking on doors.

“It’s an opportunity to be part of the front line of response as a
public health professional,” he said. “To have eye contact with someone
to say, ‘Yes you have Covid, but we are going to find every way possible
that you will be safe.’”
