# Behind Joe Biden’s Evolution on L.G.B.T.Q. Rights

Mr. Biden’s support for same-sex marriage in 2012 was a reversal for him
and a watershed moment in his shift — and the nation’s — on L.G.B.T.Q.
issues.

[Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, blocking federal
recognition of same-sex marriages. Two years earlier, he
[voted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1994/08/02/us/senate-backs-cuts-for-schools-that-endorse-homosexuality.html)
to cut off federal funds to schools that teach the acceptance of
homosexuality. In 1973, Mr. Biden, in [an off-handed
response](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/53510488/the-morning-news/) to
a question, wondered if homosexuals in the military or government were
potential security risks.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But today, Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president,
has so completely identified himself with positions embraced by
L.G.B.T.Q. leaders that his history on gay rights has faded into the
mist. If he is elected president, said Chad Griffin, a political
consultant and longtime gay rights leader, Mr. Biden, the former vice
president, will be the “most pro-equality president we have ever had.”

Mr. Biden’s evolution was on vivid display last week as he celebrated
the [Supreme Court
decision](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/us/gay-transgender-workers-supreme-court.html)
protecting L.G.B.T.Q. workers from job discrimination. So were his
differences with [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html),
who barely acknowledged the ruling, and the Republican National
Committee, which is holding over the [party
platform](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/us/politics/republican-platform.html)
from 2016 that still opposes same-sex marriage and supports so-called
conversion therapy for L.G.B.T.Q. youth.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Biden’s shifting views over the course of his political career
illustrate the extent to which the Democratic Party has changed as it
sought to keep pace with Americans, especially younger ones, who have
dismissed traditional stances on issues like same-sex marriage. Mr.
Biden has managed to not only keep pace with these evolving views, but
on same-sex marriage, he was a step ahead of many of his fellow
Democrats.

This has been the case despite the nuances of his record over the past
50 years, his centrist politics in a party that is moving to the left
and his age. Mr. Biden, 77, grew up in an era when homosexuality, the
word routinely used at the time, was often viewed as a sin and even a
crime.

He can slip into dated generalizations about gay and lesbian life, as he
did in an interview with Anderson Cooper at an L.G.B.T.Q. town hall
event on CNN last year. Talking about what San Francisco was like “15,
20 years ago,” he said that the city, with its large community of gay
men and lesbians, was “all about, well, you know, gay bathhouses,”
adding, “It’s all about round-the-clock sex.”

He has repeatedly told a story, recounted with variations on details of
the moment, of seeing two men kiss when he was a teenager and his father
saying: “Joey, it’s simple. They love each other.”

For all of the current unease with him on the left, Mr. Biden was the
highest-ranking Democrat to initially endorse same-sex marriage —
disclosing his position in a [television
interview](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/05/07/us/politics/biden-expresses-support-for-same-sex-marriages.html)
in May 2012 that helped prod President Barack Obama to take the same
position [in an
interview](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/05/10/us/politics/obama-says-same-sex-marriage-should-be-legal.html)
a few days later.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There’s no political barometer that would have told him to get ahead of
the White House on this,” said Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South
Bend, Ind., who is gay and ran against Mr. Biden for the Democratic
presidential
nomination.

But in voting for the Defense of Marriage Act, a bill that was passed
with overwhelming support from both parties and signed by President Bill
Clinton, Mr. Biden, then a Delaware senator, lent his name to
legislation that came to be known as one of the biggest legislative
setbacks for the gay rights movement in its history. His musing about
gay men and lesbians as security risks in 1973, and his support for a
measure restricting how homosexuality was presented to schoolchildren,
reflects the kind of attitudes that gay and lesbian activists had to
battle during the early decades of the movement.

“Did Joe Biden evolve on the issue of marriage like most of the rest of
the country?” said Sarah McBride, a longtime transgender activist who
grew up in Delaware and was close to Mr. Biden’s late son, Beau Biden.
“Yes. Frankly, we should want leaders with big minds and open hearts
who are willing to evolve and, in the case of Joe Biden, bring the
country along.”

Evan Wolfson, who founded the advocacy group Freedom to Marry and was a
leader in the campaign for same-sex marriage, said his organization had
specifically sought Mr. Biden’s backing, saying that he had over the
years shown a willingness to hear arguments and to change his thinking.

“When people criticize him as not being the most liberal, the most
progressive, the candidate they might have first wanted and so on, he
will find a principled center-left place and move toward it,” Mr.
Wolfson said.

“He voted wrong on that in the ’90s,” Mr. Wolfson said of Mr. Biden’s
support of the Defense of Marriage Act. “But he never spoke in
discriminatory ways, and he kept his mind and heart open.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump’s administration, by contrast, urged the Supreme Court,
unsuccessfully, not to extend the 1964 Civil Rights Act’s protections
against workplace discrimination to gay and transgender people. This
month, the administration [moved to roll back
protections](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights.html)
for transgender people against discrimination by doctors, hospitals and
health insurance companies. And his administration has repeatedly
nominated federal judges with records opposing L.G.B.T.Q. rights.

Still, Mr. Biden’s own history on gay rights — along with calling Mike
Pence, the conservative vice president, a [“decent
guy”](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/joe-biden-mike-pence-decent-guy-criticize-respond/index.html)
— made him vulnerable to criticism from the left as he sought the
Democratic presidential nomination.

“As queer people, we abhor the way that Biden, in his eagerness to reach
across the aisle, winds up being an apologist for homophobes like Mike
Pence,” Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist who challenged Andrew M.
Cuomo in 2018 for the Democratic nomination for governor in New York,
said in a statement. “But we also remember how powerful an ally he was
as vice president, and how instrumental he was in pulling Obama to the
right place in a way few people could have.”

During the Democratic presidential primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders
of Vermont invoked Mr. Biden’s vote on the Defense of Marriage Act to
paint him as out of touch with today’s Democratic Party.

“I cast a vote against the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, which was
a homophobic act brought by the right wing,” Mr. Sanders [said on the
ABC program “This
Week”](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-20-sen-bernie-sanders-dr-ben/story?id=69465733)
in March. “Back then, it was not an easy vote. Joe voted for it.”

Mr. Biden has suggested that his vote was a way of precluding a
constitutional amendment against same-sex
marriage.

[In 2006](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13085904/ns/meet_the_press/t/transcript-june/),
Mr. Biden said “marriage is between a man and a woman,” and [in his 2008
vice-presidential
debate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/elections/2008/president/debates/transcripts/vice-presidential-debate.html)
with Sarah Palin, he asserted that he opposed “redefining from a civil
side what constitutes marriage.” But his later decision to jump out
front on same-sex marriage erased, for the most part, concerns
L.G.B.T.Q. leaders had about those statements and his vote on the
Defense of Marriage Act, particularly given Mr. Trump’s record.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If we established purity tests for elected officials, nobody would
pass,” said Emily Hecht-McGowan, who served as director for L.G.B.T.Q.
equality at the Biden Foundation, a nonprofit group, until it was
disbanded in 2019 when he began his presidential run. “If we keep
holding up our elected officials to these purity tests, we will never
grow us a nation.”

Mr. Griffin, the political consultant, said he was not bothered by the
Defense of Marriage Act vote that, he noted, was “25, 26 years ago, when
I was 19 years old and still in the closet.”

“Joe Biden has had 25 years since then to establish his own record and
legacy,” he said. “I do not think that anyone can define Joe Biden by a
vote 25 years ago when he has literally spent more than a decade
championing L.G.B.T.Q. rights.”

From the first weeks after the riots at the Stonewall Inn and the start
of the modern-day gay rights movement, L.G.B.T.Q. leaders called for gay
men and lesbians to come out. The explicit strategy was that increased
visibility — as family members, co-workers, civic leaders, celebrities —
would lead to more acceptance by the general public. One of Mr. Biden’s
grandchildren identifies as L.G.B.T.Q., an aide said.

Ms. McBride said that Mr. Biden grieved with her after her husband died
at the age of 28; Mr. Biden had just lost his own son. He has officiated
at two gay weddings, including in 2017 when Henry R. Muñoz III, who was
then the Democratic National Committee’s finance chairman, married his
husband at Mr. Biden’s home at the time in Northern Virginia.

“He let me work alongside of him to push people in the administration on
marriage equality, and then he married me,” Mr. Muñoz said.

The moment that elevated Mr. Biden’s standing among gay and lesbian
activists was his appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” as vice president
in 2012 when, in response to a question, he said he supported same-sex
marriage. His response, which aides said was not calculated or planned,
blindsided the White House and Mr. Obama, who had not yet staked out
that position.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Given that he was a moderate Democrat with strong ties to blue-collar
workers, that response changed the contours of the discussion and, in
the view of many activists, emboldened other elected officials to jump
on as well. Ms. Hecht-McGowan said she was campaigning in a pitched, and
ultimately successful, battle on an initiative permitting same-sex
marriage in Maryland.

“He created this watershed moment for the movement,” Ms. Hecht-McGowan
said. “I believe that moment was the tipping point for the movement on
marriage. He did what he needed to do.”

It seems clear that whatever reservations L.G.B.T.Q. leaders have had
