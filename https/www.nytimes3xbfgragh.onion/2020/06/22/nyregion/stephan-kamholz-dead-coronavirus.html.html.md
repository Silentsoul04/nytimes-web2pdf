# Stephan L. Kamholz, Chair of Medicine at Maimonides Hospital, Dies at 72

</div>

Dr. Kamholz was working hard on the front lines of a Brooklyn hospital
swamped by the coronavirus. Then the virus got him.

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

Dr. Stephan L. Kamholz was 72, in a high risk group for the coronavirus,
but when the pandemic hit Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, where
he was chair of medicine, he got busy on the front lines.

He ordered extra oxygen tanks and ventilators and helped orchestrate a
doubling of the hospital’s capacity. He taught residents in small groups
because big lectures were too dangerous. It was a precarious
environment, especially for someone his age, but it was where Dr.
Kamholz thrived.

And then in April, his role changed. He became a patient in his own
hospital, felled by the pandemic he was trying to combat.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He spent his last eight weeks continuing to teach,” this time from his
bed as a patient, said his daughter Sandra Kamholz Oza, an internist at
Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. As someone infected with the
virus, he served as a new kind of instructor for doctors and nurses
learning how to treat a novel disease, she said. “They learned to care
for someone who was critically ill. He was teaching up until his last
breath.”

That came on June 11, in the hospital where he had worked since 2013.

His wife, Rosemary Kamholz, a retired nurse, said it was not clear how
or where he contracted the virus. “But my guess is that he caught it at
work,” she said. “He was very hands-on.”

Though doctors and nurses in the hospital were getting sick, especially
in the first few weeks, he never considered not going to work, his
daughter said. “My dad would never say to his staff, ‘I want you to
assume this risk, but I won’t assume it myself.’” As chair of medicine,
he was the physician leader for most of the hospital’s divisions.

Stephan Leonard Kamholz was born on Oct. 16, 1947, in Manhattan, and
grew up in Bayside, Queens, the only child of Sidney and Sylvia Kamholz,
a podiatrist and secretary. He attended New York University’s old Bronx
campus, graduating in 1968, and went on to the New York Medical College,
then on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, graduating in 1972.

He chose pulmonology as his specialty, and while serving his fellowship
at Montefiore Medical Center, met Rosemary Potucek, who was the
supervisor of inpatient services for the department.

“He was really cute,” she said. They married in 1978.

Along with his wife and daughter, Dr. Kamholz is survived by a son,
Roger, and another daughter, Sheryl Neufeld, and five grandchildren.

Dr. Kamholz moved through supervisory roles at several hospitals before
arriving at Maimonides, where he was known, among other things, for his
superb memory, citing page numbers and paragraph numbers when doctors
asked him medical questions.

Maimonides, in Brooklyn, was a one-hour drive from his home in
Thornwood, N.Y., in Westchester County, and he taught himself Italian on
his daily commute, adding to his knowledge of French, German and some
Creole.

He was also learning to fly single-engine planes, working toward his
commercial pilot’s license. A conscientious flyer, he worked the daily
wind conditions into his casual conversations.

“He worried a lot,” Ms. Kamholz said. “Flying was his place where he
went to get away from the things he worried about.”

Then he would go back to his worries, because they were his life’s work,
his family said.

On one thing he was clear. “He never, ever, ever wanted to retire,” Ms.
Kamholz said.
