*A rally fizzles, and Confederate monuments keep falling. It’s Monday,
and this is your politics tip sheet.*

## Where things stand

  - **6,200. That was the total attendance at President Trump’s**
    **[rally](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-rally-portsmouth-new-hampshire.html)**
    in Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday, according to the Fire Department.
    Before the event, his campaign manager had announced close to one
    million sign-ups, and the president was anticipating an overflow
    crowd. Instead, at his first major rally since the onset of the
    pandemic, [Trump spoke to an arena that wasn’t even half
    full](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html).
    He was [stunned by the lack of
    turnout](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/us/politics/trump-tulsa-rally.html),
    advisers said.

  - Hundreds — if not thousands — of young people with no intention of
    actually attending the rally [organized online to sign up for
    tickets as a
    prank](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html),
    aiming to inflate turnout expectations. Representative Alexandria
    Ocasio-Cortez
    [wrote](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1274499021625794565?s=20) on
    Twitter that the Trump campaign “just got ROCKED by teens on
    TikTok.” Steve Schmidt, the Republican strategist turned Trump
    foe,
    [tweeted](https://twitter.com/SteveSchmidtSES/status/1274486428160811009):
    “The teens of America have struck a savage blow against
    @realDonaldTrump.”

  - [Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/style/trump-tulsa-tie.html)
    and Vice President Mike Pence had planned to give warm-up speeches
    to the overflow crowd outside, but ultimately there was none. Trump
    campaign officials sought to downplay the importance of all those
    empty arena seats (colored blue, in a poetic twist), saying that
    potential attendees had been scared off by the fear that protesters
    would confront them.

  - But on “[Fox News
    Sunday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-7CJFzazUQ),” the anchor
    Chris Wallace was hearing none of it. “He didn’t fill an arena last
    night,” Wallace told Mercedes Schlapp, a Trump campaign adviser.
    “Watching the coverage and talking to Mark Meredith on the ground
    today, protesters did not stop people from coming to that rally,”
    Wallace added, referring to a Fox correspondent.

  - **Public health experts on Sunday flatly rejected Trump’s argument**
    that the coronavirus is “fading away,” as he stated last week while
    seeking to ease fears in the run-up to his rally. Speaking on a
    variety of political talk shows, top academics and former government
    officials said [there was no sign that the virus was meaningfully
    slowing its
    spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/health/coronavirus-pandemic-spread-trump.html).

  - They warned that a more unified national policy was needed to
    contain it, and they rejected Trump’s suggestion that more testing
    had artificially inflated the number of confirmed cases.

  - “I don’t see this slowing down for the summer or into the fall,”
    Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease
    Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said on NBC’s
    “Meet the Press.” “I think this is more like a forest fire,” he
    added. “I think that wherever there’s wood to burn, this fire is
    going to burn it.”

  - **Joe Biden is deep into his search for a running mate**, and The
    Times’s **[Alexander
    Burns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/alexander-burns)** has
    a new guide to the veepstakes out this morning, profiling a dozen
    women who are under serious consideration. [Click here to see who’s
    near the top of the
    list.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html)

<!-- end list -->

  - **The career-life expectancy of federal officials investigating
    Trump continues to fall.** Trump on Saturday fired Geoffrey Berman,
    a federal prosecutor whose office has investigated some of the
    president’s closest associates. Recently Berman’s team had been
    turning up the heat in their investigation of Rudy Giuliani, the
    president’s personal lawyer.

  - On Friday, William Barr, the attorney general, sought to oust Berman
    and replace him with a Trump ally. But Berman refused to resign from
    his position as the attorney for the Southern District of New York.
    [That prompted Trump to fire him, while appearing to offer a
    concession](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/nyregion/trump-geoffrey-berman-fired-sdny.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage):
    For now, Berman will be replaced by his own deputy, Audrey Strauss.

  - In a statement, Berman said he felt confident that Strauss “will
    continue to safeguard” the Southern District of New York’s “enduring
    tradition of integrity and independence.”

<!-- end list -->

  - **In what could be a preview of things to come in Washington**,
    [negotiations in the Minnesota State Legislature over sweeping
    police reform fell apart on
    Saturday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/us/minnesota-police-george-floyd.html).
    The Democratic-controlled House had passed a bill that would
    increase police accountability; give Keith Ellison, the state’s
    Democratic attorney general, the power to prosecute police killings;
    and restore voting rights to tens of thousands of convicted felons.

  - But Republicans argued that it went too far, and proposed a
    less-ambitious bill including what they called “common-sense police
    reforms.” Democrats said most of those proposals were already in
    place in most Minnesota police departments. At an impasse, the
    Legislature adjourned early Saturday morning after Republicans
    refused to keep negotiating.

  - Tim Walz, the Democratic governor, faulted them for failing to work
    out a deal. “I’m really, really worried the message this sends to
    all those tens of thousands of protesters who were on the streets,
    all those families and all those people across Minnesota and across
    the country that expected this one was going to be different,” Walz
    said.

  - **At protests around the country, monuments and homages to figures**
    associated with the legacy of white supremacy are being taken down
    at a rapid clip. Sometimes they’re defaced or torn down by
    protesters, and sometimes they’re removed on official orders. In
    Raleigh, N.C., Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor, ordered a number
    of Confederate monuments removed from the State Capitol grounds over
    the weekend.

  - [The American Museum of Natural History and the New York City
    government have
    agreed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/arts/design/roosevelt-statue-to-be-removed-from-museum-of-natural-history.html?auth=login-google&amp;smid=tw-share)
    to remove a statue from the museum’s entrance featuring Theodore
    Roosevelt on horseback, flanked by a Native American man and an
    African man.

  - [Where do monuments go once they’ve been taken down by
    officials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/confederate-statues-monuments-removal.html)?
    As of late last week, 106 Confederate symbols and monuments had been
    ordered removed since 2015; most end up in storage, according to a
    representative of the Southern Poverty Law
Center.

## How did Joe Biden become an L.G.B.T.Q. ally?

Joe Biden is not typically thought of as a progressive agitator, but in
recent years he has accrued a reputation as something of a champion of
L.G.B.T.Q. rights.

That wasn’t always so: As **[Adam
Nagourney](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/adam-nagourney)** ****
and **** **[Thomas
Kaplan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/thomas-kaplan)** ****
write [in a new
article](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/us/politics/biden-gay-rights-lgbt.html),
Biden typically voted with most fellow Democrats during his decades in
the Senate, which sometimes meant casting votes that now appear
retrograde in today’s Democratic Party.

Adam agreed to answer a few questions for us about how Biden’s positions
have evolved — and what gay-rights activists expect from a possible
Biden administration.

**Hi, Adam. If you were to look only at Joe Biden’s Senate record, you
wouldn’t get the sense that he was a big leader on L.G.B.T.Q. issues.
But in recent years he has often been ahead of the Democratic Party
consensus. How do you explain that shift?**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s always tough to get at exactly why politicians change their
positions over time. Often, it reflects political accommodation,
preparing for an upcoming campaign. (Case in point: [President Bill
Clinton signing the Defense of Marriage
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/03/26/us/politics/bill-clintons-decision-and-regret-on-defense-of-marriage-act.html),
barring federal recognition of same-sex marriages, in September 1996 — a
bill that Biden, along with most Democrats, supported.)

But it’s hard to see what Biden had to gain in 2012 when he stepped out
in front of President Barack Obama [to announce his support for same-sex
marriage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/05/07/us/politics/biden-expresses-support-for-same-sex-marriages.html).
“There’s no political barometer that would have told him to get ahead of
the White House on this,” Pete Buttigieg, who is gay and ran for
president this year, told us.

But societal views on these kinds of issues were beginning to change.
Biden was very much part of that wave — and when it came to the
Democratic Party, ahead of much of it.

**Tell us more about that moment. Was it just an example of Biden being
characteristically loose-lipped — or was it a reflection of a consistent
role he played in the administration, as a proponent of L.G.B.T.Q.
rights?**

Obama and his White House were caught off-guard by this. They were, in
fact, angered by the notion that Biden was trying to pre-empt the
president on the issue, or even that he was trying to maneuver Obama to
— I guess we shouldn’t say come out of the closet on the issue, should
we? Well, just did. Biden’s aides initially issued a statement
suggesting that he had been misunderstood, but he soon made clear that
he wasn’t.

This is one of those cases where he was asked a question, had a view on
the question, and answered it.

**In this year’s Democratic primary, Biden wasn’t the first choice of
most progressives, but he seemed to have generally earned the trust of
many L.G.B.T.Q. rights advocates. Would you say there is true excitement
there about his candidacy?**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Support for him among L.G.B.T.Q. leaders is really high; we heard it
again and again in our interviews. He might not have been their first
choice — though in many cases he was — but there is no ambivalence about
his candidacy. Chad Griffin, a longtime gay-rights leader, said Biden
would be the “most pro-equality president we have ever had.” Did we
mention that he’s running against Trump?
