  \textbf{6,200. That was the total attendance at President Trump's}
  \textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-rally-portsmouth-new-hampshire.html}{rally}}
  in Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday, according to the Fire Department. Before
  the event, his campaign manager had announced close to one million
  sign-ups, and the president was anticipating an overflow crowd.
  Instead, at his first major rally since the onset of the pandemic,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html}{Trump
  spoke to an arena that wasn't even half full}. He was
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/us/politics/trump-tulsa-rally.html}{stunned
  by the lack of turnout}, advisers said.
\item
  Hundreds --- if not thousands --- of young people with no intention of
  actually attending the rally
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html}{organized
  online to sign up for tickets as a prank}, aiming to inflate turnout
  expectations. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
  \href{https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1274499021625794565?s=20}{wrote}
  on Twitter that the Trump campaign ``just got ROCKED by teens on
  TikTok.'' Steve Schmidt, the Republican strategist turned Trump foe,
  \href{https://twitter.com/SteveSchmidtSES/status/1274486428160811009}{tweeted}:
  ``The teens of America have struck a savage blow against
  @realDonaldTrump.''
\item
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/style/trump-tulsa-tie.html}{Trump}
  and Vice President Mike Pence had planned to give warm-up speeches to
  the overflow crowd outside, but ultimately there was none. Trump
  campaign officials sought to downplay the importance of all those
  empty arena seats (colored blue, in a poetic twist), saying that
  potential attendees had been scared off by the fear that protesters
  would confront them.
\item
  But on ``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-7CJFzazUQ}{Fox News
  Sunday},'' the anchor Chris Wallace was hearing none of it. ``He
  didn't fill an arena last night,'' Wallace told Mercedes Schlapp, a
  Trump campaign adviser. ``Watching the coverage and talking to Mark
  Meredith on the ground today, protesters did not stop people from
  coming to that rally,'' Wallace added, referring to a Fox
  correspondent.
\item
  \textbf{Public health experts on Sunday flatly rejected Trump's
  argument} that the coronavirus is ``fading away,'' as he stated last
  week while seeking to ease fears in the run-up to his rally. Speaking
  on a variety of political talk shows, top academics and former
  government officials said
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/health/coronavirus-pandemic-spread-trump.html}{there
  was no sign that the virus was meaningfully slowing its spread}.
\item
  They warned that a more unified national policy was needed to contain
  it, and they rejected Trump's suggestion that more testing had
  artificially inflated the number of confirmed cases.
\item
  ``I don't see this slowing down for the summer or into the fall,''
  Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease
  Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said on NBC's
  ``Meet the Press.'' ``I think this is more like a forest fire,'' he
  added. ``I think that wherever there's wood to burn, this fire is
  going to burn it.''
\item
  \textbf{Joe Biden is deep into his search for a running mate}, and The
  Times's
  \textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/alexander-burns}{Alexander
  Burns}} has a new guide to the veepstakes out this morning, profiling
  a dozen women who are under serious consideration.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{The career-life expectancy of federal officials investigating
  Trump continues to fall.} Trump on Saturday fired~Geoffrey Berman, a
  federal prosecutor whose office has investigated some of the
  president's closest associates. Recently Berman's team had been
  turning up the heat in their investigation of Rudy Giuliani, the
  president's personal lawyer.
\item
  On Friday, William Barr, the attorney general, sought to oust Berman
  and replace him with a Trump ally. But Berman refused to resign from
  his position as the attorney for the Southern District of New York.
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/nyregion/trump-geoffrey-berman-fired-sdny.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{That
  prompted Trump to fire him, while appearing to offer a concession}:
  For now, Berman will be replaced by his own deputy, Audrey Strauss.
\item
  In a statement, Berman said he felt confident that Strauss ``will
  continue to safeguard'' the Southern District of New York's ``enduring
  tradition of integrity and independence.''
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{In what could be a preview of things to come in Washington},
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/us/minnesota-police-george-floyd.html}{negotiations
  in the Minnesota State Legislature over sweeping police reform fell
  apart on Saturday}. The Democratic-controlled House had passed a bill
  that would increase police accountability; give Keith Ellison, the
  state's Democratic attorney general, the power to prosecute police
  killings; and restore voting rights to tens of thousands of convicted
  felons.
\item
  But Republicans argued that it went too far, and proposed a
  less-ambitious bill including what they called ``common-sense police
  reforms.'' Democrats said most of those proposals were already in
  place in most Minnesota police departments. At an impasse, the
  Legislature adjourned early Saturday morning after Republicans refused
  to keep negotiating.
\item
  Tim Walz, the Democratic governor, faulted them for failing to work
  out a deal. ``I'm really, really worried the message this sends to all
  those tens of thousands of protesters who were on the streets, all
  those families and all those people across Minnesota and across the
  country that expected this one was going to be different,'' Walz said.
\item
  \textbf{At protests around the country, monuments and homages to
  figures} associated with the legacy of white supremacy are being taken
  down at a rapid clip. Sometimes they're defaced or torn down by
  protesters, and sometimes they're removed on official orders. In
  Raleigh, N.C., Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor, ordered a number
  of Confederate monuments removed from the State Capitol grounds over
  the weekend.
\item
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/arts/design/roosevelt-statue-to-be-removed-from-museum-of-natural-history.html?auth=login-google\&smid=tw-share}{The
  American Museum of Natural History and the New York City government
  have agreed} to remove a statue from the museum's entrance featuring
  Theodore Roosevelt on horseback, flanked by a Native American man and
  an African man.
\item
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/confederate-statues-monuments-removal.html}{Where
  do monuments go once they've been taken down by officials}? As of late
  last week, 106 Confederate symbols and monuments had been ordered
  removed since 2015; most end up in storage, according to a
  representative of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

\subsection{How did Joe Biden become an L.G.B.T.Q.
ally?}\label{how-did-joe-biden-become-an-lgbtq-ally}}

Joe Biden is not typically thought of as a progressive agitator, but in
recent years he has accrued a reputation as something of a champion of
L.G.B.T.Q. rights.

That wasn't always so: As
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/adam-nagourney}{Adam
Nagourney}} **** and ****
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/thomas-kaplan}{Thomas
Kaplan}} **** write
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/us/politics/biden-gay-rights-lgbt.html}{in
a new article}, Biden typically voted with most fellow Democrats during
his decades in the Senate, which sometimes meant casting votes that now
appear retrograde in today's Democratic Party.

Adam agreed to answer a few questions for us about how Biden's positions
have evolved --- and what gay-rights activists expect from a possible
Biden administration.

\textbf{Hi, Adam. If you were to look only at Joe Biden's Senate record,
you wouldn't get the sense that he was a big leader on L.G.B.T.Q.
issues. But in recent years he has often been ahead of the Democratic
Party consensus. How do you explain that shift?}

It's always tough to get at exactly why politicians change their
positions over time. Often, it reflects political accommodation,
preparing for an upcoming campaign. (Case in point:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/03/26/us/politics/bill-clintons-decision-and-regret-on-defense-of-marriage-act.html}{President
Bill Clinton signing the Defense of Marriage Act}, barring federal
recognition of same-sex marriages, in September 1996 ---~a bill that
Biden, along with most Democrats, supported.)

But it's hard to see what Biden had to gain in 2012 when he stepped out
in front of President Barack Obama
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/05/07/us/politics/biden-expresses-support-for-same-sex-marriages.html}{to
announce his support for same-sex marriage}. ``There's no political
barometer that would have told him to get ahead of the White House on
this,'' Pete Buttigieg, who is gay and ran for president this year, told
us.

But societal views on these kinds of issues were beginning to change.
Biden was very much part of that wave --- and when it came to the
Democratic Party, ahead of much of it.

\textbf{Tell us more about that moment. Was it just an example of Biden
being characteristically loose-lipped --- or was it a reflection of a
consistent role he played in the administration, as a proponent of
L.G.B.T.Q. rights?}

Obama and his White House were caught off-guard by this. They were, in
fact, angered by the notion that Biden was trying to pre-empt the
president on the issue, or even that he was trying to maneuver Obama to
--- I guess we shouldn't say come out of the closet on the issue, should
we? Well, just did. Biden's aides initially issued a statement
suggesting that he had been misunderstood, but he soon made clear that
he wasn't.

This is one of those cases where he was asked a question, had a view on
the question, and answered it.

\textbf{In this year's Democratic primary, Biden wasn't the first choice
of most progressives, but he seemed to have generally earned the trust
of many L.G.B.T.Q. rights advocates. Would you say there is true
excitement there about his candidacy?}

Support for him among L.G.B.T.Q. leaders is really high; we heard it
again and again in our interviews. He might not have been their first
choice --- though in many cases he was ---~but there is no ambivalence
about his candidacy. Chad Griffin, a longtime gay-rights leader, said
Biden would be the ``most pro-equality president we have ever had.'' Did
we mention that he's running against Trump?
