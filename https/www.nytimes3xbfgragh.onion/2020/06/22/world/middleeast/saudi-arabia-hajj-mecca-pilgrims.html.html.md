BEIRUT — Every year, Saudi Arabia welcomes millions of Muslims from
around the world for the hajj pilgrimage, a sacred rite that pumps cash
into the economy and enhances the prestige of the monarch.

But not this year.

The kingdom announced on Monday that the 2020 hajj, scheduled to take
place next month, would welcome “very limited numbers” of pilgrims in
order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The dramatic shrinkage of the largest annual rite in Islam could hit
Saudi Arabia particularly hard, with a reduced pilgrimage delivering a
further financial blow to a kingdom already grappling with low oil
prices and an economic slowdown caused by the lockdowns aimed at
preventing contagion.

It could also disappoint Muslims from around the world who have saved
for years to have a once-in-a-lifetime religious experience.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Saudi statement on Monday marked the first time since the founding
of the modern Saudi kingdom in 1932 that such restrictions have been
placed on the hajj. The event is so closely linked to the king’s
international standing that he bears the title “the custodian of the two
holy mosques,” a reference to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina where
the hajj takes place.

The pilgrimage has been canceled many times throughout history because
of wars and disease, but has faced no significant limits on attendance
since the mid-1800s, when outbreaks of cholera and plague kept pilgrims
away for a number of years.

On Monday, the kingdom made clear it was not canceling the event
outright, but drastically reducing the total number of pilgrims for
safety.

In a statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, the
Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, which oversees the pilgrimage, said the
event this year would welcome only pilgrims from Saudi Arabia and from
other nationalities who are already inside the kingdom.

The statement did not specify what the target attendance would be, but
the lack of pilgrims from abroad will surely make for a much smaller
pilgrimage.

Last year, of the 2.49 million pilgrims who performed the hajj, 1.86
million came from outside Saudi Arabia, according to [the Saudi General
Authority for Statistics](https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/28).

Nor did the statement specify what precautions would be taken to prevent
viral spread among the pilgrims who did attend.

The pilgrimage’s conditions can lend themselves to the spread of
contagious diseases. Pilgrims fly, drive or sail in from countries
across the globe and often form dense crowds while performing a series
of religious rites over a number of days.

At night, many sleep close together in tents or other crowded
accommodations and share meals. At the end, many return home to grand
receptions with crowds of family and friends.

In addition to its religious significance, the pilgrimage is a

help diversify the economy away from
oil.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The kingdom needs that income even more now, since low oil prices have
deprived the state of income and created a budget deficit.

Saudi Arabia has struggled to contain the virus while balancing
lockdowns with the damage they have caused to the economy.

In March, the government imposed strict round-the-clock curfews in many
parts of the country, with exceptions only for medical care and
essential shopping. It began a phased reopening last month and lifted
the last remaining restrictions on Sunday.

But the number of coronavirus cases has continued to rise, with the
government reporting [more than 160,000 total infections and more
than 1,307
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).

In an effort to slow the virus’s spread, the kingdom closed the holy
sites in Mecca and Medina to non-Saudis in February, and in April, a
Saudi official warned pilgrims planning to travel to the kingdom for
this year’s hajj to delay making plans.

Monday’s announcement of the limited hajj will surely disappoint many
Muslims who had hoped this year to perform the pilgrimage, one of the
five pillars of Islam, which every Muslim who is able must undertake
once in a lifetime.

So Muslims who have spent years saving for the trip and jockeying for
bookings will now have to wait until next year to try again.
