Saudi Arabia said only ``very limited numbers'' of pilgrims could
perform the hajj this year, with only Saudis and foreign nationals
already in the kingdom allowed to take part.

BEIRUT --- Every year, Saudi Arabia welcomes millions of Muslims from
around the world for the hajj pilgrimage, a sacred rite that pumps cash
into the economy and enhances the prestige of the monarch.

But not this year.

The kingdom announced on Monday that the 2020 hajj, scheduled to take
place next month, would welcome ``very limited numbers'' of pilgrims in
order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The dramatic shrinkage of the largest annual rite in Islam could hit
Saudi Arabia particularly hard, with a reduced pilgrimage delivering a
further financial blow to a kingdom already grappling with low oil
prices and an economic slowdown caused by the lockdowns aimed at
preventing contagion.

It could also disappoint Muslims from around the world who have saved
for years to have a once-in-a-lifetime religious experience.

The Saudi statement on Monday marked the first time since the founding
of the modern Saudi kingdom in 1932 that such restrictions have been
placed on the hajj. The event is so closely linked to the king's
international standing that he bears the title ``the custodian of the
two holy mosques,'' a reference to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina
where the hajj takes place.

The pilgrimage has been canceled many times throughout history because
of wars and disease, but has faced no significant limits on attendance
since the mid-1800s, when outbreaks of cholera and plague kept pilgrims
away for a number of years.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/06/22/world/22hajj2/merlin_172301529_3f88de81-2eae-4ad6-a48f-1a35846b6318-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

On Monday, the kingdom made clear it was not canceling the event
outright, but drastically reducing the total number of pilgrims for
safety.

In a statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, the
Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, which oversees the pilgrimage, said the
event this year would welcome only pilgrims from Saudi Arabia and from
other nationalities who are already inside the kingdom.

``This decision is taken to ensure Hajj is performed in a safe manner
from a public health perspective while observing all preventative
measures and the necessary social distancing protocols to protect human
beings from the risks associated with this pandemic,''
\href{https://twitter.com/KSAmofaEN/status/1275132024735633410}{the
statement} said.

The statement did not specify what the target attendance would be, but
the lack of pilgrims from abroad will surely make for a much smaller
pilgrimage.

Last year, of the 2.49 million pilgrims who performed the hajj, 1.86
million came from outside Saudi Arabia, according to
\href{https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/28}{the Saudi General Authority for
Statistics}.

Nor did the statement specify what precautions would be taken to prevent
viral spread among the pilgrims who did attend.

The pilgrimage's conditions can lend themselves to the spread of
contagious diseases. Pilgrims fly, drive or sail in from countries
across the globe and often form dense crowds while performing a series
of religious rites over a number of days.

At night, many sleep close together in tents or other crowded
accommodations and share meals. At the end, many return home to grand
receptions with crowds of family and friends.

In addition to its religious significance, the pilgrimage is a
moneymaker for the kingdom, and especially for the holy cities of Mecca
and Medina.

The hajj and a lesser pilgrimage called the umrah, which can be
performed year-round, earn the kingdom about \$12 billion per year,
according to government statistics. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, has spoken of boosting pilgrim numbers to
help diversify the economy away from oil.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground

    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest

    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make

The kingdom needs that income even more now, since low oil prices have
deprived the state of income and created a budget deficit.

Saudi Arabia has struggled to contain the virus while balancing
lockdowns with the damage they have caused to the economy.

In March, the government imposed strict round-the-clock curfews in many
parts of the country, with exceptions only for medical care and
essential shopping. It began a phased reopening last month and lifted
the last remaining restrictions on Sunday.

But the number of coronavirus cases has continued to rise, with the
government reporting
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{more
than 160,000 total infections and more than 1,307 deaths}.

In an effort to slow the virus's spread, the kingdom closed the holy
sites in Mecca and Medina to non-Saudis in February, and in April, a
Saudi official warned pilgrims planning to travel to the kingdom for
this year's hajj to delay making plans.

Monday's announcement of the limited hajj will surely disappoint many
Muslims who had hoped this year to perform the pilgrimage, one of the
five pillars of Islam, which every Muslim who is able must undertake
once in a lifetime.

So Muslims who have spent years saving for the trip and jockeying for
bookings will now have to wait until next year to try again.
