As the coronavirus pandemic hits more impoverished countries with
fragile health care systems, global health authorities are scrambling
for supplies of a simple treatment that saves lives: oxygen.

Many patients severely ill with Covid-19, the illness caused by the
coronavirus, require help with breathing at some point. But now the
epidemic is spreading rapidly in South Asia, Latin America and parts of
Africa, regions of the world where many hospitals are poorly equipped
and lack the ventilators, tanks and other equipment necessary to save
patients whose lungs are failing.

The World Health Organization is hoping to raise $250 million to
increase oxygen delivery to those regions. The World Bank and the
African Union are contributing to the effort, and some medical charities
are seeking donations for the cause.

The W.H.O. estimated on Wednesday that with about one million new
coronavirus cases worldwide per week, the world will need 620,000 cubic
meters of oxygen per day, or 88,000 large cylinders.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By a stroke of luck, the W.H.O., UNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation in 2017 began searching for ways to increase oxygen delivery
in poor and middle-income countries — not in anticipation of a pandemic,
but because oxygen can save the lives of premature infants and children
with pneumonia.

The organizations began ordering equipment in January, but within weeks
suppliers were swamped by the sudden surge in demand created by the
pandemic.

The W.H.O. has purchased 14,000 oxygen concentrators, which filter
oxygen from the air, to be sent to 120 countries, and the agency hopes
to buy 170,000 more concentrators over the next six months at a cost of
$100 million.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the W.H.O.,
warned that “80 percent of the market is owned by just a few companies,
and demand is outstripping supply.”

Although the machinery needed to generate oxygen is relatively simple,
it must be sturdy enough to withstand the dust, humidity and other
hazards common in rural hospitals in poor countries. Some companies
produce relatively rugged equipment, but prices are rising and
restrictions on international flights are complicating deliveries.

In May, the Alliance for International Medical Action, or Alima, treated
123 Covid-19 patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said Dr.
Baweye Mayoum Barka, the charity’s representative in Kinshasa, the
country’s capital. Fifty-six of them needed oxygen, but not enough
equipment was
available.

“So, unfortunately, there were 26 deaths, 70 percent of them in less
than 24 hours,” Dr. Barka said. “I can’t say they were all from a lack
of oxygen, but it played a role.”

Alima needs 40 oxygen concentrators, but the agency has just eight, he
said. Because it is hard to move patients from one hospital to another,
some die waiting, gasping for air.

In Congo, many Covid-19 patients arrive at hospitals with critically low
blood oxygen levels — sometimes as low as 60 percent, a level at which
patients must normally be put on a ventilator to survive. (Normal oxygen
saturation levels are 95 percent or more.)

One such patient was a doctor who had for a while refused to go to the
hospital and instead stayed home, taking chloroquine, which is still in
Congo’s national treatment guidelines.

“Then, when his condition deteriorated and he did come, just as he was
nearing the Covid building, he developed convulsions,” Dr. Barka
recalled. “They stopped to give him a drug for them, and he died just at
the gate.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nigeria is also grappling with an oxygen shortage, said Dr. Sanjana
Bhardwaj, UNICEF’s chief of health there. Since May, hospitals in Lagos
and Kano have seen a steady stream of older patients with Covid-19
symptoms who need oxygen.

In nearly every country the virus has hit, rich or poor, about 15
percent of all symptomatic patients develop pneumonia severe enough to
require extra oxygen, the W.H.O. estimates, but not so dire that they
must be put on a ventilator.

Ventilators are rare in poor countries; they can cost up to $50,000, and
patients must be heavily sedated the whole time the breathing tube is
lodged deep in their airways; also, the pressure must be constantly
monitored to prevent lung damage. That requires anesthesiologists and
trained respiratory technicians, positions that many hospitals
lack.

Oxygen can be delivered in two ways. Tanks contain nearly pure oxygen.
For patients who need large volumes and help keeping the air sacs in
their lungs open, tanks can deliver oxygen at high pressure through a
mask strapped tightly over the nose and mouth.

But tanks are heavy, must be refilled at central stations and delivered
by truck, and they pose some risk of explosion and fire. While many poor
countries have plants making industrial-grade oxygen for construction
jobs like welding, it cannot be used on patients because the tanks often
contain rust or oily water that could lodge in the lungs, said Paul
Molinaro, chief of operations support and logistics at the W.H.O.

An alternative is an [oxygen
concentrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_concentrator), which
is usually the size of a suitcase or even a briefcase. Concentrators
pull oxygen out of ambient air by forcing it under pressure through a
“molecular sieve” filled with the mineral zeolite, which adsorbs
nitrogen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most concentrators cost only $1,000 to $2,000. They need electricity but
can run on a generator or batteries, using about as much power as a
small refrigerator.

Typically concentrators can produce about 90 percent pure oxygen. They
do not deliver it under pressure, but the thin tube through which the
oxygen streams can be connected to a continuous positive airway pressure
machine, or CPAP, to enrich the air it blows into the lungs.

Alima has started a campaign, “Oxygen for Africa,” to raise money to
send about 500 concentrators to six poor countries, Jennifer Lazuta, a
spokeswoman, said.

UNICEF [has ordered about 16,000
concentrators](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/oxygen-therapy) for
about 90 countries, but thus far has been able to deliver only about
700, said Jonathan Howard-Brand, an innovation specialist at UNICEF’s
procurement center in
Copenhagen.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of

        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The W.H.O. has ordered another 14,000, of which 2,000 have been
delivered and 2,000 are in transit, Mr. Molinaro
said.

He and Mr. Howard-Brand described severe delivery problems created by
the epidemic, including delays of up to five weeks. When possible, the
aid agencies ship through the World Food Program, which [has dozens of
planes](https://www.wfp.org/publications/wfp-aviation-2018). But the
concentrators must compete for space with shipments of food, personal
protective gear and other lifesaving goods.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Also, some countries are far from cargo hub cities, while others
restrict all flights, even those containing aid, for fear of the virus
being introduced.

“We need more planes in the air,” Mr. Howard-Brand said.

UNICEF is also buying tens of thousands of pulse oximeters, fingertip
devices to measure blood-oxygen saturation.

In deciding how much equipment to buy, the aid agencies are, to some
extent, flying blind. As New York State learned when it was desperately
collecting ventilators in March, how great the need will be is
unpredictable.

Younger Covid-19 patients and those without other health problems often
survive without supplemental oxygen. Populations in Africa skew younger,
because vaccination and anti-malaria campaigns over the past two decades
have saved many children who otherwise would have died. Wide swaths of
older Africans died of AIDS before H.I.V. therapy became widely
available in the mid-2000s.

(It is [still unclear whether being on H.I.V.
treatment](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/staying-in-hiv-care/other-related-health-issues/coronavirus-covid-19)
increases risks of death from Covid-19, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. But U.N.AIDS, the U.N. program fighting
the disease, [worries that lockdowns and border closings will disrupt
supplies](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/un-warns-risk-low-distribution-aids-drug-amid-covid-lockdowns)
of H.I.V. medicines, which would undoubtedly put H.I.V. patients at high
risk.)

The agencies seek advice from other aid personnel in each country to
estimate how much equipment is needed, Mr. Molinaro said. If he had more
money and time, he added, he would concentrate on ways to increase
supplies of tanked oxygen, which is dangerous to ship and so must be
produced on site.

In recent years, some public-private partnerships have sprung up to do
that. In East Africa, for example, an aid organization, [Assist
International](https://assistinternational.org/global-health/access-to-oxygen/),
set out several years ago to break local corporate monopolies producing
medical oxygen that many public hospitals in Africa could not afford.

With equipment supplied by the GE Foundation and money from Grand
Challenges Canada and other donors, Assist now has a network of
oxygen-making plants in Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia.

The U.N.’s oxygen-concentrator procurement effort, begun in April, was a
natural extension of the U.N.’s Oxygen Therapy Project, which began in
2017 with Gates Foundation support in an effort to save babies and
children.

By January, the project had found four manufacturers — two in China and
two in the United States — whose machines could stand up to harsh
conditions and which could add voltage stabilizers to prevent damage
from power spikes, which are common in the electrical systems of poor
countries and anywhere that relies on generators for power.

The agencies were just beginning to place orders when the pandemic
began.

“Our timing was immaculate,” said Mr. Howard-Brand, who helped write the
specifications for the new machines. “Now maybe the market will open
up.”
