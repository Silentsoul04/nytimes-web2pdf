\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Brenda Ravenell was a lawyer for more than 30 years, most of it with the
same colleague in a general practice in East Orange, N.J. How they
divided up their cases said something about Ms. Ravenell.

``We had a good mix, like yin and yang,'' her fellow lawyer, Beverly
Giscombe, said. ``She was very kind and conscientious, which made her
better for family matters and divorces. I had the stronger personality,
and I was free to deal with personal injury cases."

At first, Ms. Ravenell worked for Ms. Giscombe. Then, in 2002, they
became partners. The partnership ended in 2017, when Ms. Ravenell
retired because of complications of diabetes. A year later, when her
condition required a kidney transplant, her daughter, Adebunmi Gbadebo,
donated one of hers.

``She was the ultimate optimist, smiling, joking and praying through it
all,'' Ms. Ravenell's sister, Daneen Cooper, said.

Ms. Ravenell died on April 4 at a hospital in Rockville Centre, N.Y., on
Long Island. She was 64. The cause was Covid-19, Ms. Cooper said.

Brenda Marsha Ravenell was born in Limestone, Me., on July 22, 1955,
when her father, James Ravenell, was stationed there, at Loring Air
Force Base. Her mother, Carrie (Marshall) Ravenell, was a medical
secretary. Her father worked in the commissary at Fort Hamilton in
Brooklyn after he retired from the Air Force.

Ms. Ravenell earned her bachelor's degree from New York University in
1976, majoring in political science and minoring in Spanish. She worked
as an insurance underwriter to save money to go Rutgers Law School, from
which she graduated in 1984.

She began her association with Ms. Giscombe after working for Legal
Services of New Jersey in Newark, which provides help on civil cases to
people who cannot afford a lawyer. ``She was a compassionate and
concerned person who gave a lot of time to people,'' Ms. Giscombe said.
``She was lovely.''

Before she received the Covid-19 diagnosis, Ms. Ravenell was in a
rehabilitation facility in Hempstead, N.Y., on Long Island, recovering
from further complications of diabetes, including the amputation of
toes. Her father was also a patient there, recuperating from shingles
and a severe staph infection.

``We couldn't go to see them because there was a lockdown, but she could
see him,'' Ms. Cooper said. ``It was a blessing,'' Mr. Ravenell, 93,
died of a heart attack in the facility.

In addition to her sister and daughter, Ms. Ravenell is survived by her
mother. Her marriage to Adebo Gbadebo ended in divorce. Her brother,
Derek, 49, died of colon cancer last November.

On the day before she died, Ms. Ravenell remained optimistic in a call
to her sister and daughter.

``She said, `I'm fighting through this, don't worry,''' Ms. Cooper said.
``She was upbeat, she never let this get to her. So when I got the call
that she died, I was shocked.''
