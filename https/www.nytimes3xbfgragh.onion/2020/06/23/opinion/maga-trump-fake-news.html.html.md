If there’s anything we’ve learned in the five years since Donald Trump
came down that escalator, it’s that he cannot thrive without a constant
stream of attention, adulation and affirmation. It’s why he’s obsessed
with cable news and Fox in particular; why his cabinet meetings begin
with almost worshipful praise from each of his appointees; and why he’s
constantly touting his sky-high support from other Republicans.

It’s also why, on Saturday, he held an indoor rally in the midst of a
respiratory disease pandemic. “I guarantee you after Saturday, if
everything goes well, he’s going to be in a much better mood,” an
unnamed Trump political adviser [told
CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/politics/trump-turn-around-losing-campaign/index.html)
the day before the event. “He believes that he needs to be out there
fighting and he feeds off the energy of the crowds.”

The president is plainly unable to handle bad news, or even the idea
that he isn’t popular or well-liked. Someone who rejects the idea of
being rejected may, for example, [believe that voter
fraud](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1275024974579982336?s=21)
is the only threat to his re-election. And he’s constructed a bubble,
let’s call it a safe space, in which he’s insulated from bad news,
negative feedback and pretty much any kind of criticism. The result is
that he’s unable to respond to a changing national mood, unable to
adjust to a public that wants more leadership than spectacle.

We have plenty of evidence that Trump shields himself from anything that
could disrupt the illusion of popularity and success he’s constructed
around himself. At the Tulsa rally, he
[told](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/22/white-house-testing-coronavirus-333803)
his audience that, when faced with evidence of rising coronavirus
infection rates, he urged his team to reduce the rate of testing. “When
you do testing to that extent, you’re gonna find more people, you’re
gonna find more cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down,
please,’” he said. His press secretary says this was a “comment that he
made in jest,” but Trump has expressed similar sentiments in the past.
“If we did very little testing, we wouldn’t have the most cases,” [he
said in
May](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-meeting-governor-reynolds-iowa/)
during a meeting with Kim Reynolds, the governor of Iowa. “So, in a way,
by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Likewise, on the question of his campaign, the president’s re-election
staffers know just what he wants to hear. They’ve either [downplayed his
poor
numbers](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-world-thrilled-that-their-terrible-poll-numbers-arent-worse)
— telling him that the polls showing Joe Biden ahead skew Democratic —
or challenged them outright. After a CNN poll found him trailing Biden
by 14 points, the Trump campaign [sent a cease-and-desist
letter](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/politics/trump-campaign-cnn-poll/index.html)
to Jeff Zucker, the president of the network, demanding that he retract
the poll and apologize for its release. The poll, read the letter, is a
“stunt” meant to “cause voter suppression, stifle momentum and
enthusiasm for the president, and present a false view generally of the
actual support across America for the president.”

The obvious problem with building a cocoon of praise and sycophancy
around oneself, as any failed authoritarian could explain, is that it
hinders one’s ability to respond to conditions on the ground, whether
that’s a pandemic or a presidential race. You can’t change course if you
refuse to see what’s happening in front of you.

Trump rejects his poor ratings on the pandemic and the protests — [58
percent](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/approval-trumps-coronavirus-response-underwater-returns-campaign-trail/story?id=71351241)
of Americans disapprove of his handling of the coronavirus, and [60
percent](https://www.journalism.org/2020/06/12/majorities-of-americans-say-news-coverage-of-george-floyd-protests-has-been-good-trumps-public-message-wrong/)
disapprove of his handling of the demonstrations to protest the death of
George Floyd — and so he continues to do the things that have placed him
in a historically weak position for an incumbent president seeking
re-election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If Trump were less cloistered, he might know that to improve his
prospects he has to speak to voters on the fence between him and Biden.
He has to address their fears and make a positive case for his
administration. But because he lives within the confines of a gated MAGA
community, Trump has no sense of what the skeptical public wants to
hear. This, too, was apparent at his Tulsa rally, where he spoke at
length about minor controversies — his ability to drink a glass of water
with one hand, his ability to walk down a ramp — that are almost
certainly irrelevant to everyone other than himself and his staunchest
supporters.

And it’s not just Trump who is closed off from the rest of the world.
Republican officials across the country refuse to believe that the
president is on the path to defeat. “The more bad things happen in the
country, it just solidifies support for Trump,” one North Carolina
Republican Party county chairman told Politico in [a
story](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/15/trump-glide-reelection-republican-officials-316457)
on the belief, within Republican circles, that “coronavirus is on its
way out” and “polls are unreliable.”

We can’t predict what will happen in November. But right now Trump is
losing the presidential race, Democrats are likely to hold the House of
Representatives, and Republicans are at risk of losing the Senate. A
backlash is brewing, and Trump can’t see or even sense it. There are
those in his camp, like Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader
of the Senate, who can see the writing on the wall. This is presumably
why he’s
[pushing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watch-live-mcconnell-tim-scott-senate-republican-police-reform-bill/)
a police reform bill — to give Republicans something to tout in the fall
to those moderate voters who sympathize with protesters.

But it’s not clear if the conservative movement as a whole knows what it
has unleashed by hitching its wagon to Donald Trump. Conservatives
thought they were getting “[252 beautiful, brand-new, conservative,
wonderful
judges](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-air-force-one-departure-15/)”
and a chance to cement their political preferences into the
constitutional order. What they may receive instead is a newly energized
and increasingly liberal public that has the numbers to sink that
project for at least the near future, if not much longer.
