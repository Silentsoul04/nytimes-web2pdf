Men menstruate. Some have even given birth. Women with penises and
prominent larynxes walk the streets and use the ladies’ restroom.
Nonbinary people wear binders and use they/them pronouns. It’s 2020.

The Trump administration would like to turn back the clock. This month,
the administration [finalized a
rule](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights.html)
that would erase nondiscrimination protections for trans people in the
provision of health care. The administration’s mode of attack is
linguistic. Trans people live in the space between “gender” and “sex,”
and the new rule aims to erase us by conflating the concepts.

A full embrace of this new trans reality will mean leaving behind old
vocabularies. Some changes are simple: We can speak of trans mothers and
brothers and siblings as easily as of any other family member. Others
are more contested. “They” as a singular pronoun is not without its
detractors, [Shakespeare
aside](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002748.html).
And some words will need to be reconfigured entirely. The “feminine **
products” aisle offers tampons and pads and diva cups — tools for
managing the biological function of menstruation. Again, some men
menstruate. So why not simply call these menstrual products?

“Sex” is a biological framework, a panoply of possibility on its own.
“Sex” needs precise words like “male” and “female” and “intersex” to
describe the origins, components and functions of bodies. But we can’t
maintain this precision if we use words about sex ** to describe gender
** — the social and political roles and possibilities we take on as
women, as men, [as something
else](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/11/16/magazine/tech-design-instagram-gender.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer)
or [none of the
above](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/04/magazine/gender-nonbinary.html).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That is to say: Stop using “male” and “female” to refer to men and
women. In fact, stop using sex-based words to refer to people at all.
They’re words for bodies, not for people with hearts and souls and
minds.

Anti-trans revanchists have centered their battles in wordplay — if you
can call it that. J.K. Rowling, in a [recent
tweet](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269382518362509313), noted
that “people who menstruate” were once referred to as “Wumben? Wimpund?
Woomud?” (She meant “women.” There’s that wordplay.)

She also argued, “[If sex isn’t
real,](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269389298664701952) the
lived reality of women globally is erased” and “erasing the concept of
sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.”
Ms. Rowling’s linguistic wizardry cloaks her political goal, to assign
gender purely by sex, and therefore relegate trans-ness to a closet
[under the
stairs](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cupboard_Under_the_Stairs).

It should be noted that trans people do not generally believe sex is not
real; indeed, discomfort with the sex of our bodies is a frequent
challenge for trans people. Ms. Rowling knows this, since she knows what
the word “trans” means. Words hold power, and it’s no surprise that
pushback to a rising trans presence has come in the form of definitional
conservatism.

But the battle extends beyond language, and Ms. Rowling’s semantic
battle has been taken to new theaters by the Trump administration. From
our
[schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html)
to our
[hospitals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights.html)
to [the federal work
force](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/06/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights.html),
the administration has pursued new rules that define trans people out of
existence. This is an attack on trans lives. As with Ms. Rowling, the
language of the proposed rules is the language of bodies: the social
roles of “man” and “woman” are the only two available, and we are all
assigned one at birth according to our bodies. (Intersex individuals
will note that false binaries are not limited to social roles.)

Last week, the judiciary offered trans people some relief. The [Supreme
Court
ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf),
“An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or
transgender violates Title VII,” which prohibits employers from
discriminating based on sex. Aimee Stephens, a trans woman and a
plaintiff in the case, was fired after notifying her employer she would
be transitioning. As the court argued, she was fired because of her sex.
**** The logic is impeccable. The only difference between a trans woman
and a cisgender woman is the sex assigned to her at birth: Firing a
trans woman but keeping a cis woman *must* be discrimination based on
sex, which is illegal.

In finding for Aimee Stephens, the Supreme Court reinforced the
centrality of bodies to the word “sex,” while undermining the
patriarchal belief that our bodies should determine our gender.
Unfortunately, the protections depend on the language of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and remain as limited as the imaginations of its authors.
While male and female people are protected classes, nonbinary or
genderqueer people may not have enforceable rights — say, to a
gender-neutral bathroom — under the act.

Clarity in language provides social and linguistic accommodation for
those of us traditionally denied both. The battle for civil rights *is*
the battle over words. Denying trans people passports because our gender
doesn’t match the sex assigned to us at birth limits freedom of
movement. For trans immigrants and [asylum
seekers](https://www.hrc.org/blog/the-precarious-position-of-transgender-immigrants-and-asylum-seekers),
this restricts access to families abroad. Denying trans people access to
bathrooms on the basis of sex denies us access to public spaces. (Can
you imagine spending a day at school or work without using the bathroom?
If you can’t pee, you don’t have access.)

When you use words like “male” as shorthand for those privileged by the
patriarchy, you leave trans women uncertain whether you have our backs
or — like the Trump administration and J.K. Rowling — you are trying to
write us out of existence. It’s impossible to dismantle the patriarchy
while wearing a “pussy hat.”

The anti-trans clique would pursue legal restrictions where nature has
concocted something more anarchic. But we are already here, being trans,
at your job, on your block, in your bathroom. And we deserve no less.
Rooting our social possibilities in our bodies is an abandonment of our
humanity in favor of mere anatomy.
