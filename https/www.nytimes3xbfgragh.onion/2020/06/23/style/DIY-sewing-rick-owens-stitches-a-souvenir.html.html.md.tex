In the latest installment of our Designer D.I.Y. series, the designer
embroiders a lover's hankie.

\emph{At a time when everyone is isolated at home, nervous about
spending money and without an occasion to dress up, what can we do to
help you pass the time?}

\emph{Styles has started a series of print-and-keep D.I.Y. wardrobe
customization ideas, similar to the sewing patterns that glossy
magazines used to provide. We want you to remember the joy of fashion
and learn (or remember) how to make things at home. Some of fashion's
best-known creative talents will be on hand to guide you through the
process.}

``During my mom's Mexican youth, girls used to embroider their
boyfriend's initials on a handkerchief with their own hair,'' Rick Owens
wrote in an email from Paris, where he and his wife, Michele Lamy, live.
Though hair can be a disconcerting substance when not attached to one's
own head, it has a rich history of use as a memento mori, used through
the ages by artists, hobbyists, fetishists and smitten teens.

``I loved that story,'' Mr. Owens said. ``So I asked my mom to embroider
a handkerchief with her hair for me.''

Years later, when the designer's friends started having children, he
plucked strands of his signature raven locks and embroidered the
newborns' initials on baby blankets that he gave to the new parents as
gifts.

Though the baroque atmospherics of the instructions below are not
required (Mr. Owens may have been, as he wrote, on magic mushrooms when
he composed them), it probably helps to be in some kind of swoon while
you sew.

\textbf{Your tool kit}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Three long strands of your own hair
\item
  One 35-by-35-inch silk handkerchief
\item
  One Clover No. 3-9 gold-eye embroidery needle
\item
  An embroidery hoop
\end{itemize}

STEP 1

``First, wash your silky hair in the milk of an ass, just as Claudette
Colbert did while playing Empress Poppea,'' Mr. Owens wrote, referring
to the actress's racy turn in ``The Sign of the Cross,'' Cecil B.
DeMille's 1932 pre-Code epic. TREsemmé would probably work just as well
if you can't find donkey's milk in the dairy aisle.

STEP 2

``Air-dry your hair by hanging it off a balcony in morning sun, combing
and untangling it with a fine-toothed mother-of-pearl comb while the
Montserrat Caballé version of Camille Saint-Saëns's `Mon coeur s'ouvre a
ta voix' plays in the background,'' Mr. Owens wrote.

Image

STEP 3

Lightly pencil the desired initials on the silk hankie, then stretch it
over ``your prettiest'' embroidery hoop.

Image

STEP 4

Take three long healthy strands of hair from your head and thread them
through the needle simultaneously. ``Using a single strand will take
forever,'' he said.

Image

STEP 5

Slip on a thimble and start embroidering the initials of the one you
love. ``Find a cozy place to sit outside under a tree,'' Mr. Owens said.
``This could very well take all day.''
