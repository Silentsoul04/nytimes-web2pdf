Apple says it will make it tougher for apps to track you. It will also
help you wash your
hands.

*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up
here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/signup/OT) *to
receive it weekdays.*

Greetings, friends\! I’m your personal tech columnist. I’ll be taking
the wheel for today’s intro.

This week is a big one for Apple, which is hosting its [annual
conference for the software
developers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/technology/apple-macs-intel-chips.html)
who make apps for Apple phones, tablets, watches and computers. The
company started the weeklong event with a video presentation streamed on
Monday, outlining its new features.

The presentation was chock-full of jargon and deeply technical stuff
that only engineers would understand. But here’s the news that you may
care about:

  - **Apple is making it tougher for apps to track you.** Unbeknown to
    many of us, thousands of apps that we lovingly use on our
    smartphones have [invisible trackers running in the
    background](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/03/technology/personaltech/fingerprinting-track-devices-what-to-do.html).
    The trackers may be collecting and sharing our personal information,
    like our location, email address and phone number, with businesses
    and other entities for the purpose of serving targeted ads. You
    can’t opt in or opt out of app tracking.
    
    That may soon change. Apple said that beginning this fall with its
    next mobile operating system, iOS 14, it will require so-called
    third-party apps to ask for your permission to track you.
    
    Apple will also give iPhone and iPad users more control over how
    their location is shared. Instead of sharing your precise location
    with an app, you will be able to share your approximate location,
    giving a developer a rough idea of where you are. That could be
    helpful if you are using a news app, for example, and you want to
    see articles about your hometown but don’t want to share precisely
    where you live.
    
    In the past, Apple and Google have required apps to ask for
    permission to access sensors, such as your camera and microphone.
    These new protections expand on Apple’s efforts to give users
    greater transparency and control over the data collected about us.
    (Your move, Google.)

  - **The Mac is about to make a big shift**. Have you ever noticed how
    sluggish Macs feel compared to Apple’s mobile devices? Macs use
    Intel processors, but mobile processors have outpaced Intel chips in
    terms of speed and power efficiency. Even the cheapest new Apple
    phone, the [$399 iPhone
    SE](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/technology/personaltech/apple-iphone-se-review.html),
    by some measures outperforms the most powerful Mac laptops, which
    cost more than $2,500.
    
    That’s why it’s a big deal that this week Apple announced the
    [beginning of the Mac’s transition to Apple-made
    silicon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/technology/apple-intel-breakup.html),
    which will be based on the same chip architecture powering iPhones
    and iPads. If all goes well, we can expect Macs with snappier
    performance and much longer battery life, and they should also be
    able to run iPhone and iPad apps.
    
    The transition to Apple chips is expected to take two years. If you
    buy a Mac in 2022, it should have the horsepower of an iPad, but
    work with a mouse and keyboard.

  - **The Apple Watch is trying to be more helpful during the
    pandemic.** Apple said the next version of the Apple Watch operating
    system, WatchOS 7, would take advantage of the watch’s motion
    sensors to detect when you are washing your hands — and start a
    20-second timer to ensure you scrub thoroughly. The watch will also
    use its sensors to track sleep patterns. These are relatively minor
    new features, but we could all probably use better sleep and hygiene
    these days.

## Seeking therapy through screens

*Thanks to Brian for tag-teaming with me. This is Shira Ovide for the
rest of today’s dispatch.*

The last few months have been A LOT. As the stresses on our bodies,
finances, families and minds have piled up, it’s gotten more complicated
to seek help as physicians and mental health specialists paused seeing
patients in person because of coronavirus fears.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But a silver lining, said Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a psychologist and
founder of the mental health resource [Therapy for Black
Girls](https://therapyforblackgirls.com/about/), is that moving therapy
sessions online has been more rewarding for some people — although that
hasn’t been true for everyone.

For some, taking face-to-face interaction out of therapy makes difficult
conversations easier. “Adding a screen is just enough of a barrier where
it maybe feels safer to share something,” Dr. Bradford said.

Dr. Bradford had advice for people seeking therapy right now through
online appointments. During virtual sessions, try to find a private,
personal space — even if that means taking a video call alone in your
car, while on a walk or in the bathroom with the door closed.

She also advised people to give themselves a time to transition after
sessions end, rather than jumping right back into family or work
obligations.

Dr. Bradford also said people shouldn’t be afraid to find a new
therapist if their current one isn’t a good match, for example a
practitioner who isn’t responsive to the added stresses that some black
people are feeling.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For people worried about costs, Dr. Bradford said some individual
therapists and apps such as Talkspace offer free appointments, and a
number of health insurers have been waiving co-payments for people to
speak to therapists virtually during the coronavirus.

And nonprofit groups including the Loveland Foundation, Open Path
Psychotherapy Collective and the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation offer
financial assistance or lower-cost options for people who are seeking
therapy.

## Before we go …

  - **Never waste a crisis, I guess?** Companies are repurposing their
    technology products as [untested and sometimes comical-sounding
    coronavirus-fighting
    systems](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/business/virus-office-workplace-return.html).
    My colleagues [Natasha
    Singer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/natasha-singer) and
    [Julie
    Creswell](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/julie-creswell)
    write about software for tracking product inventory that has been
    remade into an employee virus-tracking system. Income verification
    software has been pitched for workers to report their health status
    to employers.

  - **I want to know everything about K-pop fans:** The **** New York
    Times pop music writer [Joe
    Coscarelli](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/joe-coscarelli)
    [explains the internet might of Korean pop music
    fans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/arts/music/k-pop-fans-trump-politics.html),
    who often use their online savvy to support their favorite boy bands
    and now are [taking credit for helping inflate attendance
    expectations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html)
    for President Trump’s Tulsa rally.
    
    Also, read the Times Opinion writer [Charlie
    Warzel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/charlie-warzel)
    fretting about [oversimplifying young people’s
    motivations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/opinion/trump-protest-gen-z.html)
    in the online information wars.

  - **Your regular reminder to be cautious of what you see and share
    online:** A Times team found 41 U.S. cities and towns where false
    rumors spread about anti-fascist activists coming to cause mayhem.
    [Davey Alba](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/davey-alba) and
    Ben Decker traced the origins of how friends, neighbors and trusted
    businesses in four towns [sometimes unwittingly spread bogus
    fears](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/technology/antifa-local-disinformation.html)
    and forced law enforcement to respond.
