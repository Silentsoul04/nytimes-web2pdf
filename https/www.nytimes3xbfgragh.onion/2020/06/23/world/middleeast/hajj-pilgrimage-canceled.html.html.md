BEIRUT, Lebanon — For much of his life, Abdul-Halim al-Akoum stashed
away cash in hopes of one day traveling from his Lebanese mountain
village to perform the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that all Muslims
who can are obliged to make once in their lives.

He was all set to go this year until the coronavirus pandemic forced
Saudi Arabia to effectively cancel the hajj for what some scholars say
may be the first time in history.

“It is the dream of every Muslim believer to visit Mecca and do the
hajj,” said Mr. al-Akoum, 61, a village official. “But the pandemic came
with no warning and took away that dream.”

The Saudi announcement sent shock waves of sadness and disappointment
across the Muslim world, upending the plans of millions of believers to
make a trip that many look forward to their whole lives and which, for
many, marks a profound spiritual awakening.

A 72-year-old retired port worker in Pakistan will stay home, despite
his six children having pooled their money to finance his trip. A mother
in Kenya will forgo visiting sites she has long dreamed of seeing. An
Egyptian school administrator named Zeinab Ibrahim burst into tears.

“It was my only wish,” Ms. Ibrahim said. “To cancel it completely is
such a shame. May God relieve us of this burden.”

Performing the pilgrimage at least once for those who are physically and
financially able is one of the five pillars of Islam. Making the trip is
such a sacred milestone for the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims that in
parts of the Arab world families of returned pilgrims paint murals on
their homes to alert their neighbors to the pilgrim in their midst.

“The hajj is a transformative, emotional and spiritually moving
experience — the spiritual pinnacle of a devout Muslim’s life,” said
Yasir Qadhi, dean of the Islamic Seminary of America, who was supposed
to lead a group of 250 pilgrims to Mecca this year.

Since the Saudi announcement, he added, “There’s a sense of deflation
and spiritual loss, and a great sadness.”

The hajj is also big business. The hajj, a five- or six-day pilgrimage
that starts this year at the end of July, and the umrah, a lesser
pilgrimage that can be performed at any time of the year, earn Saudi
Arabia billions of dollars each year, and Muslim communities from Texas
to Tajikistan have travel agencies specializing in getting pilgrims to
and from the holy sites and providing accommodation along the way.

“It is a catastrophe on all levels — economic, social and religious,”
said Tariq Kalach, who runs a Beirut travel agency that was planning to
take 400 pilgrims to Mecca this year.

Pilgrimage packages cost from $3,000 to $10,000, he said. He also
provides services to a number of Islamic associations that pay for
groups of poor Muslims to make the trip each year.

He said the cancellation was devastating, but that it was the right
thing to do.

“It is a very dangerous virus and it will spread like a brush fire,” he
said. “May the almighty make things easy for the Muslims.”

The Saudi government, for which the hajj is a major source of prestige
and tourism, [announced
Monday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-hajj-mecca-pilgrims.html)
that no pilgrims from outside the kingdom could perform the hajj this
year in order to prevent contagion.

On Tuesday, Saudi officials narrowed the order, saying that only about
1,000 pilgrims would be permitted this year — a tiny fraction of the 2.5
million who came last year.

The pilgrimage has been interrupted or curtailed many times because of
wars and disease, but has faced no significant limits on attendance
since the mid-1800s, when outbreaks of cholera and plague kept pilgrims
away for a number of years.

Saudi Arabia, whose king bears the title “the custodian of the two holy
mosques,” a reference to holy sites in Mecca and Medina, has never
canceled the hajj since the modern kingdom was founded in 1932.

“This is the first time in the global phenomenon of the hajj that it has
been canceled in such a manner,” said Dr. Qadhi, the scholar. “The
dynamics have changed. Five hundred years ago you couldn’t ban it. There
were no passports, no visas.”

The Mongol invasion of the Levant in the 13th century, for example,
prevented pilgrims from reaching Mecca, he said, “but even then, the
locals did it.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Few criticized the decision to limit the event since Saudi Arabia is
suffering from one of the largest coronavirus outbreaks in the Middle
East, with 161,000 declared infections and more than 1,300 deaths.
Epidemiologists have warned that mass gatherings — from concerts to
sporting matches — can become so-called super-spreader events.

Khalid Almaeena, a Saudi political and media analyst who has attended
the hajj many times, said that much of the pilgrimage’s importance comes
from the way it mixes Muslims from different countries, races and social
classes who might not otherwise cross paths.

“This is the religious, social, cultural aspect of the hajj,” he said.
“It is not just the ritual, but the meeting places, the many great
friendships and bonds that are established and built there year after
year.”

In Egypt, the economic hardship of recent years has turned the hajj into
an elusive dream for many, which only sharpened the blow of the
cancellation.

Ms. Ibrahim, the school administrator, applied four years in a row to a
government lottery that offers free trips to the hajj, failing every
time. But this year, she scraped together the cost from her own funds.
“I wanted to go while my health is still good,” said Ms. Ibrahim, 58,
who earns about $175 a month. “I didn’t care about the
cost.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected

      - Employers have to provide [a safe

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In many countries, even those who can muster the expense often wait
years to be included in their country’s quota of pilgrims, which are set
by Saudi Arabia with the aim of equalizing the opportunity across the
Muslim world.

Imam Mokhi Turk, 45, said that 15 people from his embattled farming
village in Kunduz Province, Afghanistan, had been waiting for their turn
to do the hajj and that some of his neighbors had sold land to pay for
it.

Mr. Turk and four of his relatives registered for the pilgrimage four
years ago, but only he made the list this year.

“This makes me very sad, because every Muslim hopes to go to hajj once
in his whole life, and when it was my turn, it was canceled,” Mr. Turk
said. “I’m very upset because I’m not sure if I’ll be alive in the next
few days, let alone next year.”

Since the first hajj in 632, Muslims have traveled to Mecca in the face
of hardship, adversity and disasters, gradually transforming the
pilgrimage from an elite pursuit limited to small numbers of people into
one of the world’s largest Muslim gatherings.

For centuries, it was a feat just to make it to Mecca in one piece.

Under the Ottoman Empire, camel-riding pilgrims crossed the vast deserts
of Arabia in giant caravans that set out from Cairo or Damascus in a
journey often taking six weeks and vulnerable to attacks by Bedouin
bandits.

Others came by sea, braving storms, disease outbreaks in crowded ships,
and other threats. In 1502, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama,
battling for control of trade routes, captured a ship filled with
pilgrims as it returned from Mecca, set it on fire and killed several
hundred people. In the 19th century, periodic cholera epidemics killed
thousands of pilgrims.

The Suez Canal shortened the sea voyage for many after it opened in
1869, and the advent of motor vehicles eased the land voyage starting in
the 1920s. Even then, numbers remained low: The hajj of 1929 registered
66,000 pilgrims.

The numbers started soaring in the 1970s, as mass air travel became more
affordable, and Saudi rulers recognized that the pilgrimage brought not
just religious prestige but also income. The hajj currently earns the
kingdom billions of dollars a
year.

Since the 1990s, the pilgrimage has been marred by stampedes, giant tent
fires and worries about outbreaks of diseases such as SARS or, more
recently, MERS. The deadliest stampede occurred in 2015 when [more
than 2,200 people
died](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/12/11/world/middleeast/death-toll-from-hajj-stampede.html).

Despite the periodic tragedies, the Saudi authorities never canceled it.

The cancellation weighs particularly heavily on older Muslims who have
been waiting for years to go in hopes that they can fulfill their
religious obligation before death.

“I have been dreaming about it for 20 years and I hoped to do it before
I got this old,” said Firiyan al-Masri, 68, a woman from Beirut.

Finally this year, she got her name on the list of a Lebanese Islamic
association that finances trips for those in need, only to see her
chances dashed by the pandemic.

“If God wills it, I will do the pilgrimage next year,” she said. “If I
am still alive.”
