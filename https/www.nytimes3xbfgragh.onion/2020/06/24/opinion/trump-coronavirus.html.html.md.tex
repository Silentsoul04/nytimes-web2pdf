``It's going away'' only in the president's delusion.

President Trump says the coronavirus is
``\href{https://time.com/5855541/trump-coronavirus-fade-away/}{fading
away}'' and pats himself on the back for
``\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1275438921552257026}{a
great job} on CoronaVirus'' that saved ``millions of U.S. lives.''

``It's going away,'' Trump
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/23/trump-rally-arizona-336565}{said}
Tuesday at a packed megachurch in Phoenix where few people wore masks.

That's what delusion sounds like. We need a Churchill to lead our nation
against a deadly challenge; instead, we have a president who helps an
enemy virus infiltrate our churches and homes. Churchill and Roosevelt
worked to deceive the enemy; Trump is trying to deceive us.

For a reality check, look at this map by my colleague Nathaniel Lash
showing how much of America is trending in the wrong direction.

New York Times collection of data from state and local health agencies
and hospitals

By Nathaniel Lash \textbar{} New York Times

A few glimpses of the challenge:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Texas, California, Arizona and four other states reported record
  numbers of cases this week.
\item
  Some 27 states, by the count of the
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{Times
  tracker}, are reporting increasing numbers of new cases. Ten states
  and Washington, D.C., are reporting declining numbers, with the rest
  holding steady.
\item
  Arizona, where Trump held his rally, now has the
  \href{https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/}{highest number of new cases
  per day} per million population, and the highest share of positive
  test results.
\end{itemize}

Black Lives Matter protests do not seem to have spread the virus much,
perhaps because they were held outside and many participants wore masks.
The virus is spreading most quickly in Trump Country in the South and
Southwest and in both red and blue states in the West.

``The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to
address those surges that we're seeing in Florida, in Texas, in Arizona,
and other states,'' Dr. Anthony Fauci
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/fauci-congress-coronavirus.html}{told}
a congressional hearing on Tuesday.

The rest of the world is watching aghast.

``What's happened in the U.S. is utterly tragic, and seems like a
consequence of appalling leadership and incompetent government,'' said
Devi Sridhar, an American who is a professor of global health at the
University of Edinburgh. ``Those of us abroad are watching in horror,
disbelief and pity.''

``This is a warning to other countries of the dangers of the virus going
out of control,'' she said.

The European Union is even
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/world/europe/coronavirus-EU-American-travel-ban.html}{preparing
to bar} American visitors because of the United States' failure to
manage the coronavirus properly. Visitors from countries that have
controlled the virus better, like Vietnam, Cuba and Uganda, will be
welcome.

That's humiliating for the United States, but it should be a wake-up
call as well. Europe is right to fear American visitors. The United
States hasn't brought down case numbers the way European countries have,
and seems to simply accept a vast continuing toll of deaths.

Look at this graph of new Covid-19 cases in the European Union versus
the United States, with Canada and Australia thrown in for good measure:

Shows 7-day rolling average of newly reported cases

Our World in Data

By Nathaniel Lash \textbar{} New York Times

The United States is now reporting new cases at
\href{https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus}{nine times} the rate of
Europe, per million people.

In the New York region, memories are fresh, people are scared and the
virus is under control. But in much of the rest of the country, the
virus initially seemed remote, and people relaxed in ways that are now
leading to a crisis.

I passed through Phoenix twice last month
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/30/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-native-americans.html}{to
report on Covid-19 cases in the Navajo Nation}, and I was horrified then
by how few Arizonans wore masks. Now we see the consequences.

Deaths are still below their peaks because for now it's
disproportionately younger people getting sick. That may change.

``I wonder how many fathers got a Father's Day present from their kids
--- this virus,'' reflected Michael T. Osterholm, a University of
Minnesota epidemiologist.

While some epidemiologists expect a second wave to arrive this fall,
Osterholm foresees more of a relentless toll of sickness and death. He
anticipates spikes in this city or that --- he fears Houston may become
the next New York --- but not much of a reprieve.

``I think it's going to keep going on,'' he told me. But he also
emphasizes that even the experts don't really understand the virus or
know what to anticipate.

His advice: Be humble and be bold, and make rigorous preparations.

We don't know for sure, but the post-peak experience from New York and
Europe as well as from street protests, offers some guidance: If people
wear masks, distance as much as possible and avoid mixing indoors, it
just might be possible to keep the virus in check.

Instead, our president refuses to wear a mask and brings people together
indoors to cheer his newest proposed strategy, which in his words is
``slow the testing down.'' After aides rushed to say he was joking,
Trump denied that, saying,
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-slow-down-testing-coronavirus-i-dont-kid/}{``I
don't kid.''} He amplified in
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1275381670561095682}{a
tweet}: ``With smaller testing, we would show fewer cases!''

Yes, and by ending cancer screenings, we would reduce cancer rates. By
locking hospital doors, we would reduce hospitalizations. And if we
stopped issuing death certificates, Americans would achieve immortality!

That's the kind of strategizing that has led the United States, with 4
percent of the world's population, to experience one-quarter of the
deaths worldwide from the coronavirus --- and instead of ``fading
away,'' it's surging.
