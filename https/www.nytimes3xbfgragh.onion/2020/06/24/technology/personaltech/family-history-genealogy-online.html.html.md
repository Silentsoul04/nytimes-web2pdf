Long before the internet made it easy to share the nuances of daily
life, [local
newspapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_online_newspaper_archives#United_States)
and other regional publications reported the business, society and civic
news of the people in the community. For budding genealogists, finding
an ancestor in an old microfilmed newspaper and reading contemporaneous
accounts of her turn in the school play or his all-city bowling
championship provide a glimpse into the past that’s more textured than a
chart of names and dates.

Taking a more narrative approach to the family story can be a
time-consuming detective project with no guaranteed results. But once
you have a name and know when and where the person lived, you can start
your quest to find out *how* they lived. Here’s how to get started.

## Digging Up Your Roots

If you’re just beginning to climb your family tree and need names on the
branches, a subscription service like
[Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com/) or
[MyHeritage](https://www.myheritage.com) can be an easy place to start
gathering information. In addition to billions of digitized records
(like census data, draft rolls and religious registries), these services
include tutorials, articles, message boards and other tools to help
learn you learn how to find your
people.

<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0" data-aria-hidden="true">Large
subscription genealogy services like Ancestry host billions of
historical records from the National Archives and elsewhere that you can

New York Times</span></span>

</div>

</div>

When you get some names pinned to your tree, you may also start to
receive hints of possible undiscovered relatives from the site’s
algorithms or the service’s other members to help you along. If you’re
not sure you want to commit to a regular subscription fee, look for a
free trial period.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Finding Alternative Resources

Sleuthing on a budget? Visit the [National
Archives](https://www.archives.gov) site and its [“Resources for
Genealogists”](https://www.archives.gov/research/genealogy) page for
links to information on finding [land
records](https://www.archives.gov/research/land/land-records),
[immigration](https://www.archives.gov/research/immigration) and
[naturalization](https://www.archives.gov/research/immigration/naturalization)
documents, [census](https://www.archives.gov/research/genealogy/census)
data, [military-service papers](https://www.archives.gov/veterans), and
more. While not all government records may be free or digitized, the
National Archives hosts a [page of
links](https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/ethnic-heritage.html)
from other genealogy sites where you can look for information.

Some ancestors are harder to trace than others. For families severed by
slavery or overlooked by government, the site has an [Ethnic
Heritage](https://www.archives.gov/research/genealogy/ethnic-heritage)
section with tips for finding
[African-American](https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans#toc-online-resources)
ancestors, as well as for those searching for
[Chinese](https://www.archives.gov/research/chinese-americans),
[Hispanic/Latino](https://www.archives.gov/research/hispanic),
[Japanese](https://www.archives.gov/research/japanese-americans) or
[Native American](https://www.archives.gov/research/native-americans)
forebears.

[FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/en/), run by the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, requires only a free account to
search its billions of historical records.
[Geni.com](https://www.geni.com) (owned by MyHeritage) has free basic
family-tree building services and a large social community that
encourages members to work together. Immigration museums may also have
free online databases, like the [Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island
Foundation Passenger
Search](https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger).

## Diving Into the Archives

Once you have pinned your ancestors to specific places and years, look
for local media from that time. Business dealings, town government
activity, social gatherings and obituaries were often reported in 19th-
and 20th-century papers. But be warned: In addition to sometimes florid
writing, articles from certain eras and areas can be rife with the
unchecked misogyny, racism and xenophobia of the day.

The [Newspaper Archives, Indexes and
Morgues](http://www.loc.gov/rr/news/oltitles.html) section of the
[Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov) site has links to many
digitized publications, including
[African-American](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/?state=&ethnicity=African+American&language=),
[Cherokee](https://www.wdl.org/en/search/?collection=cherokee-phoenix-and-indians-advocate-newspaper&grouping=15576)
and
[Mexican-American](http://contentdm-landing.library.arizona.edu/contentdm/mmap/)
newspapers.

[The Ancestor Hunt](https://www.theancestorhunt.com) genealogy site has
a section devoted to [finding historical newspapers
online](https://www.theancestorhunt.com/newspaper-research-links.html),
and the [Elephind](https://elephind.com) site lets you search a growing
collection of digitized international newspapers. Some archives are
free, some charge to view the microfilmed images, and search
capabilities
vary.

[Newspapers.com](https://www.newspapers.com) is an archive with more
than 17,000 digitized publications dating from the 1700s. After the free
trial, subscriptions start at about $8 a month, but you can
[search](https://www.newspapers.com/basics/#h-search),
[clip](https://www.newspapers.com/basics/#h-clips), [save and
print](https://www.newspapers.com/basics/#h-print) the articles you
find.

## Finding Further Reading

Libraries and [historical/genealogical
societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_societies#County_and_local_societies)
may also have books and periodicals that recorded the development of the
area and the people who lived there, although you may have to visit in
person to look at the original material if it has not been scanned.
(Some libraries also offer free access to the commercial genealogy
services.)

As settlements grew, local historians often wrote books that chronicled
that development and its founding families. Many of these volumes are
now digitized in the public domain; search [Google
Books](https://books.google.com) or the [Internet
Archive](https://archive.org) for the town or county in question.

Your relatives may also appear in the [vital records
bureaus](https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/United_States_Vital_Records)
of the states where they lived. The [RootsWeb](https://www.rootsweb.com)
site offers tips on searching in its [Red
Book](https://wiki.rootsweb.com/wiki/index.php/Red_Book:_American_State,_County,_and_Town_Sources)
collection of American state, county and town
resources.

still growing and often includes published obituaries and photos of
grave sites so you can remotely visit and see where your ancestors
ultimately landed.
