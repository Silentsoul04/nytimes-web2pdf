A [Wisconsin state
senator](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/wisconsin-tim-carpenter-attacked.html)
said he was assaulted by protesters in Madison late Tuesday, amid
demonstrations against racism and police violence around the city in
which two statues were toppled.

The senator, [Tim
Carpenter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/wisconsin-tim-carpenter-attacked.html),
a Democrat who represents areas in Milwaukee, said that the incident
took place after he took a cellphone
[video](https://twitter.com/TimCarpenterMKE/status/1275716467007328258)
of protesters, who had been marching through downtown Madison for
several hours.

Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin condemned the violence on Tuesday night,
saying that Mr. Carpenter was “among the individuals attacked last
night.” He said that the demonstrations “presented a stark contrast from
the peaceful protests we have seen across our state in recent weeks,”
adding that he was ready to activate the Wisconsin National Guard “to
protect state buildings and infrastructure.”

Protesters on Tuesday brought down statues of an abolitionist, [Hans
Christian Heg](https://www.nps.gov/people/hans-heg.htm), who died
fighting for the Union in the Civil War, and a replica of Madison’s
[“Forward”
figure](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2752), an
allegorical work designed in the 1890s meant to embody the state’s
motto. The demonstrations targeting those statues contrasted with
similar protests in other cities and states where statues of Confederate
and colonial figures have been removed by protesters or the authorities.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Carpenter [told The Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/06/24/madison-protesters-pull-down-forward-hans-christian-heg-statues-attack-senator-sculptures-in-lake/3247948001/)
that he’d stopped to take a photo of the protests, and he posted a video
on Twitter that showed a large group of protesters standing in the
street near the Capitol shouting. Two protesters can be seen running
over to Mr. Carpenter, and one grabs his phone. The camera swerves.

“Leave my phone alone,” he can be heard saying. “Delete it\!” a woman
says. As news of the confrontation spread on social media, Mr. Carpenter
tweeted that taking the images “got me assaulted & beat up” by eight to
10 people. He said that he may have had a concussion, that the vision in
his left eye was blurry, and that he had a sore neck and ribs.

“This has to stop before some innocent person get killed,” he
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/TimCarpenterMKE/status/1275710960171397121)
early Wednesday. “I locked up in the Capitol until it’s safe.”

Mr. Carpenter could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman
for the Madison Police did not immediately respond to messages seeking
more information.

A member of Mr. Carpenter’s office said its staff had no details about
his condition on Wednesday morning. “He’s seeking medical attention at
this time, that’s all we know,” he said.

In one photo [shared by a reporter on social
media](https://twitter.com/telldylan/status/1275657586377965576), a man
identified as Mr. Carpenter, in a blue T-shirt, appears to be in a
confrontation with protesters. In others, he can be seen
[kneeling](https://twitter.com/lawrencegandrea/status/1275658434348748800)
and [lying](https://twitter.com/lanceveeser/status/1275664180994080768)
on the ground. A local news station, WKOW 27, [reported that he
collapsed in front of its news
crew](https://wkow.com/2020/06/24/watch-senator-shares-video-showing-attack/)
and that they stayed with him until an ambulance arrived.

In a statement to [The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/24/madison-police-protest-senator/),
Mr. Carpenter said, “Sad thing I’m on their side for peaceful
demonstrations — am a Gay Progressive Dem Senator served 36 years in the
legislature.”

Demonstrations have taken place in Madison for weeks, alongside those
across the country, protesting police violence against black people in
the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody. On
Tuesday night, they intensified after the arrest of a black activist,
identified as Devonere Johnson by the police, at a restaurant near the
Capitol.

[Video of the
arrest](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/100003369941337/videos/pcb.2877429162379387/2877427369046233)shared
on social media showed officers struggling with the man on the sidewalk,
including pulling him by the legs and carrying his body to force him
into a police car. He briefly runs from the car, and is again caught.

The police [released a
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSgI0vCoLMY&feature=youtu.be)
that they said shows the man speaking into a megaphone and holding a
baseball bat in the restaurant. The department said in a statement that
officers were trying to arrest him after “his actions inside the
restaurant.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The police later said that 200 to 300 people marched through downtown
Madison late Tuesday night and into Wednesday, breaking windows at the
City County Building and [throwing a Molotov
cocktail](https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=26631)
into it. Mr. Carpenter and at least one other person was attacked during
the protest, said Alder Michael E. Verveer.

Mr. Verveer said that protesters beheaded the statue of Heg and threw it
into Lake Monona, and that they dragged the Forward statue down State
Street. Police retrieved both statues on Wednesday and they are being
held in a city facility.

Mr. Evers said that protesters were prevented from entering the building
by Capitol Police, and that demonstrators had done “significant damage”
to state property.

“Violence against any person — whether in the middle of the street in
broad daylight, at home trying to sleep, going for a run, or happening
upon a protest as was the case last night — is wrong,” the governor said
in [a
statement.](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WIGOV/bulletins/2925906)
“Any single act of injustice against one person is less justice for all
of us, and the people who committed these acts of violence will be held
accountable.”

Ebony Anderson-Carter, one of the protesters, told The Madison State
Journal that [demonstrators tore down the
statues](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime-and-courts/protesters-tear-down-statues-punch-senator-set-small-fire-after-arrest-of-black-activist/article_8356b4c1-4dbf-52ff-9d5b-cadb98bf5356.html#tracking-source=home-top-story-1)
because they did not feel that the state was doing enough to fight
racial injustice.

Displaying those statues in Madison creates a “false representation of
what this city is,” Ms. Anderson-Carter said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

State Senator Roger Roth, the State Senate president, said in an
interview that the city of Madison should not tolerate violent protests
and needed to instill law and order.

“They terrorized the Capitol,” he said. “What we need is for people to
stand up and say there is a vast difference between peaceful, nonviolent
protesters and these radical, woke mobs.”
