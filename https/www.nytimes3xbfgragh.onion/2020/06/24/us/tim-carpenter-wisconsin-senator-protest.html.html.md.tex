A
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/wisconsin-tim-carpenter-attacked.html}{Wisconsin
state senator} said he was assaulted by protesters in Madison late
Tuesday, amid demonstrations against racism and police violence around
the city in which two statues were toppled.

The senator,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/wisconsin-tim-carpenter-attacked.html}{Tim
Carpenter}, a Democrat who represents areas in Milwaukee, said that the
incident took place after he took a cellphone
\href{https://twitter.com/TimCarpenterMKE/status/1275716467007328258}{video}
of protesters, who had been marching through downtown Madison for
several hours.

Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin condemned the violence on Tuesday night,
saying that Mr. Carpenter was ``among the individuals attacked last
night.'' He said that the demonstrations ``presented a stark contrast
from the peaceful protests we have seen across our state in recent
weeks,'' adding that he was ready to activate the Wisconsin National
Guard ``to protect state buildings and infrastructure.''

Protesters on Tuesday brought down statues of an abolitionist,
\href{https://www.nps.gov/people/hans-heg.htm}{Hans Christian Heg}, who
died fighting for the Union in the Civil War, and a replica of Madison's
\href{https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2752}{``Forward''
figure}, an allegorical work designed in the 1890s meant to embody the
state's motto. The demonstrations targeting those statues contrasted
with similar protests in other cities and states where statues of
Confederate and colonial figures have been removed by protesters or the
authorities.

Mr. Carpenter
\href{https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/06/24/madison-protesters-pull-down-forward-hans-christian-heg-statues-attack-senator-sculptures-in-lake/3247948001/}{told
The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel} that he'd stopped to take a photo of the
protests, and he posted a video on Twitter that showed a large group of
protesters standing in the street near the Capitol shouting. Two
protesters can be seen running over to Mr. Carpenter, and one grabs his
phone. The camera swerves.

``Leave my phone alone,'' he can be heard saying. ``Delete it!'' a woman
says. As news of the confrontation spread on social media, Mr. Carpenter
tweeted that taking the images ``got me assaulted \& beat up'' by eight
to 10 people. He said that he may have had a concussion, that the vision
in his left eye was blurry, and that he had a sore neck and ribs.

``This has to stop before some innocent person get killed,'' he
\href{https://twitter.com/TimCarpenterMKE/status/1275710960171397121}{tweeted}
early Wednesday. ``I locked up in the Capitol until it's safe.''

Mr. Carpenter could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman
for the Madison Police did not immediately respond to messages seeking
more information.

A member of Mr. Carpenter's office said its staff had no details about
his condition on Wednesday morning. ``He's seeking medical attention at
this time, that's all we know,'' he said.

In one photo
\href{https://twitter.com/telldylan/status/1275657586377965576}{shared
by a reporter on social media}, a man identified as Mr. Carpenter, in a
blue T-shirt, appears to be in a confrontation with protesters. In
others, he can be seen
\href{https://twitter.com/lawrencegandrea/status/1275658434348748800}{kneeling}
and
\href{https://twitter.com/lanceveeser/status/1275664180994080768}{lying}
on the ground. A local news station, WKOW 27,
\href{https://wkow.com/2020/06/24/watch-senator-shares-video-showing-attack/}{reported
that he collapsed in front of its news crew} and that they stayed with
him until an ambulance arrived.

In a statement to
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/24/madison-police-protest-senator/}{The
Washington Post}, Mr. Carpenter said, ``Sad thing I'm on their side for
peaceful demonstrations --- am a Gay Progressive Dem Senator served 36
years in the legislature.''

Demonstrations have taken place in Madison for weeks, alongside those
across the country, protesting police violence against black people in
the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody. On
Tuesday night, they intensified after the arrest of a black activist,
identified as Devonere Johnson by the police, at a restaurant near the
Capitol.

\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/100003369941337/videos/pcb.2877429162379387/2877427369046233}{Video
of the arrest}shared on social media showed officers struggling with the
man on the sidewalk, including pulling him by the legs and carrying his
body to force him into a police car. He briefly runs from the car, and
is again caught.

The police
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSgI0vCoLMY\&feature=youtu.be}{released
a video} that they said shows the man speaking into a megaphone and
holding a baseball bat in the restaurant. The department said in a
statement that officers were trying to arrest him after ``his actions
inside the restaurant.''

The police later said that 200 to 300 people marched through downtown
Madison late Tuesday night and into Wednesday, breaking windows at the
City County Building and
\href{https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=26631}{throwing
a Molotov cocktail} into it. Mr. Carpenter and at least one other person
was attacked during the protest, said Alder Michael E. Verveer.

Mr. Verveer said that protesters beheaded the statue of Heg and threw it
into Lake Monona, and that they dragged the Forward statue down State
Street. Police retrieved both statues on Wednesday and they are being
held in a city facility.

Mr. Evers said that protesters were prevented from entering the building
by Capitol Police, and that demonstrators had done ``significant
damage'' to state property.

``Violence against any person --- whether in the middle of the street in
broad daylight, at home trying to sleep, going for a run, or happening
upon a protest as was the case last night --- is wrong,'' the governor
said in
\href{https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WIGOV/bulletins/2925906}{a
statement.} ``Any single act of injustice against one person is less
justice for all of us, and the people who committed these acts of
violence will be held accountable.''

Ebony Anderson-Carter, one of the protesters, told The Madison State
Journal that
\href{https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime-and-courts/protesters-tear-down-statues-punch-senator-set-small-fire-after-arrest-of-black-activist/article_8356b4c1-4dbf-52ff-9d5b-cadb98bf5356.html\#tracking-source=home-top-story-1}{demonstrators
tore down the statues} because they did not feel that the state was
doing enough to fight racial injustice.

Displaying those statues in Madison creates a ``false representation of
what this city is,'' Ms. Anderson-Carter said.

State Senator Roger Roth, the State Senate president, said in an
interview that the city of Madison should not tolerate violent protests
and needed to instill law and order.

``They terrorized the Capitol,'' he said. ``What we need is for people
to stand up and say there is a vast difference between peaceful,
nonviolent protesters and these radical, woke mobs.''
