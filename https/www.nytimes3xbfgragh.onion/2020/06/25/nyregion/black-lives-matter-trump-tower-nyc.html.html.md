# ‘Black Lives Matter’ Will Be Painted on Street Outside Trump Tower

</div>

Mayor de Blasio’s plan drew an inflammatory response from the president,
who used it to try to stoke tensions between protesters and the police.

Mayor Bill de Blasio has ignited a new feud with President Trump by
ordering the words “Black Lives Matter” to be painted in large yellow
letters [on the street outside of Trump
Tower](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/nyregion/blm-trump-tower.html).

The words are expected to be painted in the coming week on Fifth Avenue,
between 56th and 57th Streets, according to the city.

“The president is a disgrace to the values we cherish in New York City,”
Julia Arredondo, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said in a statement on
Thursday. “He can’t run or deny the reality we are facing, and any time
he wants to set foot in the place he claims is his hometown, he should
be reminded Black Lives Matter.”

In a [tweet in
response](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1276206200393064449),
Mr. Trump referenced Mr. de Blasio’s plan to paint “the fabled &
beautiful Fifth Avenue, right in front of Trump Tower/Tiffany” and
sought to play up animosity between the Black Lives Matter movement and
the police in New York City.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump falsely said in the tweet that [Black Lives
Matter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/nyregion/blm-trump-tower.html)
protesters in the city had shouted chants encouraging the killing of
police officers.

“‘Pigs in a Blanket, Fry ‘Em Like Bacon’, referring to killing Police,
is their chant,” Mr. Trump said, an apparent reference [to a chant at a
protest](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pigs-in-a-blanket-chant-at-minnesota-fair-riles-police/)
in 2015 in Minnesota.

A scene from that protest had recently appeared in a segment on Tucker
Carlson’s show on Fox News.

“NYC Police are furious\!” Mr. Trump added in the tweet.

Mr. Trump, who has a [history of denigrating black
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/trump-race-racism-protests.html),
said in another tweet on Thursday that a leader of Black Lives Matter in
the New York area had committed treason in statements he made about
burning down “the system” if meaningful change did not materialize.

The White House did not immediately answer questions about Mr. Trump’s
tweet or the statement from Mr. de Blasio’s office.

The snipes from [Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/nyregion/blm-trump-tower.html)
came as New York City continued to see protests against racism and
police brutality sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Mr. de Blasio and the Police Department had come under fire earlier this
month for [their aggressive handling of
protesters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/nyregion/nypd-leticia-james-hearing-protests.html).

Mr. de Blasio has [also been losing black
supporters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/nyregion/de-blasio-blacks-protest.html).
Some of those supporters say that the mayor has benefited politically
from his pledges to overhaul the Police Department, but has failed to
deliver on them.

In planning to paint the words, Mr. de Blasio’s tactics mirrored those
of Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, who had city workers paint “Black
Lives Matter” in giant yellow letters outside the White House amid
[tensions with the president over his deployment of federal
officers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/upshot/george-floyd-protests-dc-statehood.html)
during protests there. Similar murals have cropped up in other cities.

In New York, the street mural outside of Trump Tower will be one of
several created by the city. One Black Lives Matter mural has already
been painted in Staten Island, on Richmond Terrace, between Hamilton
Avenue and the Ferry Terminal Viaduct. Two others will be painted in
Manhattan, and Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx will each get a mural.
Details were not immediately available about specifically where those
murals will be and when they will be painted.

Another [mural with bold yellow letters was painted this
month](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-lives-matter-mural-new-york-city-brooklyn/)
by artists and volunteers on a street in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant
neighborhood.
