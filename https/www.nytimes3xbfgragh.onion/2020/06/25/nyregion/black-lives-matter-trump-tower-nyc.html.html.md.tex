Mayor de Blasio's plan drew an inflammatory response from the president,
who used it to try to stoke tensions between protesters and the police.

Mayor Bill de Blasio has ignited a new feud with President Trump by
ordering the words ``Black Lives Matter'' to be painted in large yellow
letters
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/nyregion/blm-trump-tower.html}{on
the street outside of Trump Tower}.

The words are expected to be painted in the coming week on Fifth Avenue,
between 56th and 57th Streets, according to the city.

``The president is a disgrace to the values we cherish in New York
City,'' Julia Arredondo, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said in a
statement on Thursday. ``He can't run or deny the reality we are facing,
and any time he wants to set foot in the place he claims is his
hometown, he should be reminded Black Lives Matter.''

In a
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1276206200393064449}{tweet
in response}, Mr. Trump referenced Mr. de Blasio's plan to paint ``the
fabled \& beautiful Fifth Avenue, right in front of Trump
Tower/Tiffany'' and sought to play up animosity between the Black Lives
Matter movement and the police in New York City.

Mr. Trump falsely said in the tweet that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/nyregion/blm-trump-tower.html}{Black
Lives Matter} protesters in the city had shouted chants encouraging the
killing of police officers.

```Pigs in a Blanket, Fry `Em Like Bacon', referring to killing Police,
is their chant,'' Mr. Trump said, an apparent reference
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pigs-in-a-blanket-chant-at-minnesota-fair-riles-police/}{to
a chant at a protest} in 2015 in Minnesota.

A scene from that protest had recently appeared in a segment on Tucker
Carlson's show on Fox News.

``NYC Police are furious!'' Mr. Trump added in the tweet.

Mr. Trump, who has a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/trump-race-racism-protests.html}{history
of denigrating black people}, said in another tweet on Thursday that a
leader of Black Lives Matter in the New York area had committed treason
in statements he made about burning down ``the system'' if meaningful
change did not materialize.

The White House did not immediately answer questions about Mr. Trump's
tweet or the statement from Mr. de Blasio's office.

The snipes from
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/nyregion/blm-trump-tower.html}{Mr.
Trump} came as New York City continued to see protests against racism
and police brutality sparked by the killing of George Floyd in
Minneapolis. Mr. de Blasio and the Police Department had come under fire
earlier this month for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/nyregion/nypd-leticia-james-hearing-protests.html}{their
aggressive handling of protesters}.

Mr. de Blasio has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/nyregion/de-blasio-blacks-protest.html}{also
been losing black supporters}. Some of those supporters say that the
mayor has benefited politically from his pledges to overhaul the Police
Department, but has failed to deliver on them.

In planning to paint the words, Mr. de Blasio's tactics mirrored those
of Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, who had city workers paint ``Black
Lives Matter'' in giant yellow letters outside the White House amid
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/upshot/george-floyd-protests-dc-statehood.html}{tensions
with the president over his deployment of federal officers} during
protests there. Similar murals have cropped up in other cities.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/06/25/nyregion/NYUNREST-TRUMPTOWER2/merlin_173629047_2f9731cc-28d1-4a06-8f21-93fa452b8d1c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

In New York, the street mural outside of Trump Tower will be one of
several created by the city. One Black Lives Matter mural has already
been painted in Staten Island, on Richmond Terrace, between Hamilton
Avenue and the Ferry Terminal Viaduct. Two others will be painted in
Manhattan, and Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx will each get a mural.
Details were not immediately available about specifically where those
murals will be and when they will be painted.

Another
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-lives-matter-mural-new-york-city-brooklyn/}{mural
with bold yellow letters was painted this month} by artists and
volunteers on a street in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.
