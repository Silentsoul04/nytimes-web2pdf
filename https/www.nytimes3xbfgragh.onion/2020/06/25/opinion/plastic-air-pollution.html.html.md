LOGAN, Utah — We weren’t looking for what we found.

My research group was trying to determine how much phosphorous was being
carried by wind and rain into some of the most remote regions of the
West and how this nutrient might affect lakes and streams. To do so, we
sampled dust in 11 scattered locations, from Joshua Tree National Park
in California to the Wind River Range in Wyoming.

Back at the lab, peering through microscopes at our samples, we could
see pollen, insect parts and bits of minerals — all of which would have
made it just another day in the life of a dust scientist. But what made
it different was an unexpected interloper: tiny bits of plastic, most
from synthetic microfibers used for making clothing. They were in all of
our samples. And lots of them.

There was so much microplastic, [we
calculated](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6496/1257) that
up to 6 percent of the dusts in those far-flung locations are
microplastics and that more than 1,000 metric tons are deposited in
those places every year by wind and rain. Some blew in from nearby
cities, but most came from much farther away and represented decades of
plastic waste. Four colleagues and I recently published [our
findings](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6496/1257) in the
journal Science.

This waste has become so ubiquitous that it’s now in the air we breathe.
Airborne microplastics don’t care what ZIP code you live in. Preventing
a landfill in your community won’t limit your exposure. And there are
still many questions. If dust in the Grand Canyon contains
microplastics, how many of these tiny plastic particles are in city
dust? How high will airborne concentrations of microplastics get? What
effect are they having on the environment? Are microplastics more toxic
than other, better-understood sources of air pollution such as natural
and industrial dusts?

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We know that inhaled plastics can produce inflammation and lesions in
lungs, and repeated exposure is suspected of leading to respiratory
problems like asthma and cancer. Inhaling microplastics may also
increase exposure to other toxic substances and coatings associated with
plastics and their manufacture.

Natural dust, which include dusts generated by humans, and industrial
dusts can also contain dangerous components, like the pathogen
Coccidioides, a soil-borne fungus that causes [valley
fever](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761),
which can produce flulike symptoms. Industrial, urban and agricultural
dusts often contain heavy metals as well as synthetic toxins. Outdoor
air pollution causes roughly [seven million premature deaths a
year](https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/)
and is associated with [pulmonary
diseases](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199312093292401),
even when adjusted for underlying risk factors. Those statistics most
likely include some of the effects of plastic. That we can breathe in
microplastics [has been
known](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/cebp/7/5/419.full.pdf) for
decades. We just haven’t fully appreciated the scale of the problem.But
as Steve Allen, who does research on microplastics at the University of
Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, [put it
recently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/06/14/national-parks-deep-sea-plastic-pollution-is-showing-up-wherever-scientists-look/)
to The Washington Post, “It is hard to imagine a sentence starting with:
‘The health benefits of breathing airborne microplastic ….’”

We shouldn’t be surprised by these findings. In 2018, about [359 million
metric
tons](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282732/global-production-of-plastics-since-1950/)
of plastics were produced worldwide. Plastics are useful, of course, and
we need them for medicine, food safety and technology. But do we really
need plastic lawn decorations for every holiday? The plastic pollution
crisis seems to have as much to do with industry as it does with
consumer choices. A [2017
study](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700782.full) in the
journal Science Advances estimated that “if current production and waste
management trends continue, roughly 12 billion metric tons of plastic
waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.”

Movements against plastics pollution have led to bans on plastic straws
and plastic bags, and microbeads in cosmetics. But airborne
microplastics mostly come from clothing, car tires and the fragmentation
of commodities and packaging used briefly and then thrown away,
sometimes decades ago.

Reducing plastic waste means taking aim at consumer comfort and
convenience, and offering sustainable alternatives to plastics for those
on all rungs of the economic ladder.

The path forward to cleaning up this problem is not clear but
undoubtedly will require sweeping and uncomfortable changes. Taking on
this issue requires understanding it, and as our findings underscore,
one thing is clear: We’re breathing in microplastics. That can’t be
good.
