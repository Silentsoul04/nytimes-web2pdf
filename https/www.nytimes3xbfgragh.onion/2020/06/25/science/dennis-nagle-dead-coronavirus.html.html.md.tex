\section{Dennis Nagle, Free Spirit With an Engineer's Mind, Dies at
78}\label{dennis-nagle-free-spirit-with-an-engineers-mind-dies-at-78}}

He lived a life of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll before settling into a
fulfilling job at M.I.T. late in life. He died of the coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

In his youth, Dennis Nagle resembled Dennis Hopper's character in ``Easy
Rider'': same bushy counterculture mustache and long hair, same pirate's
smile and wild glint in his eyes. And like the film character, Mr. Nagle
embraced 1960s-style hedonism full on.

He was a big proponent of marijuana and psychedelics. He spent the '70s
living in England, where he ran with a fast crowd in London and, his
oldest son, Alex, said, made his living in the illegal drug trade. By
the time the '80s rolled around, he had fathered four children with four
women.

As disorganized as his personal life was, Mr. Nagle had the focused
technical mind of an engineer. He could fix anything. He loved visual
art, and throughout his life he built light boxes, attaching LEDs to
tiny motors to create hypnotic patterns of light. A wellspring of
knowledge lived within him.

``He taught me how to change the brakes on my car and told me all about
Andy Warhol's Factory,'' said Alex Nagle, who knew his father only as a
mythic character until, at 18, he tracked him down in Los Angeles.
Dennis Nagle had moved there from England and was working for a company
that did sound and lighting for rock concerts.

Mr. Nagle died on April 24 at the Bedford Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in Bedford, Mass. He was 78. The cause was complications of the
novel coronavirus, his youngest son, Michael, said.

It was while living in Los Angeles and raising Michael that Mr. Nagle
began to settle down. When Michael enrolled at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2001, Mr. Nagle followed him east to
Cambridge, Mass. Father and son roomed together there.

In 2007, Mr. Nagle found a job as workshop manager and instructor at
M.I.T.'s D-Lab, which uses design and technology to assist people in the
developing world. Mr. Nagle, still a character (now with long, lush
white hair), became the ``shop gnome,'' as he called himself. He brought
order to the lab, made colorful tool boards and used his mechanical
skills to teach students how to build things. He retired in 2015.

In an
\href{https://d-lab.mit.edu/news-blog/blog/remembering-d-lab-workshop-manager-and-instructor-dennis-nagle-1941-2020}{online
tribute} to him, Amy Smith, the founding director of D-Lab, described
Mr. Nagle as ``a fiercely loyal mentor to many students over the years
and was a staunch supporter of the need to balance creativity and order,
fun and work and anarchy and kindness.''

Dennis Patrick Nagle was born on Oct. 29, 1941, in Little Rock, Ark., to
Bernard and Marjorie (Vaughan) Nagle. His father was a career Army
officer, his mother a homemaker. In addition to his sons Alex and
Michael, he is survived by another son, Ben Nagle Hyde; a daughter,
Patty Holloway; and two sisters, Nora Kruplak and Molly Nagle. His three
marriages ended in divorce.

Like his father, Mr. Nagle joined the Army as a young man. He guarded a
missile silo in Greece, taking amphetamines to keep him awake while on
duty, he told Alex. He studied engineering at the University of Rhode
Island but dropped out, embarking on the long, strange trip that lasted
two decades.

Michael Nagle said his father had been someone with ``a tremendous
amount of skill and ingenuity'' who struggled to channel it into a
productive and satisfying career. The job at M.I.T. was a late-in-life
gift, he said, and one that ``gave him a sense of belonging and
balance.''
