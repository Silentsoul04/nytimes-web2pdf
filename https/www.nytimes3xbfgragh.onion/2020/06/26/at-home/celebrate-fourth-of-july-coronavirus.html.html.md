This year, Fourth of July revelers will have to swap many traditions —
peppy parades, large family reunions and patriotic concerts — with
low-key celebrations. But there are plenty of safe ways to commemorate
America’s birthday. Here are some suggestions.

### Watch fireworks, in person or onscreen.

Many cities have canceled their festivities, and with that, the main
draw: fireworks. But some are moving forward. Your best, and safest, bet
is to watch either in your backyard or on a TV or computer screen.

In New York City, [Macy’s fireworks
show](https://www.macys.com/social/fireworks/), a spectacle that usually
beckons residents to rooftops and parks on July 4, will take place on
several unspecified nights from<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Monday through the holiday, with each display lasting only five
minutes. They will be set off from unannounced locations across the five
boroughs — a strategy meant to prevent New Yorkers from congregating in
public spaces. A special presentation featuring a recap of the fireworks
will be televised nationally on July 4 at 8 p.m. Eastern on NBC.

Fireworks will light up Washington during “A Capital Fourth.” The event
traditionally takes place on the West Lawn of the Capitol, but this year
viewers are encouraged to watch from home. The presentation features
recorded performances by stars such as Patti LaBelle and Renée Fleming;
the actors John Stamos and Vanessa Williams will host. Tune in to PBS,
[PBS.org](http://www.pbs.org/a-capitol-fourth), Facebook or YouTube at 8
p.m. Eastern.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Elsewhere, Houston’s “[Shell Freedom Over
Texas](https://www.houstontx.gov/july4/)” celebration has traded its
annual festival on the Buffalo Bayou for a virtual show featuring
fireworks and musical acts, like the Houston Symphony and the country
singer Pat Green. Tune in at 8 p.m. Eastern on
[ABC13.com](https://abc13.com/). Nashville’s “[Let Freedom
Sing\!](https://www.visitmusiccity.com/july4th)” event will honor
workers who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis.
There won’t be a public concert, and Riverfront Park, along the
Cumberland, will be closed to spectators as a precaution. But you can
catch the fireworks show on
[NewsChannel5.com](https://www.newschannel5.com/) at 10 p.m. Eastern.

Other cities haven’t guaranteed fireworks, but they will salute the
country in different ways: Starting
Sunday,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Philadelphia’s weeklong
virtual “[Welcome
America”](https://welcomeamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/brochure_10_compressed.pdf)
festival features cultural programming, fun lessons for children, and
family-friendly workout sessions. It culminates in a concert by the
performers Cynthia Erivo and Jason Derulo.

On the Fourth, [Los
Angeles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/politics/july-4-events-los-angeles.html)
is still having [an annual block party](https://july4.grandparkla.org/)
— this time, the block is onscreen — hosted by Grand Park and the
Music Center, a performing arts venue. There will be musical
performances, a poetry reading, comedy sketches and more. The first hour
can be streamed on [ABC7.com](https://abc7.com/) beginning at 10 p.m.
Eastern; the rest of the event continues [on Grand Park’s website and
Facebook page,
and](https://grandparkla.org/)[MusicCenter.org](http://musiccenter.org/)[.](https://grandparkla.org/)

And the [Boston Pops
Orchestra](https://www.bostonusa.com/event/a-boston-pops-salute-to-our-heroes/65476/)
will pay tribute to front-line workers in a celebration airing on
Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio and Boston’s WHDH-TV at 8 p.m.
Eastern.

Depending on where you live, you may be able to get off your couch and
watch firework shows at drive-ins, a new alternative that at least a few
cities have announced in response to the crisis, among them [North Port,
Fla.](https://www.cityofnorthport.com/government/city-services/parks-recreation/special-events/freedom-festival);
[Auburn,
Ala.](https://news.auburnalabama.org/article/Top%20Stories/3569); and
[Loveland,
Colo](https://www.visitlovelandco.org/event/july-4th-drive-in-fireworks-show/).

Plans are subject to change, so be sure to check for updates.

### Take a virtual tour of national landmarks.

If you typically take this time to visit monuments or educate your
children about American history, the internet has plenty of resources.
The website [Architect’s Virtual
Capitol](https://www.capitol.gov/#THMESEC_2010061447464%7CTHME_2010062211742)
is an immersive look at the heart of federal government. Choose from
several videos about the history of the National Capitol, a virtual
walking tour of its campus or an interactive map of other key sites in
Washington.

Or visit Philadelphia’s Independence National Historical Park, home to
Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and the Benjamin Franklin Museum,
through educational videos, photo galleries and more on the [National
Park Service’s
website](https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/photosmultimedia/index.htm).

While there’s nothing quite like getting an up-close-and-personal look
at the Statue of Liberty, [an interactive virtual
tour](https://www.nps.gov/stli/learn/photosmultimedia/virtualtour.htm)
by the National Park Service comes close. It offers panoramic views of
the statue’s exterior and interior, saving you the strenuous climb.

You can also take a virtual tour of [St. John’s
Church](https://www.historicstjohnschurch.org/virtual-tour) in Richmond,
Va., through its website, or watch educational videos about the Second
Virginia Convention, the weeklong meeting in 1775 where Patrick Henry
delivered his famous “Give me liberty, or give me death” speech to more
than 100 delegates who had gathered to discuss the future of the
colonies.

The Founding Fathers certainly excluded many from their vision, so
consider exploring key moments in the fight against slavery by clicking
through [“The Struggle for African American
Freedom,”](https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/the-struggle-for-african-american-freedom-the-henry-ford/mgIi-GjK9Fx4KA?hl=en)
an online exhibition on Google’s Arts & Culture platform from the Henry
Ford museum complex in Dearborn, Mich. And, while not a national
landmark, the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History in Manhattan
also has a virtual exhibition on Google’s platform titled
[“African-Americans in the U.S.
Military,”](https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/african-americans-in-the-us-military-from-the-revolution-to-the-world-wars/DgJiYQ9uBRWnIw)
detailing African-Americans’ roles in American conflicts, starting with
the
Revolution.

### Watch a movie about the country’s founding.

If you prefer a dose of drama with your history lesson, settle in for a
movie night. And if you have a backyard and a projector, you can set up
an outdoor theater and catch the fireworks as an intermission.

A live recording of
[“Hamilton,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSCKfXpAGHc&feature=youtu.be)
the acclaimed Broadway musical from the writer and its star Lin-Manuel
Miranda, and the director Thomas Kail, arrives on [Disney
Plus](https://www.disneyplus.com/) on Friday.

Or [“1776,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPS-P6yes8A) a 1972 movie
that is also based on a musical, follows the debates at the Second
Continental Congress that led to the drafting and signing of the
Declaration of Independence. (Mr. Miranda has said that “1776” [paved
the
way](https://www.playbill.com/article/lin-manuel-miranda-and-william-daniels-talk-hamilton-1776-mr-feeny-and-more)
for “Hamilton.”) Stream it free on [Pluto
TV](https://pluto.tv/on-demand/movies/1776-1972-1-1?utm_medium=textsearch&utm_source=google),
or rent or buy it on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.70a9f704-1468-1688-82f6-18d97d981c5a?autoplay=1&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb),

[Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/1776-Directors-Cut/26381)
or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COGmVpHWr7s). It will also
air on July 4 on TCM at 2:30 p.m. Eastern.

[“Drums Along the
Mohawk,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1939/11/04/archives/the-screen-john-fords-film-of-drums-along-the-mohawk-opens-at-the.html)
a 1939 adventure based on the novel of the same name, follows a young
settler couple (played by Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert) on the
frontier in central New York during the American Revolution. The movie
was nominated for two Oscars. Rent or buy it on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.2ea9f738-1788-4bcc-5070-04a9b242fad8?autoplay=1&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb),

[Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Drums-Along-the-Mohawk/8506)
or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCw82SzUnBk).

### Revisit the Declaration of Independence.

For the past 50 years, the National Archives in Washington has hosted a
reading ceremony of the Declaration on its museum’s steps. This year,
the event is moving to [its website](http://www.archivesjuly4.org/) and
[Facebook page](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/usnationalarchives/).
The reading starts at 4 p.m. Eastern and is hosted by the broadcast
journalist Soledad O’Brien. Another tradition continues on NPR:
Reporters, hosts, newscasters and commentators will perform their own
reading of the Declaration, which will air on [“Morning
Edition”](https://www.npr.org/) on
Friday<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>at 6:10 a.m. Eastern.

### Celebrate in the kitchen.

If all this time at home has helped you find your inner chef, consider
trying a New York Times Fourth of July recipe, like [gochujang barbecue
ribs](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1018796-gochujang-barbecue-ribs-with-peanuts-and-scallions?action=click&module=Collection%20Page%20Recipe%20Card&region=Really%20Good%20Recipes%20for%20Grilled%20Steak%2C%20Ribs%20%26%20Chops&pgType=collection&rank=7)
with peanuts and scallions or [lemon potato
salad](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1017405-lemon-potato-salad-with-mint?action=click&module=Collection%20Band%20Recipe%20Card&region=Our%20Best%20Picnic-Perfect%20Potato%20Salads&pgType=supercollection&rank=1)
with mint.

Or invite your children to help you prepare some classic patriotic
treats. Think of red, white and blue ingredients, like marshmallows,
whipped cream, cherries, blueberries, strawberries, jam or colored
candy. Of course, the simplest approach never fails: Bake your choice of
dessert, hand over some red, white and blue frosting or sprinkles, and
let your little ones go
crazy.

### Get together (safely).

If you plan on seeing friends or family, keep the fun outside, as
experts have said indoor gatherings pose a huge risk. You could host a
barbecue in your backyard. Space chairs six feet apart, if you have
room, and make it a potluck, so you won’t have to share meals. If you
want to serve food, make sure it’s hot off the grill. ([Here are more
tips](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/06/at-home/coronavirus-how-to-have-friends-over.html)
on how to host during the coronavirus crisis.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Or if space is tight, spend the day on your porch or stoop and organize
a block party with your neighbors. If you have a car, make it a tailgate
party. All it takes is a few chairs, a table and a grill.

Another option is to have a picnic in the park. All you need is a
blanket, some food and good company. (And masks, of course.)

### Play outdoor games.

While team sports can be dangerous, playing baseball with those in your
household is on the safer side. Wear face coverings and gloves, stay six
feet apart from strangers and be sure to wash your equipment afterward.
For more guidance, Little League has released a list of [best
practices](https://www.littleleague.org/downloads/best-practices/) for
teams considering returning to the field.

Or have a water balloon fight. Play with a small group of friends, wash
your hands before making the balloons and don’t aim for anyone’s face.
(Always a good rule, regardless of health concerns.)

You could also try cornhole. Wear gloves to avoid spreading germs
through the beanbags and, if you’re playing in teams of two, wear a
mask.

For a quieter time, test your knowledge of American history with some
trivia. PBS has a quiz [on its
website](http://www.pbs.org/a-capitol-fourth/fireworks-fun/history-quiz/).
You can also create your own and challenge your friends and family.
