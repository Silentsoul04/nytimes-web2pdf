# Kenneth Lewes, Who Challenged Views of Homosexuality, Dies at 76

</div>

In an influential book, he defied the idea that being gay, as he was, is
an illness, and took on psychiatry’s “history of homophobia.” He died of
the coronavirus.

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

Kenneth Lewes grew up after World War II in a working-class neighborhood
of the northeast Bronx, the son of an immigrant couple who never got
beyond grade school. He guessed even before he entered junior high
school that he was gay.

But it wasn’t until he was nearly 50 — and publishing what would become
a critically acclaimed takedown of post-Freudian psychoanalytic theories
of homosexuality — that he confided his sexual orientation to his
parents.

“I remember finding my way to the local public library and checking out
books on psychology and human development,” he said in an interview in
2019 with the Journal of Gay & Lesbian Mental Health, “in hopes of
finding some reassurance that my interest in handsome boys was only a
stage that I would soon pass through.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Lewes (pronounced LOO-ess) was married at 23 and divorced by 32 —
the age when he had his first homosexual experience.

“It seemed only natural for me to be out of the closet to my friends,
colleagues and family,” he said, “with the important exception of my
parents, who, it had become clear over the years, did not want to hear
anything on that particular subject. I came out to them almost 15 years
later.”

Dr. Lewes died of the new coronavirus on April 17 in a Manhattan
hospital, his partner, Gary Jacobson, said. He was 76.

He is also survived by his sister, Noreen
Vasady-Kovacs.

Dr. Lewes’s major work, [“The Psychoanalytic Theory of Male
Homosexuality”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/12/11/books/navigating-the-straits-of-oedipus.html)
(1988), traced the evolution of the prevailing view that homosexuality
was a curable illness and explored what he called the psychoanalytic
establishment’s “century-long history of homophobia.” (The book’s title
was changed to [“Psychoanalysis and Male
Homosexuality”](https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=2008944236&searchType=1&permalink=y)
in later editions.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Drawing on some 500 primary sources, Dr. Lewes’s book, which expanded on
his doctoral dissertation, found that most analysts had adhered to
“popular prejudice” against gay people and clichés about them. “Many
analysts,” he concluded, “have violated basic norms of decency in their
treatment of homosexuals.”

He said he had been unable to find a single analysis of the subject
written by a psychoanalyst who identified as gay.

In his review of the book in [The New York Times Book
Review](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/12/11/books/navigating-the-straits-of-oedipus.html),
Richard Green, a professor of psychiatry and the law at the University
of California, Los Angeles, wrote:

“A major fault in the bedrock of analytic theory has been, according to
Mr. Lewes, a monumental misunderstanding of the Oedipus complex, long
considered the rite of passage to normal, healthy heterosexuality. This
misunderstanding created a false dichotomy between heterosexual wellness
and homosexual sickness.”

Dr. Lewes found that the complex could lead to 12 alternative
resolutions, six of them heterosexual and six homosexual. “All results
of the Oedipus complex are traumatic,” he wrote, “and, for similar
reasons, all are ‘normal.’”

Dr. Green [(who died last
year)](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/17/obituaries/dr-richard-green-dead.html),
one of the earliest critics of psychiatry’s classification of
homosexuality as a mental disorder, praised Dr. Lewes for tracking “the
politicized, moralistic and occasionally objective evolution of
psychoanalytic theories of male homosexuality from the enlightened
flexibility of Freud to the benighted dogmatism of his disciples,”
adding that “the history of how the single most influential school of
psychology and psychiatry abused its power and mishandled the most
politically and morally controversial of behaviors” constituted Dr.
Lewes’s “telling impact.”

Kenneth Allen Lewes was born on June 8, 1943, in Charleston, W.Va., to
Joseph and Anne (Harvin) Lewes. His father was an English-born furniture
maker and antique restorer for the National Trust for Historic
Preservation; his mother, born in Czechoslovakia, was a homemaker.

The family moved to New York in 1947. There, intending to become a
mathematician, Kenneth enrolled in the Bronx High School of Science,
graduating in 1960. He then shifted gears, earning a bachelor’s degree
in English from Cornell University in 1964 and a doctorate in
Renaissance English literature from Harvard.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the age of 36, after seven years as a professor of Renaissance
literature at Rutgers University in New Jersey — and without ever having
taken a psychology course — he made another transition and enrolled at
the University of Michigan, where he earned a second doctorate, this
time in clinical psychology, in 1982.

His study of English proved surprisingly serviceable, though.

“Literary criticism is generally better equipped to understand the depth
and complexity of symbols,” Dr. Lewes explained in the 2019 journal
interview. “I vividly remember the first time I conducted a therapy
group in a closed ward of a state mental hospital. I felt instantly at
home. Here were people trying to put into words their deepest intuitions
about life, much as people in the 17th century were obsessed with
theological debate. The people in my therapy group, however, had not
been dead for 300 years.”

He welcomed the greater acceptance of gay men by the psychiatric
profession and society in general in recent decades. But with that
progress he also lamented something lost — what he called “the gay
outlaw, the defier and challenger of traditional social values, the
person who insisted that we find our own ways of being in society and
not subscribe to the traditional values and limitations that stunted so
many lives.”

“Instead of him,” he said, “we now have the friendly next-door neighbor,
who may have adopted a child or two as well as an obligatory dog, and
who would never think of challenging values that most Americans assume
are timeless and part of
nature.”
