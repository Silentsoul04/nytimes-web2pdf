*\[Read more on* [*Roger Stone’s sentence being commuted by President
Trump*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html)*.\]*

WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday denied a request by President
Trump’s friend [Roger J. Stone
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/technology/roger-stone-facebook.html)
for a two-month delay before he begins serving his prison term, despite
the fact that his motion was unopposed by the Justice Department.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia granted Mr. Stone an additional two weeks before he
must report to a federal prison in Jesup, Ga., but ordered him placed
under home confinement in the meantime.

The judge’s order seemed to reflect some impatience about why Mr. Stone,
a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, had not yet been imprisoned. In
a trial Judge Jackson oversaw, [a jury convicted
him](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/15/us/politics/roger-stone-trial-guilty.html)
in November on seven felonies, including lying to federal investigators,
tampering with a witness and impeding a congressional inquiry. The judge
[sentenced
him](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/us/roger-stone-40-months-sentencing-verdict.html)
in February to 40 months in prison.

The Bureau of Prisons initially ordered Mr. Stone, 67, to report to
prison in April, then put off the date until June 30 after the judge, in
an order denying him a new trial, said his imprisonment should begin no
sooner than April 30.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then this month, citing the pandemic, Mr. Stone asked Judge Jackson to
delay his imprisonment until Sept. 1. He noted his age and health
concerns, which were not publicly
revealed.

In a nod to the intense criticism over the Justice Department’s handling
of the case, prosecutors told Judge Jackson that they did not oppose the
delay — but purely because of department guidelines for defendants who
are about to begin their prison terms and pose no risk of flight or
threat to public safety.

“There is no instance in which this office has opposed a request to
extend a self-surrender date during the pandemic,” prosecutors in
Washington said this week in a filing to the judge. The department’s
stance was drafted “to conform with our policy and practice — and for no
other reason,” its lawyers said.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

That seemed to conflict with a statement from Mr. Stone’s lawyers. Their
filing to the judge said government lawyers had told them this month
that the Bureau of Prisons “was no longer extending surrender dates
based on Covid-19 and that, therefore, B.O.P. would not be changing
Stone’s June 30, 2020, surrender date.”

After further discussions, Mr. Stone’s lawyers said, they were informed
that the department would not oppose his request for a delay.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Justice Department’s handling of Mr. Stone’s case has been deeply
fraught. He was one of a string of former Trump aides who were charged
as a result of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S.
Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016
election.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

After Attorney General William P. Barr reversed their sentencing
recommendation for a stiff prison term, four career prosecutors quit the
case and one of them left the department entirely. This week, in [a
statement](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenthelper/7042-aaron-zelinsky-testimony/ad5f15a1e37896bd07bb/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
to the House Judiciary Committee during an oversight hearing, one of
those prosecutors said his superiors cited “heavy pressure from the
highest levels of the Department of Justice to cut Stone a break.”

“What I heard — repeatedly — was that Roger Stone was being treated
differently from any other defendant because of his relationship to the
president,” said [the prosecutor, Aaron S.J.
Zelinsky](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/politics/justice-department-politicization.html).
Mr. Zelinsky has now left his assignment in the United States attorney’s
office in Washington but remains a department prosecutor in Baltimore.

Mr. Barr has dismissed Mr. Zelinsky’s account as hearsay.

The coronavirus has been spreading through federal prisons. So far, 89
inmates and one staff member have died of the disease, according to
Bureau of Prisons statistics.

In an Instagram post this month, Mr. Stone complained that he had been
ordered to serve his sentence in a prison that had a “substantial”
problem with the virus, while other high-profile prisoners were granted
reprieves.

But Judge Jackson wrote that Mr. Stone’s prison was as yet “unaffected.”
She said two weeks of home confinement for Mr. Stone would help protect
other inmates “who share defendant’s anxiety over the potential
introduction and spread of the virus.”
