President Trump's friend had sought a longer reprieve before he serves
his sentence on seven felony convictions, citing the pandemic.

Stone's sentence being commuted by President Trump}}\emph{.{]}}

WASHINGTON --- A federal judge on Friday denied a request by President
Trump's friend
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/technology/roger-stone-facebook.html}{Roger
J. Stone Jr.} for a two-month delay before he begins serving his prison
term, despite the fact that his motion was unopposed by the Justice
Department.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia granted Mr. Stone an additional two weeks before he
must report to a federal prison in Jesup, Ga., but ordered him placed
under home confinement in the meantime.

The judge's order seemed to reflect some impatience about why Mr. Stone,
a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, had not yet been imprisoned. In
a trial Judge Jackson oversaw,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/15/us/politics/roger-stone-trial-guilty.html}{a
jury convicted him} in November on seven felonies, including lying to
federal investigators, tampering with a witness and impeding a
congressional inquiry. The judge
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/us/roger-stone-40-months-sentencing-verdict.html}{sentenced
him} in February to 40 months in prison.

The Bureau of Prisons initially ordered Mr. Stone, 67, to report to
prison in April, then put off the date until June 30 after the judge, in
an order denying him a new trial, said his imprisonment should begin no
sooner than April 30.

Then this month, citing the pandemic, Mr. Stone asked Judge Jackson to
delay his imprisonment until Sept. 1. He noted his age and health
concerns, which were not publicly revealed.

In a nod to the intense criticism over the Justice Department's handling
of the case, prosecutors told Judge Jackson that they did not oppose the
delay --- but purely because of department guidelines for defendants who
are about to begin their prison terms and pose no risk of flight or
threat to public safety.

``There is no instance in which this office has opposed a request to
extend a self-surrender date during the pandemic,'' prosecutors in
Washington said this week in a filing to the judge. The department's
stance was drafted ``to conform with our policy and practice --- and for
no other reason,'' its lawyers said.

That seemed to conflict with a statement from Mr. Stone's lawyers. Their
filing to the judge said government lawyers had told them this month
that the Bureau of Prisons ``was no longer extending surrender dates
based on Covid-19 and that, therefore, B.O.P. would not be changing
Stone's June 30, 2020, surrender date.''

After further discussions, Mr. Stone's lawyers said, they were informed
that the department would not oppose his request for a delay.

The Justice Department's handling of Mr. Stone's case has been deeply
fraught. He was one of a string of former Trump aides who were charged
as a result of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S.
Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

    The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth

    its recommendation of six feet} on the idea that most large droplets
    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough
    apart.

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}
    immune molecules called antibodies, which are

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

After Attorney General William P. Barr reversed their sentencing
recommendation for a stiff prison term, four career prosecutors quit the
case and one of them left the department entirely. This week, in
\href{https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenthelper/7042-aaron-zelinsky-testimony/ad5f15a1e37896bd07bb/optimized/full.pdf\#page=1}{a
statement} to the House Judiciary Committee during an oversight hearing,
one of those prosecutors said his superiors cited ``heavy pressure from
the highest levels of the Department of Justice to cut Stone a break.''

``What I heard --- repeatedly --- was that Roger Stone was being treated
differently from any other defendant because of his relationship to the
president,'' said
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/politics/justice-department-politicization.html}{the
prosecutor, Aaron S.J. Zelinsky}. Mr. Zelinsky has now left his
assignment in the United States attorney's office in Washington but
remains a department prosecutor in Baltimore.

Mr. Barr has dismissed Mr. Zelinsky's account as hearsay.

The coronavirus has been spreading through federal prisons. So far, 89
inmates and one staff member have died of the disease, according to
Bureau of Prisons statistics.

In an Instagram post this month, Mr. Stone complained that he had been
ordered to serve his sentence in a prison that had a ``substantial''
problem with the virus, while other high-profile prisoners were granted
reprieves.

But Judge Jackson wrote that Mr. Stone's prison was as yet
``unaffected.'' She said two weeks of home confinement for Mr. Stone
would help protect other inmates ``who share defendant's anxiety over
the potential introduction and spread of the virus.''
