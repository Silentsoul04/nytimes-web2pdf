# Lockdown? What Lockdown? Heat Wave Brings Britons Out in Droves

With pubs and restaurants still closed in a country that has the world’s
third-highest reported coronavirus death toll, crowds have flocked to
beaches, parks and streams this week.

LONDON — They descended by the tens of thousands on Britain’s southern
beaches and jammed into city parks. They cavorted by the hundreds in
streams. They [attacked police officers who tried to disperse illegal
block
parties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/world/europe/brixton-party-police.html).
And hundreds became [stuck in mud
flats](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/tourists-trapped-mud-flats-trying-4265533)
while trying to reach the sea at low tide.

By Friday, the third sweltering day in a row in a country where many
homes lack air conditioning, the message was abundantly clear: Many
Britons are done with the lockdown.

Although [Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain announced a major
easing of lockdown
restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html)
this week and declared the beginning of the end of a “long national
hibernation,” all pubs, restaurants and cafes will remain closed until
July 4, leaving the public with few venues to enjoy their newfound
freedom.

“It’s like an avalanche of people everywhere,” said Rachel Cox, 55, a
resident of Notting Hill in western London who said she had been woken
up on Thursday night by the sound of partygoers pelting police officers
with various objects. “It’s as if the last three months of fear and
caution over the coronavirus vanished overnight.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scores of officers came under attack this week as they tried to crack
down on illegal street parties. At least 22 officers were injured in
south London on Wednesday night as they were attacked with bottles and
other objects while breaking up an unauthorized music event.

Under the government’s new guidance, groups of up to six people are
allowed to meet outdoors. But each night, hundreds of people have been
gathering on Notting Hill’s Portobello Road for group drinks, block
parties, music events and raves.

Even as the rate of coronavirus deaths and new infections has fallen
considerably in recent weeks, scientists have warned that complacency
around social distancing measures could set off a second wave of the
virus. Britain has the world’s third-highest confirmed coronavirus death
toll, with [more than 43,000 deaths, and over 300,000 reported
infections](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).

“We’ve been cooped up for so long, and I think it’s understandable that
while the virus is under control people want to just go out and have
some fun,” said Amy Hodge, a 21-year-old design student who attended a
small street party in western London on Thursday. “It was very mellow
and chilled. Not everyone is out to cause trouble.”

In the beach resort of Bournemouth, [a major incident was
declared](https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/18540767.police-security-staff-kept-busy-bournemouth-beach/)
on Thursday after emergency response teams were deployed to deal with
overcrowding, traffic gridlock and antisocial behavior that included
leaving behind mounds of litter, fighting, and urinating and defecating
in public.

Beaches in the area can usually accommodate high volumes of people. But
many of their resources, including public bathrooms, are still largely
unavailable because of coronavirus restrictions.

Under regular circumstances, “the pubs are open, the cafes are open, the
hotels are open, people aren’t just congregating here, they are not
bringing vast quantities of alcohol,” Vicki Slade, the leader of
Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said in a statement on
Thursday.

“The behavior of people, parking on the middle of roundabouts and
pavements, people defecating in a cardboard box on the beach and leaving
it for our staff to deal with, refuse collectors being abused for doing
their job,” she said — “that is what made it unprecedented, and that is
why we had to take action.”

Hundreds of beachgoers in the seaside town of Weston [became trapped in
mud
flats](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/tourists-trapped-mud-flats-trying-4265533)
as they tried to reach the sea during low tide. Pictures shared on
social media showed women struggling as they tried to carry children out
of the swampy terrain, and the Weston-super-Mare Coast Guard said it had
been called out 55 times on Thursday to rescue people stuck in the mud.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Matt Hancock, the country’s health secretary, threatened to close down
beaches if social distancing measures continued to be violated.

“We do have that power,” he said. “I am reluctant to use it because
people have had a pretty tough lockdown and I want everybody to be able
to enjoy the sunshine. But the key is to do it with respect for the
rules.”

Thousands of Liverpool soccer fans also gathered on Thursday night to
celebrate their Premier League championship victory, even though the
police had urged them to stay at home. Jubilant fans descended onto the
streets outside the team’s stadium in northwestern
[England](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/world/europe/britain-quarantine-us-coronavirus.html)
where they sang, danced and set off
fireworks.

Liverpool has been disproportionately hit by the coronavirus, and the
city’s mayor, Joe Anderson, said it was disappointing that so many fans
had ignored the pandemic guidelines.

“Not all of them young people, but most of them young people, gathered
to celebrate and drink,” he told the BBC’s Today Program. “It’s
disappointing, it’s absolutely disappointing in the same way that it was
to see the scenes on Bournemouth beach.”

On Friday, the weather cooled down a bit, but London’s parks were still
full of large groups frolicking, sunbathing and exercising.

“Thousands of people should not be sitting on top of each other at the
beach, and the parks should not be this full during a pandemic,” said
Anton Bregman, a dancer from western London, as he meandered through
groups of people in London’s Hyde Park on his roller skates.

“I get the frustration, though,” he said. “I mean, we’re allowed out
now, but everywhere is still shut. Where exactly are we all supposed to
go?”
