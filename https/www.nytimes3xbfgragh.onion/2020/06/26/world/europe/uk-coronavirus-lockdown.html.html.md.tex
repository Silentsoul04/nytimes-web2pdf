With pubs and restaurants still closed in a country that has the world's
third-highest reported coronavirus death toll, crowds have flocked to
beaches, parks and streams this week.

LONDON --- They descended by the tens of thousands on Britain's southern
beaches and jammed into city parks. They cavorted by the hundreds in
streams. They
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/world/europe/brixton-party-police.html}{attacked
police officers who tried to disperse illegal block parties}. And
hundreds became
\href{https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/tourists-trapped-mud-flats-trying-4265533}{stuck
in mud flats} while trying to reach the sea at low tide.

By Friday, the third sweltering day in a row in a country where many
homes lack air conditioning, the message was abundantly clear: Many
Britons are done with the lockdown.

Although
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-reopening.html}{Prime
Minister Boris Johnson of Britain announced a major easing of lockdown
restrictions} this week and declared the beginning of the end of a
``long national hibernation,'' all pubs, restaurants and cafes will
remain closed until July 4, leaving the public with few venues to enjoy
their newfound freedom.

``It's like an avalanche of people everywhere,'' said Rachel Cox, 55, a
resident of Notting Hill in western London who said she had been woken
up on Thursday night by the sound of partygoers pelting police officers
with various objects. ``It's as if the last three months of fear and
caution over the coronavirus vanished overnight.''

Scores of officers came under attack this week as they tried to crack
down on illegal street parties. At least 22 officers were injured in
south London on Wednesday night as they were attacked with bottles and
other objects while breaking up an unauthorized music event.

Under the government's new guidance, groups of up to six people are
allowed to meet outdoors. But each night, hundreds of people have been
gathering on Notting Hill's Portobello Road for group drinks, block
parties, music events and raves.

Even as the rate of coronavirus deaths and new infections has fallen
considerably in recent weeks, scientists have warned that complacency
around social distancing measures could set off a second wave of the
virus. Britain has the world's third-highest confirmed coronavirus death
toll, with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{more
than 43,000 deaths, and over 300,000 reported infections}.

``We've been cooped up for so long, and I think it's understandable that
while the virus is under control people want to just go out and have
some fun,'' said Amy Hodge, a 21-year-old design student who attended a
small street party in western London on Thursday. ``It was very mellow
and chilled. Not everyone is out to cause trouble.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/06/26/world/26virus-uk-lockdown2/merlin_173879847_9076ae4b-c059-4ab5-818b-063f9822f8c9-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Although the hot spell --- which has sent temperatures into the high 80s
Fahrenheit --- is expected to subside on Saturday,~police patrols will
increase over the weekend and all unauthorized gathering will be
dispersed, London's police chief, Cressida Dick, said on Friday.

``These events are unlawful,'' she said. ``They shouldn't be happening,
and for our officers who are simply doing their duty to be attacked in
that manner is utterly unacceptable.''

In the beach resort of Bournemouth,
\href{https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/18540767.police-security-staff-kept-busy-bournemouth-beach/}{a
major incident was declared} on Thursday after emergency response teams
were deployed to deal with overcrowding, traffic gridlock and antisocial
behavior that included leaving behind mounds of litter, fighting, and
urinating and defecating in public.

Beaches in the area can usually accommodate high volumes of people. But
many of their resources, including public bathrooms, are still largely
unavailable because of coronavirus restrictions.

Under regular circumstances, ``the pubs are open, the cafes are open,
the hotels are open, people aren't just congregating here, they are not
bringing vast quantities of alcohol,'' Vicki Slade, the leader of
Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said in a statement on
Thursday.

``The behavior of people, parking on the middle of roundabouts and
pavements, people defecating in a cardboard box on the beach and leaving
it for our staff to deal with, refuse collectors being abused for doing
their job,'' she said --- ``that is what made it unprecedented, and that
is why we had to take action.''

Hundreds of beachgoers in the seaside town of Weston
\href{https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/tourists-trapped-mud-flats-trying-4265533}{became
trapped in mud flats} as they tried to reach the sea during low tide.
Pictures shared on social media showed women struggling as they tried to
carry children out of the swampy terrain, and the Weston-super-Mare
Coast Guard said it had been called out 55 times on Thursday to rescue
people stuck in the mud.

In South Wales, where lockdown restrictions remain in place, a violent
brawl broke out on a beach on Thursday --- a scene that one official
described as a ``contagion of stupidity,''
\href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-53186920}{the BBC reported.}

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}
    immune molecules called antibodies, which are

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

Matt Hancock, the country's health secretary, threatened to close down
beaches if social distancing measures continued to be violated.

``We do have that power,'' he said. ``I am reluctant to use it because
people have had a pretty tough lockdown and I want everybody to be able
to enjoy the sunshine. But the key is to do it with respect for the
rules.''

Thousands of Liverpool soccer fans also gathered on Thursday night to
celebrate their Premier League championship victory, even though the
police had urged them to stay at home. Jubilant fans descended onto the
streets outside the team's stadium in northwestern
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/world/europe/britain-quarantine-us-coronavirus.html}{England}
where they sang, danced and set off fireworks.

Liverpool has been disproportionately hit by the coronavirus, and the
city's mayor, Joe Anderson, said it was disappointing that so many fans
had ignored the pandemic guidelines.

``Not all of them young people, but most of them young people, gathered
to celebrate and drink,'' he told the BBC's Today Program. ``It's
disappointing, it's absolutely disappointing in the same way that it was
to see the scenes on Bournemouth beach.''

On Friday, the weather cooled down a bit, but London's parks were still
full of large groups frolicking, sunbathing and exercising.

``Thousands of people should not be sitting on top of each other at the
beach, and the parks should not be this full during a pandemic,'' said
Anton Bregman, a dancer from western London, as he meandered through
groups of people in London's Hyde Park on his roller skates.

``I get the frustration, though,'' he said. ``I mean, we're allowed out
now, but everywhere is still shut. Where exactly are we all supposed to
go?''
