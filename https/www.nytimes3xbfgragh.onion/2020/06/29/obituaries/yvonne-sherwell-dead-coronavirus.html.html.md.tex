\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

If a quintessential denizen of bohemian Greenwich Village in Manhattan
existed, it might have been Yvonne Sherwell, who appeared in a
small-budget movie, acted in plays, sang cabaret and wrote a memoir.

But Ms. Sherwell had other sides to an eclectic life: She was a member
of the leadership of the
\href{https://villagedemocrats.org/55-years-strong/}{Village Independent
Democrats} political club and worked as a coat checker at the Algonquin
Hotel in the early 1980s.

Ms. Sherwell was in need of a part-time job and enjoyed the ambience of
the hotel, her daughter, Candela Prol, said: ``She liked the glamour of
all the writers and journalists and actors and actresses that would
frequent the Algonquin Hotel.''

She might have been channeling the spirit of the hotel's famed Round
Table and its wits when she was quoted in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1981/01/07/garden/a-problem-in-the-cloakroom-finding-space-for-down-coats.html}{a
1981 New York Times article} about a surge in the popularity of down
coats.

``They are the bane of my life,'' she said. ``I'm convinced they have a
life of their own. They visit each other and I'm convinced that they
mate. I try to tether them, but they float overhead. I restrain them but
they get away from me.''

Ms. Sherwell died on April 6 at a rehabilitation center in Manhattan.
She was 92. The cause was the coronavirus, Ms. Prol said.

Ms. Sherwell was born in Waterbury, Conn., on May 27, 1927, to Helen
Louise (Jackson) Sherwell and
\href{https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1963/05/01/80445766.html?pageNumber=39}{Guillermo
Sherwell}. Her mother was a reporter for The
\href{https://www.thewesterlysun.com/}{Westerly Sun} and a playwright.
Her father was an executive at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust bank with
a focus on its South American activities.

After moving to New York at 18 to become an actress, Ms. Sherwell
studied ballet and flamenco dancing there.

She married Paul Eugene Rose, a decorator at the Lord \& Taylor
department store, in 1950. They had a son, Anthony Sherwell. She and Mr.
Rose divorced, and in 1958 she married
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/06/25/classified/paid-notice-deaths-prol-julio.html}{Julio
Prol}, a classical guitarist and prominent teacher. They lived in
Greenwich Village, where they raised their children, Candela and Rick.

Ms. Sherwell and Mr. Prol divorced in 1991. She later married Christos
Demakopoulos. He died in 2012.

Her children and a sister, Carlotta Benacerraf*,* survive her.

Ms. Sherwell appeared in several Off Off Broadway productions, mostly at
\href{http://lamama.org/}{La MaMa}, where she had the title role in the
1969 production of ``Big Charlotte,'' a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/08/16/arts/music/16wallowitch.html}{John
Wallowitch} musical inspired by the Bette Davis movie ``Now, Voyager.''

Ms. Sherwell's foray into film came in a secondary role in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1973/01/26/archives/life-studyscreen-love-story-is-all-too-vulnerable.html}{``Life
Study,''} a 1973 love story directed by Michael Nebbia that also
included Tommy Lee Jones in the cast.

She sang cabaret in the late 1990s and early 2000s, appearing several
times at
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/12/31/arts/music/31kreston.html}{Judy's}
in Chelsea. Late in life she published a memoir, ``Zig-Zag: Or How Not
to Louse Everything Up the Way I Did!'' (2018), in which she explored
her talents and what she considered her unfulfilled potential.

As the promotional copy reads, ``I knew what not to do, but I did it
anyway!''
