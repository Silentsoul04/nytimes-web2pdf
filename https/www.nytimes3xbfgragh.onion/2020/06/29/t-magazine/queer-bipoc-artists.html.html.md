As the country contends with ongoing violence against queer and BIPOC
communities, it’s paramount that voices from those communities are
heard. Not all artists are activists, of course, but they are all keen
observers, ones who invite the viewer to consider their way of seeing
things, whether their chosen subject is as expansive as prison reform or
as singular as their own sense of self. Each work tells a story, and
here, we’ve asked 15 queer artists of color to elaborate on theirs.
(Look for a coming compilation of works by queer Indigenous artists in
the weeks ahead.)

*These interviews have been edited and condensed.*

In his essay “Fifth Avenue, Uptown: A Letter From Harlem” (1960), [James
Baldwin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/05/t-magazine/james-baldwin-giovannis-room.html)
writes, “Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely
expensive it is to be poor; and if one is a member of a captive
population, economically speaking, one’s feet have simply been placed on
the treadmill forever. One is victimized, economically, in a thousand
ways.” I think about emotional and moral buoyancy in the face of various
kinds of impoverishment and de facto captivity. To be bankrupt does not
mean that one is alone or without dignity or without meaningful personal
iconography, loving sanctuary or
self-respect.

### **By** **[rafa esparza](https://commonwealthandcouncil.com/us/rafa-esparza/biography), 38, based in Los Angeles**

“bust: indestructible columns” drew on an earlier performance I did in
2015, for which I ensconced myself in a concrete pillar outside of the
Men’s Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles and, once the concrete had
dried, freed myself using a hand-chisel and a hammer. The work was a
comment on police violence and the sort of surveillance endured by black
and brown bodies. I intentionally did it in a public place, where I
might have an encounter with the police and where people could bear
witness and be more than a passive audience. Last year, I, along with
[Performance Space](https://performancespacenewyork.org/) and [Ballroom
Marfa](https://www.ballroommarfa.org/) and a number of individual
collaborators, brought a version of the piece to the Ellipse in
Washington, D.C. In this case, I was thinking about the racist rhetoric
of this administration, and the column was a replica of one of those
lining the porticoes at the White House. Afterward, there was a dinner
with a feast prepared by Gerardo Gonzalez and readings of writers’
reflections on the day. The evening evolved into a dance party and was a
reminder of, given the risks and laboriousness of creating culture and
speaking truth to power as queer folks, how important it is for us to
have spaces dedicated to care and joy. Later this week, a new project
that I organized with the artist Cassils will launch — I can’t say too
much, but it involves 80 different artists from all walks of life coming
together to appeal for the abolishment of immigrant
detention.

### **By** **[Shen Wei](http://shenwei.studio/), 43, based in New York**

Recently, I completed my decade-long self-portrait series “I Miss You
Already,” many of the images from which were photographed during my
extensive travels around the world; the series was a diary and a
travelogue for capturing meaningful moments. One of the first things I
do when I walk into any hotel or guest room is set up my camera on a
tripod. That way, when the moment is right, the camera is there and
ready, though often it stands there the entire trip without me taking a
single picture. “Self-portrait (Mochi)” (2019) was photographed in a
friend’s apartment in Paris. When I’m abroad, I must always stop by an
Asian grocery store to satisfy my longing for homey food. I’m from
Shanghai, where sticky rice is a staple, and felt very nostalgic eating
a piece of mochi cake by a Parisian window shadowed with painterly
bamboo leaves. “Self-portrait (Origami)” (2019) was photographed in
Puebla, Mexico, in the morning hour at the dining table in my hotel
room. Whenever I see paper napkins, my natural reaction is to fold them
origami style, an art form I grew up learning. Something about doing a
familiar thing in a foreign environment comforts me. At the end of the
shoot, I folded a fan, a swan and an elephant. It was a perfectly
introverted moment — I was alone but not
lonely.

“Riot I” (2019) is from an ongoing series of sculptures, and that fact
is important — the series is as much the work as any of the individual
pieces within it. We are dealing in — we are trafficking in — systems
here. The initial impetus for this series was the site of the prison
visiting room, and the works themselves are altered one-to-one scale
replicas of the furniture within those rooms. This is about touch and
its foreclosure, intimacy and its foreclosure, as well as performance
and commodification and exploitation. It’s about economics both micro
and macro — *defund the \[expletive\] police*. Basically, these
structures are emblematic of a system and infrastructure, a labor and
actual people, actual lives. The bodies of “free” and “unfree” are meant
to be affixed to this furniture for the duration of a visit. And there
is so, so, so much more I could say about all of this. Maybe “Riot I” is
an epic
poem.

This work is based on memories shared with my husband, William. We were
cleaning out the closet, going through mostly clothes and shoe boxes. It
was cold that winter and our hearts and minds were cluttered with
different emotions caused by the outside world that had come into the
interior of our home and bodily homes. Our bedroom was like an icebox,
but having our bodies close together kept us warm as we unpacked that
evening. I wrote the following poem to accompany the image:

> Kiss some friction on my rubber band  
> Sweet burning lick  
> His nails crush through and through waves  
> Why does his forehead feel like an icy wet dinner
plate

### **By** **[Devan Shimoyama](https://www.devanshimoyama.com/), 30, based in Pittsburgh**

I tend to use unconventional materials, specifically in my paintings,
and often borrow from drag culture and the glamorous black women I’ve
known. I’m thinking about the spaces where we celebrate identity and
construct different fantasies on top of our bodies — there’s a sort of
peacocking associated with wearing one’s Sunday best, for instance.
“Grandmother’s Blessing” (2019) shows my own grandmother, with pieces
of costume jewelry affixed to the canvas for her eyes and a blouse made
of a beaded brocade. Whenever I move into a new place, she makes a point
of coming out to visit and bless it, which sort of completes the space
for us both. “The Abduction of Ganymede” leans more toward fantasy, a
driving force in my work that allows me to create a brighter alternate
reality. In the Greek myth, Zeus either sends his eagle or turns into an
eagle and then abducts the most beautiful boy. My take is about
self-love, about being able to embrace the narrative that you, with your
black body, are
beautiful.

### **By** **[Christina Quarles](https://www.christinaquarles.com/), 35, based in Los Angeles**

“Oh Dear, Look Whut We’ve Dun to tha Blues” (2020) was one of the last
paintings I made before the United States entered quarantine. I was
feeling rising anxiety all around me, this sense that we were all going
through the motions of business as usual amid a spreading virus. This
doom bubbling just below the veneer of a calm, often decadent facade is
one I have also felt with regard to the urgency of issues like global
warming, racial injustice and class inequality, to name a few. Perhaps
this is what led to me painting one of the figures with a pattern that I
see as oscillating between expensive pink marble terrazzo and a stinky
cheap slice of pimento loaf. “Pull on Thru tha Nite” (2017) is titled
for the visual pun of the figure pulling down the night sky, a gesture
that points to the mutability of context and our agency to move and even
play within the confines of fixed meaning. In all my work, I am
interested in the ways in which meaning is derived from an ever-shifting
and always-constructed edge, and how within this boundary we are
confined and contorted but also held and supported. We are subject to
but can also be activated *by* these limits, a paradox outlined by the
writer [Joshua Gamson](http://www.joshuagamson.com/): Fixed categories
of identity can be used to marginalize but, paradoxically, can be used
by the marginalized to gain visibility and political
power.

“Lighting Up” (2018) is from my “One Land to Another” project, which is
partly a response to the lack of Asian representation in mainstream
culture. I take on different characters and create these cinematic
images — they’re almost like film stills. In 2018 and 2019, I visited
Beijing and installed these images, temporarily, in my childhood home.
My parents don’t know I’m gay, and it’s an environment where that sort
of expression is not encouraged, so it was a rebellious act, a way of
disrupting the heterosexual structure that’s embedded in the home and
familial relations. But it was also an exploration of intersectionality
and the fact that I’m not completely free there or here. In the United
States, I’m a gay person and a foreigner. I’m very cognizant of how
systems of oppression are used as a means of control, and I’m looking to
bridge dialogues about both countries, which in certain ways are quite
similar.

### **By** **[Darryl DeAngelo Terrell](http://darryldterrell.com/), 29, based in Detroit**

Growing up in Detroit, I never felt I could perform any gender other
than male. But around 2015, during my first year of grad school, I
started experimenting with gender performance and expression with my
alter-ego, Dion, as a way of exploring fat, femme, queer, black bodies.
“I Look Like My Momma (Self-portrait 1980),” is referencing two images
— [Robert
Mapplethorpe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/robert-mapplethorpe)’s
“Self Portrait, 1980” and [James Van Der
Zee](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/28/nyregion/harlem-renaissance-james-van-der-zee.html)’s
“Couple in Raccoon Coats, 1932.” I borrowed my mom’s raccoon-and-fox fur
coat and gold necklace for it and took the photo in a peacock wicker
chair reminiscent of those I used to see in our family photos. I sent
the image to my mom and she said, “Damn, boy, you look good. You look
like me.”

“\#Project20s” started in 2017, when I was doing an independent study at
Ox-bow and around a lot of white people listening to [Taylor
Swift](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/taylor-swift),
which was irritating. I, meanwhile, became fixated by the fact that both
[Kendrick
Lamar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/01/t-magazine/beck-tom-waits-kendrick-lamar.html)
and [Kanye
West](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/10/t-magazine/kanye-west-adidas-yeezy-fashion-interview.html)
have songs about the likelihood of black kids not making it to a certain
age in their 20s, while also thinking about how heavily gentrification
was hitting both Chicago and Detroit. My aim is to photograph upward of
200 black or brown people in their 20s by the time I turn 30 — Don, the
young person pictured in the second image, was an art student who died
in an ambulance after the EMTs took an unhurried approach to his asthma
attack. I want for this series to live in museums or gallery spaces
where it will confront the people privileged with leisure time.
Gentrification is a form of racial violence, and my thinking is, “If you
kick us out of our hood, I put us on your white
walls.”

“Issa Saturday Study” (2019) is essentially a study for another painting
I made titled “Issa Saturday” for [my 2019
exhibition](https://www.norton.org/exhibitions/nina-chanel-abney) “Neon”

as an investigation of how and why we as a society choose to celebrate

### **By** **[D’Angelo Lovell Williams](https://www.dangelolovellwilliams.com/), 27, based in New York**

I treat images like portals. My current exhibition, “Papa Don’t Preach,”
(open by appointment at [Janice Guy](https://janiceguy.com/)’s space, in
collaboration with [Higher Pictures](https://higherpictures.com/), at
520 West 143rd Street in New York) looks at intersections of blackness,
queerness and family. This image from the exhibition, “Was Blind, But
Now I See (Granny)” (2018), narrates a moment between my mom’s mom and
me. The title, a line from the song “Amazing Grace,” refers to an
experience where my Granny was dead for 10 minutes after going into
cardiac arrest over a decade ago due to smoking cigarettes. She was
resuscitated but was blind, couldn’t speak and couldn’t walk. It was a
sort of rebirth for her, especially religiously. Over the last decade,
my granny has, with the help of family and friends, slowly regained her
speech, her ability to walk and her sight. When she started speaking
again, she recalled seeing God during the 10 minutes she was dead. The
gesture of her hand over my face is a way of her sharing that testimony
with me through touch. The use of the gaze is prominent in my work, and
here, Granny’s gaze is mine and hers at once, even if we don’t always
agree. With images existing as these portals, I continue to seek how
life as a black, queer, H.I.V.-positive person intertwines with the
depths of kinship, intimacy and
history.

I created these works last summer for Frieze London, but they are
extensions of a project I started in 2016, when I delved into the
history of zoot suits and pachuco culture as they existed in my hometown
of El Paso, Texas. The town also has Fort Bliss, the second largest Army
post in the country, so I grew up seeing camouflage everyday, and
collage was a way of unpacking both of these histories while exploring
questions of race, gender and sexuality. As part of my research, I
revisited [Ralph
Ellison](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/ralph-ellison)’s
“Invisible Man” (1952), which describes the zoot suiters as men who
existed outside of their time and also has the line, “When they approach
me they see only my surroundings.” “Distorted In the Interest of Design”
(2019) looks at what it means to be invisible but also hyper-visible,
which is the reality of being black or brown in this country. For the
series, I mine an archive of ’70s-era erotic magazines with fetishistic
images of black men photographed through the gaze of white
photographers. Using the centerfold, I draw clothing onto the nude
models and then cut and weave the magazine pages back together. The
process is additive and subtractive and, above all, a type of
photographic disruption. In “Divided Territory” (2019), I affixed actual
pieces of clothing. There are shirt collars, pockets, waistbands and
cuffs — places where the body
connects.

“RECOMMENDATION” (2018-19) is a fabricated steel barricade sculpture. In
thinking about the infrastructure of crowd control, I became interested
in the ubiquity of barricades at protests and other large public
gatherings like concerts and political rallies. Barricades have origins
in a very radical material tradition, having been made out of refuse by
the working classes in 19th-century France to block and redirect the
flow of street traffic as a means of protecting themselves against state
violence. These structures also served as social spaces and ad hoc
stages for these citizen insurgents to address one another. Through the
advent of mass production, barricades have become a mobile architecture
that controls how crowds and audiences are allowed to take up space;
they are no longer technologies of the people but technologies of
authority, and the freedom to speak and to listen is negated by the
physical control rendered by the barricades’ presence. “RECOMMENDATION”
considers exclusion and protection, radical expression and the
regulation of speech and
listening.

Though my work draws from my own experiences and emotions, my practice
is fundamentally political. My 2018 “Pull-Up” series explores sagging —
the style of wearing low-hanging pants that was popularized by hip-hop.
The closely cropped compositions abstract the body into landscape, a
political arena where people express their agendas and fantasies
regardless of whether they mean harm or not. The photographs are often
crafted in the studio, borrowing from the language and symbols of
commercial advertising and alluding to the omnipresent commodification
of the assumed bodies. The identities of the models are hidden, which
draws upon the viewer's fantasies. With works like “roscoe’s long beach
34.0407° N, 118.3476° W” (2018), I rephotographed the studio shots of
the waist area outside, conflating the bodily landscape with the urban
landscape and light of Los Angeles, the city where I was born and
raised, and where young black men have lived and
died.

The top image is from one of the rare occasions when I was invited to
make photographs in a documentary context. I attended the funeral of a
person who had a storied life, despite having suffered an incredibly
traumatic racial violence early on. This was the only image I felt
comfortable sharing with a wider audience; the guests’ identities aren’t
disclosed, and yet it communicates why I was there and serves as a way
of paying my respects. I noticed that those who had been closest to this
person moved through the day with ease — mostly they seemed proud and at
peace — and it made me think about the power the deceased had and
whether forgiveness was a tool for cultivating that power. A lot of my
work involves interiority, both of physical spaces and of individuals —
I’m interested in what constitutes their foundation and enables them to
act. Your attacker might not repent and the state might assist in
perpetuating violence, so, in that lack, what tools do you have to
fortify yourself?

“Prune and grout” (2019) I took last year at a New Orleans bar. There’s
a companion piece to this that shows a woman with her head down on the
bar, as though she’s mourning someone’s absence. This image shows the
logistical setup — the person pictured here was just helping me with the
other shot, but there was such concern in his eyes. His hand, which is
just outside the frame here, was holding that of the woman.
