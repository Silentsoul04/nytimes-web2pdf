\subsection{California backslides}\label{california-backslides}}

Early in the outbreak, California emerged as a leader in fighting the
spread of the coronavirus. It was the first state to impose a
stay-at-home order, and its swift response is thought to have
\href{https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Study-Shelter-in-place-helped-avert-4-8-million-15325645.php}{prevented
1.7 million coronavirus cases in the state}.

For months it seemed that California --- considered especially
vulnerable to the virus because of its large, globe-trotting population
--- was weathering the storm relatively well.

But over the last week, things have changed. The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html}{state's
case count} has exploded, reaching 200,000 infections. Gov. Gavin Newsom
has rolled back reopening plans. And officials in Los Angeles County are
\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/l-a-county-issues-dire-warning-amid-alarming-increases-in-coronavirus}{projecting
that they may run out of hospital beds} in two to three weeks.

Now Californians are asking themselves, what went wrong?

The turn, some say, may have come Memorial Day weekend, when cooped-up
residents responded to the state's reopening by getting out and
socializing. According to
\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/california-coronavirus-hot-spot-memorial-day}{an
analysis by The Los Angeles Times}, coronavirus hospitalizations in the
state began accelerating around June 15 --- which, given the incubation
period of the virus, points to holiday barbecues, beach trips and
graduation parties as potential culprits.

The Los Angeles Times also
\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/california-coronavirus-hot-spot-memorial-day}{noted}
that Californians, unlike New Yorkers, had not yet felt the trauma of
having their hospitals overloaded with patients, so many saw reopening
as a license to return to life as it was before the pandemic.

Our colleague Jill Cowan, who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/california-today}{writes
the California Today newsletter}, told us that a complex patchwork of
rules that can change from county to county was also to blame.

``State and local officials would say that, recently, people have been
letting their guard down, and they've been gathering with family members
and they've been going to bars and restaurants,'' Jill told us. ``But a
lot of people are then saying, `Well, why did you let restaurants and
bars reopen?'''

\subsection{A nightmare side effect}\label{a-nightmare-side-effect}}

Many severely ill patients have developed a terrifying condition
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/28/health/coronavirus-delirium-hallucinations.html}{that
causes nightmarish visions and can have long-lasting consequences}.
Known as hospital delirium, the phenomenon, which was observed mostly in
older people before the pandemic, has struck Covid-19 patients of all
ages.

Reports suggest that about two-thirds to three-quarters of virus
patients who end up in intensive-care units, even for relatively short
stays, have experienced the condition. Their hospitalization often
provides the perfect combination of elements: long stints on
ventilators, heavy sedatives, poor sleep, minimal social interaction.

Delirium takes two forms --- hyperactive, which leads to paranoid
hallucinations and agitation, and hypoactive, which causes internalized
visions and confusion. Some people experience both.

Recovered virus patients have described thinking they were being
abducted or burned alive. Even after their visions go away, the
condition can slow the healing process and increase the risk of
depression or post-traumatic stress. Older patients can also develop
dementia sooner than they otherwise would have, and even die earlier.

\textbf{Another troubling development:} Immunologists believe the
coronavirus may be responsible
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html}{for
depleting disease-fighting T cells}, similar to how H.I.V. operates. If
that's the case, protection against the virus could be fleeting, and a
cocktail of antiviral drugs may be needed to control it.

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second
    bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a
    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}
    immune molecules called antibodies, which are

    These antibodies may} last in the body

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.
