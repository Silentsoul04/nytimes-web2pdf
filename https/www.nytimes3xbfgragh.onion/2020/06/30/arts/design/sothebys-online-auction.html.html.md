# Art Auction or Game Show? Sotheby’s Tries Something New

With a “multicamera global livestream” in place of its usual New York
sale, the auction house tried breathing life back into a pandemic-numbed
market.

LONDON — “This is what we like: the ping-pong between New York and Hong
Kong. We see them on the split screens in perfect clarity,” the
auctioneer Oliver Barker said late Monday, sounding like a prime-time TV
game show host. He was taking seven-figure bids at a Sotheby’s sale of
Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, presented as a “multicamera
global livestream.”

The marathon 74-lot auction at Sotheby’s, which replaced the postponed
May evening sales in New York, used the latest technology to try
breathing life back into the pandemic-numbed top end of the
international art market.

The hybrid format featured the suavely suited Mr. Barker taking bids on
a rostrum in an empty room in London, facing a bank of screens showing
telephone-wielding colleagues in an adjoining room, as well as in New
York and Hong Kong.

Mr. Barker deftly fielded online and on-screen bidding from across the
world for almost five hours, alone in his London control room. [Led by a
Francis Bacon
triptych](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/arts/design/sothebys-online-auction-francis-bacon.html),
five works sold for more than $10 million, and at least eight artist’s
records were set.

“Sales are down across the board, but there’s an incredible amount of
wealth chasing the rarest of the rarest,” said Wendy Cromwell, an art
adviser based in New York. “There’s a real disconnect between who’s
hurting and who isn’t. There’s so much pent-up demand.”

And so it proved. Sotheby’s was fortunate to have secured at least three
major consignments before the lockdowns imposed to fight the coronavirus
pandemic made owners [reluctant to sell high-value artworks via digital
platforms](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/arts/design/buying-art-online.html).
As lockdowns eased around the world, collectors and agents could view
works by appointment in Hong Kong, London and New York. Several works
had been widely published and exhibited, giving bidders further
confidence.

Francis Bacon’s imposing 1981 work “Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of
Aeschylus” had been exhibited since 1993 at the [Astrup Fearnley
Museet](https://www.afmuseet.no/), a private museum in Oslo founded by
the Norwegian collector Hans Rasmus Astrup. Dealers said the museum [had
been trying to sell the triptych privately for more than $100
million](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/arts/design/sothebys-online-auction-francis-bacon.html).
But a more approachable valuation of $60 million at the Sotheby’s
auction encouraged a telephone bidder to give $84.6 million for the
work, the third-highest price achieved for the artist at auction.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The $84.6 million Bacon was underbid online, and the $15.2 million
achieved for a masterpiece-quality 1982 Jean-Michel Basquiat drawing of
a head was not only a record for a work on paper by the artist, but was
also claimed by Sotheby’s to the highest price ever given by an online
bidder at auction.

“This is a departure,” said Guy Jennings, managing director of the Fine
Art Group, a London-based advisory firm. “As a result of this sale we
may see much more confident online bidding at a higher level than we’ve
seen before. There used to be a ceiling of a few hundred thousand on
internet bids.”

High-quality Impressionist and modern pieces were fewer and further
between, as has been the case for several years, but a private
collection of Latin American Surrealist paintings did spark intense
competition. The stand out lot was the haunting, highly detailed 1956
“Harmony (Suggestive Self-Portrait)” by Remedios Varo. This set a new
high of $6.2 million for the Spanish-Mexican artist, underlining the
revaluation of women’s contributions to the Surrealist movement.

Demand for works by long underappreciated female artists was a
consistent theme of the evening. A group of 18 works from the estate of
the pioneering Denver-based dealer and collector Ginny Williams
kick-started the auction, grossing $65.5 million. All of them sold, with
a new auction high for Helen Frankenthaler, whose “Royal Fireworks,” a
spectacularly vibrant 1975 abstract, sold to a telephone bidder for $7.9
million, more than double the high estimate.

Postwar masterworks by male artists from the estate of the fabled
California collectors Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson drew more
measured bidding. A much-published and extremely rare 1947 Clyfford
Still abstract, “PH-144 (1947-Y-No.1),” was the predictable top
performer, selling for $28.7 million, well within
estimate.

“It was a marathon, but bravo. I can see how this could become full
blown reality TV with Sotheby’s broadcasting from Honolulu, Moscow,
Dubai,” said Mary Hoeveler, a New York-based art adviser who watched the
sale online. “Welcome to the pandemic market. It looks like the art
market has a good immune system.”

That said, the final total of $363.2 million represented just over half
the $692 million Sotheby’s raised from its evening Impressionist &
modern and contemporary sales in New York last May.

It looks like the art market may take a while returning to full health.
