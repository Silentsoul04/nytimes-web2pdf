In recent weeks,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/arts/music/k-pop-fans-trump-politics.html}{K-pop
fans have garnered attention} for drowning out racist hashtags on social
media, possibly crashing a police video-submission app with clips of
K-pop idols, organizing
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/arts/music/bts-donate-black-lives-matter.html}{financial
donations to Black Lives Matter}, and being part of a broader social
media movement to flood the Trump campaign with fake ticket requests for
his
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html}{rally
in Tulsa}.

This has caused quite a media hubbub, but in truth, K-pop activism is
consistent with a broader trend in the superfan ---~or stan ---
ecosystem: the emergence of listeners who are asking for more of their
heroes than simply music.

It was there in the dust-up between
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/arts/music/playlist-noname-aretha-franklin-saweetie.html}{J.
Cole and Noname}, fueled by the differing responses each rapper has
deployed to the recent racial justice protests. It's been there in the
push for Drake to engage more directly with current events, and in
recent years, in how fans have responded to Jay-Z's alliances with
institutions
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/style/jay-z-super-bowl-roc-nation.html}{like
the National Football League}.

On this week's Popcast, a conversation about the activism feedback loop
between stans and the stars they obsess over, and how celebrities are
increasingly indebted to their most intense fans, who may have political
and social expectations that the artists may not be ready to deliver on.
