# Most People With Coronavirus Won’t Spread It. Why Do a Few Infect Many?

</div>

Growing evidence shows most infected people aren’t spreading the virus.
But whether you become a superspreader probably depends more on
circumstance than biology.

Following a birthday party in Texas on May 30, one man
[reportedly](https://apnews.com/d9a6ca7eef083315648003509d07515a)
infected 17 members of his family with the coronavirus.

Reading
[reports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
like these, you might think of the virus as a wildfire, instantly
setting off epidemics wherever it goes. But other reports tell another
story altogether.

In Italy, for example, scientists looked at stored samples of wastewater
for the earliest trace of the virus. Last week they
[reported](https://www.thelocal.it/20200619/coronavirus-was-already-in-italy-by-december-waste-water-study-shows)
that the virus was in Turin and Milan as early as Dec. 18. But two
months would pass before northern Italy’s hospitals began filling with
victims of Covid-19. So those December viruses seem to have petered out.

As strange as it may seem, these reports don’t contradict each other.
Most infected people don’t pass on the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html)
to someone else. But a small number pass it on to many others in
so-called superspreading events.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“You can think about throwing a match at kindling,” said Ben Althouse,
principal research scientist at the Institute for Disease Modeling in
Bellevue, Wash. “You throw one match, it may not light the kindling. You
throw another match, it may not light the kindling. But then one match
hits in the right spot, and all of a sudden the fire goes up.”

Understanding why some matches start fires while many do not will be
crucial to curbing the pandemic, scientists say. “Otherwise, you’re in
the position where you’re always one step behind the virus,” said Adam
Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine.

When the virus first emerged in China, epidemiologists scrambled to
understand how it spread from person to person. One of their first tasks
was to estimate the average number of people each sick person infected,
or what epidemiologists call the reproductive number.

The new coronavirus turned out to have a reproductive number somewhere
between two and three. It’s impossible to pin down an exact figure,
since people’s behavior can make it easier or harder for the virus to
spread. By going into lockdown, for instance, Massachusetts [drove its
reproductive number](https://rt.live/us/MA) down from 2.2 at the
beginning of March to 1 by the end of the month; it’s now at .74.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This averaged figure can also be misleading because it masks the
variability of spread from one person to the next. If nine out of 10
people don’t pass on a virus at all, while the 10th passes it to 20
people, the average would still be
two.

In some diseases, such as influenza and smallpox, a large fraction of
infected people pass on the pathogen to a few more. These diseases tend
to grow steadily and slowly. “Flu can really plod along,” said Kristin
Nelson, an assistant professor at Emory University.

But other diseases, like measles and SARS, are prone to sudden flares,
with only a few infected people spreading the disease.

Epidemiologists capture the difference between the flare-ups and the
plodding with something known as the dispersion parameter. It is a
measure of how much variation there is from person to person in
transmitting a pathogen.

But James Lloyd-Smith, a U.C.L.A. disease ecologist who developed the
dispersion parameter 15 years ago, cautioned that just because
scientists can measure it doesn’t mean they understand why some diseases
have more superspreading than others. “We just understand the bits of
it,” he said.

When Covid-19 broke out, Dr. Kucharski and his colleagues tried to
calculate that number by comparing cases in different countries.

If Covid-19 was like the flu, you’d expect the outbreaks in different
places to be mostly the same size. But Dr. Kucharski and his colleagues
found a wide variation. The best way to explain this pattern, they
found, was that 10 percent of infected people were responsible for 80
percent of new infections. Which meant that most people passed on the
virus to few, if any, others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Kucharski and his colleagues published their
[study](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67) in April as a
preprint, a report that has not been reviewed by other scientists and
published in a scientific journal. Other epidemiologists have calculated
the dispersion parameter with other methods, ending up with similar
estimates.

In Georgia, for example, Dr. Nelson and her colleagues analyzed over
9,500 Covid-19 cases from March to May. They created a model for the
[spread of the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/health/coronavirus-infections-us.html)
through five counties and estimated how many people each person
infected.

In a
[preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.20130476v2)
published last week, the researchers found many superspreading events.
Just 2 percent of people were responsible for 20 percent of
transmissions.

Now researchers are trying to figure out why so few people spread the
virus to so many. They’re trying to answer three questions: Who are the
superspreaders? When does superspreading take place? And where?

As for the first question, doctors have observed that viruses can
multiply to bigger numbers inside some people than others. It’s possible
that some people become virus chimneys, blasting out clouds of pathogens
with each breath.

Some people also have more opportunity to get sick, and to then make
other people sick. A bus driver or a nursing home worker may sit at a
hub in the social network, while most people are less likely to come
into contact with others — especially in a lockdown.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Nelson suspects the biological differences between people are less
significant. “I think the circumstances are a lot more important,” she
said. Dr. Lloyd-Smith agreed. “I think it’s more centered on the
events.”

A lot of transmission seems to happen in a narrow window of time
starting a couple days after infection, even before symptoms emerge. If
people aren’t around a lot of people during that window, they can’t pass
it
along.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

And certain places seem to lend themselves to superspreading. A busy
bar, for example, is full of people talking loudly. Any one of them
could spew out viruses without ever coughing. And without good
ventilation, the [viruses can linger in the air for
hours](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html).

A study from Japan this month found [clusters of coronavirus
cases](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/9/20-2272_article) in health
care facilities, nursing homes, day care centers, restaurants, bars,
workplaces, and musical events such as live concerts and karaoke
parties.

This pattern of superspreading could explain the puzzling lag in Italy
between the arrival of the virus and the rise of the epidemic. And
geneticists [have
found](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/health/coronavirus-spread-united-states.html)
a similar lag in other countries: The first viruses to crop up in a
given region don’t give rise to the epidemics that come weeks later.

Many countries and states have fought outbreaks with lockdowns, which
have managed to draw down Covid-19’s reproductive number. But as
governments move toward reopening, they shouldn’t get complacent and
forget the virus’s potential for superspreading.

“You can really go from thinking you’ve got things under control to
having an out-of-control outbreak in a matter of a week,” Dr.
Lloyd-Smith said.

Singapore’s health authorities earned praise early on for holding down
the epidemic by carefully tracing cases of Covid-19. But they didn’t
appreciate that huge dormitories where migrant workers lived were prime
spots for superspreading events. Now they are wrestling with a
resurgence of the virus.

On the other hand, knowing that Covid-19 is a superspreading pandemic
could be a good thing. “It bodes well for control,” Dr. Nelson said.

Since most transmission happens only in a small number of similar
situations, it may be possible to come up with smart strategies to stop
them from happening. It may be possible to avoid crippling,
across-the-board lockdowns by targeting the superspreading events.

“By curbing the activities in quite a small proportion of our life, we
could actually reduce most of the risk,” said Dr. Kucharski.
