\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Allen Y. Lew was best known as a prolific and proficient builder of
public works. He succeeded in what can be a thankless mission by first
bulldozing or, at least, bypassing, the barriers posed by municipal
bureaucracy.

He characterized himself as someone with ``a constructive level of
impatience about getting things done.''

Mr. Lew oversaw billions of dollars' worth of public works in Washington
and New York, where he returned late last year to supervise construction
at his alma mater as the first Asian-American vice chancellor of the
City University of New York.

Mr. Lew died on June 23 at a Queens hospital. He was 69. His wife,
Suling Lew, said the cause was complications of the coronavirus.

Allen Yee Lew was born on Sept. 11, 1950, in Manhattan. His father was
Fong Young Lew, an immigrant from Guangzhou, China. His Chinese-American
mother was Helen (Yee) Lew. His parents owned and operated a
dry-cleaning business.

He was raised in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan and in Long Island City,
Queens. Winning an art contest in elementary school inspired him to
study design. After graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, he
earned a bachelor of science degree in architecture from the City
College of New York, part of the City University.

``It was there that he became intrigued with the development and
construction side of the business,'' Ms. Lew said.

He received a master's degree in architecture and urban design from
Columbia University.

He married Suling Goon, who was an equity sales manager and research
director at an investment bank, in 1979. Along with her, he is survived
by their son, Garrett Lew; a sister, Helen Chin; and a grandson.

In New York, he was executive vice president and chief operating officer
of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center from 1983 to 1988; a vice
president at Rose Associates, the real estate developer; and vice
president for capital programs of the New York City Health and Hospitals
Corporation.

He moved on to Washington to hack through red tape there. As chief
executive of Washington's Sports and Entertainment Commission from 2004
to 2007 under Mayor Anthony A. Williams, he oversaw the design and
rehabilitation of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, which brought
major league baseball back to the nation's capital, and the design and
construction of the \$650 million Nationals Park, a permanent home for
the team.

He also supervised the building of Washington's \$850 million convention
center and managed the \$1 billion rehabilitation of the District of
Columbia's ramshackle school facilities. From 2011 to 2015, he was the
district's city administrator under Mayor
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/04/02/us/muriel-bowser-defeats-mayor-vincent-gray-in-washington-primary.html}{Vincent
C. Gray}, who described him as a ``visionary and a doer.''

Mr. Lew was president of the Washington Architectural Foundation, the
philanthropic arm of the Washington chapter of the American Institute of
Architects, before joining CUNY as the senior vice chancellor of
facilities, planning and construction management.

``Allen built a reputation as a hard-driving executive who prized speed
and efficiency and mastered the art of cutting through bureaucracy,''
the university's chancellor, Félix V. Matos Rodríguez said in a
statement.

Sometimes his methods raised eyebrows. He was once chided by the
Washington city auditor for obstructing transparency. Mr. Lew attributed
the lapse to inadequate record-keeping and what he called his ``nimble''
circumvention of stultifying regulations that impeded progress.
