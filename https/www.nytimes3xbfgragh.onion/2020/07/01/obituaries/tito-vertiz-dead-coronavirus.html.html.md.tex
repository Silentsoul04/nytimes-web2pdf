Mr. Vértiz, a citizen of three countries, left Peru as a flight
attendant in the 1960s and built friendships around the world. He died
of Covid-19.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

The last months of Tito Vértiz's life were marked by the harsh realities
of the pandemic, yet he remained until the end ``a writer, painter, bon
vivant, uncle and much-loved friend with a zest for life,'' said one of
those friends, Lucrecia Briceno, a theater lighting designer whom he had
met at college in Florida.

Mr. Vértiz died on May 29 in Lima, Peru, of Covid-19, friends said. He
was 80.

José Ernesto Vértiz was born on Dec. 12, 1939, in Lima. He had a job as
a flight attendant and left Peru in the 1960s to attend college in the
United States. He eventually acquired U.S. citizenship; friends said he
was also an Italian citizen through his Italian mother.

Mr. Vértiz was as restless in his academic career as he was in the rest
of his life. He studied architecture at New York University and therapy
at the University of Nebraska, and he eventually earned a master's
degree from the University of Florida, also in therapy.

He found work as a therapist in Alachua County jails, in the
Gainesville, Fla., area, mostly working as a counselor for women
prisoners, whom he called his angels. After retirement, he spent time
writing novels, partly based on his experiences counseling prisoners,
four of which
\href{https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Tito-Vertiz/dp/1506509355}{he
published} himself, in Spanish; two of them were translated into
English. He had finished writing another novel shortly before his death.

He also painted, filling his home in Gainesville with his works,
including landscapes, self-portraits and portraits of his friends and
loved ones.

``He had so much energy for the rest of his life,'' Ms. Briceno said. He
played guitar as well, and he could converse brilliantly on almost any
subject, she said, one of the reasons he acquired a large group of
friends all over the world.

Mr. Vértiz returned to Peru in 2005 to take care of his beloved younger
sister, Elena, his only sibling, who was stricken by Alzheimer's
disease. After she died, Mr. Vértiz planned to return to the United
States. He had reserved space in a care home in Atlanta, but before he
could leave, Peru imposed a lockdown because of the pandemic, which
included closing its international airports.

He stayed with family, including his sister's husband, in a family-owned
building. Both became ill with Covid-19, family members said.

When he got sick, Mr. Vértiz decided to remain home surrounded by his
numerous nieces and nephews rather than go to a hospital. Family members
told friends that his brother-in-law died a few weeks after he did.
