You might call it poetic, if it weren’t so painful. Donald Trump won the
White House largely on a campaign of shutting America’s borders to
pretty much everyone other than people of European descent. “Why are we
having all these people from shithole countries come here?” [he once
asked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html),
about Haitians, Salvadorans and Africans. “We should have more people
from places like Norway.”

So what should one conclude about America’s own proximity to Trump’s
global latrine now that “places like Norway” have decided to keep
*their* borders indefinitely closed to us?

Among [the list of
nations](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/06/30/council-agrees-to-start-lifting-travel-restrictions-for-residents-of-some-third-countries/)
to which Norway and the rest of Europe will soon reopen for travel are
three from the continent that Trump flushed down the toilet: [Algeria,
Morocco and
Rwanda](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/world/europe/eu-reopening-blocks-us-travelers.html).
Canada is also on the list. So is China, assuming it reciprocates.

But Trump’s America is not, because we are nowhere close to meeting
Europe’s criteria for reducing the spread of the coronavirus. How
successfully a society can fight a pandemic is as objective a measure of
national capacity, not to mention “greatness,” as one is likely to find
— and on this, like so much else these days, America ranks near the
bottom.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I have lived in the United States for more than 30 years, and I can’t
think of any national failure as naked and complete as this one. When I
look at the graphs showing American infections soaring while the virus
abates [in nearly every other affluent
country](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/briefing/coronavirus-mississippi-new-england-patriots-your-monday-briefing.html),
I feel the sting of defeat, misery and embarrassment.

As an immigrant from South Africa, I find it hard to resist seeing
Europe’s travel dis as the ultimate comeuppance of Trump’s xenophobia.
Like a lot of Americans, I sometimes find myself assuming [American
exceptionalism](https://theweek.com/articles/654508/what-exactly-american-exceptionalism)
— the idea that America’s founding ideals make us morally superior to
“ordinary” nations and confer on us special credibility and insight
when dealing with global crises.

But America’s pandemic failure demolishes the notion that our country is
better off without people and ideas from beyond our borders. The last
few months should stick a fork in the absurd proposition that the United
States enjoys some kind of monopoly on brilliance. Clearly, we do not.
Rather than close ourselves off from the planet, we should be inviting
others to join the urgent project of rebuilding America.

I bang this drum often. As I’ve argued before, I am in favor of
[throwing America’s borders wide
open](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/16/opinion/open-borders-immigration.html)
to much of the world. My primary reasons are moral — I don’t think a
country founded on the idea that everyone is equal should seal itself
off to the ambitious billions who live beyond our shores.

There are also powerful economic and strategic arguments for openness;
American exceptionalism is impossible without immigration. [The only
way](http://paulgraham.com/95.html) that a country with less than 5
percent of the world’s population can maintain the long-term economic
and cultural superiority to which many Americans feel entitled is to
collectively produce much more than 5 percent of the world’s best ideas.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The only way to do that is to invite in the other 95 percent. I spent
much of my career covering Silicon Valley. Some of the most innovative
companies in the world — from Google to Intel to Instagram to Stripe —
were founded by immigrants, and many in the industry say the whole place
[would not work without
immigration](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/08/technology/personaltech/why-silicon-valley-wouldnt-work-without-immigrants.html).

I am not one of those lefties who believe that Trump bears all of the
blame for our flawed response to the virus. The breakdown here was so
total that it [lays bare larger and more persistent
ailments](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/):
our creaking health care system, the ruthlessness of our economy, our
Swiss-cheese safety net, and political polarization that poisons
effective action but excels at whipping up nonsensical culture wars.

The totality of our failure is precisely why we should look to the
outside for success — yet Trump has used the virus as an excuse to
[accelerate his restrictions on
immigration](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-immigration-policies.html).

Last week, Trump [suspended the issuance of work
visas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-h1b-work-visas.html)
for hundreds of thousands of foreigners, from tech workers to seasonal
workers in the hospitality industry to au pairs and students.

Another group the restriction affects is doctors. [About 127,000
doctors](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/fear-deportation-heightened-immigrant-doctors-h-1b-visas-amid-pandemic-n1204791),
nearly a quarter of the physicians in the United States, are immigrants.
Many of them are now [caring for coronavirus
patients](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/06/immigrant-h1b-doctors-coronavirus-green-card/)
in communities without enough health care professionals. All the while,
immigrant doctors have had to worry not only that they might die of the
virus while taking care of Americans, but also that if they do, their
families could be deported.

This is madness. More than that: If we keep shutting foreigners out,
what justifies our arrogant assumption that the world’s best and
brightest will keep wanting to come here?

Consider, for instance, Rwanda, one of the countries that did make
Europe’s list. In 1994, it suffered a genocide in which the United
States and the United Nations infamously refused to intervene. Almost a
million people were killed. In the 26 years since, Rwanda has [rebuilt
itself](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/06/world/africa/rwanda-genocide-25-years.html),
and now it boasts one of the most [capable medical systems in
Africa](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/rwandas-successes-and-challenges-in-response-to-covid-19/).
Rwanda’s 13 million people have nearly universal health care coverage;
the country uses drones to carry blood and other supplies to far-flung
hospitals.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And when the coronavirus came,
[Rwanda](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-african-nations-are-teaching-the-west-about-fighting-the-coronavirus)set
up contact tracing to quickly halt the spread of the virus, making
it[one of several African
countries](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-african-nations-are-teaching-the-west-about-fighting-the-coronavirus)
to squash it. To date, only two Rwandans are known to have died of
Covid-19.

I truly hope that Rwandans and others witnessing America’s dysfunction
are not tempted to celebrate our fall. The United States’ coronavirus
failure is a loss for the world, which has long depended on American
leadership to combat global crises.

The lesson here is obvious: We are all in this together. It’s time to
stop pretending that America, and Americans, have all the answers. We
need all the help we can get.
