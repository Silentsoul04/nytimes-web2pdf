WASHINGTON --- The chief executives of four of the world's biggest
technology companies will appear before Congress this month as part of
its sweeping antitrust investigation into their market power, according
to the committee running the inquiry, setting up a high-profile face-off
between the companies and skeptical lawmakers.

Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and
Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, will appear at
the hearing, said Shadawn Reddick-Smith, a spokeswoman for the House
Judiciary Committee, which is said to be nearing the end of its
investigation.

The date and whether the executives will appear in person or virtually,
as has become common during the coronavirus pandemic, are still being
discussed, Ms. Reddick-Smith said.

The hearing will allow lawmakers to ask the executives about accusations
of antitrust abuses at their companies, all of which are the focus of
investigations by federal regulators or state attorneys general. The
executives are also likely to face questions about other issues, like
Amazon's treatment of its warehouse workers or the spread of hate speech
on Facebook and YouTube.

The hearing would be a central moment in the continuing backlash against
the power of major tech companies. Prosecutors at the Justice Department
are preparing a possible antitrust case against Google this year, after
an inquiry homed in on its control of advertising technology and the
search engine market. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating
Amazon's business and Facebook's acquisition of smaller companies.

A number of state attorneys general are investigating similar issues and
could pursue their own actions or work with federal authorities.

It will be the first time that Mr. Bezos will testify before Congress.
Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Cook have appeared in front of
Capitol Hill lawmakers before.

Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon declined to comment on the record about
the committee's plans. An Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to
a request for comment.

The plans for the hearing were

earlier by Kara Swisher}, a contributing opinion writer for The New York
Times.

The lawmakers' investigation has focused on different aspects of each
business. They have raised many questions about Amazon's treatment of
brands that sell products on its e-commerce site. Much of the attention
on Google has been on its lucrative ad business. With Apple, lawmakers
have asked about how its App Store terms hurt developers. Their
questions to Facebook have been largely about its use of past
acquisitions to cement its dominance in social media.

Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook are four of the five biggest tech
companies by market value. The fifth, Microsoft, has not been subjected
to the same public scrutiny in recent years. It faced a landmark
antitrust case a generation ago.
