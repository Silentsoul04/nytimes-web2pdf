\section{Maria de Sousa, Leading Portuguese Scientist, Dies at
80}\label{maria-de-sousa-leading-portuguese-scientist-dies-at-80}}

She focused on the immune system and helped establish a major academic
program in her field. She died after testing positive for the novel
coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Maria de Sousa, one of Portugal's leading scientists, first made her
mark with research in immunology while working in Britain and the United
States.

But after two decades abroad, she returned home with two goals:
developing a national program of science education and creating a better
understanding of
\href{https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemochromatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351443}{hemochromatosis},
a hereditary disease especially prevalent in northern Portugal in which
the body absorbs excessive amounts of iron.

Dr. de Sousa died on April 14 at a hospital in Lisbon. She was 80. The
cause was Covid-19, according to the Institute for Research and
Innovation in Health at the University of Porto, where she was a
professor emeritus.

Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the president of Portugal, paid homage to Dr.
de Sousa's scientific accomplishments and ``broad vision of the world,
which was not limited to academia but instead embraced with enthusiasm
the relationship between knowledge, society, science and the arts.''

She managed to become ``a prominent woman scientist at times when it was
even harder than now,'' said one of her former students, Rui Costa, who
is the director and chief executive of the
\href{https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/}{Mortimer B. Zuckerman
Mind Brain Behavior Institute} at Columbia University. Her efforts to
train a new generation of Portuguese researchers, he added, ``was really
like a national scientific revolution.''

Maria Angela Brito de Sousa was born on Oct. 17, 1939, in Lisbon. Her
father was a naval officer and her mother a homemaker. She received a
medical degree in 1963 and then left for Britain to continue her
studies, making a rare move overseas during Portugal's dictatorship.

She earned a doctorate in immunology at the University of Glasgow, then
came to the United States, where she was an adjunct professor at what
was then Cornell Medical College and became head of the cell ecology lab
at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

She began building an international reputation in the 1960s with
research into the functions of the immune system's organs, in particular
the thymus and its T-cells. Dr. de Sousa explained how these cells could
rearrange themselves in other organs, like the digestive tract. This
finding also helped show that if the cells were injected into the blood,
they could then naturally make their home in different parts of the
body.

She then narrowed her focus to investigating the immune system's role in
resisting iron poisoning, studying patients with an iron overload.

In the mid-1980s Dr. de Sousa returned to Portugal, where she used her
iron toxicity research to focus on hereditary hemochromatosis. That
disease can cause joint pain and weight loss, but in its most acute form
it can also lead to liver cancer or diabetes.

At the same time, she pushed for the creation of Portugal's first
doctoral program in biomedicine, setting up the
\href{https://gabba.up.pt/}{Graduate Program on Basic and Applied
Biology} at the University of Porto. Having kept a home in New York, she
also started the A\href{https://www.apbrf.org/}{merican-Portuguese
Biomedical Research Fund}, which supports young researchers.

Dr. de Sousa, who has no immediate survivors, received one of Portugal's
highest honors, the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint James of the
Sword, in 2016.
