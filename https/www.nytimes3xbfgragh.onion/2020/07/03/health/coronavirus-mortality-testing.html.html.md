After a minor late-spring lull, the number of confirmed
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/florida-mother-2-children-covid-19.html)
cases in the United States is [once again on the
rise](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
States like Arizona, Florida and Texas are seeing some of their highest
numbers to date, and as the nation hurtles further into summer, the
surge shows few signs of stopping.

And yet the virus appears to be killing fewer of the people it infects.
In April and May, Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, led
to as many as 3,000
[deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/florida-mother-2-children-covid-19.html)
per day, and claimed the lives of roughly 7 to 8 percent of Americans
known to have been infected. The number of daily deaths is [now closer
to 600](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/briefing/coronavirus-jobs-numbers-joe-biden-your-thursday-briefing.html),
and the death rate is less than 5 percent.

In general, experts see three broad reasons for the downward trend in
the rate of coronavirus deaths: testing, treatment and a shift in whom
the virus is infecting. The relative contribution of these factors is
not yet clear. And because death reports can lag diagnoses by weeks, the
current rise in coronavirus cases could still portend increases in
mortality in the days to come.

## Testing on the rise

Since mid-March, when the coronavirus was declared a national emergency,
diagnostic testing for the coronavirus has risen significantly. More
than 600,000 tests are administered each day in the United States, up
from about 100,000 per day in early spring. Although the nation is still
falling short of the [millions of daily tests that experts have called
for](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-policy-watch/what-testing-capacity-do-we-need/),
the increased testing has identified many more infected individuals with
mild or no symptoms, driving down the overall proportion of patients who
die from Covid-19, said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns
Hopkins Center for Health Security.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And with more tests available, infections are often identified earlier,
“which allows us to intervene earlier,” said Saskia Popescu, a
hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease expert in Arizona. Many
treatments seem to work best when given well before people are at
death’s door.

As the weeks have worn on, doctors and nurses have also gained a better
handle on how to treat the coronavirus. In several states, emergency
departments are [no longer overflowing](https://covidtracking.com/data);
between April and June, nationwide hospitalizations dropped to less than
30,000 from nearly 60,000, [according to the Covid Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily). That may have eased
the strain on exhausted employees and limited medical supply chains,
including those that keep lifesaving equipment like ventilators in
stock, said Dr. Taison Bell, a physician specializing in infectious
disease and pulmonary and critical care at the University of Virginia.
Under less pressure, hospitals are now “better able to take care of
critically ill patients,” he said.

## More and better treatments

Health care workers have also become more knowledgeable about promising
treatments and palliative care options to combat the coronavirus and its
effects. For instance, prone positioning, in which patients are flipped
onto their stomachs, can [ease respiratory
distress](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2767575)
by [opening up the
lungs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/health/coronavirus-proning-lungs.html).
Critically ill individuals are also now known to be vulnerable to
[excessive blood
clotting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/health/coronavirus-strokes.html),
and may [benefit from blood
thinners](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/135/23/2033/454646/COVID-19-and-its-implications-for-thrombosis-and).
And the steroid [dexamethasone appears to reduce
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html)
among patients with severe Covid-19, although the data demonstrating
this emerged only recently. (Another drug, an antiviral called
remdesivir, seems to [speed
recovery](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-remdesivir.html),
but does not appear to have notable effects on
mortality.)

“Before, it felt like we were stumbling in the dark,” Dr. Bell said. “It
feels a little bit better now.”

## A new patient population

A shifting patient population is probably also altering the disease’s
dynamics. Coronavirus-related hospitalizations [increase with
age](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html),
and elderly individuals remain some of those hardest hit by the
coronavirus; [patients over 65 account for eight out of 10 deaths from
Covid-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html),
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But
[younger people now make up a growing proportion of
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/coronavirus-cases-young-people.html),
and they are less likely to die from the disease. In Arizona, people
ages 20 to 44 now account for nearly half of all cases. In Florida,
which just recorded [more than 10,000 new
cases](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-florida/florida-shatters-records-with-over-10000-new-covid-19-cases-in-single-day-idUSKBN243299)
in a single day, the median age of residents testing positive has
dropped to 35 from 65. And in Texas, more than half of those testing
positive are [under the age
of 50](https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/ed483ecd702b4298ab01e8b9cafc8b83).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Numerous states recently began reopening their economies, which might be
driving some of the youthful bias, said Natalie Dean, an infectious
disease epidemiologist in Florida, where new cases are hitting record
highs. People in their 20s and 30s have returned to bars and beaches;
working-age employees have resumed jobs that cannot be done from home.

“We know that’s high-risk,” Dr. Dean said. “We’re hearing a lot of
reports of clusters being linked to these places” as they open back up.

At the same time, elderly individuals, as well as those with [underlying
health conditions thought to exacerbate
Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/coronavirus-underlying-conditions.html),
may be warier of exposure, said C. Brandon Ogbunu, a computational
biologist and disease ecologist at Yale University. “Early on, this
disease ripped through older populations with such aggression,” he said.
“It’s possible that’s where the message was felt the most strongly.”

Moreover, nursing homes and other facilities that harbor vulnerable
populations may be working harder to protect their residents, Dr. Dean
said. In general, “We now have a better set of tools to keep our
communities safer,” he said. “More people are wearing masks. We’re
better at sanitizing things.”

Of course, “Young people don’t live in isolation,” Dr. Bell said. They
are still mingling with older members of the population — potentially
seeding transmission events that have yet to appear.

## Looking ahead

Experts can’t be sure, but behaviors like mask wearing, physical
distancing and hygiene may also be reducing the dose of coronavirus that
people encounter in the population at large, Dr. Dean said. The amount
of virus that individuals carry [may influence the severity of their
symptoms](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/health/coronavirus-transmission-dose.html).
But so far, there is no evidence that this dynamic is contributing to
the lower mortality rate in the United
States.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

There is also no indication that the death rate is lower because the
coronavirus itself has become less deadly, Dr. Ogbunu said. Mutation is
a normal part of any virus’s evolutionary trajectory, but these genetic
changes are [often
inconsequential](https://undark.org/2020/05/14/covid-19-evolution-mutation/).

Given the recent rise in infections, the dip in coronavirus mortality
will not necessarily last. As more people socialize, those with milder
infections might end up ferrying the pathogen to vulnerable individuals.
As states reopen, local leaders are urging residents to continue
physical distancing and to wear masks. But even tempered by warnings,
moves back toward normalcy could inadvertently signal to people that the
worst is already over, Dr. Popescu said.

Experts are also reluctant to place too much emphasis on falling death
rates. “We’re training a lot of attention on the idea of mortality,”
said Dr. Jennifer Tsai, an emergency medicine physician at Yale
University. Behind that picture, she added, there is a great deal of
suffering. Reports from around the world have painted a sobering
portrait of [chronic Covid-19
syndromes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-recovery-survivors.html),
some of which last for months. Patients may be saddled with physical and
emotional distress that persists long after the virus has left their
bodies.

“Death is not the only outcome,” Dr. Dean said. And people marginalized
by race, ethnicity and social standing will inevitably [bear more of the
disease
burden](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html)
than others, Dr. Tsai added. “The risk and the mortality is going to be
passed on to the most vulnerable, no matter who gets infected first,”
she said.

Recent upswings in coronavirus case numbers leave experts apprehensive
of what’s to come. Death, when it occurs, tends to trail infection [by
about two to four
weeks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html).
Early on in the pandemic, when testing focused on patients with
worrisome symptoms, the typical lag between case and death reporting was
a week or two. Now that diagnostic testing is more widespread, that
interval has widened.

Two weeks into a new round of coronavirus cases, the United States may
be verging on another wave of deaths. Already, hospitalizations have
begun [an alarming
upsurge](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/23/coronavirus-live-updates-us/)
in several states.

“I think the next two to three weeks will be very telling,” Dr. Popescu
said.
