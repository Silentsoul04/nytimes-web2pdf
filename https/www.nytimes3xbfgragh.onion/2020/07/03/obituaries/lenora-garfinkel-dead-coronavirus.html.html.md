Ms. Garfinkel thrived in a field dominated by men, juggling a career

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

When Leonard Josephy took the admissions exam for [Cooper
Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome)in 1949, the circumstances were unusual
in two ways. The first was that it was a Sunday, because as an observant
Jew, Leonard could not take the test on a Saturday, with the other
applicants.

The second and more significant difference was that Leonard was actually
Lenora, using a man’s name on her application because the school’s
architecture program at the time was almost entirely male.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Better odds, she figured.

Whether by hook or by crook, her plan worked, and the future architect,
having overcome two artificial barriers — her faith and her gender — had
a story to tell her future children.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So began a distinguished career designing buildings for Orthodox Jewish
congregations in the New York area, as one of the few women in the
field.

She worked until she was 85 from her home in Monsey, N.Y., in Rockland
County — raising five children, caring for a disabled brother and
teaching Hebrew school along the way. She died on April 29 at Hackensack
University Medical Center in New Jersey, after spending her 90th
birthday on a ventilator.

The cause was the novel coronavirus, which also claimed one of her sons
and a grandson over the next two weeks, all at different hospitals, her
daughter Letitia Dahan Forspan said.

“It’s been overwhelming,” Ms. Forspan said.

Lenora Fay Josephy was born in the Bronx on April 12, 1930, the oldest
of three children of Hyman and Bertha Josephy. Her father taught at New
York University, on the old Bronx campus; her mother worked as a
secretary.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lenora attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, commuting
from the Bronx, and then spent a year at Hunter College before she was
allowed to take the Cooper Union exam on a Sunday. A family friend, a
judge, had advised her that the test’s Saturday-only format amounted to
religious discrimination, and told her to push the issue. She did, with
good results.

“I never got the picture that she was breaking the glass ceiling because
she wanted to break the glass ceiling,” her grandson Ariel Dahan, who
lived with her in her later years, said. “She just wanted to be an
architect, so this is what she did.”

She met a pharmacy student named Samuel Garfinkel, from Winnipeg,
Manitoba, and the two married, twice — once in the Bronx, once in
Winnipeg.

After graduating from Cooper Union in 1952, Ms. Garfinkel worked for
another architect, then branched out on her own. The family moved to
Spring Valley, in Rockland County, in 1958, and later to Monsey, to a
house she had designed on spec for a builder.

Both areas had large Orthodox populations with specific needs: for
synagogues or wedding halls or ritual baths — mikvahs — all regulated in
their design by Jewish law. Ms. Garfinkel navigated these arcana with
rabbis, and explained them to community zoning boards.

A simple handrail in a school hallway had to meet local building codes,
fire codes and the Americans With Disabilities Act as well as Jewish
law.

“It’s a lot of laws,” said Rabbi Yaakov Bender of Far Rockaway, Queens,
whose home she redesigned.

She often worked until the wee hours of the morning, Mr. Dahan said.
“Three o’clock was ice cream o’clock,” he said.

Her noteworthy buildings, all aesthetically simple, include a cavernous
synagogue for the Viznitz Hasidic sect in Kaser, N.Y., the
[Atrium](https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/featured/1838568/alert-from-rockland-health-dept-atrium-wedding-hall-among-locations-exposed-to-coronavirus.html)catering
hall in Monsey and the [Masores Bais
Yaakov](https://insideschools.org/school/22KAHA) school in Brooklyn.

But her signal edifice was her family, her daughter and grandson said.
She is survived by four children, 19 grandchildren and 49
great-grandchildren. Two of her sons, Eliezer and Chaim, became
architects.
