This Fourth of July, it’s worth taking stock of the state of freedom —
and of our attitudes toward it — at home and around the world.

In Russia, Vladimir Putin [just won a
“plebiscite”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/world/europe/putin-referendum-vote-russia.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
ratifying his right to stay in power until the year 2036. In Hong Kong,
[a new security law came into
effect](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-china.html)
effectively putting an end to the right of peaceful protest. In Poland,
a [runoff election will
decide](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/04/poland-is-showing-the-world-how-not-to-run-a-pandemic-election/)
if the country continues its slide toward illiberalism.

In the United States, these stories barely make a dent on public
consciousness. Conservatives and liberals alike have ceased to care very
much about the denial of freedom to others.

We also have our own problems with freedom.

For once, the main problem isn’t Donald Trump. The president may be an
instinctual fascist, a wannabe autocrat. But, after nearly four years in
power, he’s been unmasked as an incompetent one.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Trump may have privately praised Xi Jinping for building concentration
camps for Uighurs. Congress still passed legislation to impose sanctions
on China for them. He may want to bring Russia back to the G7. The other
six won’t let him. He may have sought to abolish DACA for the Dreamers.
John Roberts decided otherwise. He may call the press an “enemy of the
American people.” That enemy still operates without restraint when it
comes to slamming him.

To adapt the Lloyd Bentsen line, Donald John Trump, you’re no Recep
Tayyip Erdogan.

The more serious problem today comes from the left: from liberal elites
who, when tested, lack the courage of their liberal convictions; from
so-called progressives whose core convictions were never liberal to
begin with; from administrative types at nonprofits and corporations
who, with only vague convictions of their own, don’t want to be on the
wrong side of a P.R. headache.

This has been the great cultural story of the last few years. It is
[typified by
incidents](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/04/opinion/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html)
such as The New Yorker’s David Remnick thinking it would be a good idea
to interview Steve Bannon for the magazine’s annual festival — until a
Twitter mob and some members of his own staff decided otherwise. Or by
The Washington Post [devoting 3,000
words](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/blackface-incident-at-washington-post-cartoonists-2018-halloween-party-resurfaces-amid-protests/2020/06/17/66f09bde-af2e-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html)
to destroying the life of a private person of no particular note because
in 2018 she wore blackface, with ironic intent, at a Halloween party. Or
by big corporations [pulling ads from
Facebook](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/business/media/Facebook-advertising-boycott.html)
while demanding the company do more to censor forms of speech they deem
impermissible.

These stories matter because an idea is at risk. That’s the idea that
people who cannot speak freely will not be able to think clearly, and
that no society can long flourish when contrarians are treated as
heretics.

That idea, old as Socrates, formerly had powerful institutional
defenders, especially in the form of universities, news media, book
publishers, free-speech groups and major philanthropies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But those defenders are, on account of one excuse or another,
capitulating to people who claim free speech for themselves (but not for
others), who believe all the old patriarchal hierarchies must go (so
that new “intersectional” hierarchies may arise), who are in a perpetual
fervor to rewrite the past (all the better to control the future), and
who demand cringing public apologies from those who have sinned against
an ever-more radical ideological standard (while those apologies won’t
save them from being fired).

As in so much else, George Orwell was here before us. In connection to
the recent vandalism of monuments and destruction of statues, a line
from “1984” has been making the rounds — “every book has been rewritten,
every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building
has been renamed, every date has been altered.” But the Orwell essay to
which I keep returning is a little jewel from 1946, “[The Prevention of
Literature](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-prevention-of-literature/).”

Orwell’s concern then was not just with Russian totalitarianism, but
with the arguments used by much of the Western intelligentsia to justify
repression.

“What is sinister,” he wrote, “is that the conscious enemies of liberty
are those to whom liberty ought to mean most.” He was particularly
calling out Western scientists who admired the Soviet Union for its
technical prowess and were utterly indifferent to Stalin’s persecution
of writers and artists. “They do not see that any attack on intellectual
liberty, and on the concept of objective truth, threatens in the long
run every department of thought.”

*Every department of thought.* Right now, all the Twitter furors, the
angry rows over publication decisions, the canceled speeches and books,
the semantic battles about which words take an uppercase and which
don’t, may seem remote to those who care about more tangible issues:
depression, disease, police abuse, urban decline. Yet the issue that
counts the most is whether the institutions that are supposed to
champion liberal ideals will muster the moral confidence to survive. On
this July 4, it’s very much in doubt.
