# Critics Fear Amtrak Is Using Pandemic to Cut Service That Won’t Return

</div>

Members of Congress are angry that the rail agency is asking for more
money while planning to lay off staff and reduce services. Smaller
communities that rely on rail service could be badly hurt.

WASHINGTON — Amtrak has long wanted to cut back on long-distance train
routes that span America’s heartland, but political pressure from
Congress made it next to impossible.

Then came the coronavirus.

Since March, the pandemic has [killed over 128,000
Americans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
and exacted a higher financial toll on the transportation industry than
the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Amtrak has not been spared, with an
internal analysis showing a 95 percent drop in ridership, and revenue
projected to fall by 50 percent in 2021.

In an effort to stay afloat, the rail agency announced last month it
would cut up to 20 percent of its work force by October. It also will
suspend daily service on long-distance train routes that service over
220 communities across the country, according to industry experts who
analyzed the effect of proposed cuts to national train routes when the
Trump administration tried to gut the service in 2019.

The moves have been met with intense skepticism, and even anger.

Amtrak received letters from 16 senators last week asking why it needed
to enact such steep cuts since it had already received $1 billion in
emergency aid. The agency had also requested nearly $1.5 billion in
additional funding on top of its standard $2 billion budget request for
2021.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are deeply concerned by the downsizing plan,” a bipartisan coalition
of seven senators, led by Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, said in
its letter to Amtrak. “These cuts would not only dramatically reduce the
utility of the nation’s passenger rail network, but would also ignore
congressional intent to expedite economic recovery following the
pandemic.”

Critics argue Amtrak’s cutbacks are not a surprise, and fall in line
with the agency’s recent desires to prioritize profitability and the
reduction of long-distance routes. The rail agency receives federal
funds but is independently run.

“I fear that the Covid-19 pandemic is convenient reasoning to do that
which Amtrak, over the past several years, has determined to do,” said
John Robert Smith, a former chairman of Amtrak’s board, “and that is to
dismantle the national
system.”

A spokesman for Amtrak, Jason Abrams, said in a statement that the
agency was cutting back service “to better align our service with
demand” during the pandemic.

“We are fully committed to returning this service when demand returns
and with adequate funding,” he said, adding: “Amtrak is adjusting its
work force to better match this reduced demand. As a first step, we are
offering employees a voluntary incentive package.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Supporters of continued rail service say Amtrak’s decision will be
particularly damaging to small communities where the train provides an
economic lifeline and may be the only transit option available to
residents.

They also point out that ridership on long-distance routes in May
dropped by 78 percent compared with the same period last year, while
ridership on shorter routes fell more than 90 percent.

“A lot of people can’t fly, they just can’t get on the plane,” said Sean
Jeans-Gail, the vice president at the Rail Passengers Association.
“Amtrak is the only way they can get around. Those users of the system
have a right to be very concerned.”

On Monday, the rail agency [will
reduce](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2020/06/29/amtrak-reduce-new-york-florida-trains-starting-july-6/3254400001/)
service from New York to Miami to four days a week rather than each day.
Up to 20 percent of the work force, or nearly 4,000 employees, could be
let go by October. Most of the network’s 15 long-distance train routes
will see daily service cut to three days a week starting in the fall.
Even Amtrak’s busiest route in the Northeast Corridor will have fewer
trains serving passengers every day.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Amtrak is prepared to cut its operating costs by $500 million in its
2021 fiscal year, which starts in October, anticipating ridership will
not return to prepandemic levels because of “changed behaviors, such as
increased telework and reduced discretionary income,” according to a
letter William J. Flynn, Amtrak’s new chief executive, wrote to Congress
in May.

But the agency recognizes that the future is hard to predict.

“Generating estimates of future demand is incredibly challenging, given
the unprecedented nature of our current circumstances and the unknowable
trajectory of the pandemic,” Mr. Flynn wrote. “Most demand predictions
anticipate a second wave of Covid-19 impacts in the fall, and that
further complicates any forecast.”

Many in Congress are skeptical, and are asking the rail agency to
provide stronger proof that such drastic action is needed even with
significant emergency funding from Congress.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We would like to ensure that reductions in frequencies for
long-distance routes do not unnecessarily extend beyond the Covid-19
crisis,” a group of five Republican senators, led by Roger Wicker of
Mississippi, wrote last week in a letter obtained by The New York Times.
“What data is Amtrak using to justify reductions in service for all of
fiscal year 2021?”

Since Amtrak was created in 1971 by Congress to be the nation’s rail
operator, it has lost money. Federal subsidies and payments from states
have allowed the network to remain operational, and it has become an
integral mode of transport in corridors like the Northeast and Southern
California.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days

In 2017, Amtrak’s board hired Richard Anderson, a former chief executive
of Delta Air Lines, to take the reins of the rail network and make it
profitable and more reliable. His three-year contract recently expired,
but he will remain on staff for the remainder of 2020 as a senior
adviser to Mr. Flynn.

Mr. Anderson took his charge from the board seriously, and embarked on a
mission to trim the work force and improve shorter-haul, more trafficked
routes in corridors like the Northeast, while scaling back support for
longer-haul and less popular routes that run across parts of America’s
Southern, mountain and Western regions.

“We should be looking at breaking up some of those long-distance
trains,” Mr. Anderson said last year at a Senate hearing, “and
figuring out how we serve the American consumer to provide high-quality
service in short-haul markets.”

In 2018, he decided to close an Amtrak reservation call center in
California, and told 500 employees they could keep their jobs if they
moved to Philadelphia — where the positions were being relocated — in 60
days. Around 100 took the offer, according to the Transportation
Communications Union.

The same year, Mr. Anderson tried to significantly cut long-distance
service along a 2,200 mile route which stretches from Chicago to Los
Angeles, and replace the portion from Kansas to New Mexico with bus
service. Amtrak abandoned its plans after receiving fierce blowback from
members of Congress.

During a congressional hearing last year, Senator Jerry Moran,
Republican of Kansas, said “the idea that Amtrak would think about
replacing passenger service with bus service for 400 miles” was
something he could not “get over because it tells me your attitude
toward that line or maybe toward long-distance nonprofitable passenger
service.”

Mr. Flynn has yet to testify before Congress about his vision for the
rail network, but he said this week [in an interview with The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live-amtrak-ceo-william-flynn/)
that service cuts to Amtrak’s long-distance routes would remain in
effect for the winter and would be re-evaluated on a route-by-route
basis next spring and summer.

Critics also warn that cutting service on long-distance train routes
makes them a less attractive option, with passengers having to wait days
for trips or endure long layovers between connecting routes.

Others point to [Amtrak’s
statements](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106shrg85968/pdf/CHRG-106shrg85968.pdf)
from as far back as 2000, in which its leadership said attempts to
reduce long-distance service “ended up costing the company more in lost
revenue than we were able to take out in the way of expenses” because
some fixed costs could not be cut even after reducing service from daily
to three days a week.

“We’ve done it before,” Mr. Smith said. “It doesn’t pay, it doesn’t save
the money and it drives off revenue.”
