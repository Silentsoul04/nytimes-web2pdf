OFF THE COAST OF MAINE — As he pulled alongside one of his lobster pots,
marked by a red and yellow buoy on the Penobscot Bay, Mike Hutchings
extracted and measured several of the crustaceans that would contribute
to his 130-pound catch that day. It was a decent haul but his assessment
of the fishing season was grim: “The worst it’s ever been.”

Mr. Hutchings’s catch on the final Saturday in June came as the lobster
trade approached its money-making time. With the Fourth of July holiday
around the corner, Mr. Hutchings and his fellow lobstermen were supposed
to be gearing up for a major payday as out-of-staters, cruise ships,
warmer weather and bounties of lobsters, having just molted their shells
and been lured into the thousands of traps anchored on the rocky bottom
of Maine’s coastal waters, came together in a seasonal windfall.

But like many businesses across the country, the Maine lobster industry,
which makes up the bulk of the fishing revenue the state brings in every
year, is being battered by the coronavirus, which has crushed the
tourism trade that Mr. Hutchings and his fellow fishermen rely on for a
living.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With fewer tourists expected to descend in search of lobster rolls, the
immediate problem for Mr. Hutchings is simple: too many lobsters and not
enough people to eat them. That has sent the price of lobsters
plunging.

The pain is particularly unwelcome for an industry that has spent the
past several years caught in the middle of political fights, including
President Trump’s trade war with China, looming restrictions to protect
an endangered whale species and bait quotas. And then there are the
region’s warming waters, spurred by climate change, which have slowly
shifted the areas conducive to lobster reproduction [away from the
coast](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/21/climate/maine-lobsters.html).

The effect of the virus on the Maine lobster trade is the latest
indication of how the disease is upending nearly all corners of business
activity and inflicting economic pain poised to last longer than many
had predicted. Last month, after groups of fishermen outlined their
concerns for Mr. Trump at an event in Bangor, Maine, the president
directed the Agriculture Department to provide federal assistance to
lobster harvesters.

But that assistance, which has yet to be detailed or allocated, may come
too late.

More than 30 million people typically visit Maine each year. The
majority come in the summer months for the pleasant air of coastal New
England, as well as for the lobster, a high-priced specialty that is a
staple of tourist meals.

But the normal influx of visitors has been derailed by the virus, which
is surging in some parts of the country, contributing to the general
unease many Americans share when it comes to traveling. Further
compounding the situation are the quarantine restrictions that Gov.
Janet T. Mills, a Democrat, put in place for out-of-state travelers.
(Maine has had about 3,300 virus cases, one of the lowest numbers in the
country, according to [data compiled by The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/maine-coronavirus-cases.html).)

For Mr. Hutchings, 66, whose hands are worn from both line and lobster
after fishing Maine waters for more than 50 years, the effect of the
pandemic boils down to whether he can make enough money to keep his boat
profitable.

His expenses include bait, fuel and his crew’s wages. And as the cost of
a pound of lobster steadily drops, he has been weighing almost daily
whether to leave his harbor in Lincolnville for good.

“If the price gets so low, I won’t go,” Mr. Hutchings said, standing as
his stern man, Eddie Hustus, quickly moved herring and pogies into mesh
bait bags below his boat. “I’m not going to do it for nothing.”

In the waning days of June, Mr. Hutchings said he was selling the more
costly hard-shell lobsters at around $4.50 a pound, roughly half of what
he was able to get for them a year ago. In Lincolnville Harbor, only
three of eight boats in the cove had lobster traps in the water, Mr.
Hutchings explained. The captains of the others were patiently waiting
to see how prices shift.

The economic hit to lobstermen seemed a far cry from Mr. Trump’s
declaration on social media just a few days earlier.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“Pres. Obama destroyed the lobster and fishing industry in Maine. Now
it’s back, bigger and better than anyone ever thought possible,” [the
president said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1275951862269829121).
“Enjoy your ‘lobstering’ and fishing\! Make lots of money\!”

Maine’s lobster industry hit its peak in 2016, the last year of
President Barack Obama’s second term, with 132 million pounds caught at
a value of $540 million, according to state data. Maine’s fishermen sold
less than $500 million during each of the first three years of the Trump
administration, on par with Mr. Obama’s first term. In 2019, a
particularly bad haul pushed the price per pound of lobster to $4.82,
the highest since Maine [began recording the data
in 1880](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/commercial-fishing/landings/documents/lobster.table.pdf).

After his meeting in Bangor last month, Mr. Trump issued a proclamation
directing the agriculture secretary to find ways to assist the lobster
industry, which he said had been unfairly targeted with retaliatory
tariffs by
China.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“From 2015 to 2018, American lobster was the most valuable single
seafood species harvested in the United States, with Maine accounting
for approximately 80 percent of that value each year,” Mr. Trump said in
the proclamation, adding that his administration would “mitigate the
effects of unfair retaliatory trade practices on this important
industry.”

Mr. Hutchings, who supports Mr. Trump, called the Bangor event “a photo
op,” but said he appreciated the president’s decision to sit down in
Maine with the fishing industry, which he believed to be a presidential
first, at least in his lifetime.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Whether something good comes out of it, who knows,” Mr. Hutchings said.

Mr. Trump’s move to help Maine fishermen is aimed at strengthening his
blue-collar bona fides during an election year. Yet for those affected,
no number of presidential round tables adorned with lobster traps is
likely to change what could be a terrible summer for Maine’s fisheries.

“I think there’s obviously a lot of uncertainty for local businesses and
a lot of concern for fishermen and for everyone else who relies on
tourist business,” said Marianne LaCroix, the executive director of the
Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs on American lobster nearly crippled
exports from wholesalers like Mr. Young. Maine lobster exports to China
fell by 48.24 percent in 2019.

Canadian resellers have stepped in, buying shellfish from Maine
wholesalers, albeit at a lower price, before [sending it to
international
markets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/12/business/trump-trade-lobster-canada.html)
such as China and Europe. Mr. Trump has criticized Europe for charging a
higher tariff on American lobsters than those from Canada, but that
difference stems from a trade agreement the European Union and Canada
signed in 2016, which lowered European tariffs on Canadian products.

Mr. Young’s excess lobsters often go to the Canadian freezer plants at
the end of the season, but this year, with low sales and the
coronavirus, his buyer’s plants are already full, he said.

“Last month we were trading an old dollar for a new one,” Mr. Young
said, noting that he did not expect to receive federal aid anytime soon.
“If the tourists aren’t here and we can’t ship the other product to
Canada because they’re full, it’s going to be a different year as we try
and find a home for some of this
stuff.”

A good season for Mr. Young means roughly 20 boats from a constellation
of nearby towns like Searsport, Stockton Springs and Northport are
selling their catch to him. So far this year, he has just two boats,
leaving a glimmer of hope that fewer vessels on the water will translate
to a smaller lobster yield and higher prices.

Mr. Hutchings’s 40-foot, Canadian-built, diesel-powered lobster boat,
Fundy Spray, is one of those two boats. And on Saturday, Mr. Hutchings
said he had decided to put the entirety of his 800 traps in the water
this season just in case those prices do turn.

Adjusting his camouflage ball cap adorned with “Young’s Lobster Pound”
atop his mop of white hair, Mr. Hutchings maneuvered his boat back
toward Lincolnville’s harbor.

The wind picked up and the sun was out. The deck was covered in seaweed.
Several small crabs scurried among the ocean detritus along with the red
rubber bands that did not quite make it onto a lobster’s claw. Over the
rhythmic churn of his boat’s engine and the occasional chatter from the
marine radio, Mr. Hutchings muttered what could easily have been a Maine
mantra.

“If you’re a fisherman, you have to make it work,” Mr. Hutchings said.
“It’s what you do.”
