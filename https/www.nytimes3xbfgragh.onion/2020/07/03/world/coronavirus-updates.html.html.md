# Coronavirus Cases in U.S. Are Rising, Even as Death Rates Trend Down

</div>

At least five U.S. states set single-day records on Friday as the
country’s daily infection report passed 50,000 again. President Trump,
in a speech at Mount Rushmore, barely mentioned the pandemic.

## As infections in the U.S. are rising sharply, the death rate has dropped.

After a minor late-spring lull, the number of confirmed coronavirus
cases in the United States is [again on the
rise](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
States like Arizona, Florida and Texas are seeing some of their highest
numbers to date, and as the nation hurtles deeper into summer, the surge
shows few signs of stopping.

Yet the virus appears to be killing fewer of the people it infects — a
seemingly counterintuitive trend that might not last, experts said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In April and May, Covid-19 led to as many as 3,000 deaths per day and
claimed the lives of roughly 7 to 8 percent of Americans known to have
been infected. Now, even though cases are rising in the majority of
states, some of which are hitting single-day records, the number of
daily deaths is closer to 600, and the death rate is less than 5
percent.

Because death reports can lag diagnoses by weeks, the current rise in
coronavirus cases could portend increases in mortality in the days to
come. However,[there are also a few factors that can help explain the
apparent
drop](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/health/coronavirus-mortality-testing.html).

One is increased diagnostic testing, which has identified many more
infected individuals with mild or no symptoms. That means those who die
with Covid-19 form a smaller overall proportion of cases, said Caitlin
Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security

And with more tests available, infections are often identified earlier,
“which allows us to intervene earlier,” said Saskia Popescu, a
hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease expert in Arizona.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Health experts also noted that treatments had improved, and that the
virus is now infecting more young people, who are less likely to die of
Covid-19.

Health officials are [urging Americans to scale back their Fourth of
July
plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-fourth-of-july.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
as the coronavirus pandemic makes a frightening resurgence.

Reports of new cases have increased 90 percent in the United States in
the last two weeks. More than 53,000 new daily coronavirus cases were
reported in the United States on Friday, according to a New York Times
database. That total exceeded all previous daily counts but the 55,595
on Thursday, the first time the number had passed 50,000.

At least five states set single-day case records on Friday: Alabama,
Alaska, Kansas, North Carolina and South Carolina, [according to data
compiled by The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
In South Carolina, where more than 1,800 new cases were announced
Friday, the positivity rate has hovered around 20 percent this week, up
from about 10 percent in early June. In Kansas, where at least 770 new
cases were announced, daily reporting totals vary widely because the
state government only releases new data three times a week. The state
reported positivity rates exceeding 10 percent for the first three days
in July, a significant uptick from mid-June when the rate hovered
between 5 and 7 percent.

On Thursday, the United States set a single-day case record for the
sixth time in nine days, with [more than 55,000 new cases
announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
and single-day highs in eight states. Domestic travel restrictions have
re-emerged, and many locales have slowed or reversed reopenings.

The [vast majority of July 4 fireworks displays in big cities and small
rural towns have been
canceled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/business/fourth-of-july-fireworks-displays.html).
Most politicians, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
the presumptive Democratic nominee, are forgoing the traditional parades
and flag-waving appearances.

President Trump, however, has a different, discordant message: The
sparkly, booming show must go on at all costs. Mr. Trump was in South
Dakota on Friday evening for a massive fireworks display at [the Mount
Rushmore National
Memorial](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/us/mount-rushmore.html),
a made-for-TV patriotic display that he has spent years lobbying to
revive. (There have been no fireworks at Mount Rushmore since 2009
because of fears that they would set off forest fires and contaminate
groundwater.)

Few in the packed crowd of supporters wore masks. In his pre-fireworks
speech, Mr. Trump barely mentioned the pandemic, which has killed more
than 120,000 people in America, instead choosing to cast himself as
[waging battle against a “new far-left
fascism.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mount-rushmore.html)

Hours before Mr. Trump spoke at Mount Rushmore, law enforcement
officials, many holding shields, clashed with protesters blocking a
road.

As tension escalated, an officer warned demonstrators that they should
disperse if they wanted to avoid chemical agents.

“It’s not going to be a pleasant smell,” the officer said,[according to
a video posted on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/EEBormett/status/1279196853452656641). “If
you don’t mind it, you can stay here, but it’s going to be very
irritating.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Anti-Trump protesters chanted and held signs reading, “You are
trespassing on stolen land,” and “Black Lives Matter,” according to
[video footage of the event](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BRKjYOAEMpxw). A
group of Trump supporters held Trump 2020 posters and “All Lives Matter”
signs.

Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Mr. Trump’s eldest son and a top
fund-raising official for the Trump re-election campaign, [tested
positive for the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/politics/kimberly-guilfoyle-trump-campaign-coronavirus.html)
on Friday before the event at Mount Rushmore, a person familiar with her
condition said.

Ms. Guilfoyle traveled to South Dakota with Donald Trump Jr. They did
not travel aboard Air Force One, according to the person familiar with
her condition, and she was the only person in the group who tested
positive.

The president plans to follow up his trip with a “Salute to America”
celebration the following day on the South Lawn at the White House,
including a military flyover and a massive fireworks display on the
National Mall that Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, has warned
violates local health guidelines.

Mr. Trump has consistently downplayed concerns over new cases, claiming
that young people [“get better much easier and
faster](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1278897430378041344)”
and that the virus will [“just
disappear.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-he-thinks-coronavirus-will-just-disappear-despite-rising-n1232709)

In many places across the country, face coverings have gone from
suggestions to mandates, but Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a
Republican, said there were no plans to enforce social distancing during
Mr. Trump’s open-air address before a live audience, framed by some of
the nation’s most revered presidents.

Early in the pandemic, more than 1,000 cases were linked to the
Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, which remains one of
the country’s largest known clusters. But in recent weeks, South Dakota
has had one of the country’s most encouraging trend lines. The state has
averaged a few-dozen new cases each day, including 85 announced Friday.
There has not been a day with more than 100 new cases in South Dakota
since late
May.

A number of protests are planned for Independence Day in the nation’s
capital, ahead of the annual fireworks display and a [military
flyover](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-presents-2020-independence-day-celebration-nations-capital)
hosted by Mr. Trump.

Since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the end of May,
Washington has become a center of protests. Its mayor, Muriel Bowser,
publicly challenged Mr. Trump’s decision to order National Guard troops
into the city during demonstrations against racism and police brutality,
and she presided over the painting of the words “Black Lives Matter” in
giant yellow letters on a street near the White House.

Black Lives Matter DC and two other groups, Sunrise and the Black Youth
Project 100, announced several events over the weekend focused on
[defunding the police](https://www.defundmpd.org/). The Instagram
account [\#dcteensaction](https://www.instagram.com/dcteensaction/)
lists at least nine protests for Saturday, including a march near the
Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and
an evening protest beginning in Malcolm X Park.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For the official celebration, the federal government said it would
provide around 300,000 face coverings, and a news release from the
Department of the Interior warned visitors to observe social distancing
— while noting that viewing areas on the Mall would be accessible by
four security entry points. Ms. Bowser told reporters that she did not
think the event was in keeping with federal health officials’ guidelines
for gatherings during the
pandemic.

The holiday comes amid a national [reckoning over
racism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/06/24/magazine/reparations-slavery.html?searchResultPosition=3),
and the founding story of the United States is part of [what is being
questioned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/black-history-american-democracy.html)
right now.

William H. Lamar IV, the pastor of the Metropolitan African Methodist
Episcopal Church, a few blocks from the White House, said that he did
not normally celebrate the Fourth but that this
year<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the country might be
observing the holiday with more honesty than usual.

“The symbols coming down, that’s only the beginning,” Reverend Lamar
said. “That’s people saying, ‘We need a new story. This story excludes
me. It is inherently violent and evil. It murdered me. It erased me as a
human being. I deserve a story that includes me and wants me to
flourish.’”

He added: “Is there a kind of national story that can hold us together
in this multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious reality? The survival
of this experiment called America depends upon
it.”

Brazil, which has more coronavirus cases than any country but the United
States, topped 1.5 million total infections on Friday, just two weeks
after reaching a million cases, according to a New York Times database.

But even as the country passed that grim milestone, President Jair
Bolsonaro vetoed a measure that would have provided masks to vulnerable
groups and required businesses to provide masks to their employees,
[according to The Associated
Press.](https://apnews.com/ea560c3c7e0766f3f4eb0f77f958140a)

Since mid-June, some major cities in Brazil have eased preventive
measures. Shopping malls have already reopened in São Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro. Beaches are starting to draw crowds again. And Rio allowed gyms
and bars to reopen at 50 percent capacity on Thursday, while some
[hospital systems were close to running
out](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/06/noves-estados-estao-com-mais-de-80-das-utis-lotadas.shtml)of
intensive care beds.

If the country’s trend lines hold, some epidemiologists project the
pandemic’s death toll in Brazil could surpass that of the U.S. by late
July. Brazil had recorded 63,174 total deaths as of Friday; the U.S. has
recorded 129,402.

Some experts initially thought that Brazil was well equipped to cope
with the pandemic, based on [its track record during past public health
emergencies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/16/world/americas/virus-brazil-deaths.html).
Brazil has a public health care system that, while underfunded, provides
robust coverage across the country.

Starting July 10, England [will drop its mandatory 14-day
quarantine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/world/europe/britain-quarantine-us-coronavirus.html)
for visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in
place for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the
isolation of America. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their
own travel policies and may not follow England’s lead in easing
restrictions.

The European Union recently [upheld a ban on U.S.
travelers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/world/europe/eu-reopening-blocks-us-travelers.html),
even as it opened its borders to visitors from Canada, Rwanda, Thailand
and 15 other countries. England’s policy, announced on Friday, is less
restrictive: Americans can still enter so long as they agree to isolate
themselves for two weeks.

The United States has barred most visitors from Britain since March,
after briefly exempting them from a travel ban on the European Union. At
the time, Europe was dealing with far more coronavirus infections than
the United States. Since then, the epicenter of the pandemic has moved
across the Atlantic.

However, Britain still has [the world’s third-highest known death
toll](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html),
with triple-digit death counts still coming most days.

More than half the country’s nursing homes have had [at least one case
since
March](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/impactofcoronavirusincarehomesinenglandvivaldi/26mayto19june2020).
The government announced on Friday that nursing home residents will be
[tested for the virus
monthly](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/regular-retesting-rolled-out-for-care-home-staff-and-residents),
while staff members will receive tests weekly, officials announced.

Some public-health experts said the fractious debate over the travel
quarantine had distracted from more pressing problems, like safely
reopening Britain’s schools and organizing an effective test-and-trace
program.

“The U.K. government seems focused on giving people a summer pandemic
holiday instead of dealing with the hard issues facing the aviation
industry for the coming year,” said Professor Devi Sridhar, the director
of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said earlier this week that it was
Britons’ “patriotic duty” to go to the pub when they reopen at 6 a.m. on
Saturday, has now urged people not to “overdo it.” His warning came
after tens of thousands have [flocked to
beaches](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-lockdown.html),
[organized illegal music
parties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/world/europe/brixton-party-police.html)
and violated social-distancing rules in recent weeks.

“Let’s not blow it now, folks,” Mr. Johnson told LBC radio on Friday,
weeks after he announced that the country’s “long hibernation” was over
and that the virus was under control.

In other news:

  - **Brazil,** which has been experiencing a surge in virus cases,
    allowed restaurants and bars to reopen with conditions on Thursday,
    [according to The Associated
    Press](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/south-america/restrictions-on-rio-restaurants-and-bars-eased.html).
    Gyms, dance, fighting and swimming classes were also authorized to
    restart, The A.P. said, as long as there is no physical contact, a
    third of capacity and a time-slot schedule.

    unknown functionary who helped guide the country out of the health
    emergency, Jean Castex. Mr. Philippe is one of three government
    officials facing investigation into their handling of the
    coronavirus crisis, according to French prosecutors.

  - **Air France,** which like other airlines has seen ticket sales
    plummet, told labor union leaders on Friday that it needs to cut
    about 7,500 jobs by the end of 2022, but that it would achieve the
    most through attrition and would also offer buyouts, early
    retirement packages and assistance with applying for open positions
    at the company. The airline has received 7 billion euros ($7.8
    billion) from the French government.

  - Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose successful response to the
    coronavirus crisis in **Germany** has been widely praised, was seen
    wearing a mask for the first time on Friday, as she headed into a
    session at the cramped Bundesrat. Asked by a reporter this week why
    she didn’t mask, even as she encourages Germans to, she said: “If I
    keep the social distancing rules, then I don’t need to wear a mask.
    And when I don’t social distance, when I go shopping for example, we
    clearly never run into each other.”

  - **Spain** said on Friday that it would not reopen its borders with
    **Morocco** after Morocco’s decision to keep entry points closed
    that are used by millions of people every summer. The dispute also
    affects Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in North Africa.
    Spain also said that it would bar arrivals from Algeria and China.

  - **Austria** recorded more than 100 new cases of the virus on a
    single day this week, its highest such total in more than two
    months. Many of the confirmed infections are connected to a
    religious community in Linz, a city in the northern part of the
    country, and officials closed schools and day care centers in the
    area for a week. Austria’s health ministry has registered 17,959

Spending two weeks quarantined in a hotel room is not a pleasant
experience, as thousands of people who’ve flown internationally since
the pandemic began can attest.

But the 300 foreigners confined to a Ramada hotel in Yongin, South
Korea, have it worse than most.

Each day for the past week, from about 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., protesters
outside the hotel have been raising a deafening noise with drums, brass
gongs and loudspeakers blaring music. They are local residents, angry
that the government chose a hotel in their neighborhood as a quarantine
site.

“Even with double-glazed windows, they can still be heard when the
windows are closed,” said James Martin Thompson, an app developer from
Washington, from his fifth-floor room in the hotel, the Ramada by
Wyndham Yongin.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“When you’re stuck in a small indoor space 24/7, being able to open the
windows makes it much more bearable,” said Mr. Thompson. “And during
much of the daytime, that isn’t practical with the noise coming from the
demonstrators.”

On June 11, the South Korean government designated the Ramada as one of
eight facilities where foreigners who arrive with no Covid-19 symptoms
are quarantined for two weeks.

Three days later, a foreigner quarantined at the hotel tested positive
for the coronavirus. Since then, residents of the neighborhood, called
Jeondae-ri, have been accusing the government of recklessly exposing
them to infection.

On June 27, protesters began their daily noise-making campaign in front
of the 18-story hotel, hoping to force the authorities to send
foreigners elsewhere for quarantine.

A large banner that protesters hung in front of the Ramada read, “This
is a hotel that produced a confirmed Covid-19 case. Shut it down
immediately\!”

The foreigners are confined to their rooms with little hope of escaping
the torment, even if they wanted to
try.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Mr. Pence had been scheduled to visit Arizona on Tuesday, but multiple
factors related to the spread of the virus foiled those plans, according
to a person familiar with Mr. Pence’s travel.

A swift rise in new cases in the state [has overwhelmed testing
centers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/upshot/virus-testing-shortfall-arizona.html)
in recent days, and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, ordered bars, gyms
and movie theaters closed this week. As of Friday, there have been more
than 4,300 new cases reported in the state. In an apparent
acknowledgment of outbreaks erupting across the South and the West, the
vice president canceled his plan to headline a “Faith in America”
campaign rally in Tucson on Tuesday and then tour Yuma with Mr. Ducey.

Instead, Mr. Pence opted for a shorter visit to Phoenix on Wednesday,
where he participated in a public health briefing at Sky Harbor
International Airport.

“Help is on the way,” Mr. Pence said at a news conference with Mr. Ducey
at the airport, after descending the steps of Air Force Two wearing a
mask, the latest sign of the administration’s [evolving stance on face
coverings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/us/coronavirus-masks.html).

But the positive tests and symptoms of Secret Service agents expected to
be in proximity to the man who is next in line for the presidency were
some of the factors that prompted his change of schedule, the officials
said. The news of the agents who showed symptoms, or tested positive,
[was first reported by The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-agents-preparing-for-pence-arizona-trip-contracted-coronavirus/2020/07/02/8029280c-bc97-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html).

As many as [80 percent of community fireworks
displays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/business/fourth-of-july-fireworks-displays.html)
in large cities and small rural towns have been canceled this year over
fears that they would create a social distancing nightmare. In New York
City, instead of the usual hourlong fireworks extravaganza, Macy’s will
have five-minute displays in undisclosed locations across the five
boroughs. The grand finale on Saturday, which will also be from an
undisclosed location, will be televised.

In Florida, Miami-Dade and Broward counties had already announced they
were closing beaches for the Fourth of July weekend. And on Friday,
Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Giménez’s [countywide
curfew](https://www.miamidade.gov/releases/2020-07-02-mayor-covid-measures.asp),
which was announced Thursday, went into effect from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Mr. Giménez also rolled back the opening of movie theaters, arcades,
casinos, concert halls, bowling halls and adult entertainment venues
that recently had their reopening plans approved by the county. Florida
reported more than 9,400 new cases Friday. Exactly one month earlier,
the state reported just 1,317 new cases.

In Mississippi, which reported more than [900 new coronavirus cases

can offer indoor dining as long as they stay below 50 percent capacity.
Backyard BBQs can have up to 100 people so long as guests remain

residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases [to wear masks in

Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic

wear masks in public. Texas has been one of the worst-hit states in the
past week reaching a record number of hospitalizations on Friday, up 270
to 7,652, and reporting more than 6,400 new cases.

Elsewhere in the U.S.:

  - In **Arkansas,** Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed an executive order

    reported, according to [a New York Times

    routes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/coronavirus-amtrak-cuts.html)

    revenue plummeting, Amtrak plans to cut up to 20 percent of its work
    force by October and suspend daily service on routes that service
    over 220 communities. Amtrak has received letters from 16 senators
    asking why it needed to enact such steep cuts since it had already
    received $1 billion in emergency aid.

  - Results of **Major League Baseball**’s first round of widespread
    coronavirus testing were released on Friday, as preseason training
    resumed in full after being shut down for more than three
    months.[Out of 3,185 tests, 38 were

    they would feel uncomfortable, compared with just 6 percent of Mr.

## The actors’ union, citing safety concerns, tells members not to work on a film being produced by Michael Bay.

The SAG-AFTRA actors’ union issued a [do-not-work
notice](https://www.sagaftra.org/do-not-work-notice-songbird) to its
members for a pandemic-themed independent film starring Demi Moore and
Craig Robinson, saying that producers had “not been transparent about
their safety protocols.” Producers for the film,
“[Songbird](https://deadline.com/2020/05/michael-bay-adam-goodman-songbird-pandemic-themed-thriller-start-in-five-weeks-1202937906/),”
include Michael Bay, who is better known for his work on big-budget
films, and Adam Goodman, a former president of production at Paramount
Pictures.

“Songbird” has drawn attention as one of the first movies aiming to roll
cameras since the virus brought production in Hollywood to a halt in
March. California allowed film and television shoots to [resume on
June 12](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-06-05/gavin-newsom-hollywood-production)
— under [strict safety
protocols](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-06-12/hollywood-reopening-rules-productions-covid-19-pandemic)
— and Los Angeles began issuing permits last week. So far, however, only
a handful of TV shows (mostly soap operas like “The Bold and the
Beautiful”) have restarted production; none of the major movie studios
are expected to shoot anything before next month.

The independent companies behind “Songbird” have said they planned to
use [nontraditional camera
techniques](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/demi-moore-craig-robinson-board-michael-bay-produced-pandemic-thriller-songbird-1300322)
to avoid having actors in proximity. The film, a thriller, takes place
in the near future during a pandemic lockdown — martial law has been
imposed to combat a fast-mutating virus — and focuses on a young woman
and a motorbike courier with rare immunity.

Representatives for the producers either declined to comment or did not
respond to a query. Invisible Narratives, one of the companies involved,
[told
Deadline](https://deadline.com/2020/07/sag-aftra-songbird-do-not-work-order-los-angeles-shoot-pandemic-1202976458/),
an entertainment trade news site, that it was “actively working to
resolve this paperwork
issue.”

College students across the country have been warned that [campus life
will look dramatically different in the
fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/magazine/covid-college-fall.html),
with temperature checks at academic buildings, masks in half-empty
lecture halls and maybe no football games.

What they might not expect: [a lack of professors in the
classroom](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/coronavirus-college-professors.html).

Thousands of instructors at American colleges and universities have told
administrators in recent days that they are unwilling to resume
in-person classes because of the pandemic.

[More than three-quarters of colleges and
universities](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626)
have decided students can return to campus this fall. But they face a
growing faculty revolt.

“Until there’s a vaccine, I’m not setting foot on campus,” said Dana
Ward, 70, an emeritus professor of political studies at Pitzer College
in Claremont, Calif., who teaches a class in anarchist history and
thought. “Going into the classroom is like playing Russian roulette.”

In Pennsylvania, a Penn State student living off campus has died of
respiratory failure and Covid-19, the first known death of a student at
the university related to the virus, according to the university.

The student, Juan Garcia, 21, who was in the College of Earth and
Mineral Sciences, had been living off-campus in State College when he
began to feel sick, the university said in an announcement expressing
its condolences. He went home to Allentown on June 19, and tested
positive for the coronavirus the next day. He died on June 30, the
university said.

The death comes as faculty, concerned about their own safety and that of
students, are organizing to have more say in the campus opening for the
fall. Sarah J. Townsend, an associate professor of Spanish and
Portuguese and a faculty organizer, said the student’s death was
disturbing in part because of the close connection between the campus
and the surrounding
town.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In an indication of how fluid the situation is, the University of
Southern California said on Wednesday that an “alarming spike” in
coronavirus cases had prompted it to reverse an earlier decision to
encourage attending classes in person.

With more than a month before campuses start reopening, it is hard to
predict how many professors will refuse to teach face-to-face classes in
the fall. But colleges and professors are planning ahead.

New York, transformed by the virus and protests for racial justice, has
been cooped up, and a good, old-fashioned swim “takes the edge off,”
said Rachel Thompson, a schoolteacher. She was at Rockaway Beach in
Queens on Wednesday as New York City [opened its beaches for
swimming](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/nyregion/beaches-open-nyc.html)
— just in time for the Fourth of July weekend, when even more people are
expected to pack the sand.

Still, several beachgoers that morning, Ms. Thompson included, were
feeling a bit jittery about the city’s gradual reopening. An hour after
the ban on swimming was lifted, the mayor announced that [indoor dining
at restaurants would not
resume](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/nyregion/indoor-dining-coronavirus-nyc.html)
on Monday as anticipated, citing [the virus’s rapid spread in other
large
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/world/coronavirus-updates.html).

Mayor Bill de Blasio, worried that large crowds might risk virus
transmission, had kept the city’s [14 miles of beaches
closed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/16/nyregion/nyc-beaches-coronavirus.html)
even as temperatures rose — along with frustration from long-quarantined
New Yorkers. With an estimated million visitors total on a hot day, they
are some of the country’s most crowded shorelines, and people largely
access them via subways and buses.

Safety measures include lifeguards in masks carrying waist packs with a
face mask, gloves and hand sanitizer. Beachgoers must keep at least six
feet apart and wear face coverings when on the sand or the boardwalk.
Restrooms will operate at half-capacity, and boardwalk concessions must
offer to-go service only.

Hundreds of city workers, deployed as social distancing ambassadors,
will hand out masks, keep space between beachgoers, tally beachgoers to
prevent overcrowding, tend beach entrances to limit capacity and, if
necessary, direct people to less crowded sections.

Worries have lingered about a possible backslide in the state, where,
after reining in the virus, there have been a few alarming outbreaks,
such those at a [house
party](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/nyregion/rockland-coronavirus-party.html)
and graduation party in the suburbs just north of the city.

Elsewhere in the U.S.:

  - **In** **Miami-Dade County, Fla.,** the mayor [imposed a countywide
    curfew](https://www.miamidade.gov/releases/2020-07-02-mayor-covid-measures.asp)
    from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., starting Friday; he also rolled back the
    opening of movie theaters, arcades, casinos, concert halls, bowling
    halls and adult entertainment venues that recently had their
    reopening plans approved by the county. Miami-Dade and Broward
    counties had already announced they were closing beaches for the
    Fourth of July weekend. On Friday, [Florida reported 9,488 new
    cases](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7572b118dc3c48d885d1c643c195314e/).

  - Critics of **Amtrak**’s newly announced cutbacks [worry that the
    rail agency will not bring back service to the long-distance
    routes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/coronavirus-amtrak-cuts.html)
    it has long sought to end. With ridership down 95 percent and
    revenue plummeting, Amtrak plans to cut up to 20 percent of its work
    force by October and suspend daily service on routes that service
    over 220 communities. Amtrak has received letters from 16 senators
    asking why it needed to enact such steep cuts since it had already
    received $1 billion in emergency aid.

  - Results of **Major League Baseball**’s first round of widespread
    coronavirus testing were released on Friday, as preseason training
    resumed in full after being shut down for more than three
    months.[Out of 3,185 tests, 38 were
    positive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/sports/baseball/mlb-workouts-first-practices-boston-red-sox.html)
    (31 players and seven staff members). The league plans to open a
    60-game season on July 23, with no fans in the stands. Preseason
    preparation has resumed at teams’ home stadiums rather than
    returning to spring-training sites in Florida and Arizona.

  - In [New York Times/Siena College
    surveys](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/upshot/poll-2020-biden-battlegrounds.html)
    of **voters in battleground states** for the presidential election,
    supporters of Joseph R. Biden Jr. were far more likely than
    President Trump’s to be [concerned about in-person
    voting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/upshot/biden-supporters-are-more-worried-about-the-health-risks-of-voting.html)
    during the pandemic. About 40 percent of Mr. Biden’s supporters said
    they would feel uncomfortable, compared with just 6 percent of Mr.
    Trump’s supporters. Most of these people said they would go to the
    polls anyway, but 8 percent of Mr. Biden’s surveyed supporters and
    less than 2 percent of Mr. Trump’s said they would be too
    uncomfortable to go vote. Voting by mail for any reason is available
    in all six battleground states included in the Times/Siena data.

  - **Texas**, one of the worst-hit states in the past week, saw a
    record number of hospitalizations on Friday, up 270 to 7,652. In a
    reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered residents in counties
    with 20 or more virus cases [to wear masks in
    public](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-texas-masks.html).
    Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by
    Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in
    their cities to wear masks in public.

  - Mayor Lori Lightfoot of **Chicago** said Thursday that travelers
    from 15 states with large outbreaks would have to quarantine for two
    weeks or face up to $7,000 in fines.

  - Some 13,400 employees, or nearly 70 percent of the staffing, of
    Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that
    handles U.S. visas and naturalization, [face furlough by
    Aug. 3](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/politics/immigration-furloughs-coronavirus.html)
    because the immigration processing fees that fund it have plummeted.

  - In **Arkansas,** Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed an executive order
    allowing local officials to pass mask ordinances on Friday. Mr.
    Hutchinson, a Republican, [never implemented a statewide
    stay-at-home
    order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html),
    instead opting to close high-contact businesses like gyms and

Identifying likely voters is a challenge for pollsters in every
election. This year, the coronavirus, mail voting and a surge in
political engagement may make it even harder than usual.

For now, Mr. Biden’s nine-point lead across the critical battleground
states is so significant that it is essentially invulnerable to
assumptions about turnout, according to [New York Times/Siena College
surveys](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/upshot/poll-2020-biden-battlegrounds.html)
of the states likeliest to decide the election. But supporters of Mr.
Biden are [far more likely to be concerned about in-person
voting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/upshot/biden-supporters-are-more-worried-about-the-health-risks-of-voting.html)
during the pandemic, and his wide polling lead among registered voters
could narrow if their concerns persist to the election.

Over all, one-quarter of registered voters in the battleground states
said they would feel uncomfortable voting in person.

People were asked if they would feel uncomfortable voting in person if
the election were held during the week they were interviewed in June.
About 40 percent of Mr. Biden’s supporters said they would feel
uncomfortable, compared with just 6 percent of President Trump’s
supporters.

This political divide transcends demographics. A young Biden supporter
in a rural area, for instance, would be likelier to feel uncomfortable
voting than an older Trump supporter in a city, even though the health
risk is probably quite low for the Biden voter and potentially quite
significant for the Trump supporter.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most of these voters would go to the polls anyway. But about one-quarter
of the uncomfortable voters — or about 6 percent of the overall
electorate — said they would feel too uncomfortable to vote in person if
the election were held during the week they were interviewed. This
includes 8 percent of all of Mr. Biden’s supporters in the battleground
states, compared with fewer than 2 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is important to emphasize that no-excuse absentee voting, in which
any voter can request a mail ballot, is available in all six of the
battleground states included in the Times/Siena data.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court [blocked a trial judge’s
order](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/070220zr_n7io.pdf)
that would have made it easier for voters in three Alabama counties to
use absentee ballots in this month’s primary runoff election.

The court’s brief, unsigned order gave no reasons, which is typical when
it rules on emergency applications, and it said the order would remain
in effect while appeals moved forward.

The court’s four more liberal members — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — said they would
have rejected Alabama’s
request.

Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, who said earlier this week that
it was Britons’ “patriotic duty” to go to the pub when they reopen on
Saturday, has now urged people not to “overdo it.” His warning came
after tens of thousands have [flocked to
beaches](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-lockdown.html),
[organized illegal music
parties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/world/europe/brixton-party-police.html)
and violated social-distancing rules in recent weeks.

Britain has reported [the world’s third-highest pandemic death
toll](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html),
with triple-digit death counts still coming most days.

“Let’s not blow it now, folks,” Mr. Johnson told LBC radio on Friday,
weeks after he announced that the country’s “long hibernation” was over
and that the virus was under control. Restaurant industry workers have
said [in British news
outlets](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/pubs-reopening-super-saturday-social-distancing-hospitality-rules-a9598106.html)
that they were afraid of going back to work, and concerns are high that
pub customers could flout basic rules and trigger new waves of
infections.

A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said that pubs could reopen starting at 6
a.m. on Saturday, “in the event anybody would attempt to try to open at
midnight.”

On Wednesday, the Treasury tweeted that people should “grab a drink and
raise a glass” when pubs reopen. The tweet was later deleted. A pub in
south London has promised “endless supply” of drinks to “fuel your
shenanigans,” after more than three months of closure, which was [a
first in the history of the country’s
pubs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/world/europe/uk-pub-coronavirus.html).

Pubs — like restaurants, hair salons and other businesses welcoming
visitors again on Saturday — [will have to maintain a 21-day record of
their
customers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace),
the government has said, to trace contacts in case of new outbreaks.

In Leicester, 100 miles north of London, pubs and other nonessential
businesses will remain closed because of a regional outbreak of virus
cases.

The British authorities also announced on Friday that, starting July 10,
travelers from countries in Europe including France, Italy and Spain
will no longer have to self-quarantine for 14 days. The change will
currently only apply to England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland expected to set up their own rules.

  - Starting July 10, **England** [will drop its mandatory 14-day
    quarantine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/world/europe/britain-quarantine-us-coronavirus.html)
    for visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions
    in place for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the
    isolation of America. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply
    their own travel policies and may not follow England’s lead in
    easing restrictions.

  - Residents in nursing homes in **Britain** will be [tested for the
    virus
    monthly](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/regular-retesting-rolled-out-for-care-home-staff-and-residents),
    while staff members will receive tests weekly, officials announced.
    According to [a survey published on

    by the Office for National Statistics, 56 percent of the country’s
    nursing homes have had at least one case since March, with 20
    percent of residents in such facilities known to have been infected.
    Out of the nearly 44,000 reported deaths in Britain, at least 15,500
    people have died in nursing
homes.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China appears to be downplaying expectations ahead of a planned trip
next week by a World Health Organization team to the country to
investigate the [origins of the
outbreak](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-timeline.html).

Since the head of the W.H.O., Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced the
trip on Monday, several Chinese officials and experts have said that any
investigation into the origins of the virus should not focus only on
China.

“It does not matter which country the scientific identification work
starts with, as long as it involves all related countries and is fairly
conducted,” Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist for the Chinese Center
for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state-run nationalist
newspaper Global Times on Tuesday.

Wang Guangfa, a top government health adviser, told Global Times this
week that the W.H.O. should also go to Spain. He cited a
not-yet-published [study by researchers at the University of
Barcelona](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/health/coronavirus-spain.html)
that suggests the virus was present in Spain’s wastewater as early as
March 2019.

Independent experts have said the study was flawed, and that other lines
of evidence strongly suggest the virus emerged in China late last year.

The virus most likely originated in bats, but the path of transmission
is still unknown. Experts say establishing that will be a crucial step
in preventing future outbreaks.

The hunt for information has focused on Wuhan, the central Chinese city
where the virus is believed to have first emerged, and specifically the
Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was said to have [sold wildlife
and had links to many of the country’s first reported
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mike Ryan, head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program, said on Wednesday
that the agency would be sending two experts from Geneva to join its
China team on next week’s trip. He said one would likely be an
epidemiologist and the other an expert in animal health.

Dr. Ryan did not reveal which cities the team was planning to visit. He
described it as a “scoping mission.”

Getting answers on the origins of the virus has become more difficult as
the issue has become increasingly politicized. China has been on the
defensive for months in response to [growing criticism from the United
States and other
countries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/03/world/europe/backlash-china-coronavirus.html)
for its initial mishandling of the outbreak. Officials from both the
United States and China have, without providing evidence, accused each
other of intentionally releasing the virus.

But at a news briefing this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman
sounded a less-aggressive note.

“China has always believed that virus tracing is a scientific issue, and
relevant research should be carried out by scientists and medical
experts,” said Zhao Lijian, the spokesman, who in March promoted a
theory that the U.S. Army purposely introduced the virus to China.

“China continues to support scientists from all over the world in
conducting global scientific research on the source and spread of
viruses,” he
added.

## As daily cases in the U.S. pass 50,000, officials stress precautions.

“Someday we will welcome these crowds to our great city,” Flint’s mayor,

As the pandemic spirals further out of control in the United States,
politicians and public health officials have become noticeably more

In many places, face coverings have gone from suggestions to mandates.
Bars have been reopened — and closed again. Domestic travel restrictions
have re-emerged. And mayors have told people to shape up and follow the
rules.

“I know that wearing a mask is uncomfortable,” said Mayor Nan Whaley of
Dayton, Ohio, where case numbers are spiking and face coverings are now
required. “I know that, unfortunately, wearing a mask has become a
political flash point. But I also know that masks save lives.”

In a reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, one of the worst-hit states in
the past week, on Thursday ordered residents in counties with 20 or more
virus cases [to wear masks in
public](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-texas-masks.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic
mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to
wear masks in public.

In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Thursday that travelers from 15
states with large outbreaks would have to quarantine for two weeks or
face up to $7,000 in fines. In Los Angeles County, Calif., where there
are more than 2,000 new cases most days, the top public health official
said “we urgently need to make a change in the trajectory.” And in
Northern California, where the outlook is also bad, leaders in several
counties urged residents to [celebrate the Fourth of July at
home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-fourth-of-july.html)
and not test the limits of the law.

“Just because you can does not mean it is safe or that you should rush
to do it,” said Dr. Matt Willis, the Marin County public health officer.

President Trump plans to celebrate the Independence Day holiday with a
fireworks display on Friday at [the Mount Rushmore National
Memorial](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/us/mount-rushmore.html)
in South Dakota. About 7,500 people are expected to attend the outdoor
event, where masks will be available but not
required.

## As U.S. infections reach another record, leaders seek new answers and itineraries.

As the United States headed into the Fourth of July weekend, [officials
were telling people to hold the
partying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-fourth-of-july.html)
until next year. The coronavirus has exploded in large parts of the
nation: On Thursday, the U.S. set a single-day case record for the sixth
time in nine days, with more than 50,000 new cases reported for the
first time, according to [a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
The figure topped 55,000 by the end of the day.

Thursday’s daily new case total represented an increase of more than 85
percent since two weeks ago, when states were reopening after extensive
lockdowns tempered the outbreak, particularly in the hard-hit Northeast.
Until last week, the country had not surpassed a record daily total for
two months, since 36,738 new cases were reported on April 24.

In a reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, one of the worst-hit states in
the past week, on Thursday ordered residents in counties with 20 or more

Thursday.

Mr. Pence had been scheduled to visit Arizona on Tuesday, but multiple
factors related to the spread of the virus foiled those plans, according
to a person familiar with Mr. Pence’s travel.

A swift rise in new cases in the state [had overwhelmed testing

outbreaks erupting across the South and the West, the vice president
canceled his plan to headline a “Faith in America” campaign rally in
Tucson on Tuesday and then to tour Yuma with Mr. Ducey.

Instead, Mr. Pence opted for a shorter visit to Phoenix on Wednesday,
where he participated in a public health briefing at Sky Harbor
