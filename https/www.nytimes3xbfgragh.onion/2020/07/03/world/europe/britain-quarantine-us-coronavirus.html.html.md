LONDON — England will drop its mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors
from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in place for
travelers coming from the United States, deepening the isolation of
America and delivering another rebuke to President Trump for his
handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

The European Union recently [upheld a ban on travelers from the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/world/europe/eu-reopening-blocks-us-travelers.html),
even as it opened its borders to visitors from Canada, Rwanda, Thailand
and 15 other countries. England’s policy, announced on Friday, is not as
draconian. Visitors from America can still enter the country so long as
they agree to isolate themselves for two weeks.

But those from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and [dozens of other
countries](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jul/03/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-warn-public-pubs-reopen-england-saturday?page=with:block-5eff3c7b8f08ff51fe2ac38a#block-5eff3c7b8f08ff51fe2ac38a)
will be able to travel to England with no restrictions — an arrangement
intended to bolster the languishing tourism industry in time for the
summer vacation season. The regulations will take effect on July 10.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their own travel policies and
may not follow England’s lead in easing restrictions.

The United States has barred most visitors from Britain since March,
after briefly exempting them from a travel ban on the European Union. At
the time, Europe was dealing with far more coronavirus infections than
the United States. Since then, the epicenter of the pandemic has moved
across the Atlantic.

That prompted fierce criticism of a policy that placed restrictions on
people arriving from countries where the virus was well under control,
including New Zealand. The authorities threatened to fine rule breakers
up to £1,000 ($1,245).

Critics said the measures were economically damaging, ineffective and
legally unenforceable because the country did not have the resources to
ensure that people were obeying their 14-day quarantine. Of the 12
police forces that replied to questions from the BBC, none said they had
handed out any fines.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some public-health experts said the fractious debate over the quarantine
had distracted from more pressing problems, like safely reopening
Britain’s schools, organizing an effective test-and-trace program and
organizing a system to stamp out new outbreaks in [cities like
Leicester](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/01/leicester-outbreak-driven-by-infection-rise-in-under-19s-says-phe-report)
to avert a second lockdown.

“The U.K. government seems focused on giving people a summer pandemic
holiday instead of dealing with the hard issues facing the aviation
industry for the coming year,” said Professor Devi Sridhar, the director
of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh.

Scotland has balked at the easing, much as it resisted Prime Minister
Boris Johnson’s earlier plans to lift the lockdown. Its infection and
death rates are lower than in England, which officials attribute to its
more cautious approach. The Scottish government has yet to decide how to
relax restrictions on travelers, though its options are somewhat
limited, given its open border with
England.

Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the BBC on Friday that the
United States would be excluded from the immediate relaxation because of
the “very high numbers of infections” in the country.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

The government has designated countries with green, yellow and red
lights, based on “the prevalence of coronavirus, the numbers of new
cases and potential trajectory of the disease in that destination.” The
United States [has a red
light.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

The announcement appeared to go further than an earlier idea floated by
ministers to create “air bridges” with specific countries, in which
travelers would have reciprocal freedom to travel. The government still
hopes that a number of the exempted countries will not require visitors
from Britain to quarantine.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the list of greenlight countries comprises more than 50 — among them
Vietnam and Hong Kong, though not mainland China. Some could still
require travelers from Britain to quarantine on arrival. On the British
end, many arriving passengers will still be required to provide contact
information.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your

Still, for the travel industry, it was a welcome relief after a tense
period when they worried that the summer season was going to be ruined.
Many complained about the damage to their businesses and warned about
job losses.

“It has been an incredibly frustrating time,” said Steven Freudmann, the
chairman of the Institute of Travel and Tourism, a lobbying group.
“There just appears to be no coordinated thinking. A shambles is the
only word I can think of.”

Mr. Freudmann said he was “happy and relieved that finally — finally —
the government seems to be making sensible decisions.” But he said the
government’s erratic policies had “created a lack of confidence and
clearly we, as an industry, have a job in establishing that
confidence.”

Nor was Mr. Freudmann the only critic of the government’s
decision-making over quarantine rules.

The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, described it as
“shambolic,” adding that she wanted to study the detail before taking
any decision on whether Scotland should adopt the new program with
England.

Among those who flouted the existing travel restrictions was the father
of Mr. Johnson, Stanley Johnson. The elder Mr. Johnson, 79, posted
pictures on social media of his arrival in Greece, which currently
prevents vacationers from flying directly from Britain. He apparently
got there via the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.

It was not the first time he had defied government coronavirus advice.
Before Britain’s lockdown began, when the prime minister urged Britons
not to go to the pub, his father said he would go anyway if he felt the
thirst.

Speaking from Greece, Stanley Johnson told the Daily Mail newspaper that
he was in the country on “essential business, trying to Covid-proof my
property in view of the upcoming letting season.”
