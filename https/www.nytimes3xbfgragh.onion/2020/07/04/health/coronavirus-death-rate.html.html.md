# The Pandemic’s Big Mystery: How Deadly Is the Coronavirus?

Even with more than 500,000 dead worldwide, scientists are struggling to
learn how often the virus kills. Here’s
why.

More than six months into the pandemic, the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/florida-mother-2-children-covid-19.html)
has
[infected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/health/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html)
more than 11 million people worldwide,
[killing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/arizona-coronavirus-mark-anthony-urquiza.html)
more than 525,000. But despite the increasing toll, scientists still do
not have a definitive answer to one of the most fundamental questions
about the virus: How deadly is it?

A firm estimate could help governments predict how many
[deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/florida-mother-2-children-covid-19.html)
would ensue if the virus spread out of control. The figure, usually
called the infection fatality rate, could tell health officials what to
expect as the pandemic spreads to densely populated nations like Brazil,
Nigeria and India.

In even poorer countries, where lethal threats like measles and malaria
are constant and where hard budget choices are routine, the number could
help officials decide whether to spend more on oxygen concentrators or
ventilators, or on measles shots and mosquito nets.

The question became even more complex last month, when the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention released data suggesting that for every
documented infection in the United States, [there were 10 other cases on
average that had gone
unrecorded](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html),
probably because they were very mild or asymptomatic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If there are many more asymptomatic infections than once thought, then
the virus may be less deadly than it has appeared. But even that
calculation is a difficult one.

On Thursday, after the World Health Organization held a two-day online
meeting of 1,300 scientists from around the world, the agency’s chief
scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said the consensus for now was that
the I.F.R. is about 0.6 percent — which means that the risk of death is
less than 1 percent.

Although she did not note this, 0.6 percent of the world’s population is
47 million people, and 0.6 percent of the American population is 2
million people. The virus remains a major threat.

At present, countries have very different case fatality rates, or
C.F.R.’s, which measure deaths among patients known to have had
Covid-19. In most cases, that number is highest in countries that have
had the virus the longest.

According to [data gathered by The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html),
China had reported 90,294 cases as of Friday and 4,634 deaths, which is
a C.F.R. of 5 percent. The United States was very close to that mark. It
has had 2,811,447 cases and 129,403 deaths, about 4.6 percent.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Those percentages are far higher rates than the [2.5 percent death rate
often ascribed to the 1918 flu
pandemic](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/1/05-0979_article).
Still, it is difficult to measure fatality rates during pandemics,
especially at the
beginning.

In the chaos that ensues when a new virus hits a city hard, thousands of
people may die and be buried without ever being tested, and certainly
without them all being autopsied.

It is never entirely clear how many died of the virus and how many died
of heart attacks, strokes or other ills. That has happened in both New
York City and in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began.

Normally, once the chaos has subsided, more testing is done and more
mild cases are found — and because the denominator of the fraction
rises, fatality rates fall. But the results are not always consistent or
predictable.

Ten sizable countries, most of them in Western Europe, have tested
bigger percentages of their populations than has the United States,
according to [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/),
which gathers statistics. They are Iceland, Denmark, Spain, Portugal,
Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Britain, Israel and New Zealand.

But their case fatality rates [vary
wildly](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20200605&instance_id=19111&nl=the-morning&regi_id=3423762&segment_id=30155&te=1&user_id=2f7d5ee538b6384a048aa9442c9b48c2):
Iceland’s is less than 1 percent, New Zealand’s and Israel’s are below 2
percent. Belgium, by comparison, is at 16 percent, and Italy and Britain
at 14 percent.

Both figures — the infection fatality rate and the case fatality rate —
can differ quite a bit by country.

So far, in most countries, about 20 percent of all confirmed Covid-19
patients become ill enough to need supplemental oxygen or even more
advanced hospital care, said Dr. Janet Diaz, head of clinical care for
the W.H.O.’s emergencies program.

Whether those patients survive depends on a host of factors, including
age, underlying illnesses and the level of medical care available.

Death rates are expected to be lower in countries with younger
populations and less obesity, which are often the poorest countries.
Conversely, the figures should be higher in countries that lack oxygen
tanks, ventilators and dialysis machines, and where many people live far
from hospitals. Those are also often the poorest countries.

The W.H.O. and various charities are [scrambling to purchase oxygen
equipment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/health/coronavirus-oxygen-africa.html)
for poor and middle-income nations in which the coronavirus is
spreading.

And now, new factors are being introduced into the equation. For
example, new evidence that people with Type A blood [are more likely to
fall deathly
ill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/health/coronavirus-blood-type-genetics.html)
could change risk calculations. Type A blood [is relatively
rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_distribution_by_country)
in West Africa and South Asia, and very rare among the Indigenous
peoples of South America.

Before this week’s meeting, the W.H.O. had no official I.F.R. estimate,
Oliver Morgan, the agency’s director of health emergency information and
risk assessment, said in an interview in early June.

Instead, it had relied on a mix of data sent in by member countries and
by academic groups, and on a meta-analysis done in May by scientists at
the University of Wollongong and James Cook University in Australia.

Those researchers looked at 267 studies in more than a dozen countries,
and then chose the 25 they considered the most accurate, weighting them
for accuracy and averaged the data. They concluded that the global
I.F.R. was 0.64
percent.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The C.D.C. relies on a “symptomatic case fatality ratio” that “is not
necessarily equivalent to the number of reported deaths per reported
cases.” The best estimate for the United States is 0.4 percent,
according to [a set of planning
scenarios](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html)
released in late May.

The agency did not respond to requests to explain how it arrived at that
figure, or why it was so much lower than the W.H.O.’s estimate. By
comparison, 0.4 percent of the United States population is 1.3 million
people.

The 25 studies that the Australian researchers considered the most
accurate relied on very different methodologies. One report, for
example, was based on diagnostic PCR tests of all passengers and crew
aboard the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that docked in Japan after
it was overcome by the coronavirus. Another study drew data from an
antibody survey of 38,000 Spaniards, while another included only 1,104
Swedes.

The current W.H.O. estimate is based on later, larger studies of how
many people have antibodies in their blood; future studies may further
refine the figure, Dr. Swaminathan said.

But there is “a lot of uncertainty” about how many silent and untested
carriers there are, Dr. Morgan of the W.H.O. said.

To arrive at the C.D.C.’s new estimate, researchers tested samples from
11,933 people for antibodies to the coronavirus in six regions in the
United States. New York City reported 53,803 cases by April 1, but the
actual number of infections was 12 times higher — nearly 642,000, the
agency estimated.

New York City’s prevalence of 7 percent in the C.D.C. study was well
below the 21 percent estimated in [a state
survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279720302015)
in April. But that number was based on people recruited at supermarkets,
and so the results may have been biased toward people out shopping
during a pandemic — often the young, who have been less affected.

The global fatality rates could still change. With one or two
exceptions, like
[Iran](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/world/middleeast/iran-coronavirus-surge.html)
and
[Ecuador](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/world/americas/ecuador-deaths-coronavirus.html),
the pandemic first struck wealthier countries in Asia, Western Europe
and North America where advanced medical care was available.

Now it is spreading widely in India, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria and other
countries where millions are crowded into slums, lockdowns have been
relatively brief and hospitals have few resources.

But the death rates may also shift in wealthier northern countries as
winter approaches. Most of the spread of the virus in Europe and North
America has taken place during mild or warm weather in the spring and
summer.

Many experts fear that infections and deaths will shoot up in the fall
as colder weather forces people indoors, where they are more likely to
infect one another. Discipline about wearing masks and avoiding
breathing on one another will be even more important then.

In each of the eight influenza pandemics to hit the United States since
1763, a relatively mild first wave — no matter what time of year it
arrived — was followed by a larger, much more lethal wave a few months
later, noted Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious
Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

More than a third of all the people killed by the Spanish flu, which
lasted from March 1918 to late 1920, died in the short stretch between
September and December 1918 — about six months after a first, relatively
mild version of what may have been the same virus broke out in western
Kansas.

“We will go much higher in the next 12 to 18 months,” Dr. Osterholm
said. Because this is a coronavirus, not influenza, it may not follow
the same pattern, but it is “a much more efficient transmitter than
influenza.”
