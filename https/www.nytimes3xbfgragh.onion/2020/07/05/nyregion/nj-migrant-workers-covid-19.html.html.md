HAMMONTON, N.J. — Workers at the largest blueberry farm in the Northeast
move through the fields in small groups, fingers dancing with the speed
of musicians as they pick bushes heavy with fruit.

The more they gather, the more they are paid during a season that lasts
only about seven weeks.

Barring rain, they work seven days a week; there is no time for illness.

But everywhere there are reminders of the coronavirus and its power to
sweep quickly through tightly packed farm camps.

It is the reason laborers who live and toil close together wear
bandannas across their faces in the hot sun and work separated by
plexiglass in the fruit packaging facility.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is what had them standing in line on a steamy morning, weeks before
picking started, to be tested for the virus at the large farm in
southern New Jersey, Atlantic Blueberry Company in Hammonton.

“It feels a little uncomfortable,” said Angel Rodriguez, who works in
the farm’s packaging facility. “You don’t know if somebody is
contagious.”

Mr. Rodriguez, 34, left Puerto Rico in March to begin working his way up
the East Coast, stopping for two months in Florida before arriving in
late May in Atlantic County, the hub of New Jersey’s [thriving blueberry
industry](https://www.nj.gov/agriculture/news/press/2019/approved/press190701.html#:~:text=Blueberries%20were%20the%20No.,on%209%2C000%20acres%20last%20year.).

He is one of an estimated
[22,000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4040280/#R10)
seasonal workers who tend and harvest crops in New Jersey, nicknamed the
[Garden
State](https://www.state.nj.us/nj/about/facts/nickname/#:~:text=Abraham%20Browning%20of%20Camden%20is,the%20nickname%20the%20Garden%20State.&text=Browning%20said%20that%20our%20Garden,The%20name%20stuck%20ever%20since.)
for its robust agriculture industry.

Like Mr. Rodriguez, many laborers follow the ripening crops up the
Eastern Seaboard, starting in
[Florida](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/coronavirus-florida-texas-california-arizona.html),
where [migrant living quarters have been
ravaged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/florida-coronavirus-immokalee-farmworkers.html)
by the virus, and working their way north to Maine.

In New Jersey, 3,900 farmworkers had been tested as of Thursday and 193
were positive for the virus, according to the state’s Department of
Health. Of these, 14 migrant workers who had nowhere to remain isolated
were placed in quarantine at a state-run field hospital at the Atlantic
City Convention Center.

“It’s a little dangerous,” said Felix Nieves, 56, who works as a
supervisor at Atlantic Blueberry. The 1,300-acre farm is considered the
biggest blueberry producer in the Northeast.

“But farming never stops. The fruit will not wait for this to pass.”

The first round of testing at [Atlantic
Blueberry](https://www.atlanticblueberry.com/history) was done early in
the season, before most workers had arrived. Three of the first 56
people tested were positive for the virus.

The health risks posed by the virus have made testing a priority at the
sprawling farm, according to an owner, Paul Galletta.

“As often as they can come, we will test,” Mr. Galletta said of the
health workers who wore white jumpsuits, masks, face shields and gloves
as they gathered nasal swabs. They have returned three times.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A sick work force during a short growing season could be financially
catastrophic.

“This crop comes in, virus or no virus,” said Denny Doyle, president of
the New Jersey Blueberry Industry Advisory Council.

Atlantic Blueberry purchased 3,000 bandannas and gave each worker two —
one to wear, one to wash — and hung fire-retardant cloth between beds in
the dormitories where hundreds of laborers live during the season. Mr.
Doyle said the farm also purchased several additional buses to create
extra space on the shuttles that run to and from the fields.

Agriculture is New Jersey’s third-largest industry. The state is among
the nation’s [top
producers](https://www.nj.gov/agriculture/pdf/2018Annual%20ReportFINAL.pdf)
of
[blueberries](https://www.nj.gov/agriculture/news/press/2019/approved/press190701.html#:~:text=Blueberries%20were%20the%20No.,on%209%2C000%20acres%20last%20year.),
cranberries, peaches and eggplant.

In May, state health officials arranged for four federally qualified
health centers to begin testing and [issued safety
guidelines](https://nj.gov/health/cd/documents/topics/NCOV/COVID_MigrantFarmWorkerGuidance_5.20.2020.pdf)
that offered a range of ambitious — some say impractical — suggestions
for farm owners. Farmers were told to avoid bunked beds, require masks
and create separate housing for anyone who tested positive for the
virus, among other recommendations.

There are no penalties for noncompliance.

New Jersey’s 5 percent rate of infection among farmworkers may actually
be higher. Day laborers who do not live on the farms are unlikely to be
among those tested by the health centers. Workers who are tested in
private medical practices are not included in the tally.

The testing program is also voluntary, and 57 farms have barred medical
teams from doing on-site testing, according to Dr. Lori Talbot, who
treats migrant farm workers and viewed the list of noncompliant farms
that was sent to the state’s health and labor
departments.

Dr. Talbot, who runs a clinic in [Bridgeton,
N.J.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/01/nyregion/missing-child-nj-dulce-alavez.html),
said 18 percent of the 200 farmworkers she tested in May were positive
for the coronavirus; many were asymptomatic, but two patients died of
Covid-19.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is just a whole new level of pain for farmworkers,” Dr. Talbot
said. “They’re arriving now, and they’re coming from places with high
rates of infection.”

The state’s health commissioner, Judith M. Persichilli, has cited the
prevalence of cases among farmworkers as one of the possible reasons the
positivity rate in South Jersey is now higher than it is in other parts
of the state.

Linda Flake, the chief executive of Southern Jersey Family Medical
Center, one of the four health centers coordinating testing, said the
perception that workers might carry the virus breeds a fear that, in
ways, is worse than the risk of the disease itself.

“Fingers are being pointed at the farmworkers,” she said. “I’m more
concerned about them being stigmatized.”

In May at a large agricultural greenhouse in Oneida, N.Y., Green Empire
Farms, one in four workers contracted the virus, according to a
spokeswoman for Madison County, Samantha Field. Community backlash
followed, playing out on social media and in panicked telephone
calls.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“There was a lot of community outrage,” Ms. Field said. “A lot of people
were blaming them.”

Yet the risk of spread is most pronounced within the cramped camps
themselves. Of 100 laborers tested at a [watermelon farm in
Florida](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/florida-coronavirus-immokalee-farmworkers.html),
90 were found to have the virus, according to Florida’s governor.

In New Jersey, at Cassaday Farms in Gloucester County, 70 of the 90
workers contracted the virus, according to the owner, George Cassaday.

Mr. Cassaday asked Southern Jersey Family Medical Center to conduct
testing after an older worker became ill and was hospitalized for about
a week. None of the other workers showed severe symptoms, said Mr.
Cassaday, who also contracted the virus; he was tested after he could no
longer smell his favorite flowers, hyacinths.

Most of his employees travel each spring from Mexico on
[H-2A](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-temporary-agricultural-workers)
worker visas, and stay for the harvest of early and late-season crops,
including broccoli, corn, strawberries and squash.

He says his business is as dependent on their health as he is on their
trust.

“I eat with the men. I visit them in Mexico,” Mr. Cassaday said. “We’re
one big
family.”

At least half the nation’s farmworkers are believed to be undocumented,
according to Bruce Goldstein, president of Farmworker Justice, a
national advocacy organization focused on labor standards and
occupational safety.

“What we’re hearing from all over is that people are too fearful of
being fired or deported to ask for improvement of the health and safety
practices,” Mr. Goldstein said.

Migrant farmworkers are not included in the categories of foreign
[workers barred in June by President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-h1b-work-visas.html)
from entering the country. But finding enough people to work the fields
has been a problem on farms in the United States long before the
coronavirus.

There has been a fivefold increase in the number of H-2A visas requested
and approved since 2005, climbing to 258,000 last year — “one of the
clearest indicators of the scarcity of farm labor,” according to a
[report](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/#size)
from the United States Department of Agriculture.

On New Jersey’s blueberry farms, a labor shortage over the last several
years has led to an expanded use of machinery to harvest the fruit,
which can be damaged in the process and then must be sold frozen, not
fresh.

[Guidance
issued](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-agricultural-workers.html)
by the United States for the safety of the nation’s estimated 2.4
million farmworkers is not mandatory. A New Jersey state senator, M.
Teresa Ruiz, has introduced a bill to make the state’s recommendations
binding.

“Each state is on their own,” said Amy Liebman, director of
environmental and occupational health at the Migrant Clinicians Network,
a nonprofit for health care organizations. “In some cases, each farm is
on their own.”

Sara A. Quandt, a professor and medical anthropologist who teaches
epidemiology and prevention at Wake Forest School of Medicine, has begun
a survey of farmworkers’ understanding of the virus and social
distancing.

She said she was frustrated by “victim blaming” and suggestions that the
infection rate in migrant communities is somehow linked to poor hygiene.

“There is inherent racism going on,” Professor Quandt said, “that
perhaps their lives are not worth quite as much and perhaps it’s their
own darn fault.”
