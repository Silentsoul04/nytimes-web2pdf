<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nick Cordero, a musical theater actor whose imposing height — 6 feet 5
inches — and effortless charm brought him a series of tough-guy roles on
Broadway, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 41.

His death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was [announced on
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCSBM89Axt_/) by his wife, Amanda
Kloots. She did not cite a cause, but he had been in the hospital for
three months after contracting the coronavirus. The couple moved from
New York to Los Angeles last year.

Mr. Cordero’s experience with the virus, which included weeks in a
[medically induced
coma](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-04-30/coronavirus-nick-cordero-amanda-kloots-interview-cbs-this-morning)
and the
[amputation](https://www.today.com/health/nick-cordero-s-wife-his-coronavirus-leg-amputation-it-was-t179215)
of his right leg, was chronicled by Ms. Kloots on Instagram.

Mr. Cordero’s big break came in 2014, when he played Cheech, a gangster
with a fondness for theater and a talent for tap in a musical adaptation
of Woody Allen’s 1994 film “[Bullets Over
Broadway](https://nyti.ms/1lNUKtH).” The role earned him a Tony
nomination for best performance by an actor in a featured role in a
musical. (James Monroe Iglehart won for “Aladdin.”)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Mr. Cordero never pushes for effect, even when he’s leading a homicidal
dance number to ‘’Tain’t Nobody’s Biz-ness if I Do,’” Ben Brantley wrote
in his review in The New York Times. “And somehow, this dopey,
mass-murdering thug and the actor playing him stand out as being far
more endearingly earnest than anybody else.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He went on to play the abusive husband of the title character in
“[Waitress](https://nyti.ms/1SYwN0i)” and a mentoring mobster in “[A
Bronx Tale](https://nyti.ms/2gSjZh0).”

“The terrific Mr. Cordero radiates a cool charisma that mixes a surface
geniality with shrugging ruthlessness” in “A Bronx Tale,” Charles
Isherwood wrote in his Times review.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cordero [fell ill on
March 20](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-hXYJPgalZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)
with what was initially diagnosed as pneumonia and later as Covid-19,
Ms. Kloots said in her Instagram posts.

</div>

</div>

<div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He was kept alive for weeks, she said, through the use of a ventilator,
dialysis and a specialized heart-lung bypass machine; he endured brief
heart stoppage, minor heart attacks and sepsis, [Ms. Kloots
said](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_8qYEogmw7/), as well as the leg
amputation and a tracheotomy.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As he remained unresponsive, she began daily playing a song that he had
written, “[Live Your Life](https://youtu.be/LHTezKJdYTg),” and
encouraging others to do so as well. Many people joined in online,
sharing videos of themselves singing and dancing as they tried to
encourage his recovery with the hashtag \#WakeUpNick.

Alumni of musicals like “[Waitress](https://youtu.be/RIkV4s3ubj8),”
“[Good
Vibrations](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_gkSkHngdb/?igshid=12rkjeumeagpk)”
and “[Rock of
Ages](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/jonquesenberry/videos/10160469098802524/?t=2)”
recorded online performances for him, as did [a group of
musicians](https://youtu.be/-mVKcSmaHbI) led by Constantine Maroulis and
Steven Van Zandt.

“We sang it to him today, holding his hands,” Ms. Kloots said in her
Instagram post announcing his death. She said that as she sang lines
from the song’s last verse — “They’ll give you hell but don’t you let
them kill your light/Not without a fight” — “I smiled because he
definitely put up a fight.”

While Mr. Cordero was hospitalized, Ms. Kloots and her family had been
living in a guesthouse owned by the actor Zach Braff, Mr. Cordero’s
co-star in “Bullets Over Broadway.” He said [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/zachbraff/status/1279961237342674944),
“Don’t believe that Covid only claims the elderly and infirm.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Kloots’s updates on Instagram occasionally had encouraging news; on
April 24 she said that Mr. Cordero had tested negative in two tests for
Covid-19. “We think the virus is out of his system,” she wrote. On May
12, she said he had woken up after a long medically induced coma.

But a lung infection persisted, and by May 20 she told her followers
that “unfortunately things are going a little downhill at the moment.”
In recent weeks he had been able to respond with his eyes to some
communication but otherwise remained immobile, she said.

Nicholas Eduardo Alberto Cordero was born on Sept. 17, 1978, in
Hamilton, Ontario, to Eduardo and Lesley Cordero. His father was
originally from Costa Rica. Both parents were teachers.

Nick performed frequently as an adolescent in school shows and at local
theaters. He attended Ryerson University in Toronto to study acting but
dropped out to join a band called Love Method.

His professional acting career began with “Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding” in
Toronto, followed by a two-year stint working on cruise ships.

He moved to New York in 2007, and by 2008 he was starring in a small
musical called “The Toxic Avenger,” first [in New
Jersey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/10/19/nyregion/new-jersey/19theatnj.html)
and then [Off
Broadway](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/04/07/theater/reviews/07toxi.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Mr. Cordero morphs convincingly from supernerd to slime-dripping hulk,
retaining traces of geekery that glimmer appealingly from under the
neon-green gunk,” Mr. Isherwood wrote in The Times.

After a period of unemployment, Mr. Cordero was cast in the national
tour of “Rock of Ages” and in 2012 [joined the Broadway
cast](https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/ROCK-OF-AGES-Welcomes-Nick-Cordero-to-the-Cast-as-Dennis-924-20120921)
of that long-running show; another stretch of joblessness prompted him
to [consider a career in real
estate](https://www.broadway.com/buzz/175841/tony-nominated-bullets-star-nick-cordero-on-quitting-school-getting-in-trouble-woody-allens-comedy-tips/).

But then he landed his breakout role in “Bullets Over Broadway.” It was
also there that he met Ms. Kloots, who was a dancer in the ensemble.
[(She is now a fitness trainer.)](https://amandakloots.com/)

In addition to his wife, his survivors include their 1-year-old son,
[Elvis](https://www.playbill.com/article/broadways-nick-cordero-and-amanda-kloots-welcome-first-child).

In Los Angeles this year, Mr. Cordero returned to a familiar show
reconceived for a new setting, appearing in a [bar-based version of
“Rock of
Ages,”](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-01-15/rock-of-ages-hollywood-bourbon-room)
staged in a nightclub.

In [a 2014 interview](https://nyti.ms/1qc1E17), he reflected on the
challenge of finding his way into the roles coming his way.

“The producer kept telling me, ‘Get tough. Get mean. Get angry,’ ” he
said. “But I’m a nice guy. I’m
Canadian.”
