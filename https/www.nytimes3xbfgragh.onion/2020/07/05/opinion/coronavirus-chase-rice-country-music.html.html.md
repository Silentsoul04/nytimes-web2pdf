# How to Keep Music (and One Another) Alive

If we want to experience concerts again, we need to support the artists
we love until the pandemic passes. Here’s how.

NASHVILLE — On June 27, as Covid-19 cases were [rising to a crisis level
in
Tennessee](https://wpln.org/post/following-high-case-counts-tennessees-pandemic-tracking-site-goes-down/?mc_cid=a2c6e0f2a3&mc_eid=e952ad88f8),
the country music artist [Chase Rice held a
concert](https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/06/29/chase-rice-chris-janson-concerts-roil-nashvilles-ravaged-music-industry/3280563001/)
outside the Historic Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in Petros, Tenn.
Packed tightly together and wearing no masks — at least none that were
visible in the video Mr. Rice posted on Instagram — fans seemed
unconcerned that a deadly pandemic was unfolding around them. And
probably among them, too.

The video has since expired, but the backlash against Mr. Rice — and
also Chris Janson, who played to a similar crowd in Filer, Idaho — was
fierce. Coming on the heels of an image that circulated on social media
[of a packed
bar](https://twitter.com/MissMandyHale/status/1272231947708891144) at
Kid Rock’s Big Ass Honkytonk and Rock ‘n’ Roll Steakhouse in Nashville’s
tourist district, it seemed emblematic, a giant middle finger to the
pandemic itself.

I’m as outraged as anyone at the sight of people making choices that
will inevitably cost lives and prolong the pandemic, but I can
understand, at least a little bit, why Mr. Rice held that concert and
why his fans showed up.

Bands once supported themselves primarily through record sales. But then
music went digital, and Napster, the early file-sharing platform,
[changed the industry almost
overnight](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2000/07/15/opinion/freedom-one-song-at-a-time.html?searchResultPosition=2).
I haven’t thought of Napster in years, but the shuttering of clubs and
concert halls during this pandemic has reminded me of something the
musician Rich Brotherton, my husband’s lifelong friend, heard Loudon
Wainwright say at a concert some 20 years ago: “You’re file-sharing the
food right out of my mouth.”

Today’s streaming services, [which pay out a fraction of a cent per
play](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/how-musicians-make-money-or-dont-at-all-in-2018-706745/),
are marginally fairer than outright piracy, but their chief value to a
performer is the opportunity to reach new listeners: If someone falls in
love with a song, that new fan is apt to buy a concert ticket when the
artist performs nearby.

Musicians can’t pay their bills if they can’t perform, but it’s not like
Chase Rice had no options for waiting out the pandemic safely. Other
musicians have found [new ways to reach their old
audiences](https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/all-musicians-streaming-live-concerts.html).
“[Live From the Drive-In](http://www.livenation.com/drivein/),” with
performances by country, rock and rap artists, and the “[Drive-In
Theater Tour](https://www.driveintheatertour.com/),” featuring Christian
artists, offer concerts with social distancing baked in: Fans bring
their own refreshments and stay with their cars, tailgate-style, for the
whole show. At the country artist Keith Urban’s [pop-up drive-in
performance](https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/05/15/keith-urban-drive-concert-stardust-vanderbilt-medical-workers-tennessee/5196898002/)
for front line medical workers in May, the audience “clapped” with their
headlights.

Far more common are [online
performances](https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/all-musicians-streaming-live-concerts.html)
streamed live and archived for those who missed the show. Last month
Sturgill Simpson [live streamed a benefit
concert](https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/spin/article/21136475/sturgill-simpson-lets-the-grass-grow-at-the-ryman)
from the stage of Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium to an empty hall. Every
week she’s in town, Marshall Chapman streams a “[Saturdays at
Springwater](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/pg/marshallchapmanmusic/events/)”
show from [the oldest continuously operated
bar](https://www.thespringwater.com/) in Tennessee. Mary Gauthier
streams both a concert series, “[Sundays With
Mary](https://www.marygauthier.com/tour),” and master classes[in
songwriting](https://www.marygauthier.com/masterclass). Mr. Brotherton’s
Irish band, Úlla, can no longer keep its weekly date at an Austin club,
so the musicians have [moved their Sunday evening shows
online](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/pg/ullairishmusic/posts/?ref=page_internal),
each performing from their own homes.

But for all its better-than-nothing virtues, a digital concert doesn’t
have even remotely the power of a live performance. And the experience
of seeing an artist in the flesh — or on a jumbotron — is only part of
the draw.

The real beauty of an in-person concert is the relationship between the
audience and the performer, and among members of the audience. It’s the
feeling of being a part of something huge and beautiful and fleeting. A
live musical performance, whether it’s in a stadium or in a storied
concert hall or in the shabbiest dive bar on the loneliest back street,
is a shared experience of transcendence. As Rosanne Cash wrote in [a
recent essay for The
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/what-pandemic-has-clarified-me-about-life-road/612076/),
a live performance is an irreplaceable act of reciprocity: “They needed
something from me, and giving it to them gave something back to me. I
loved them. They knew it.”

These may seem like frivolous things in the context of a global health
emergency, but they are not at all frivolous in the context of fear and
isolation. It’s an awful lot to ask of performers to give up performing,
and it is an awful lot to ask of fans to skip their shows.

Expecting people to do the right thing when the right thing flies in the
face of human nature is never a good bet. Until it’s safe to sing along
in public again, the only answer is for leaders to show some backbone
and [lock down the concert halls and the
bars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/07/02/health/bc-us-med-virus-outbreak-bars.html?searchResultPosition=2).
Last week Nashville’s mayor John Cooper [did just
that](https://wpln.org/post/nashville-backtracks-on-reopening-plan-reverting-to-phase-2/).

If we ever hope to experience the transcendence of live performance
again, we’re going to have to support the artists we love until the
pandemic passes. We’re going to have to put some money in the tip jar at
virtual concerts. Buy the T-shirts and the ball caps with the band logos
on them. Above all, we’re going to have to start buying records again.

“The LPs and CDs that musicians would have on their merchandise tables
at shows across the country are there to be had on their website stores
right now,” the Nashville music journalist Craig Havighurst told me in a
recent email. Buying the merch “is the most potent way fans can help
artists survive this crisis.”

If people can get in the habit of buying records again, it would go a
long way toward helping musicians and songwriters survive the pandemic
and beyond. “This is the best possible time to rethink our consumption
habits as fans for the short and long term,” Mr. Havighurst pointed out.
“We should strive for an ethos where we stream to discover and purchase
what we love.”
