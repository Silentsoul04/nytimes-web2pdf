# Tokyo’s First Female Governor Sails to Re-Election Even as Virus Cases Rise

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TOKYO — In rewarding Tokyo’s first female governor, Yuriko Koike, with a
second term on Sunday, voters endorsed her highly visible leadership as
the sprawling metropolis has avoided the kind of spiraling death toll
from the coronavirus seen in other world capitals.

But a recent resurgence in cases in Tokyo has made clear that her
challenge is far from over.

Even as Ms. Koike, 67, cruised to victory on Sunday, with exit polls by
Japanese news media showing her winning 60 percent of the vote, Tokyo
reported 111 new infections, its fourth straight day over 100.

The creeping increase in cases has started to raise anxieties that the
capital may have to reinstate elements of the nearly two-month [state of
emergency](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/19/world/asia/tokyo-japan-coronavirus.html)
that it emerged from at the end of May. That growing caseload was felt
in the election: About 15 percent of voters cast their ballots before
Sunday, and turnout on Election Day was just above 37 percent.

During the emergency period, in which the government issued voluntary
requests for businesses to limit operations and residents to stay home,
Ms. Koike made herself the face of Tokyo’s response to the virus. She
anchored near-nightly news conferences to deliver daily test figures and
advice on how to avoid infections.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Koike presented a stark contrast to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who
often appeared stiff in front of the news media. He was widely
criticized when he posted an [awkward video on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/AbeShinzo/status/1249127951154712576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1249127951154712576%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fenglish.kyodonews.net%2Fnews%2F2020%2F04%2F9fe49575657a-abe-criticized-over-stay-at-home-twitter-video-showing-him-lounging.html)
showing himself at home drinking tea with his dog. Ms. Koike was a much
more relaxed presence when she appeared in a jovial conversation with
Japan’s most famous [YouTube star,
Hikakin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofCsslfc-So).

“Seeing her face on television every day made me feel comfortable,” Yuki
Matsuura, 70, said as she voted in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo. “I think
that she is doing the best that she can in a very difficult situation.”

Ms. Koike said she was unlikely to request citywide business closings as
she did during the earlier state of emergency. She said that she would
prefer a “pinpointed” approach and that she wanted to establish a Tokyo
version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A total of 22 challengers vied for the post. Ms. Koike’s main rivals for
the governor’s seat tried to differentiate themselves by staking out
positions on further delaying, or even canceling, the Tokyo Olympics.
Mr. Abe and the International Olympic Committee announced in March that
the Games would be [postponed from 2020
to 2021](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/sports/olympics/coronavirus-summer-olympics-postponed.html)
because of the pandemic, and Ms. Koike has stuck to the official line.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Same-sex partnerships were another dividing line in the race. All three
of Ms. Koike’s most significant opponents expressed support for them:
Kenji Utsunomiya, a former president of the Japan Bar Association who
was backed by the country’s largest opposition parties, including the
Communist Party; Taisuke Ono, a former adviser to the governor of
Kumamoto in southern Japan; and Taro Yamamoto, a former actor and the
head of a newly founded party.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When asked about the issue during an online question session, Ms. Koike
said she “didn’t know” whether she would support such a policy.

The<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>victory on Sunday for Ms.
Koike, an ultraconservative former defense minister who speaks English
and Arabic, was something of a turnabout for her. Just a few years ago,
she had seemed to have fallen out of favor with the public: In 2017, [an
upstart
party](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/25/world/asia/japan-abe-election.html)
she founded to challenge Mr. Abe’s governing Liberal Democratic Party in
national elections took a drubbing, forcing her to admit “total defeat.”

Until the pandemic, Ms. Koike’s record of achievements had been thin,
and some of her decisions have drawn criticism.

Not long after she was elected in 2016, she postponed a controversial
move of [Tokyo’s famous seafood
market](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/06/world/asia/tokyo-fish-market-tsukiji.html)
from its historic location in Tsukiji when it emerged that contaminants
in the groundwater at a newly built site far exceeded environmental
limits. But she went through with the move a year later even as tenants
suspected that the metropolitan government had suppressed information
about the safety of the new
site.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

She also led an initiative to [ban smoking in most indoor venues in
Tokyo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/27/world/asia/japan-tokyo-smoking.html).

Burnishing her credentials with hard-line conservatives, she was the
first Tokyo governor to refuse during an annual ceremony to pay tribute
to Koreans who died in a massacre after the Great Kanto Earthquake of
1923. She also revoked a lease of public land to a new school for ethnic
Korean residents, many descended from people who were brought to Japan
as forced labor before and during World War II, when Japan occupied the
Korean Peninsula.

Surveys of employees of the metropolitan government, which oversees a
region of 14 million people, indicate that she is far less popular among
her city’s staff than she has been with voters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As an incumbent, Ms. Koike started with a considerable advantage,
particularly given that the Japanese news media tends not to ask tough
questions of candidates or investigate their records. The only thing
that came close to a challenge to Ms. Koike were rumors that she had
falsified her graduation from Cairo University in Egypt, prompting the
Egyptian Embassy in Tokyo to [post confirmation on its Facebook
page](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/permalink.php?story_fbid=1103403096719497&id=520203215039491)
that she had received a diploma.

“The Japanese media likes scandals, but they don’t really do any serious
policy review or anything that really affects our livelihood,” said
Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. The
Japanese media “fails to inform us or fails to ask questions of the
incumbents who have a huge advantage and owe us an explanation of their
past record.”

Ms. Koike has also managed to portray herself as a renegade. Although
she started her political career as a member of the Liberal Democratic
Party and served briefly as defense minister during Mr. Abe’s first term
as prime minister, she has run for governor as an independent. Some
analysts say she is more adept at political performance than actual
policy.

“She is very good at presenting catchy slogans or sound-bite phrases,”
said Jiro Yamaguchi, a professor of political science at Hosei
University in Tokyo. “I don’t think she has achieved substantive
policies during her first term, but she often appears in television
programs, especially after the outbreak of Covid-19, and she pretends to
handle the problems.”

Kazuhisa Tanaka, 63, who was voting in the Setagaya ward on Sunday
afternoon, said he had cast his vote for the incumbent by default. “I
don’t think that Koike has done the best job,” he said. “But who else
would I vote for?”

Hikari Hida, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.
