\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in

Dulce Nunes seemed poised to become a movie star, with her face
plastered on the covers of national magazines and a high-profile
marriage to one of Brazilian cinema's leading men. She had made several
films in her early 20s and found a place in the society pages thanks to
her storybook marriage. The public eagerly awaited her next movie.

Then she disappointed them, taking a detour into singing and releasing a
trio of albums in the 1960s that capitalized on the surging popularity
of bossa nova.

She died of Covid-19 on June 4 in a Rio de Janeiro hospital, her cousin
Sergio Bressane said. She was 90.

Ms. Nunes is best known for the 1964 album that launched her singing
career, ``Poor Little Rich Girl,'' with songs arranged by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1994/12/09/obituaries/antonio-carlos-jobim-composer-dies-at-67.html}{Antonio
Carlos Jobim} from a musical by Vinicius de Moraes, who wrote the book,
and Carlos Lyra, who composed the music --- three of the biggest names
in bossa nova, which combined samba rhythms with jazz.

A year later, Ms. Nunes released her first solo record, ``Dulce,''
featuring compositions by up-and-coming bossa nova composers, including
Mr. Jobim. In 1967, she came out with her only other solo recording,
``Writers' Samba,'' in which she sang her own settings of contemporary
Brazilian poetry.

That same year she married
\href{https://www.ecmrecords.com/artists/1435045864/egberto-gismonti}{Egberto
Gismonti}, her ex-husband's nephew, who became a successful musician in
his own right. The couple divorced in 1976, but Ms. Nunes continued to
sing on Mr. Gismonti's records into the early 1990s.

Dulce Pinto Bressane was born on June 11, 1929, in Rio de Janeiro to
Fernando Bressane, a merchant, and Euridyce de Oliveira Pinto, a
painter. She grew up in an unconventional family, in which the women
worked, smoked and associated with the city's bohemian set.

Ms. Nunes was expelled from a prestigious Roman Catholic school in Rio
for bad behavior, and she began acting while still in her teens. She
would complain about how all the male leads tended to be older men, but
then married one of them: the actor, composer, pianist and notorious
lady's man Bené Nunes, in 1956. The couple separated in 1963 but
remained close until his death in 1997.

Ms. Nunes' first movie, ``Woman From Afar,'' came out in 1949, and in
1950 she appeared in two more films, ``Morning Star'' and ``My Wife's
Fiancé.'' Her last role was in ``The ABC of Love,'' in 1967.

She is survived by her sisters, Heloisa Bressane Neno Rosa and Amélia
Bressane Pontes.

Ms. Nunes began working as an interior designer in the early 1990s,
spending her final years in Rio's beachside Ipanema district.
