# Laid Off and Locked Up: Virus Traps Domestic Workers in Arab States

</div>

The pandemic and economic crises have caused many workers to lose their
jobs. Some have been detained, abused, deprived of wages and stranded
far from home with nowhere to turn for help.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — When the nine African women lost their jobs as
domestic workers in Saudi Arabia because of the coronavirus lockdown,
the agency that had recruited them stuffed them in a bare room with a
few thin mattresses and locked the door.

Some have been there since March. One is now six months pregnant but
receiving no maternity care. Another tore her clothes off in a fit of
distress, so the agency chained her to a wall.

The women receive food once a day, they said, but don’t know when they
will get out, much less be able to return to their countries.

“Everybody is fearing,” one of the women, Apisaki, from Kenya, said via
WhatsApp. “The environment here is not good. No one will listen to our
voice.”

Families in many Arab countries rely on millions of low-paid workers
from Asia and Africa to drive their cars, clean their homes and care for
their children and elderly relatives under conditions that rights groups
have long said allow exploitation and abuse.

Now, the pandemic and associated economic downturns have exacerbated
these dangers. Many families will not let their housekeepers leave the
house, fearing they will bring back the virus, while requiring them to
work more since entire families are staying home, workers’ advocates
say.

Other workers have been laid off, deprived of wages and left stranded
far from home with nowhere to turn for help.

Persian Gulf countries alone had nearly four million domestic laborers
in 2016, more than half of them women, according to[a study for the Abu
Dhabi
Dialogue](http://abudhabidialogue.org/sites/default/files/document-library/2018_Future%20of%20Domestic%20Work%20Study.pdf),
which focuses on migrant labor in the region. Experts say the real
number has risen since and is probably much higher.

Hundreds of thousands of foreign housekeepers and nannies work in other
Arab countries, including Lebanon and Jordan, giving the Arab world the
most female domestic migrant workers of any region, according to the
International Labor
Organization.

Most come to the Middle East through recruitment agencies and are
employed under a sponsorship system that links their residency status to
their jobs, giving their employers tremendous power. In many cases, they
cannot quit without losing their residency, or move to new jobs or leave
the country without an employer’s permission.

And in practice, many employers confiscate workers’
passports<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>and deprive them of
time off, rights groups say. Some prevent them from using cellphones or
the internet. Physical and sexual abuse are common.

The combination of their gender, the sponsorship system and their
isolation<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>makes female domestic
workers especially vulnerable, said Vani Saraswathi, associate editor
of[Migrant-Rights.org](https://www.migrant-rights.org/), an advocacy
group.

“You have this person who controls your every movement, and you are in
their house 24-7,” she said, “so imagine the kind of power that gives
them.”

Alarm among such workers rose as Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus, spread across the Middle East and shook the economies many
migrants depend on.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Even in cases of extreme abuse, workers are hesitant to leave their
employers, as they fear being made completely homeless,” Ms. Saraswathi
said.

Dozens of Kenyan women in Saudi Arabia have complained of “not enough
food, no rest, violence, even being threatened, trapped and monitored,”
said Ruth Khakame, chairwoman of the National Domestic Workers Council
of[Kudheiha](http://www.kudheiha.org/), a Kenyan union. “You’re being
denied from using your phone. So you’re struggling, you’re alone and
you’ve nowhere to turn.”

Fear of contagion has upset relations between many domestic workers and
their employers. Some who used to get breaks when their employers left
for the office now have to serve and clean up after entire families
stuck at home all day. Other families distrust their workers as
potential vectors for the virus.

“From the beginning, my employers were not friendly,” said Justine
Mukisa, 33, a Ugandan working in Oman. But during the pandemic, her
salary of about $180 per month has been cut in half, her workload has
increased and her employers have grown hostile.

“Before coronavirus, we sometimes played with the children,” she said.
“Now this is not allowed. My employers do not want me to touch their
food or sit near them.”

In recent years, a number of countries have passed regulations regarding
domestic workers, granting them one day off each week, annual or
biannual leave and an end-of-service benefit based on length of
employment.

Qatar has capped the workday at 10 hours, the [United Arab
Emirates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/science/mars-united-arab-emirates.html)
and Kuwait at 12 hours and Saudi Arabia at 15 hours. Kuwait has a
monthly minimum wage of about $195 for domestic workers. Kenyans in
Saudi Arabia are [supposed to
earn](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001310333/pact-with-saudi-arabia-raises-kenyan-workers-minimum-pay)
at least $375 per month plus benefits, and the Philippines has set a
$400 minimum wage for its citizens across countries.

As the coronavirus has spread, Bahrain, Kuwait and the Emirates have
facilitated visa renewals to stranded migrants to help them avoid fines
and detention if their residency status lapses. Qatar and Saudi Arabia
have announced free treatment for migrant workers who get Covid-19.

But workers’ advocates say that enforcement of regulations is often
spotty and that those who face abuse have little recourse.

“The way these countries have perfected this system of disposable labor
lends itself to a high level of exploitation,” said Mustafa Qadri, the
executive director of[Equidem](https://www.equidemresearch.org/), a
labor rights organization based in
Britain.

Those who get the virus can be easily discarded by their employers.

Two months ago, Hanico Quinlat, a Filipino domestic worker in Saudi
Arabia, came down with a severe headache and moved into her agency’s
hostel to recover. When she tested positive for Covid-19, the agency
supervisor locked her in a room alone, giving her only painkillers and
vitamin C to treat her illness.

“When they give us food, they throw it into the room,” Ms. Quinlat said
by telephone from the room where she was being held. “We are people, not
animals.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Kelleh Njoki, 25, arrived in Dubai from Kenya as a tourist in February
seeking work, but soon discovered she was pregnant. She is now sleeping
in a crowded private dorm and cannot afford maternity care or a $400
repatriation flight.

“I’m seven months pregnant; how am I going to have my baby here?” she
said in a phone interview. “I’m stuck. I’m confused. I really need
help.”

For Apisaki, the Kenyan locked up with eight other women in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh, the trouble started when she left her job last month
after not being paid for months and returned to her recruiting agency,
she said.

She was soon held with others from Kenya and Uganda who also had no work
and no way to get home because of the lockdown — and because the agency
had taken their passports.

The New York Times verified the details of the women’s confinement
through interviews with two women in the room, including Apisaki, who is
being identified only by her middle name for her safety, and videos she
shared showing their conditions.

The women are in a single room whose only sunlight comes from a small
window that was recently taped shut. They share a toilet, wash clothes
in the sink and cook one meal per day when the agency drops off food.
The pregnant woman hasn’t seen a doctor in months, Apisaki said, and the
woman who tore off her clothes spent weeks lying naked on the tile, her
arm chained to the wall.

For the Kenyan women, the agency that recruited them in Kenya is
responsible for helping them return home. But the agency that recruited
Apisaki is no longer answering its phone or responding to messages, she
said.

Last week, the Kenyan Embassy in Riyadh
[announced](https://twitter.com/KenyaRiyadh/status/1277911187724828673)
a possible repatriation flight to Nairobi but said travelers had to
prove they did not have Covid-19, buy a $525 ticket and quarantine once
home.

But Apisaki can’t get tested or fly if she can’t leave the room, and her
efforts to reach the embassy have failed, she said.

The women said they had been locked up by their Saudi agency, [Almuhait
Recruitment](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/%D9%85%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%B7-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-103491741091774/?ref=nf&hc_ref=ARSq4vc8q4S5QfycNQXadsjq_HLexcYyzaiFQZAKq_cXIDFfzK1uEecA1F1fnZyolcM).
It did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday.

In an emailed response to questions, Peter Ogego, the Kenyan ambassador
to Saudi Arabia, said that he was alarmed by the “serious allegations”
of the women’s detention and that he would work with the Saudi
government “to bring justice to the victims and address the loopholes in
the law and any underlying causes.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But he said it was Saudi Arabia’s job to ensure the safety of foreigners
working there and questioned Apisaki’s inability to reach embassy
officials.

“Much of our work is daily spent largely addressing such allegations,”
he wrote.

After The New York Times contacted Almuhait Recruitment about the
women’s situation on Sunday, Apisaki told an associate outside of
Saudi Arabia that several of the women, including the pregnant woman,
had been taken to a hospital for medical checkups and Covid-19 tests.

“They can’t hold women without any right,” Apisaki said. “I don’t get
sun to my body, no space to stretch my legs, to walk or exercise. These
are the things that make my brain crazy.”
