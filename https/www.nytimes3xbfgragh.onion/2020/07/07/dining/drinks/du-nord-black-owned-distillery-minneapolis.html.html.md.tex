Forward}\label{a-black-owned-distillery-in-minneapolis-pushes-forward}}

From the pandemic to protests to arson, Du Nord Craft Spirits has dealt
with repeated turmoil and emerged with a new purpose.

When Chris and Shanelle Montana founded
\href{http://www.dunordcraftspirits.com/}{Du Nord Craft Spirits} in
2013, they chose the Longfellow neighborhood in southern Minneapolis,
``in part because it was a little quieter,'' Mr. Montana said.

It didn't work out that way. Over the past four months, Du Nord has been
buffeted and transformed by each new trauma to shake the city, and the
world.

In mid-March, with the coronavirus converging on the United States, the
couple, like many other distillers, ceased making their gin, vodka,
whiskey and liqueurs, and began manufacturing much-needed hand
sanitizer.

Mr. Montana handed out that sanitizer to protesters outside the nearby
Third Precinct police station after the killing of George Floyd on May
25. The distiller was tear-gassed twice for his trouble.

In the early hours of May 29, Du Nord, like many businesses in the
neighborhood, was in flames. The fire activated its sprinkler system,
which added water damage to the devastation. The night after that, the
Montanas' East Lake Street apartment building was set on fire.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/08/dining/07minn-distiller2/merlin_174096450_a7bc54bc-7d6f-421d-9f54-730ebe07009c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

No sooner had Du Nord begun to clean up than Mr. Montana quickly
pivoted, converting what was left of the building, where he leases
space, into an impromptu food bank to aid the reeling neighborhood.

``I think one of the things that has made it easier personally is
there's just so much to do,'' said Mr. Montana, 37. ``You don't really
have time to sit down and soak it all in. I might be bummed because some
people set fire to my distillery. That saddens me and angered me. But
right now, I have food every night. I'm fine. There are people doing so
much worse than I am.''

Du Nord's experience is all the more remarkable in the current cultural
context because Mr. Montana is one of the few Black distillery owners in
the United States.

During the protests and ensuing unrest that engulfed much of East Lake
Street, he had to weigh his instincts as a business owner against the
dangers that might await him outside. When he heard at 2 a.m. on May 29
that his distillery was on fire, he did not rush to the site, but waited
until daybreak.

``That was very scary,'' said Shanelle Montana, 36, ``the thought of his
going back to a burning distillery when the police walk by. Are they
going to think he's a distillery owner mourning his distillery?''

Though the Montanas, who have three young children, have enough to
contend with on their own, their focus has been helping the community.
The food bank in the distillery has paused while critical repairs are
made to the waterlogged building, but Du Nord is likely to reopen it,
based on community need in the coming months.

When friends started GoFundMe accounts for them, the couple's reaction
was to answer those efforts with a fund-raising drive of their own to
help other businesses in the area owned by people of color. ``I knew a
lot of them were uninsured or underinsured,'' Mr. Montana said.

The \href{https://www.gofundme.com/f/minnesota-poc-business-support}{Du
Nord Craft Spirits Riot Recovery Fund}, administered by the newly
created nonprofit Du Nord Foundation, has since raised roughly
two-thirds of its \$1 million goal. ``We're hoping that within the next
two weeks, we're going to start writing checks,'' said Mr. Montana, who
hopes to get back to producing spirits by the fall.

This generosity in the face of personal adversity has not surprised the
couple's friends and colleagues. ``He's always making the best of
whatever situation is handed to him,'' said Jon Kreidler, a co-founder
of \href{https://www.tattersalldistilling.com/}{Tattersall Distilling},
a Minneapolis company that teamed up with Du Nord on sanitizer
production.

``Chris and Shanelle would never turn down an opportunity to serve the
community,'' said Jessica Ward-Denison, an organizer of the food bank.
``With the scariness and sadness of the days leading up to this, I think
there was a great need for something positive.''

Ms. Montana, who is white, took more time getting to that positive
place.

''I was very angry for a long time,'' she said of the destruction. ``A
lot that were hit were small mom-and-pop businesses by people of color
that had been in business for a long time.

``But as I talked to people, a lot of them said, `If this is what it
takes to change things, then this is what it takes.' It really changed
my perspective. I got there. It took me longer, but I got there, to see
the hope in this and to separate the damage from the change it might
bring.''

Mr. Montana benefited from a broader view, informed by his childhood.
Soon after his family moved to Minnesota from Indiana, in 1991, he
recalled a rally and chants of ``No justice, no peace.''

``Then, it was about Rodney King,'' he said. ``It occurred to me that
here we are, almost 30 years on, the chants are the same, the problems
are the same.''

This time, though, he senses a shift.

``I don't condone the property damage, but I do understand it,'' Mr.
Montana said. ``If that means there's going to be attention paid to this
fundamental issue in our country, then it's worth it. I don't know if
there's a person of color in this country that, whether they own the
business or not, who would not pay that price over and over again.''
