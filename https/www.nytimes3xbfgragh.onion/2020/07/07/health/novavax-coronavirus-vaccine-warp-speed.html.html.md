The federal government will pay the vaccine maker
[Novavax](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html)
$1.6 billion to expedite the development of a [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html).
It’s the largest deal to date from Operation Warp Speed, the sprawling
federal effort to make [coronavirus
vaccines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html)
and treatments available to the American public as quickly as possible.

The deal would pay for Novavax to produce 100 million doses of its new
vaccine by the beginning of next year — if the vaccine is shown to be
effective in clinical trials. That’s a significant bet on Novavax, a
Maryland company that has never brought a product to market.

With this deal, the federal government has now invested nearly $4
billion in companies pursuing vaccines, but has provided little
information about how Operation Warp Speed is spending money, which
agencies the funding is coming from or how decisions are being made.

That money [has gone to six
companies](https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx)
with varying track records and, in many cases, promising but untested
technologies. British drugmaker AstraZeneca has received [$1.2
billion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/health/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca.html)
in federal assistance for its vaccine, which uses a harmless virus to
provoke an immune response. [Moderna
Therapeutics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html),
which has received more than $500 million, also has never brought a
product to market and is using a genetic technology that is valued for
its speed but has never led to a successful human vaccine.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some say the administration’s strategy — backing a variety of
approaches, including some that are cutting-edge but may not work — is
the best way to move quickly in the middle of a deadly pandemic. But
critics say the public deserves to know more about how taxpayer money is
being spent at this critical moment.

“It’s a black box,” said Peter Maybarduk, the director of the global
access to medicines program at Public Citizen, a public interest group.
“This could be one of the most important medical technologies of our
time, and we know very little about how that money is being spent, and
what conditions are being placed on it.”

Officials have given varying estimates of how many treatments and
vaccines are part of Operation Warp Speed, [and have
declined](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/operation-warp-speed-s-opaque-choices-covid-19-vaccines-draw-senate-scrutiny)
to give the full list of which companies are participating. Congress has
appropriated nearly $10 billion to support development of a coronavirus
treatment or vaccine, but Trump administration officials have said that
billions more could ultimately be spent, without providing additional
details. [A flurry of
contracts](https://www.keionline.org/covid19-ota-contracts) with vaccine
and drug manufacturers were recently made public, but the documents were
heavily redacted and provided little information about the arrangements
with the
companies.

“Operation Warp Speed leaders analyze all possible therapeutics and
vaccine partners, select the most promising candidates, and then follow
standard protocol on contract awards and spending,” said Michael Caputo,
assistant secretary for public affairs at the department of health and
human services. “While these experts are moving quickly and focused on
safety, we’re putting a lot of effort into assuring transparency while
not tangling them up in constant media inquiries.”

In an interview on Sunday, Novavax’s president and chief executive,
Stanley C. Erck, initially said he was not sure where in the government
the $1.6 billion was coming from. A Novavax spokeswoman later said the
money was coming from a “collaboration” between the Health and Human
Services Department and the Defense Department.

“Adding Novavax’s candidate to Operation Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio
of vaccines increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective
vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” Alex M. Azar II, the health
and human services secretary, said in a statement.

Until now, new [vaccines have taken
years](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html)
to develop, and many vaccines fail in clinical trials when they turn out
to be ineffective or to cause serious side effects. Many experts have
said the aggressive timelines set by companies and government officials
for a coronavirus vaccine are [overly
optimistic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/opinion/trump-coronavirus-vaccine.html).

Mr. Erck said Novavax’s coronavirus vaccine uses the same technology as
its other experimental vaccines, such as one for the flu, [that have
been tested](https://novavax.com/our-pipeline) in late-stage clinical
trials. Novavax has recently brought in senior executives from
established manufacturers like AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, he said.

“The risk they’re taking is that a company like ours — which doesn’t
have a pipeline of already commercialized products — can we get to the
big leagues and scale up?” he said. “And I think they’re placing the bet
that we can.”

The U.S. investment comes after an international group, the Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, [awarded up to $388 million to
Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-receive-388-million-funding-cepi-covid-19-vaccine)
in May to make its coronavirus vaccine available
globally.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Several vaccine experts said Novavax’s vaccine would help diversify the
federal portfolio by including another candidate that uses a
protein-based vaccine that has worked against other pathogens, like
hepatitis B. The Novavax vaccine uses microscopic particles that carry
fragments of the coronavirus, prompting the body’s immune system to
respond. Sanofi, which has received nearly $31 million in government
funding, is also developing a vaccine that is based on viral proteins.

“This is a sort of diversification from other approaches, which makes a
certain amount of sense,” said John P. Moore, a professor of
microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York
City. “You don’t want all of your eggs in one basket.”

Mr. Erck said the deal with the United States would allow Novavax to
begin manufacturing the vaccines before the company concludes late-stage
clinical trials, expected by the end of the year. The company would
ensure that 100 million doses — enough for 50 million people to receive
an initial shot and a booster — are delivered by the first quarter of
2021, if its coronavirus vaccine is proved safe and effective. In June,
[Novavax secured a $60 million
contract](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-awarded-department-defense-contract-covid-19-vaccine)
from the Defense Department to guarantee the delivery of 10 million
doses to vaccinate American troops for the coronavirus.

Novavax began early-stage safety trials in Australia in May, and the
company has said it expects to make the results available this month. It
said it planned to begin so-called Phase 3 efficacy trials by the fall
of this year and could release interim data by the end of 2020.

Through its deal with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations, Novavax is also setting up manufacturing in other sites
around the world, including in Europe and Asia, to serve populations
outside the United States. The company is using its own facilities to
scale up manufacturing and will also contract with outside companies,
Mr. Erck said.

He and others have noted that more than one vaccine will need to succeed
in order to vaccinate the entire world. “Right now, we need and want
everybody’s to work,” he said.
