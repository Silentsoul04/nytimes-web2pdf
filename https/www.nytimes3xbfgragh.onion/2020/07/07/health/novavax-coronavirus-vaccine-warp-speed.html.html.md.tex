The Maryland-based company, which has never brought a product to market
before, just made the biggest deal to date with the Trump
administration's Operation Warp Speed.

The federal government will pay the vaccine maker
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html}{Novavax}
\$1.6 billion to expedite the development of a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{coronavirus
vaccine}. It's the largest deal to date from Operation Warp Speed, the
sprawling federal effort to make
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html}{coronavirus
vaccines} and treatments available to the American public as quickly as
possible.

The deal would pay for Novavax to produce 100 million doses of its new
vaccine by the beginning of next year ---~if the vaccine is shown to be
effective in clinical trials. That's a significant bet on Novavax, a
Maryland company that has never brought a product to market.

With this deal, the federal government has now invested nearly \$4
billion in companies pursuing vaccines, but has provided little
information about how Operation Warp Speed is spending money, which
agencies the funding is coming from or how decisions are being made.

That money
\href{https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx}{has
gone to six companies} with varying track records and, in many cases,
promising but untested technologies. British drugmaker AstraZeneca has
received
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/health/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca.html}{\$1.2
billion} in federal assistance for its vaccine, which uses a harmless
virus to provoke an immune response.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html}{Moderna
Therapeutics}, which has received more than \$500 million, also has
never brought a product to market and is using a genetic technology that
is valued for its speed but has never led to a successful human vaccine.

Some say the administration's strategy --- backing a variety of
approaches, including some that are cutting-edge but may not work --- is
the best way to move quickly in the middle of a deadly pandemic. But
critics say the public deserves to know more about how taxpayer money is
being spent at this critical moment.

``It's a black box,'' said Peter Maybarduk, the director of the global
access to medicines program at Public Citizen, a public interest group.
``This could be one of the most important medical technologies of our
time, and we know very little about how that money is being spent, and
what conditions are being placed on it.''

Officials have given varying estimates of how many treatments and
vaccines are part of Operation Warp Speed,
\href{https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/operation-warp-speed-s-opaque-choices-covid-19-vaccines-draw-senate-scrutiny}{and
have declined} to give the full list of which companies are
participating. Congress has appropriated nearly \$10 billion to support
development of a coronavirus treatment or vaccine, but Trump
administration officials have said that billions more could ultimately
be spent, without providing additional details.
\href{https://www.keionline.org/covid19-ota-contracts}{A flurry of
contracts} with vaccine and drug manufacturers were recently made
public, but the documents were heavily redacted and provided little
information about the arrangements with the companies.

``Operation Warp Speed leaders analyze all possible therapeutics and
vaccine partners, select the most promising candidates, and then follow
standard protocol on contract awards and spending,'' said Michael
Caputo, assistant secretary for public affairs at the department of
health and human services. ``While these experts are moving quickly and
focused on safety, we're putting a lot of effort into assuring
transparency while not tangling them up in constant media inquiries.''

In an interview on Sunday, Novavax's president and chief executive,
Stanley C. Erck, initially said he was not sure where in the government
the \$1.6 billion was coming from. A Novavax spokeswoman later said the
money was coming from a ``collaboration'' between the Health and Human
Services Department and the Defense Department.

``Adding Novavax's candidate to Operation Warp Speed's diverse portfolio
of vaccines increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective
vaccine as soon as the end of this year,'' Alex M. Azar II, the health
and human services secretary, said in a statement.

Until now, new
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html}{vaccines
have taken years} to develop, and many vaccines fail in clinical trials
when they turn out to be ineffective or to cause serious side effects.
Many experts have said the aggressive timelines set by companies and
government officials for a coronavirus vaccine are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/opinion/trump-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{overly
optimistic}.

Mr. Erck said Novavax's coronavirus vaccine uses the same technology as
its other experimental vaccines, such as one for the flu,
\href{https://novavax.com/our-pipeline}{that have been tested} in
late-stage clinical trials. Novavax has recently brought in senior
executives from established manufacturers like AstraZeneca and
GlaxoSmithKline, he said.

``The risk they're taking is that a company like ours --- which doesn't
have a pipeline of already commercialized products --- can we get to the
big leagues and scale up?'' he said. ``And I think they're placing the
bet that we can.''

The U.S. investment comes after an international group, the Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations,
\href{https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-receive-388-million-funding-cepi-covid-19-vaccine}{awarded
up to \$388 million to Novavax} in May to make its coronavirus vaccine
available globally.

Several vaccine experts said Novavax's vaccine would help diversify the
federal portfolio by including another candidate that uses a
protein-based vaccine that has worked against other pathogens, like
hepatitis B. The Novavax vaccine uses microscopic particles that carry
fragments of the coronavirus, prompting the body's immune system to
respond. Sanofi, which has received nearly \$31 million in government
funding, is also developing a vaccine that is based on viral proteins.

``This is a sort of diversification from other approaches, which makes a
certain amount of sense,'' said John P. Moore, a professor of
microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York
City. ``You don't want all of your eggs in one basket.''

Mr. Erck said the deal with the United States would allow Novavax to
begin manufacturing the vaccines before the company concludes late-stage
clinical trials, expected by the end of the year. The company would
ensure that 100 million doses --- enough for 50 million people to
receive an initial shot and a booster --- are delivered by the first
quarter of 2021, if its coronavirus vaccine is proved safe and
effective. In June,
\href{https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-awarded-department-defense-contract-covid-19-vaccine}{Novavax
secured a \$60 million contract} from the Defense Department to
guarantee the delivery of 10 million doses to vaccinate American troops
for the coronavirus.

Novavax began early-stage safety trials in Australia in May, and the
company has said it expects to make the results available this month. It
said it planned to begin so-called Phase 3 efficacy trials by the fall
of this year and could release interim data by the end of 2020.

Through its deal with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations, Novavax is also setting up manufacturing in other sites
around the world, including in Europe and Asia, to serve populations
outside the United States. The company is using its own facilities to
scale up manufacturing and will also contract with outside companies,
Mr. Erck said.

He and others have noted that more than one vaccine will need to succeed
in order to vaccinate the entire world. ``Right now, we need and want
everybody's to work,'' he said.
