Maria Carmen Tapia has learned a host of new skills in the last few
months. The 42-year-old housekeeper and all her colleagues at the
housekeeping app [Up & Go](https://www.upandgo.coop/) were trained by
Occupational Safety and Health Administration-authorized trainers,
learning to put on protective gear correctly and establish safety
protocols to keep themselves and their clients safe during the pandemic.

At first glance, Up & Go resembles any other housekeeping app: When a
client requests a cleaning service in New York City, a few clicks bring
a trained housekeeper like Ms. Tapia to the door with her scrubber,
broom and eco-sprays.

But Up & Go is different from most gig economy platforms. Ms. Tapia is
not an underpaid worker eking out a meager living in an expensive city,
but an owner of her own enterprise. “When someone hires me, they get the
boss herself,” she said.

Up & Go is a new platform model for cooperatives. In 2017, the nonprofit
Center for Family Life, a neighborhood-based family and social services
organization in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, invited Ms. Tapia to join. Now
she is one of 51 housekeepers, all Latin American immigrants, who own
the platform. “We want to bring fair work to the workers by bringing the
co-ops into the 21st century,” said Sylvia Morse, the project’s
coordinator.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The owner-workers share offices, customer service representatives and
the app. They talk every two weeks to answer questions like: Should we
include more housekeepers and expand the cooperative? During New York
City’s stay-at-home order, they had to suspend residential cleanings,
which is the core of their business model. But Ms. Tapia and her
colleagues made up for some of the losses by fulfilling Up & Go’s
contracts for commercial cleanings, and reopened for domestic cleaning
on July 1.

The Center for Family Life has worked in Sunset Park since 1978. It
offers counseling, child care and senior care — and for the last 12
years it has tried to raise workers’ wages by helping them form
cooperatives. Instead of the $11 to $12 an hour Ms. Tapia was earning
when she found clients through fliers, she now usually makes $25 an hour
with Up & Go.

For a $135 fee she does a five-hour deep cleaning of a one-bedroom
apartment: She scrubs the bathroom, polishes the floors. “If a house
requires more work, we raise the fee,” Ms. Tapia said. A mother of two,
she has worked as a housekeeper and babysitter since she emigrated from
Ecuador with her mother 21 years ago. “I was barely making minimum
wage,” she said. “My life has changed drastically.”

Cooperatives have been booming in [New
York](https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/article/worker-cooperatives).
Landscapers, nurses and painters increasingly organize themselves in
co-ops. But Up & Go is unique in combining the traditional co-op
structure with the online platform and app technology of the gig
economy. It tries to pick the best of two worlds: For clients, the ease
of an app to book help quickly. For workers, the security of regular
jobs plus the pride of being an entrepreneur.

The workers agreed on safety protocols as soon as the threat of Covid-19
became clear. “In this stressful time,” Ms. Morse said, “it makes a big
difference that workers have the space to share, establish best
practices.” To make up for the loss of income, the center did extra
fund-raising, extended the hours of its food pantry and connected those
who struggle to pay their bills with emergency funds.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Early on, the big challenge was to make sure the co-op members had the
right information, took precautions to protect themselves and their
customers,” Ms. Morse said. “This is where we really saw the power of
the co-op. We had these systems in place. Everything was grounded in the
worker’s experience, rather than ‘we need to make as much money as
possible; let’s send people out even if they don’t have adequate
protective gear.’” So far none of Up & Go’s workers has contracted
Covid-19.

The gig economy, with platforms like Uber, Handy and TaskRabbit, seemed
to offer opportunities for freelancers and unskilled workers when it
took off after the 2008 recession. But economists soon [warned against
pitfalls](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/10/opinion/the-gig-economys-false-promise.html?searchResultPosition=1),
and the pandemic has [disproportionately affected gig economy
workers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/technology/gig-economy-pandemic.html).
As independent contractors, they do not qualify for basic protections
like minimum wages. The pandemic has put many of them out of work with
no safety net or forced some to consider working [without adequate
protection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/business/economy/coronavirus-instacart-amazon.html).

By contrast, the Up & Go worker-owners distribute the existing jobs
fairly among themselves, and every worker has agreed to stay home should
they develop any symptoms. “A big difference is that we know our rights
better,” said Ms. Tapia. “We are not only workers but entrepreneurs.
That changed who I am and how I see myself. I am constantly learning new
things — how to run a business, how to handle a democratic
decision-making process, what good management is.” She also appreciates
that the co-op members decide collectively whether to approve new
members and that if she falls ill, “another worker will keep my spot
open.”

The 51 Up & Go worker-owners, only two of whom are men, speak very
little English. Ms. Tapia knows enough English to arrange basic
housekeeping but leaves more complex conversations and conflict
resolution to professional customer representatives. “It is exactly this
clientele we want to serve with Up & Go,” Ms. Morse emphasized.
“Historically, this type of work has been done by immigrants and
predominantly by women. Racism and sexism have devalued this work.”

Development costs are the biggest hurdle in copying the Up & Go model.
Barclays and [Robin Hood](https://www.robinhood.org/), an anti-poverty
organization in New York City, funded the start-up with $500,000 and
invested again this year. Tech experts from [CoLab
Cooperative](https://colab.coop/) improved the app. This financial and
logistical support allows the Up & Go owners to keep 95 percent of their
income; 5 percent goes to support the infrastructure.

“Who owns the technology? Who decides how it is designed? How does it
influence the quality of life for workers in the gig economy?” Ms. Morse
said. “When we look at the change in the working world, these questions
are important.”

This model will work long-term only if enough consumers are willing to
pay a higher fee to be certain that their housekeepers are legally
documented and fairly paid. “I’ve seen $30 online specials for an
initial cleaning,” Ms. Morse said. “Up & Go just can’t do that.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Instead, Up & Go offers quality and trust. “It’s a matter of trust to
let someone into your home,” she said. “With Up & Go, you know that the
person has not just downloaded an app but is a co-owner who went through
a training process. The sense of accountability and safety is huge.”

To be sure, while its website describes the multiple precautions the
worker-owners take to avoid spreading or contracting Covid-19, it is
also frank with prospective customers that there is always a risk of
contagion. So Up & Go, like many service enterprises, requires customers
to sign a liability waiver before hiring their cleaners.

Before the pandemic, Ms. Morse said, Up & Go was likely to turn a profit
this year and expand. Now she hopes that commercial cleanings will keep
the start-up afloat and that other cities and industries will copy the
model. She found it especially encouraging that nearly 50 percent of its
residential clients continue to pay for the services to support the
workers even if they could not receive their services during the
lockdown.
