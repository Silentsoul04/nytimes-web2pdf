### Dear Tripped Up,

My wife and I were supposed to attend a wedding in Sonoma this spring,
but the affair was obviously canceled. I canceled our Best Western
reservation well before the 24 hours required by the company’s new
coronavirus [cancellation
policy](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/notice/covid-19-response-cancel-policy.html),
but was told that the only option is to postpone our stay for a year —
as if I jet-set out to wine country every year for a wedding (and
besides, I’m more of a beer guy). I’ve been messaging back and forth
with Best Western on Facebook; the customer-service people said the
hitch lies with the hotel owner, who is refusing to issue the refund.
What’s the point of flexible corporate cancellation policies if
individual hotels aren’t required to adhere to them? George

### Hi George,

The pandemic has brought to light some nerdy issues about the travel
industry — ones that most of us never needed to think about before. But
here we are, wondering aloud about the oversight capabilities of hotel
franchises, and what powers they can exert over their thousands of
individual owners.

I got several emails about this topic. Nick, another reader, faced a
nearly identical uphill battle while trying to cancel a June reservation
at the Hilton Rome Airport. Hilton’s [stated
policies](https://help.hilton.com/s/article/Change-cancellation-policy-extended-to-August-31)
for refunds are flexible, yet the individual hotel owner refuses to
budge.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For starters, the answer is yes: Whenever a company like Best Western or
Hilton announces a flexible corporate cancellation policy, it’s meant to
apply to all branded hotels. But Best Western also [states
outright](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/notice/covid-19-response-cancel-policy.html)
that a small percentage of individual owners may be eligible to deny
refunds on a small percentage of bookings. And that’s what happened
here.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokeswoman for Best Western said in a statement that “During the
COVID-19 pandemic, Best Western Hotels & Resorts has offered a flexible
cancellation policy to its valued guests. This policy includes that ‘a
more restrictive cancellation policy may apply to a limited number of
high-demand dates at individual hotels,’ which was applicable to this
guest’s reservation.”

After reaching out to Hilton, I learned that Nick got trapped by an even
more peculiar loophole — a bizarre wrench in the pandemic’s
ever-expanding toolbox of bizarre wrenches. On March 17, Italy passed
the “Cura Italia” decree, a relief measure meant to offset the economic
toll of the pandemic in one of the hardest-hit countries. The new law
gave hotel owners in Italy the option to make the call on whether to
issue refunds or vouchers.

As I’ve reported before, cash-strapped travel companies have [numerous
reasons for retaining non-refundable
payments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/travel/refunds-or-credits-travelers-and-businesses-face-off.html)
in the age of the coronavirus, and it’s also not hard to understand why
the owner of hotel in Italy — at an airport, no less — would choose that
option, especially when expressly given the greenlight by the Italian
government. Another reader bemoaned a similar issue, also with an
Italian hotel. “Why is an American who never set foot on Italian soil
subject to a new Italian decree?” she wondered.

In general, though, hotels have generally been better about
Covid-related cash refunds than airlines, tour operators and cruise
lines. In mid-March, as the world started shutting down, every major
hotel company announced newly flexible cancellation terms, even for
“non-refundable” or “advance purchase” reservations. And even now, as
we move into summer, hotel policies remain pretty flexible. Hilton, for
example, allows guests to cancel any reservation booked through August
without penalty, so long as it’s done so at least 24 hours before the
arrival date. It’s a strategic move meant to get people to take a leap,
plan travel, book trips.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hilton’s communications department has worked its magic — a spokeswoman
for the brand has confirmed that Nick’s refund is in process. And in a
followup email, you told me that Best Western’s Facebook
customer-service team has offered you a gift card, which, unlike a
rebooked stay, can be used at any of the company’s
hotels.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

I realize it’s not quite the same as a cash refund, but amid an era when
planning (and canceling) travel feels especially difficult and
impersonal, measures like these can feel like a welcome human touch.
Whatever you’re drinking — be it beer or wine — I’ll say cheers to that.

*The* [*May 25
edition*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/25/travel/coronavirus-refunds-overseas-adventure-travel.html)
*of Tripped Up, about widespread refund issues with a Boston-based tour
operator, drew hundreds of reader responses. One, from a woman named
Lisa, stuck with me: “I love to travel and am very aware that many
travel services companies are fighting for their lives,” she wrote. “But
as a customer, I am increasingly concerned about shouldering the
bankruptcy risk of the tour operator. If they go bankrupt, those
vouchers are worthless. It’s a real dilemma, how to be supportive of
travel companies yet not end up losing thousands.”*
