# Pandemic Plunges Puerto Rico Into Yet Another Dire Emergency

The island has had to weather a hurricane, a political crisis and
earthquakes, but those crises did not lead to the widespread
unemployment caused by the response to the coronavirus pandemic.

SAN JUAN, P.R. — With hundreds of thousands of people suddenly out of
jobs in [Puerto
Rico](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/us/puerto-rico-earthquake.html),
Luciano Soto, a tour guide who has not worked in nearly four months,
wanted to be first in line at the Puerto Rico Convention Center, now
outfitted as an unemployment office.

He showed up at 8 p.m. one night a few weeks ago, with a lunchbox full
of snacks, prepared to spend the night, so that he could find out why
the unemployment benefits he had applied for months earlier had never
arrived. By 5 a.m., more than 400 others were also at the convention
center, and many furious people were turned away.

Mr. Soto finally got his money last week, after finding three of his
checks at the post office: The government had mailed them to the wrong
address.

“This is going to go on for a while,” said Mr. Soto, 57, who is worried
that the cruise industry he depends on will not quickly recover. “Would
you take a cruise right now, even if someone gave it to you for free?”

As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the globe, shutting businesses,
killing the vulnerable and crippling economies, Puerto Rico has taken
one of the country’s hardest economic hits.

Gov. Wanda Vázquez was the first governor in the nation to order
businesses to close and people to stay home. Experts say that her quick
action helped stave off an even worse medical crisis on the island. But
the pandemic has nonetheless plunged Puerto Rico into its fifth dire
emergency in three years, one that the government has struggled to
manage.

Thanks largely to hurricane reconstruction, Puerto Rico’s economy had
been inching toward recovery after a devastating 2017 storm and the
bankruptcy of the island’s government the same year. A civic uprising
paralyzed the island last summer and led to the ouster of Governor
Vázquez’s predecessor. Then a series of earthquakes shook the south
side of the island in January, damaging homes and buildings, sending
thousands to live on the street, and closing schools across the island.

As of last week, despite guidance from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention that everyone should be washing their hands frequently
during the coronavirus pandemic, the governor announced that because of
a [severe
drought](https://apnews.com/485aa49fc349decdbbef5e663d92dc74#:~:text=SAN%20JUAN%2C%20Puerto%20Rico%20\(AP,territory%20amid%20a%20coronavirus%20pandemic.&text=Gov.%20Wanda%20V%C3%A1zquez%20said%2021,29%20by%20the%20moderate%20drought.),
parts of the island would have running water only every other day for
the foreseeable future. So far, the island has had 8,714 confirmed and
likely cases of the virus, and 157 deaths.

Experts say this latest economic crisis has been even more difficult
than the one that followed Hurricane Maria. For one thing, aid has not
come pouring in from around the world, as it did after disasters of the
natural kind. And with Covid-19 creating serious problems in Florida and
other parts of the United States, unemployed Puerto Ricans, who fled to
the mainland in droves after Hurricane Maria, have nowhere to
turn.

As a result, on an island that already had the highest [poverty
rate](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/MS,PR/LFE305218) in
the United States, at least 300,000 Puerto Ricans have filed
unemployment claims linked to the pandemic — out of a civilian labor
force of 1.05 million — and many others are ineligible for aid because
they are part of the island’s large informal economy. Puerto Rico in
mid-June had the highest insured unemployment rate in the country, at 23
percent, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

Thousands of people were left waiting for their checks as Puerto Rico’s
understaffed bureaucracy struggled to keep up with the flood of claims.
A postal worker’s video went viral when he showed unemployment checks
stuck in mail purgatory because they had been addressed to “Same”: Many
applicants had written their home addresses on the form and then, when
asked for their mailing address, wrote “same as above.”

The island’s labor secretary, Briseida Torres, resigned in June, when
public fury was mounting over the long lines and delayed payouts,
including associated delays in receiving federal stimulus checks. Since
then, claims have started being paid, but workers without jobs have
remained deeply unsettled.

“I lost my job on June 1,” said Marelys Figueroa, 27, who was a
marketing and recruitment officer at a university. “I was working from
home, and I got an email. It said I was unemployed, effective
immediately. My income was the strongest of my household, and I have a
4-year-old child.”

The food bank, Comedores Sociales, said that it received 8,000 requests
for help in the first two months of the pandemic. Paola Aponte Cotto, a
worker there, said she spends 20 hours a week on the phone, fielding
requests.

</div>

“We’ve received calls from people crying,” Ms. Aponte said. “The callers
who are most shocked are the ones who lost their jobs.”

Puerto Rico's new labor secretary, Carlos Rivera Santiago, acknowledged
that there were delays in getting unemployment checks to those who
needed them, but said the government had opened more offices and
improved online services to address the backlog. After weeks of chaotic
scenes like the one Mr. Soto experienced, the government implemented a
more orderly indoor process, with socially distanced seats where weary
applicants wait for their appointments.

More than 300,000 people are now getting benefits, Mr. Rivera Santiago
said, while total claims in two available assistance programs have
reached 500,000.

“It’s a challenge, and one Puerto Rico is going to confront,” he said.
“We have to reinvent ourselves, change the way we work. Remote work
has become the order of the day, and that was not very usual in Puerto
Rico.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He stressed that the key to recovery will be injecting money into the
economy.

Puerto Rico is expected to receive $13 billion in Covid-related federal
funds, according to the Financial Oversight and Management Board, the
agency that has managed Puerto Rico’s finances since it defaulted on $72
billion in debt. The board has estimated that Puerto Rico’s economy will
contract by 4 percent.

In March, Governor Vázquez announced a $787 million stimulus package,
which included $160 million in grants to small businesses and the
self-employed. The government also set aside some special Covid-related
federal grants to help heavily affected sectors like hospitals and
tourism. About $350 million in federal funds went to the private sector
to help pay employees at businesses that were disrupted, according to a
Puerto Rico government
report.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your

José Caraballo-Cueto, an associate professor at the University of Puerto
Rico, said the rollout of the stimulus was problematic, because it gave
priority to things like hazard pay for front-line workers, who were
still employed.

Puerto Rico’s official unemployment rate has not been reported since
February, but Mr. Caraballo-Cueto estimates that it is now close to 40
percent. It is unclear how many people have returned to work since the
governor [authorized
businesses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/travel/travel-reopenings-virus.html)
to reopen in mid-June.

“The claims were the biggest we ever saw, since the beginning of
recording unemployment in the 1980s,” Mr. Caraballo-Cueto said. “And the
government pretended to process all of those new claims with the same
number of employees they always
had.”

Maria Enchautegui, an economist at the Youth Development Institute of
Puerto Rico, a policy and research organization, said the greatest
challenge was the technical capacity of the island’s Labor Department,
which was too limited to deal with the crush of applications. If the
promised aid does not quickly arrive, she said, the poverty rate among
workers in businesses affected by the recent lockdowns could climb to 77
percent.

“The effect on poverty could be quite bad,” Ms. Enchautegui said.

Many Puerto Ricans have informal off-the-books jobs that do not qualify
them for unemployment benefits, making the situation on the island even
more complicated, said Amanda M. Rivera, the institute’s executive
director.

The poverty rate did not climb after Hurricane Maria in 2017, she said,
despite experts’ predictions, because so many people left the island.

“After the hurricane, there was a valve, a place people could go where
things were normal,” Ms. Rivera said. “Now that people don’t have that
valve, that’s a real concern.”

Roberto Rivera, 55, a driver for a guided tour company, slept in his car
one night a few weeks ago, his crutches by his side, so he would be the
first in line for a short-lived drive-through service center established
by the Labor Department to receive disaster unemployment assistance
applications.

The scene resembled gasoline lines that formed during Hurricane Maria,
but were much longer, as thousands of people traveled overnight from
different parts of Puerto Rico to arrive at the convention center before
sunrise, driving on dark highways where the streetlights have not been
turned on since government austerity cuts three years ago.

“I arrived here at 11 p.m. — I need the money, I have to pay rent, buy
food,” Mr. Rivera said. “I submitted everything a month ago, and I
haven’t received anything. I’ve been surviving with the little I have
left.”
