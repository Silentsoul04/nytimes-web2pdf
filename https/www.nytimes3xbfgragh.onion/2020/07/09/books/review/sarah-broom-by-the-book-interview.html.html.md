*“My mother used to buy me any and every book with the word ‘Sarah’ in
the title,” says the author, whose 2019 memoir “The Yellow House” is now
out in paperback.*

**What books are on your nightstand?**

“The Dolphin Letters: Elizabeth Hardwick, Robert Lowell, and Their
Circle”; “The Selected Letters of Ralph Ellison”; “Sing, Unburied,
Sing,” by Jesmyn Ward; “Blindness,” by Jose Saramago; “More Dimensions
Than You Know,” by Jack Whitten; “Doomstead Days,” by Brian Teare; Toni
Morrison’s “The Black Book”; “Some of Us Did Not Die,” by June Jordan;
“Trieste,” by Dasa Drndic; John Gardner’s “The Art of Fiction”; Javier
Marías, “Thus Bad Begins.”

**What’s the last great book you read?**

“One Hundred Years of Solitude,” which I reread at least once a year.
It’s one of my favorite worlds to live in and I am still trying to
figure out how García Márquez built it. I also just finished “Sister
Love: The Letters of Audre Lorde and Pat Parker,” which reminded me of
all that friendship does, especially this from Lorde to Parker:
“Whatever I have/know that is useful to you is yours. Most of all to
hear from you when you speak, and believe you when you are silent.”

**Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how).**

A deep soaking tub with steaming hot water that never runs out. If
that’s not possible, in bed, coffee and fruit in abundance, jazz
playing low. As ritual, my partner and I read to each other most nights
around dinnertime, which I love so much and now cannot live without. We
last read the play “Home,” by Samm-Art Williams.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What’s your favorite book no one else has heard of?**

“Louisiana,” by Erna Brodber.

**Which writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets —
working today do you admire most?**

Saidiya Hartman, Kiese Laymon, Natasha Trethewey, Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah,
Jesmyn Ward, Walton Muyumba, Maggie Nelson, Wendy S. Walters, Lynell
George, Angela Flournoy, Kaitlyn Greenidge.

**Do you have any comfort reads?**

Oh yes, “Conversations With Toni Morrison,” edited by Danille
Taylor-Guthrie — I would wear it around my neck like a talisman if it
didn’t weigh so much.

**Which subjects do you wish more authors would write about?**

I wish (and I know this was not the question, exactly) for the day when
Black writers — especially women — are free to write whatever in the
world they want. And are fairly paid for the thing they wrote. Am
thinking so much these days of Toni Morrison’s apt quotation: “The
function, the very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps
you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again,
your reason for being.” I am looking for intellectual boundlessness in
my own work.

**What moves you most in a work of literature?**

When the writing and the story are equally captivating. I am most drawn
to philosophical texts that ask existential questions. And when within
this same kind of book, the writer makes me laugh? Joy\!

**Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you
avoid?**

I mostly read fiction. And this will perhaps seem ironic, but I tend to
avoid memoir.

**How do you organize your books?**

Alphabetical, without regard to genre. Poets live separately on one
massive bookshelf that reaches the ceiling. A few writers are gathered
in a case reserved for what I call “biblical texts”: Joan Didion, John
Edgar Wideman, Elizabeth Hardwick, Philip Roth, Albert Murray, Gayl
Jones and Toni Morrison are a few who live there.

**What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?**

If they know me at all, not a single one.

**What’s the best book you’ve ever received as a gift?**

My mother used to buy me any and every book with the word “Sarah” in the
title. Which is how she came to buy me Catherine McKinley’s “The Book of
Sarahs.”

**What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and
authors stick with you most?**

I lived for the Scholastic Book Fairs. Me and my mother made a job out
of circling all the books I would buy if our budget were unlimited, then
narrowed it way way down. I loved Shel Silverstein’s “Where the Sidewalk
Ends,” in particular. The other one I memorized and quoted from — in
completely inappropriate childhood situations — was “Aesop’s Fables.” I
had a hardcover special edition with the best drawings. To this day, I
miss that childhood copy. My mother taught us that books were a road to
elsewhere — a means of deepening.

**You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead
or alive, do you invite?**

I’m desperate to sit around a table with Natasha Trethewey, Kiese Laymon
and Imani Perry — but would also invite June Jordan, Audre Lorde and
Lorraine Hansberry.

**Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if
you were supposed to like, and didn’t? Do you remember the last book you
put down without finishing?**

Books speak to us differently at different times.

**What do you plan to read next?**

I’m rereading a series of small (page-wise) but big (power-wise) books:
Baldwin’s “Giovanni’s Room”; Elizabeth Hardwick’s “Sleepless Nights”;
Marilynne Robinson’s “Housekeeping”; and Gayl Jones’s “Corregidora.” Am
trying to see something. Want to also reread Natasha Trethewey’s
“Memorial Drive,” which I read some time ago in galley.
