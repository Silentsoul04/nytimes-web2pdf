\emph{``My mother used to buy me any and every book with the word
`Sarah' in the title,'' says the author, whose 2019 memoir ``The Yellow
House'' is now out in paperback.}

\textbf{What books are on your nightstand?}

``The Dolphin Letters: Elizabeth Hardwick, Robert Lowell, and Their
Circle''; ``The Selected Letters of Ralph Ellison''; ``Sing, Unburied,
Sing,'' by Jesmyn Ward; ``Blindness,'' by Jose Saramago; ``More
Dimensions Than You Know,'' by Jack Whitten; ``Doomstead Days,'' by
Brian Teare; Toni Morrison's ``The Black Book''; ``Some of Us Did Not
Die,'' by June Jordan; ``Trieste,'' by Dasa Drndic; John Gardner's ``The
Art of Fiction''; Javier Marías, ``Thus Bad Begins.''

\textbf{What's the last great book you read?}

``One Hundred Years of Solitude,'' which I reread at least once a year.
It's one of my favorite worlds to live in and I am still trying to
figure out how García Márquez built it. I also just finished ``Sister
Love: The Letters of Audre Lorde and Pat Parker,'' which reminded me of
all that friendship does, especially this from Lorde to Parker:
``Whatever I have/know that is useful to you is yours. Most of all to
hear from you when you speak, and believe you when you are silent.''

\textbf{Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what,
how).}

A deep soaking tub with steaming hot water that never runs out. If
that's not possible, in bed, coffee and fruit in abundance, jazz playing
low. As ritual, my partner and I read to each other most nights around
dinnertime, which I love so much and now cannot live without. We last
read the play ``Home,'' by Samm-Art Williams.

\textbf{What's your favorite book no one else has heard of?}

``Louisiana,'' by Erna Brodber.

\textbf{Which writers --- novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists,
poets --- working today do you admire most?}

Saidiya Hartman, Kiese Laymon, Natasha Trethewey, Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah,
Jesmyn Ward, Walton Muyumba, Maggie Nelson, Wendy S. Walters, Lynell
George, Angela Flournoy, Kaitlyn Greenidge.

\textbf{Do you have any comfort reads?}

Oh yes, ``Conversations With Toni Morrison,'' edited by Danille
Taylor-Guthrie --- I would wear it around my neck like a talisman if it
didn't weigh so much.

\textbf{Which subjects do you wish more authors would write about?}

I wish (and I know this was not the question, exactly) for the day when
Black writers --- especially women --- are free to write whatever in the
world they want. And are fairly paid for the thing they wrote. Am
thinking so much these days of Toni Morrison's apt quotation: ``The
function, the very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps
you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again,
your reason for being.'' I am looking for intellectual boundlessness in
my own work.

\textbf{What moves you most in a work of literature?}

When the writing and the story are equally captivating. I am most drawn
to philosophical texts that ask existential questions. And when within
this same kind of book, the writer makes me laugh? Joy!

\textbf{Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you
avoid?}

I mostly read fiction. And this will perhaps seem ironic, but I tend to
avoid memoir.

\textbf{How do you organize your books?}

Alphabetical, without regard to genre. Poets live separately on one
massive bookshelf that reaches the ceiling. A few writers are gathered
in a case reserved for what I call ``biblical texts'': Joan Didion, John
Edgar Wideman, Elizabeth Hardwick, Philip Roth, Albert Murray, Gayl
Jones and Toni Morrison are a few who live there.

\textbf{What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?}

If they know me at all, not a single one.

\textbf{What's the best book you've ever received as a gift?}

My mother used to buy me any and every book with the word ``Sarah'' in
the title. Which is how she came to buy me Catherine McKinley's ``The
Book of Sarahs.''

\textbf{What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books
and authors stick with you most?}

I lived for the Scholastic Book Fairs. Me and my mother made a job out
of circling all the books I would buy if our budget were unlimited, then
narrowed it way way down. I loved Shel Silverstein's ``Where the
Sidewalk Ends,'' in particular. The other one I memorized and quoted
from --- in completely inappropriate childhood situations --- was
``Aesop's Fables.'' I had a hardcover special edition with the best
drawings. To this day, I miss that childhood copy. My mother taught us
that books were a road to elsewhere --- a means of deepening.

\textbf{You're organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers,
dead or alive, do you invite?}

I'm desperate to sit around a table with Natasha Trethewey, Kiese Laymon
and Imani Perry --- but would also invite June Jordan, Audre Lorde and
Lorraine Hansberry.

\textbf{Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel
as if you were supposed to like, and didn't? Do you remember the last
book you put down without finishing?}

Books speak to us differently at different times.

\textbf{What do you plan to read next?}

I'm rereading a series of small (page-wise) but big (power-wise) books:
Baldwin's ``Giovanni's Room''; Elizabeth Hardwick's ``Sleepless
Nights''; Marilynne Robinson's ``Housekeeping''; and Gayl Jones's
``Corregidora.'' Am trying to see something. Want to also reread Natasha
Trethewey's ``Memorial Drive,'' which I read some time ago in galley.
