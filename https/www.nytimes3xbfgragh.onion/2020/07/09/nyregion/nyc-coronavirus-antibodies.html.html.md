At a clinic in Corona, a working-class neighborhood in Queens, more than
68 percent of people tested positive for [antibodies to the new
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-antibody-testing.html).
At another clinic in Jackson Heights, Queens, that number was 56
percent. But at a clinic in Cobble Hill, a mostly white and wealthy
neighborhood in Brooklyn, only 13 percent of people tested positive for
antibodies.

As it has swept through [New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/nyregion/coronavirus-testing-nyc.html),
the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/nyregion/coronavirus-testing-nyc.html)
has exposed stark inequalities in nearly every aspect of city life, from
who has been most affected to [how the health care system
cared](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/nyregion/Coronavirus-hospitals.html)
for those patients. Many lower-income neighborhoods, where Black and
Latino residents make up a large part of the population, were hard hit,
while many wealthy neighborhoods suffered much less.

But now, as the city braces for a possible second wave of the virus,
some of those vulnerabilities may flip, with the affluent neighborhoods
becoming most at risk of a surge. According to antibody test results
from CityMD that were shared with The New York Times, some neighborhoods
were so exposed to the virus during the peak of the epidemic in March
and April that they might have some protection during a second wave.

“Some communities might have herd immunity,” said Dr. Daniel Frogel, a
senior vice president for operations at CityMD, which plays a key role
in the city’s testing program.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The CityMD statistics — which Dr. Frogel provided during an interview
and which reflect tests done between late April and late June — appear
to present the starkest picture yet of how infection rates have diverged
across neighborhoods in the city.

As of June 26, CityMD had administered about 314,000 [antibody
tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/nyregion/new-york-city-antibody-test.html)
in New York City. Citywide, 26 percent of the tests came back positive.

But Dr. Frogel said the testing results in Jackson Heights and Corona
seemed to “jump off the map.”

While stopping short of predicting that those neighborhoods would be
protected against a major new outbreak of the virus — a [phenomenon
known as herd
immunity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/28/upshot/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html)
— several epidemiologists said that the different levels of antibody
prevalence across the city are likely to play a role in what happens
next, assuming that antibodies do in fact offer significant protection
against future
infection.

“In the future, the infection rate should really be lower in minority
communities,” said Kitaw Demissie, an epidemiologist and the dean of the
School of Public Health at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.

Dr. Ted Long, the executive director of the city’s contact-tracing
program, said that while much remained unknown about the strength and
duration of the protection that antibodies offer, he was hopeful that
hard-hit communities like Corona would have some degree of protection
because of their high rate of positive tests. “We hope that that will
confer greater herd immunity,” he said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Neighborhoods that had relatively low infection rates — and where few
residents have antibodies — are especially vulnerable going forward.
There could be some degree of “catch up” among neighborhoods, said Prof.
Denis Nash, an epidemiology professor at the CUNY School of Public
Health.

But he added that even if infection rate were to climb in wealthier
neighborhoods, “there are advantages to being in the neighborhoods that
are hit later.” For one, doctors have become somewhat more adept at
treating severe cases.

Some epidemiologists and virologists cautioned that not enough data
exists to conclude that any areas have herd immunity. For starters, the
fact that 68.4 percent of tests taken at an urgent care center in Corona
came back positive does not mean that 68.4 percent of residents had been
infected.

“For sure, the persons who are seeking antibody testing probably have a
higher likelihood of being positive than the general population,” said
Professor Nash. “If you went out in Corona and tested a representative
sample, it wouldn’t be 68 percent.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

So far, the federal government has released relatively little data from
antibody testing — making the CityMD data all the more striking. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for instance, [has
published](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html)
limited data that suggested that 6.93 percent of residents in New York
City and part of Long Island had antibodies. But that survey was based
on samples collected mainly in March, before many infected New Yorkers
might have developed antibodies.

New York State conducted a more comprehensive survey on antibody rates,
which involved testing some 28,419 people across the state. That survey
suggested that roughly 21.6 percent of New York City residents had
antibodies. But it also revealed a much higher rate in some
neighborhoods. While the state has released [little data from
Queens](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.20113050v1.full.pdf),
its numbers showed that in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for example, about 45
percent of those tested had antibodies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The CityMD data provides similar conclusions. At a location in Bushwick,
a Brooklyn neighborhood which has a large Hispanic population and where
the median household income is below
the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>citywide average, some 35
percent of antibody tests were positive, according to Dr. Frogel.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening

The CityMD in Corona, on Junction Boulevard, serves a predominantly
Hispanic neighborhood whose residents include many construction workers
and restaurant employees. Many had to work throughout the pandemic,
raising their risk of infection.

Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, called the high
positive rate in Corona “a stunning finding.” Epidemiologists said the
rate showed the limits of New York’s strategy in curtailing the virus:
While public health measures may have slowed the spread in some
neighborhoods, they did far less for others.

There are reasons parts of Queens [were hit so
hard](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/nyregion/coronavirus-queens-corona-jackson-heights-elmhurst.html).
Homes in Elmhurst and parts of Corona are [especially
crowded](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/10/23/nyregion/basements-queens-immigrants.html)
— the [highest rate of household
crowding](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/01/nyregion/overcrowding-worsens-in-new-york-as-working-families-double-up.html)
in the city, according to census bureau data from 2014. Given that
[transmission among family
members](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)
is a leading driver of the disease’s spread, it is unsurprising that
[crowded
households](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-households-spread-coronavirus-families-navajo-california-second-wave-11591553896)
have been associated [with higher risk of
infection](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/crowded-homes-poor-neighborhoods-linked-covid-19).

For residents of Corona, the main sources of employment are jobs in
hospitality, including restaurants, as well as construction and
manufacturing, [according to
a 2019](https://www.cccnewyork.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/FINAL-CCC-Elmhurst-Corona_SinglePages_1216.pdf)
report by the Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York. Many
construction workers and restaurant employees showed up to work
throughout the pandemic, elevating their risk of infection.

“Our plan did not really accommodate essential workers as it did people
privileged enough — for lack of a better word — to socially distance
themselves,” Professor Nash said. He said that one lesson of the past
few months was that the city needed to better protect essential workers
— everyone from grocery store employees to pharmacy cashiers — and
make sure they had sufficient protective equipment.

Epidemiologists have estimated that at least 60 percent of a population
— and perhaps as much as 80 percent — would need immunity [before
“herd immunity” is
reached](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/28/upshot/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html),
and the virus can no longer spread widely in that community.

But scientists say it would be a mistake to base public health decisions
off antibody rates across a population.

“Just looking at seroprevalence alone can’t really be used to make
actionable public health decisions,” Dr. Rasmussen, the virologist at
Columbia, said.

One reason is that the accuracy of the antibody tests is not fully
known, nor is the extent of immunity conferred by antibodies or how long
that immunity lasts. Dr. Rasmussen noted that the “magical number of 60
percent for herd immunity” assumes that everyone infected has complete
protection from a second infection. “But what about people with partial
protection?” she asked. “They may not get sick, but they can get
infected and pass it along.”

“It is premature to discuss herd immunity, since we are still learning
what the presence of Covid-19 antibodies means to an individual and
whether, or for how long, that conveys immunity; and we don’t know how
the level of immunity in a single community translates into herd
immunity,” said Jonah Bruno, a spokesman for the state Department of
Health.

He said he was unsurprised by the high rate in Corona, and senior
officials with the city’s contact-tracing program and public hospital
system agree. “We know this area was disproportionately affected,” said
Dr. Andrew Wallach, a senior official in the city’s public hospital
system, “so this just confirms what we’ve seen clinically.”
