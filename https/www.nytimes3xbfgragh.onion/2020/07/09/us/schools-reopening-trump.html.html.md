Bus monitors to screen students for symptoms in Marietta, Ga.: $640,000.
Protective gear and classroom cleaning equipment for a small district in
rural Michigan: $100,000. Disinfecting
[school](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html)
buildings and hiring extra nurses and educators in San Diego: $90
million.

As the White House, the [nation’s
pediatricians](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/us/coronavirus-schools-reopening-guidelines-aap.html)
and many worn-down, economically strapped parents push for school doors
to swing open this fall, local education officials say they are being
crushed by the costs of getting students and [teachers back in
classrooms
safely](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/us/virus-teachers-classrooms.html).

President
[Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html)
threatened this week to cut off federal funding to districts that do not
[reopen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html),
though he controls only a sliver of money for schools. But
administrators say they are already struggling to cover the
head-spinning logistical and financial challenges of retrofitting
buildings, adding staff members and protective gear, and providing
students with the academic and emotional support that many will need
after a traumatic disruption to their lives.

The federal relief package passed in March dedicated $13.5 billion to
K-12 education — less than 1 percent of the total stimulus. But
education groups estimate that schools will need many times that, and
with many local and state budgets already depleted by the economic
impact of the coronavirus, it is unclear where it will come from.

“If Congress doesn’t do something in the summer, there is going to be a
big mess,” said John Lee Evans, president of the San Diego Board of
Education.

Dr. Evans, a psychologist, said his district hoped to physically reopen
five days a week, starting Aug. 31, for families that want their
children to attend in-person classes. But it currently has the money to
do so safely for only half of the academic year, he said, and might need
to revert to online instruction after the winter holidays.

The district’s superintendent, Cindy Marten, has been calling colleagues
in political swing states, like Ohio and Colorado, to ask them to lobby
their senators to pass additional education funding. Democratic plans in
Congress call for between [$58
billion](https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2020/05/heroes-act-education-funding-house-passes.html)
and [$175
billion](https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CCCERA%20Fact%20Sheet%20062920.pdf)
for local schools, but those efforts lack significant Republican
support.

“It’s incredible to me that the federal government would see the
necessity of bailing out airlines and banks,” said Adam Goldstein, a
fifth-grade teacher in San Diego, “and not see the need to do something
similar for the public schools in this country.”

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has said he is

opening schools safely. “We can’t get back to normal if the kids are not
back in school,” [he said this
week](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/08/cdc-guidelines-school-reopenings-mitch-mcconnell-trump-differ/5399417002/).

Exactly how much money the nation’s [schools need to
reopen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/upshot/coronavirus-school-reopening-private-public-gap.html)
is a matter of debate, complicated by the conflicting, sometimes
shifting advice and guidelines that administrators have received from
government agencies and medical authorities.

In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [said that remote
learning](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html)
was the safest option, and that students in classrooms should remain six
feet apart “when feasible.” A six-foot requirement would mean that many
schools could accommodate half of their students or fewer at any given
time.

Given that, many systems [planned a hybrid
approach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html),
with students splitting their time between classrooms and remote
learning. On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said students
in the nation’s largest school district would most [likely attend only
one to three days per
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html)
if schools open in September.

The Trump administration has promoted an alternate set of guidelines
[from the American Academy of
Pediatrics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/us/coronavirus-schools-reopening-guidelines-aap.html)
that suggest three feet of physical distance may be sufficient in
classrooms if students wear masks.

Regardless of which recommendations are followed, [reopening
schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/magazine/schools-reopening-covid.html)
will require changes. An average-size district of 3,700 students can
expect $1.8 million in pandemic-related costs for 2020-21, representing
3 to 4 percent of a typical annual budget, according to an estimate from
AASA, the School Superintendents Association. Districts say they
typically operate on tight budgets, and even more so this year as state
and local tax revenues run low.

But some experts have suggested that much of what schools are planning
for the fall, such as checking students’ symptoms before they board
buses or enter schools, is unnecessary, akin to the type of “[security
theater](https://onezero.medium.com/the-public-is-being-misled-by-pandemic-technology-that-wont-keep-them-safe-1966ed740a87)”
Americans became accustomed to after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,
2001 — reassuring, but often providing only superficial protection.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That criticism is driven in part by emerging research suggesting that
children are not only [less likely to be infected by the
coronavirus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32546824/), but also [less
likely to transmit
it](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/05/22/peds.2020-004879)
to one another or to adults. Some school finance experts have also
suggested that districts need to make tougher choices, prioritizing core
educational functions.

Marguerite Roza, director of the [Edunomics
Lab](https://edunomicslab.org/) at Georgetown University, suggested that
schools could save money by holding core classes in large spaces like
auditoriums or gyms, allowing a single teacher to work with more
students while keeping everyone physically distanced.

Too few systems, Professor Roza said, were willing to delay planned pay
raises for teachers or furlough unneeded staff members. She also
suggested cutting programs like indoor sports and chorus, which may not
be safe this year because they spread respiratory droplets that can
transmit the
coronavirus.

In much of the country, such changes require consideration of teacher
contracts. Like many districts, San Diego is currently in tense
negotiations with its teachers’ union regarding return-to-work
conditions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A key demand of many unions is to protect the jobs of teachers who are
at high risk of serious illness if they contract the virus, or who live
with someone who is high risk. Many of those teachers prefer to continue
to work remotely. Nationwide, [more than a
quarter](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2020/2020142.pdf) of the public school
teaching force is over the age of 50.

Mr. Goldstein said he was eager to return to his fifth-grade classroom
in San Diego. But like many teachers across the country, he was not yet
convinced that his district had enough money, or the detailed plans in
place, to protect the health of employees and students, especially given
rising coronavirus caseloads [in
California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html)

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

He would feel more assured, he said, if teachers could be guaranteed
small class sizes — he had 35 students on his roster last year — and if
school staff and students could be regularly tested for the virus,
something the C.D.C. [said was
unnecessary](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-testing.html).

Administrators forging ahead with plans for full-time physical school,
even as the virus rages, may have been seized by a type of “wishful
thinking,” Mr. Goldstein added.

Ms. Marten, the San Diego superintendent, has the job of trying to
balance all of the competing needs and requirements to get students and
teachers back in classrooms.

Closing school buildings in the spring brought the district some savings
— lower utility bills and fuel costs for vehicles, for example — but did
not come close to covering the $30 million it took to transition to
remote learning, she said. The district took on a variety of expenses,
including meal distribution for low-income families and providing laptop
chargers and home internet connections for students who lacked them. It
also offered hazard pay to staff members who delivered those meals and
devices.

The district has not made significant program or staff cuts.

When schools shut down in Dundee, Mich., the rural district of 1,700
students an hour from Detroit did reallocate $350,000 intended for a new
athletics complex, according to the superintendent, Edward Manuszak. It
spent much of that money preserving jobs.

Mr. Manuszak said that one of his priorities was maintaining trust
between the district, its employees and the community during a difficult
time.

Superintendents in districts without collective bargaining have more
flexibility in how they staff their schools under pandemic conditions.
Teachers who work for Marietta City Schools in Georgia can ask to go on
leave if they are uncomfortable returning to physical classrooms, said
Grant Rivera, the superintendent. But they might not receive full pay
and will not have the opportunity to work from home, he said.

Dr. Rivera plans to staff the district’s remote learning program, which
will be an option for any family that chooses it, from among those
teachers who are willing to return to school and who have also
demonstrated skill in online instruction.

He faces a daunting to-do list as he prepares to reopen the school
system on Aug. 4. The district plans to spend $200,000 to install desk
partitions in classrooms where it will be impossible for students and
teachers to stay six feet apart. It will also distribute masks, which
will be required for teachers and students, and hire an employee to
assist with contact tracing.

To pay for it all, the superintendent is looking for philanthropic
support, lobbying his county for $2.9 million in additional funds and
also hoping for federal aid.

“You can see what they value,” he said of political leaders, “by what
they spend their money on.”
