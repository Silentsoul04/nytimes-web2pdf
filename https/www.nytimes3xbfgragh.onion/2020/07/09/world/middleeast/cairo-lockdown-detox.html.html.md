Three months of lockdown slowed its pulse, stripped its grit and exposed
a new side to a weary city. But without the noise, bustle and grind, was

CAIRO — If ever a city needed a good detox, it was Cairo.

Centuries of turbulent history, topped with recent decades of chaotic
urban development, have left the ancient metropolis in poor physical
shape. Its complexion is parched and blemished. Traffic clogs its
throbbing arteries. It has signs of major stress.

The coronavirus obliged. Three months of lockdown, including an 11-hour
nightly curfew, imposed a rejuvenating deep cleanse on Cairo. Roads once
choked with honking cars ran free. The air, free of fumes, seemed to
sparkle. Silence flooded the streets.

At my apartment near the Nile, a bedroom that was barely usable because
of the morning din became an oasis of calm. In the evenings, my family
gathered on the balcony to witness sunsets that were more saturated than
ever. The pollution app on my phone glowed an unfamiliar green.

Of course, it came at a jarring price. On dawn runs down deserted
streets, I passed anxious-looking people wearing masks, crowded around
the entrance to a hospital.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And then it was over.

Toward the end of June, the government announced it was allowing
mosques, restaurants and coffee houses to reopen. On the last night of
curfew, I scrambled into the streets to capture its delicate pleasures
one final time. Hundreds of Egyptians, it turned out, had the same idea.

They clustered at dusk on a bridge, watching the squadron of kites that
fluttered in the hot breeze shooting down the Nile. Young men in skinny
jeans tugged on strings. Veiled women chased after dating couples,
trying to sell them roses.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Inevitably, the fun tweaked Egypt’s rulers, always wary of unsanctioned
public gatherings. A senior lawmaker warned that the crowded skies posed
a threat to national security because Egypt’s enemies could fit the
kites with surveillance cameras.

But on the bridge, nobody cared for such talk, preferring to wallow in
this odd moment, between serenity and anxiety, when their city’s
famously frenetic pulse had been slowed by a virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I chatted with two brothers who held aloft a giant kite emblazoned with
photographs of themselves, preening, and the soccer star Mohamed Salah,
who was beaming. Nearby, Samiha Meneim, 62, perched on a rickety plastic
chair, surrounded by 15 family members as well as half-eaten platters of
koshary, Egypt’s national dish of spiced lentils, rice and
macaroni.

The picnic was a mercy dash after months cooped up in their cramped,
low-rent neighborhood. “We had to get out,” said Ms. Meneim, a retired
nurse in a black cloak who continued her treatment for breast cancer
throughout the lockdown.

She saw the coronavirus as a message from God. “He wants us to look at
life differently,” she said.

For much of Egypt’s history, its fate has been shaped by the Nile. The
bridge of kites led to Roda Island, described in “[One Thousand and One
Nights](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Thousand-and-One-Nights)”
as a place of heavenly gardens, now a tight sprawl of dust-smeared
apartment blocks. At its southern tip, though, there survives a
Nilometer built in the ninth century — a structure that measured the
river’s seasonal flooding and thus predicted the annual
harvest.

Now, disease was dictating the pace of life. As night fell and the
curfew officially began, I crossed into downtown Cairo, a jumble of old
palaces, crumbling elegance and gaudy shop fronts where, in normal
times, the traffic is so crazy that guidebooks offer tourists solemn
advice on how to survive.

“Look for locals and join a group,” advises my edition of National
Geographic Traveler. “They cross all together, one lane at a time.”

That night it would have taken a miracle to get knocked down. The strays
were in charge — skinny cats that strutted down empty boulevards, for
once unbothered, and a pair of lordly street dogs that snoozed atop an
SUV.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The Metro Cinema, with its dust-encrusted Art Deco facade, opened in
1940 with “Gone With the Wind.” Now it had the eerie air of an abandoned
film set, advertising the Egyptian movies it had been showing in March:
“Peep Show,” and “The Thief of Baghdad.”

In the late 19th century, Egypt’s ruler, Khedive Ismail, modeled this
area on the airy elegance of Haussmann’s Paris, but for decades the
graceful buildings have gradually crumbled into disrepair. Now, in the
desolation of curfew, they seemed to stand proud again, as did the
statues lining the
way.

The giant bronze lions that guard Qasr el Nil, the city’s most scenic
bridge, looked more relaxed than ever with no foe in sight.

The mix of eerie desolation and faded splendor had a touch of magic, and
for an instant I thought of [the Egyptian version of the movie “Night at
the Museum,”](https://youtu.be/_CaAODL1XjM?t=5602) in which the bronze
lions come to life under darkness.

But I was not entirely alone.

Teenagers clustered conspiratorially in doorways. Food-delivery riders
clustered around their motorcycles outside a restaurant. Business was
brisk.

“If it keeps going like this,” remarked Mahmoud Abdel Fattah, leaning
over his handlebars, “I’ll be as rich as Naguib Sawiris” — an outspoken
billionaire who has been a vociferous critic of the lockdown measures.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, Mr. Fattah noted wryly that, at 28 cents per delivery, that
fortune could take a while. “Maybe after one million pizzas,” he
quipped.

For all their ebullience, the deliverymen also had a downbeat air. Sure,
they could zoom to any address in minutes. But Cairo without the grit,
the grind, the bustle of people — was it really Cairo at
all?

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Plagues are nothing new in Cairo. On a visit to Cairo in the 14th
century, when the city’s 500,000 inhabitants made it the world’s largest
city outside China, the explorer Ibn Battuta noted that an outbreak of
the bubonic plague was killing as many as 20,000 people a day. Cholera
hit repeatedly in the 19th century.

This time, the human cost is amplified by Egypt’s soaring population,
which in February crossed [the 100 million
threshold](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/11/world/middleeast/egypt-population-100-million.html),
an unnerving milestone in a densely packed country.

Outside the city center, the lockdown has been loosely observed — social
distancing is little more than an admirable idea in the city’s cramped
slums.

Many Egyptians wear masks over their chins or spurn them entirely, much
to the chagrin of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a fitness enthusiast
who has urged Egyptians to stay safe, keep fit and lose weight during
the lockdown. “Remember to do sport, it increases immunity levels,” he
said in May.

Otherwise, it has been business as usual for Mr. el-Sisi during the
lockdown — with the arrest of rights activists, belly dancers and even
young women who post dance videos to social media. The virus, though,
cannot be banished so easily.

Egypt has [over 77,000 known
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html),
and confirmed infections have grown by about 1,400 cases a day for the
past month. Egypt has registered more than 3,400 deaths, the highest
toll in the Arab world. In an ominous portent, Mr. el-Sisi last week
[opened a 4,000-bed field
hospital](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/373091/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-Sisi-tours-Armed-Forces-medical-isolation-f.aspx)
to treat coronavirus patients.

And the economic toll is only now becoming apparent. Millions of workers
have lost income, and families are cutting back on meat and other items
that are now unaffordable. The International Monetary Fund has lent $8
billion to get Egypt through the crisis. More may be needed.

The day after the lockdown was lifted, I walked the same route again.
The sense of magic had evaporated.

Police officers patrolled the bridge where the kites had flown. The
familiar rumble of traffic snarled the downtown, where some restaurants
had opened. But others remained shut — it’s not worth it yet, the
manager of Abou Tarek, the city’s most celebrated koshary emporium, told
me<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>— and there was talk that
some restrictions could become permanent.

Rules obliging restaurants and coffee houses to shut at 10 p.m. will
remain after the virus, a cabinet spokesman said — an announcement that
was consistent with Mr. el-Sisi’s desire to “civilize” Egyptians, but
that met with muted indignation in a city famous for its vibrant
all-night socializing.

Egyptian rulers have announced similar detox measures in the past, only
to quickly backtrack in the face of popular resistance. For now, what’s
certain is that Cairenes are staying home, caught between their desire
to get back to normal and their fear of what may be coming next — much
like everywhere else.
