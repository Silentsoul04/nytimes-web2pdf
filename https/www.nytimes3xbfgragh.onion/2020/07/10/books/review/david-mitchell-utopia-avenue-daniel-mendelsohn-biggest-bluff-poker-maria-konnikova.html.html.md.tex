On the cover of this week's Book Review, Daniel Mendelsohn writes at
length about not just
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/books/review/utopia-avenue-david-mitchell.html}{David
Mitchell's new novel, ``Utopia Avenue,''} but the entire career of the
author of ``Ghostwritten,'' ``Cloud Atlas'' and other books. On the
podcast, Mendelsohn discusses Mitchell and his work, and some larger
ideas about the nature of a literary career.

``For most writers, and I'm sure myself included, there comes a point at
which you've said what you have to say,'' Mendelsohn says. ``And that
doesn't mean you're going to stop writing, it just means you're not
expanding anymore. And you can handle that in different ways. One way is
to be content with doing the thing that you know you can do. And another
way is to sort of flail, and try to do more extravagant gestures in
order to feel that you're still being creative. I don't think there are
that many people probably in the history of literature who have managed
to keep growing until they drop dead.''

Maria Konnikova visits the podcast to talk about her new book,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/books/review/maria-konnikova-the-biggest-bluff.html}{``The
Biggest Bluff,''} in which she recounts her unlikely entry into --- and
then success in --- the world of high-stakes poker, and what the game
can tell us about our emotional relationship to risk.

``At the beginning I was losing a lot of money --- finding everything
very overwhelming --- and at the lowest stakes, poker is not necessarily
the most welcoming world for women, so I was experiencing a lot of
negativity, a lot of sexism, it wasn't particularly pleasant,''
Konnikova says. ``But the more I learned about the game, the more I
discovered how fascinating it was, and how good it was at teaching me
the skills that I'd been wanting to learn forever: how to teach me
better decision-making, how to teach me to be in better control of my
emotions. It taught me a lot about myself --- about the kind of person I
am, the kind of person I \emph{can} be, and it gave me the skills to
reach for that person. And as I started discovering that, I started
falling in love with the game.''

Also on this week's episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the
publishing world; and Gregory Cowles and John Williams talk about what
people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
