# After Trump’s Supreme Court Loss, D.A. Moves Closer to Getting Tax Records

A lower-court judge swiftly scheduled a hearing for next week on the
Manhattan prosecutor’s demand to see President Trump’s financial
records.

A day after winning a Supreme Court victory over President
[Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/nyregion/cy-vance-manhattan-da-trump.html),
the Manhattan district attorney moved one step closer to obtaining some
of the president’s financial records when a lower-court judge acted
quickly to hear any final arguments from the president’s lawyers.

The federal judge in Manhattan who first presided over the dispute
issued an order on Friday asking the lawyers and the district attorney,
[Cyrus R. Vance
Jr](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/nyregion/cy-vance-manhattan-da-trump.html).,
to inform him as to whether any further action was needed in light of
the Supreme Court’s ruling.

The judge, Victor Marrero, has scheduled a hearing for Thursday, when
the president’s lawyers are expected to continue to fight against
turning over the records to Mr. Vance.

The order came sooner than expected and seemed to signal that the judge
would move swiftly to try to resolve the matter. For nearly a year, Mr.
Vance, a Democrat, has been locked in a legal battle with the president
over access to the records.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last August, Mr. Vance’s office [subpoenaed Mr. Trump’s accounting firm
for tax
records](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html)
in connection with an investigation into [hush money
paid](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/01/nyregion/trump-cohen-stormy-daniels-vance.html)
to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress who said she had an affair with
Mr. Trump, an allegation he has denied. The office asked for returns and
other financial records dating to 2011.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump sued to block the grand jury subpoena, saying that
the president was immune from state criminal inquiries while in office,
an argument that had never been tested in court. They said local
investigations could distract the president from his duties and that Mr.
Vance was motivated by political considerations.

The case made its way to the Supreme Court, and on Thursday, the court
ruled, 7 to 2, against the president. [Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
wrote](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-635_o7jq.pdf) that
“no citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common
duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal
proceeding.”

Chief Justice Roberts added, however, that Mr. Trump could still raise
objections in court to the scope and relevance of the subpoena,
potentially setting up hearings before Judge Marrero that could take
weeks or longer.

After the ruling was announced, the White House press secretary,
Kayleigh McEnany, said in a statement that further proceedings were
required in the lower court in which Mr. Trump could “raise additional
arguments, including constitutional protections, against this frivolous
and politically motivated subpoena.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokesman for Mr. Vance declined to comment on Judge Marrero’s order.

Even if Judge Marrero allows Mr. Vance’s office to obtain some or all of
the president’s records, the documents would not soon — and might never
— become public. As part of a secret grand jury investigation, they
would remain sealed unless an indictment were handed up and they were
introduced as evidence at a hearing or trial.

The president’s former lawyer and fixer, [Michael D.
Cohen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/nyregion/michael-cohen-donald-trump-prison.html),
paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence [during the 2016
presidential
campaign](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/01/nyregion/trump-cohen-stormy-daniels-vance.html)
and later pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges for his
role in that deal and another hush-money payment.

Mr. Cohen, who is serving a three-year sentence at a federal prison in
Otisville, N.Y., implicated the president, saying in court that he had
acted on Mr. Trump’s orders.

After federal prosecutors concluded their investigation last year, Mr.
Vance’s office began examining whether New York State laws were broken
when Mr. Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Mr.
Cohen.

Initially, Mr. Vance’s investigation focused on whether senior
executives at the company falsely accounted for the reimbursement as a
legal expense to cover up the nature of the payment, according to people
briefed on the matter. In New York, falsifying a business record can be
a crime.

The state prosecutors did some initial digging, interviewing Mr. Cohen
in prison, empaneling a grand jury to investigate and subpoenaing
records from the Trump Organization and from potential witnesses.

But the investigation slowed while Mr. Vance’s office awaited the
Supreme Court’s ruling on whether prosecutors could examine Mr. Trump’s
financial records, the people briefed on the matter said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If the office gains access to Mr. Trump’s taxes, the investigation could
broaden beyond the possible falsification of records to include other
potential financial crimes, one of the people added.

Little has been said publicly about the scope of Mr. Vance’s grand jury
investigation. Late last year, in defending the subpoena before Judge
Marrero, Mr. Vance’s office outlined the inquiry on two pages in a
larger public court filing, but that section was redacted in its
entirety.

The legal deadline has expired for bringing a misdemeanor charge of
filing false business records. The office can bring a felony charge
until about early 2022, five years after the Trump Organization
reimbursed Mr. Cohen.

To prove a felony charge of falsifying records, Mr. Vance’s office would
need to show not just that the records were falsified, but that it was
done with the intent to defraud and to commit, or to conceal, another
crime.

Toward that end, investigators could focus on possible tax crimes or on
whether false information was provided to one of the Trump
Organization’s banks.

Judge Marrero’s brief order on Friday offered no indication of how he
might rule on final attempts by Mr. Trump to narrow or block the
subpoena.

Last October, in a 75-page opinion, [Judge Marrero rejected the
president’s
argument](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/07/nyregion/trump-taxes-lawsuit-vance.html)
that he was immune from investigation, calling it “repugnant to the
nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A month later, after Mr. Trump appealed, [a federal appeals panel
unanimously affirmed Judge Marrero’s
rulin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/04/nyregion/trump-taxes-vance-appeal.html)g,
saying that the president’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, had to comply
with the
subpoena.
