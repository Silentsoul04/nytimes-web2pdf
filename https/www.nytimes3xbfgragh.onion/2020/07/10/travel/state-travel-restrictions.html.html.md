*This list will be updated as states continue to announce changes to
their travel advisories. Are we missing an update? Email us at*
[*travelrestrictions@NYTimes.com*](mailto:travelrestrictions@NYTimes.com)*.*

In the United States, [gas prices are
down](https://gasprices.aaa.com/national-average-decreases-as-gas-demand-remains-low/)
while the number of coronavirus cases are up, making the decision of how
to vacation during this unprecedented summer a complex one. Meanwhile,
state restrictions on travelers are constantly evolving, with some
requiring mandatory testing and others imposing [quarantine
requirements](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that [travel
increases a person’s chance of getting and spreading the
virus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftravelers%2Ftravel-in-the-us.html).
“Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from
Covid-19,” the federal agency cautions.

For those who do take a trip, the C.D.C. notes that each mode of
transportation has its own risks, and offers a series of recommendations
for safety: that people wear a face mask in public, wash hands
frequently, avoid touching their face, keep six feet from others, cover
coughs and sneezes, and use drive-through service and curbside pickup at
restaurants and stores.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Here is a summary of current restrictions in the United States for
leisure travelers, although some requirements do not apply to those
spending less than a day in the state. Many states also have exemptions
for essential workers who are on the job, including health care workers,
members of the military and others, but even [they are subject to some
restrictions](https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/covid-19-essential-workers-in-the-states.aspx).

With the number of coronavirus cases surging across the country, check
the areas you plan to visit before you travel. Some municipalities or
counties may have more stringent regulations than issued by their state.

### [Alabama](https://alabama.travel/my-trip/staying-safe)

As of Aug. 19, there were no statewide restrictions in Alabama.

### [Alaska](https://covid19.alaska.gov/travelers/)

All nonresidents must upload proof of a negative or pending virus test
taken within 72 hours before departure to [an online travel
portal](https://www.alaska.covidsecureapp.com/), where they can also
submit a travel declaration and self-isolation plan. The state requests
a second test be done seven to 14 days after arriving in Alaska.

Visitors arriving without a previously taken test can get one for $250,
and must quarantine while awaiting results at their own cost. Testing is
free for Alaska residents, who also have the option of a two-week
quarantine instead of a test.

### [Arizona](https://tourism.az.gov/covid-19-updates-2/)

As of Aug. 19, there were no statewide restrictions in Arizona.

### [Arkansas](https://www.arkansas.com/travel-advisory/covid-19)

As of Aug. 19, there were no statewide restrictions in
Arkansas.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### [California](https://www.visitcalifornia.com/latest-covid-19-coronavirus)

As of Aug. 19, there were no statewide restrictions in
California.

### [Colorado](https://covid19.colorado.gov/prepare-protect-yourself/prevent-the-spread/travel)

As of Aug. 19, there were no statewide restrictions in
Colorado.

### [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/Covid-19-Knowledge-Base/Travel-In-or-Out-of-CT)

With rare exception, those coming into Connecticut after more than 24
hours in a state or area with a high rate of confirmed infections must
self-quarantine for 14 days from their last contact with the affected
state.

The states currently affected by the order are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. Visitors or residents
returning from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands face the same
restrictions.

Someone whose home state is added to the list after they are already
vacationing in Connecticut is asked to quarantine, but isn’t required
to. People under self-quarantine may leave for medical visits, to obtain
medication or to shop for groceries. A person who cannot quarantine
because they are coming in for a funeral, for instance, may show proof
of negative results for a coronavirus test taken in the previous 72
hours. Those who have been tested but have not received the results are
required to quarantine until negative results are received and submitted
to the
state.

        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

### [Vermont](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/traveling-vermont)

Visitors from counties in select states that have similar active
coronavirus rates to Vermont and who travel in a private vehicle do not
have to quarantine. The same is true for Vermont residents who visit

are in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

Most other travelers need to self-quarantine upon arrival in Vermont,
but the state gives them a few options. People may self-quarantine out
of state before traveling to Vermont as long as their trip is in a
private vehicle and they make only necessary stops, while wearing a face
mask, social distancing and washing their hands frequently. Those opting
to self-quarantine before their visit to Vermont can either do it for 14
days, or they can shorten it to seven days if they then get a negative
test result.

Those arriving by public transportation or a longer car ride must
self-quarantine for 14 days, or for seven days followed by a negative
test.
