# Auctions Are Crimped as the Pandemic Forces Them Online

</div>

As sellers look to shed valuable items and buyers look to collect them
on the cheap, auction houses are learning to adapt with virtual events.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Just about every area of personal finance has been affected by the
coronavirus pandemic. That economic shock reaches all the way to some of
the most aspirational purchases on the planet: art, cars, watches and
wine.

The mechanism to buy and sell many of these objects — frothy, in-person
auctions, with attendees dressed smartly and cocktails readily available
— has been rendered untenable since March because of social-distancing
measures meant to stop the spread of the virus.

But the desire remains, with sellers looking to shed valuable items to
shore up their own balance sheets, and buyers who have reserves looking
to collect on the cheap.

To meet that demand, the rarefied world of the auction house has been
forced online.

The electricity you feel in a room, as the bidding heats up and prices
soar, is gone. But auction houses are working to make sure selling their
high-ticket objects doesn’t devolve into an eBay frenzy, where wealthy
buyers are sitting around in their pajamas stalking deals on their
laptops.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To counteract that down-market feel, auction houses have become
creative. Sotheby’s, for one, built a platform for its online-only
auctions that prevents people from entering a bid just as the time is
about to expire, a strategy known as sniping.

“If someone snipes at the last minute, the sale extends for another five
minutes,” said Richard Lopez, head of online sales and a senior watch
specialist at Sotheby’s.

On Friday, Christie’s live-streamed a “[global 20th century art
sale](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/arts/design/christies-auction.html)”
across four cities: Hong Kong, Paris, London and New York.

Auctions tend to be seasonal, and many are smaller now that they are
online. Several annual California car auctions next month in Pebble
Beach and Monterrey are planning to present half the number of cars
online that they did in in-person auctions last year. But because
sellers may need cash, there may also be more deals for people with
money to invest in these illiquid assets.

Bidding and buying will require greater due diligence ahead of the
auction, because items will be difficult to see, feel and assess.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The pandemic has caused people who under normal circumstances have
shied away from the internet to increase their interest in buying
online,” said David Sleeman, executive director of the Winston Art
Group, an appraisal firm. But that means those new online buyers need
“to research the sellers’ reputation and feel a level of trust that
they’re going to be on the up and
up.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sotheby’s contemporary art sale, held online at the end of June, was
[the first big test of virtual
auctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/arts/design/sothebys-online-auction.html).
In-person viewing was limited by New York’s reopening guidelines.

Some major pieces of art still sold for top dollar. A Francis Bacon
triptych [sold for nearly $85
million](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/arts/design/sothebys-online-auction-francis-bacon.html),
above its estimate. A Jean-Michel Basquiat drawing went for $15 million,
which was $3 million more than the high estimate.

But some of the other featured paintings, including one by Roy
Lichtenstein and another by Clyfford Still, fetched prices in the middle
of their ranges.

“We’ve been lucky at Sotheby’s because with our online platform, we’ve
been able to switch over with the same level of trust,” Mr. Lopez said.
(When asked what was lost online, he responded without hesitation: “The
fun.”)

Still, the push to move auctions online has its risks.
[Stories](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/04/arts/design/art-dealer-pleads-guilty-fraud-case.html?searchResultPosition=1)
abound of buyers being duped by [high-end

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Acquiring real estate, a business — there would be a lot of due
diligence,” Mr. Sleeman said. “But oftentimes when a collector is
considering making a purchase of an equally expensive painting, they
don’t do the same due diligence.”

On the positive side, moving big purchases online could drive greater
advance research, Mr. Sleeman said. Some art fairs are requiring dealers
to publish their prices online, he said, adding a level of transparency
that wasn’t there, or at least not as easily accessible, before the
pandemic.

### Cars

Part of the thrill of buying a collectible car is strolling among scores
of polished, perfect automobiles. Once they leave the auction grounds,
most of these cars will be parked in climate-controlled garages,
shielded from the sun-dappled fields where they are shown, driven and
coveted.

Next month would normally send some of the world’s most expensive cars
to the Monterrey Peninsula for the annual [Pebble Beach Concours
d’Elegance](https://pebblebeachconcours.net/), where rare automobiles
are parked for a day on the 18th fairway at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

That’s not happening this year. Both Gooding & Company and Bonhams, two
auction houses with large automotive departments, will present about
half the cars they would have in a live auction, and rely on video and
limited in-person viewing to drum up interest. Both houses are upbeat
about the online demand.

“People are getting in touch with things that make them happy and that
they love,” said David Gooding, president of his namesake company. “If
they’re passionate about cars, they’re tapping into that passion. We’re
seeing demand and interest as strong as ever.”

There is far less ambivalence now than ahead of a typical live auction.
Sellers really want to sell their cars, and buyers are focused on
getting the car they want. A few cars are priced in excess of $2
million, but many are in the $50,000-to-$100,000 range, he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To assure the cars’ condition, the auction house is maintaining them in
a Los Angeles warehouse. “It’s critical for us to know what we’re
selling and representing,” Mr. Gooding said.

Bonhams is similarly storing its cars, splitting them between Los
Angeles and Bedford, N.Y., where specialists can arrange virtual or
in-person viewings before the August
sale.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events

Some of the highest-priced cars may be the easiest to sell at an online
auction, said Jakob Greisen, head of Bonhams’ U.S. motoring department.
The sale’s signature car is a 1934 Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 Cabriolet by
Figoni, estimated to sell for as much as $7.5 million.

“Few people are going to walk in and say, ‘I’ll have that 90-year-old
car I’ve never heard about,’” Mr. Greisen said. “It’s for a really
sophisticated buyer who has had more time to think about their hobby and
their passion.”

Where he thinks sales could struggle is in what he termed the
impulse-buy range — around $250,000 — because people will not be walking
around and getting excited by a car that they realize they can
afford.

What’s expensive is always relative. A $28,000 Rolex is inexpensive
compared with a $7.5 million car, but there is one model from the iconic
watchmaker that has had a star turn during the pandemic: the Rolex
Daytona with a ceramic bezel.

The watch has a retail price of $13,000 but has been selling for $20,000
to $30,000 in online auctions. Sotheby’s recently sold one for $28,000.
“You can buy it retail, but the wait list is two to three years,” Mr.
Lopez said.

Watches lend themselves to the online scrolling so many of us have been
doing to pass the time. And that has pushed Sotheby’s watch department
to move to weekly and monthly auctions, scrapping its previous format of
semiannual New York auctions.

“We were getting a lot of consignors who wanted the cash for doomsday,
and collectors who were willing to purchase because they were home and
bored,” Mr. Lopez said. “We couldn’t get them to go with the traditional
timeline for the bigger auctions.”

Data on who is buying what from where has allowed the auction house to
further refine and target the watch
auctions.

Fine wine can sit in a bottle for decades and, potentially, get better.
But the primary mechanism for selling first-growth wine from Bordeaux,
France — the most reliably collectible region in the wine world — is to
sell wine futures a few months after the wine is put into a barrel.
Futures, the prices for wine that won’t arrive in buyers’ cellars for
several years, have traditionally been set by working with wine brokers
through a marketplace called the Place du Bordeaux.

This year, the process of tasting young wines to divine which ones will
age well was disrupted because no one could travel to Bordeaux to sample
the 2019 vintage. To sell the wine, which is considered a top vintage,
Bordeaux producers are discounting it heavily, said Tom Gearing, chief
executive and a co-founder of Cult Wines, which manages about $165
million of investment-grade wine.

“With the uncertain economy, people are in the position to ask, ‘Do I
really want to shell out money for a wine I won’t have physically for
two years?’” he said.

To encourage buyers, producers, even among the top five Bordeaux houses
like Rothschild and Margaux, have discounted this vintage as much as 25
percent from the 2018 vintage (which is considered not as good). As with
all of these passion investments, fine wine is a deal only if you are
among the lucky few who have weathered the economic crisis with
disposable income and confidence in the future.
