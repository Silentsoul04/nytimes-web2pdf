# In Texas Beach City, Out-of-Towners Drove In an Outbreak

A month ago, Corpus Christi had hardly any cases of coronavirus and
business was booming. Now it is struggling to contain one of the state’s
fastest growing outbreaks. What happened?

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — As recently as early June, days went by with
hardly anyone testing positive for the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/us/coronavirus-family-houston-masks.html).
A single case one day. Three the next. Then zero. Zero. Zero.

Word spread that Corpus Christi, always a popular beachfront vacation
spot for Texans from around the state, was a safe place to go. They
didn’t even require masks indoors. It was an oasis from the virus.

“People in San Antonio, in Houston, Austin, even Dallas, knew that we
had low caseload,” said Peter Zanoni, the city manager. “It was a nice
getaway from the rules, the regulations, the doom and gloom.”

It turned out that no place was safe.

Now the city of 325,000 has one of the [fastest-growing outbreaks in
Texas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html),
a state where new records for positive cases were set for four straight
days last week, with nearly 11,000 recorded on Thursday. Corpus Christi
has seen more cases per capita than Houston and a rapidly mounting death
toll: of the 38 deaths recorded from the pandemic, 30 have come in July,
including a baby less than 6 months old.

Local officials have been left scrambling to get ahead of an outbreak
that went into overdrive without warning. As recently as June 15, the
city had tallied 360 cases during the entirety of the outbreak; on
Wednesday alone, there were 445.

The city’s two dozen contact tracers are so overwhelmed that they are no
longer able to seek detailed information about each new infection.
Hospital beds have filled at an alarming rate, prompting pleas for
additional staffing.

The surge in cases forced local leaders, businesses and residents to
grapple with the uncomfortable reality that the same out-of-towners who
help the city thrive economically may have caused the outbreak. The
feeling is less one of resentment than of frustration at a seemingly
impossible dilemma.

The speed of the spread is what struck researchers. Other vacation
destinations have seen a rising number of cases, but the increase in
Corpus Christi outstripped even much larger major urban centers, said
Dr. Christopher Bird, a professor at Texas A\&M-Corpus Christi.

“The part that’s different here is just how fast we rose in the number
of cases and how fast it spread,” said Dr. Bird, who has been modeling
the outbreak for officials.

The reason for the rapid spread in Corpus Christi is not certain. Data
gathered from cellphones indicated that movement around the city
returned to pre-pandemic levels by early June, especially at
restaurants. “When I saw that, I knew it wasn’t a good sign,” Dr. Bird
said.

Many pointed at the visitors from big cities.

“I think they should stay home,” said Jasmine Rodriguez, 24, a security
guard at a La Michoacana grocery store. “There should be checkpoints and
a mandatory stay-in-your-city.”

But some locals said they had no one but themselves to blame. People
went to bars. They partied. They did not social distance or wear masks.
The city did not require masks in most retail stores until last week,
days before a statewide
order.

“It’s us. Yeah, it’s us,” said Marilyn McCaleb, 62, speaking through a
flower-print mask as she went grocery shopping at a local H-E-B store.
“They don’t wear their masks — maybe they do now, because they have
to.”

Whatever the reason, the virus was almost nowhere, and then, seemingly
overnight, it was everywhere. Bars. Restaurants. Graduation
celebrations. A draft party for a local baseball player picked up by a
major league team. A chance encounter on the beach.

“I know because they would say to the contact tracers, oh, I was at the
beach and some girls from San Antonio told us at the end of the night
that they had Covid,” said Annette Rodriguez, the public health director
for Corpus Christi and the surrounding county. “And we shared a bottle.”

The county attorney tested positive, as did many city workers. At one
point, 10 percent of the firefighters in the city were out sick or
quarantining because of possible exposure. At City Hall, staffers who
were back in the office after months of working from home in the spring
were told to return to remote work. Officials instituted a beach curfew
and barred cars from the sands over the July 4 holiday.

The contrast with even a few weeks ago could not be more stark.

At first, city officials had been able to jump on and contain what few
small outbreaks there were: at a meat processing plant, or a halfway
house. Officials tested aggressively and got those who were exposed to
isolate. They felt confident in their approach.

Corpus Christi is a politically split and culturally mixed town, with a
Democratic county leader, a conservative mayor and a population that is
majority Hispanic.

“It’s not even purple. It’s more like lavender,” said Barbara Canales,
the top executive for Nueces County, which includes Corpus Christi.
“We’re much more interested in our own backyard than in the national
scene.”

Last month, the city stood out as an example of a place that had
suffered economically from pandemic-related shutdowns — with
unemployment at nearly 16 percent in early June — without actually
experiencing much of a viral outbreak at all. Few residents knew anyone
who had gotten sick.

Not only was tourism devastated, but another major industry in the city
— its massive port for oil and gas exports — suffered from declining
demand and plunging oil prices.

Then, as Texas reopened beginning on May 1, Texans began flocking to
Corpus. It started on Memorial Day weekend and did not stop for
weeks.

“The entire city was completely sold out. Every hotel. Every short-term
rental,” said Brett Oetting, the head of the Corpus Christi tourism
bureau. “What happened during the entire month of June: every weekend
was a Memorial Day weekend.”

Hotels, restaurants and bars that had been starved for life surged back.
But some business owners grew wary of the number of people suddenly
flooding into
town.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“It was horrible — it was so busy,” said Brigitte Kazenmayer, 59, the
owner of the popular breakfast spot JB’s German Bakery & Cafe. “People
didn’t wear masks. They didn’t understand the six feet.”

Ms. Kazenmayer, who immigrated from Germany and fell in love with Corpus
Christi, said that in June the lines would snake out the door and across
the parking lot. “They came from Houston, Austin, San Antonio — and I
think, why are you here? You bring it here\!” she said of the virus.
“But they like the beach. That’s why I’m here, too.”

The Bait Bucket, a cinder-block box of a store painted bright yellow,
saw so many customers in June that they had to add a second sales person
to deal with the crowds, said Miriam Longoria, 21, who worked behind the
counter.

The store attracts both locals and tourists, and people kept coming, she
said, even after the governor ordered bars to close in late June and
other places in town began slowing down.

“This is the one thing you can do, is fish,” said Jeff Soward, 56,
holding up a white plastic bag of dead shrimp he had just bought inside.
He said he knew several people who had been infected: a 72-year-old
business partner in Mexico; the children of several friends; his
daughter’s boyfriend in Dallas.

“The kids I know that got it, they’re fine,” he observed.

But dealing with the outbreak has strained medical resources in a city
where officials said nearly one in five residents does not have health
insurance. Hospitals have stopped performing elective surgeries and are
paying overtime to keep up.

“The coast is not clear,” Ms. Canales said during a daily news briefing
this week. “It is not clear to come to at this
time.”

Still, people come, albeit in smaller numbers. The beaches are open. And
the surf is inviting.

But now it is the visitors from other parts of Texas who are wary of
being around people in Corpus Christi.

At an R.V. campsite just a few steps from the beach, Billy Arocha, 34,
prepared to grill as his three children played in a sprinkler. Mr.
Arocha, from outside San Antonio, said he had considered canceling the
trip when he saw the cases exploding in Corpus Christi. “I’m scared,” he
said, adding an expletive for emphasis.

When they were planning their stay, Mr. Arocha said he considered going
out to eat in a restaurant, “but not anymore.” He said he was not
talking to anyone in town and only going to the beach when it was
uncrowded.

The vacation had been meant as a much-needed break, and a way to
celebrate his wife’s birthday. But the mood had darkened over their
festivities.

“We just got a call that her aunt is close to dying from the
coronavirus,” he said. “That virus is something else.”
