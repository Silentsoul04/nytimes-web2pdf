If you’re lucky enough to live in New Zealand, the coronavirus nightmare
has been mostly over since June. After more than two weeks with no new
cases, the government lifted almost all restrictions that month. The
borders are still shut, but inside the country, normal life returned.

It’s coming back elsewhere too. Taiwan, where most days this month no
new cases have been reported, just held the [Taipei Film
Festival](https://www.startribune.com/asia-today-no-masks-on-red-carpet-as-taiwan-logs-few-cases/571731572/),
and a recent baseball game drew 10,000 spectators. Italy was once the
epicenter of Europe’s outbreak and remains in a state of emergency, but
with just a [few hundred new cases a
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-cases.html)
in the whole country, bars are open and tourists have started returning,
though of course Americans remain banned. According to The New York
Times’s figures, there were 321 new cases in all of Canada last Friday.

And America? We had 68,241. [As of last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/briefing/arizona-mary-trump-facebook-your-wednesday-briefing.html),
the worst per capita outbreak on the planet was in Arizona, followed by
Florida. [The world is closed to
us](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/travel/american-travelers-restrictions-coronavirus.html);
American passports were once coveted, but now only a few dozen nations
will let us in. Lawrence O. Gostin, professor of global health law at
Georgetown, told me he doesn’t expect American life to feel truly normal
before summer 2022. Two years of our lives, stolen by Donald Trump.

As our country plunges into a black hole of unchecked illness, death and
pariahdom, the administration is waging a PR war on its own top disease
expert, Anthony Fauci, trying to convince news outlets that he can’t be
trusted. “The move to treat Dr. Fauci as if he were a warring political
rival comes as he has grown increasingly vocal in his concerns about the
[national surge in coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),”
[reported The
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/12/world/coronavirus-updates.html#_blank).

Trump has also undercut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
retweeting the conspiratorial ramblings of the former [game show host
Chuck
Woolery](https://twitter.com/chuckwoolery/status/1282499347117215745?s=20):
“The most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid-19. Everyone is
lying. The C.D.C., media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that
we are told to trust.” There are now so many stories of [Trump fans
dying](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8515535/Ohio-man-37-dies-coronavirus-claiming-pandemic-just-hype-Facebook-post.html)
after blithely exposing themselves to the virus that they’ve become a
macabre cliché.

Gostin was part of the international panel that put together the [Global
Health Security Index](https://www.ghsindex.org/), a report, released
last year, that evaluated the pandemic readiness of every nation on
earth. No country, they found, was as prepared as the United States. But
the coronavirus, he said, has shown us that “health system capacity
alone is almost useless unless you have a government that can unleash
that capacity promptly and consistently.”

America has long fancied itself a swaggering colossus. It will likely
emerge from this calamity humbled and decrepit.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Not all experts are as pessimistic as Gostin. Andy Slavitt, a senior
health official in the Obama administration, [has
argued](https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1282465694664273922?s=20)
that with better tests, therapies and an eventual vaccine, life could
broadly improve as soon as next year.

Others caution against making predictions. “We want to be able to give
some assurance of, ‘Life will not always be this way, and it will be
over soon,’ but we don’t know when that will be,” said Nicolette
Louissaint, president of Healthcare Ready, an organization established
after Hurricane Katrina to strengthen the health care supply chain for
disasters.

But we know that the C.D.C. forecasts total deaths from Covid-19 [to
rise to as
many](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)as
160,000 just by the end of the month. Many times that number will have
long-term medical complications, and a record [5.4 million people lost
their health
insurance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/world/coronavirus-updates.html#link-4a45abca)
between February and May. A generation of American kids will have their
educations derailed, and many parents who don’t lose their jobs due to
the economic crisis will see their [careers
ruined](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/07/working-parents-careers-school-childcare/613936/)
by the demands of child care.

The country’s international humiliation is total; historians may argue
about when the American century began, but I doubt they’ll disagree
about when it ended.

The psychological consequences alone will be incalculable. Even before
the coronavirus, researchers spoke of loneliness as its own epidemic in
America. A [March
article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2762469?guestAccessKey=b70282f9-d0c1-43f8-ba38-18a2b6831cc7&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=030420)in
the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry attributed 162,000 deaths a year to
the fallout of social isolation. Now people are being told that they can
socialize only under the most stringent conditions. Much of what makes
life sweet is lost to us, not for days or weeks, but months or years.

“We’re going to stagger out of it; we’re not going to snap back,” Gostin
said of the pandemic. He added, “It’s going to take several years for us
to be able to come out of all of the trauma that we’ve had.”

Yet somehow there’s no drumbeat of calls for the president’s
resignation. People seem to feel too helpless. Protesters can make
demands of governors and mayors, especially Democratic ones, because at
the local level small-d democratic accountability still exists.
Nationally such responsiveness is gone; no one expects the president to
do his job, or to be held to account when he doesn’t. That’s how you
know the country was broken before coronavirus ever arrived.
