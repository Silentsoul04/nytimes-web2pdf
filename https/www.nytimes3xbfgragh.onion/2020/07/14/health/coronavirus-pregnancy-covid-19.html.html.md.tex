Researchers said the case strongly suggests that Covid-19 can be
transmitted in utero. Both the mother and baby have recovered.

Researchers on Tuesday reported strong evidence that the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/health/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html}{coronavirus}
can be transmitted
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17436-6}{from a
pregnant woman to a fetus}.

A baby born in a Paris hospital in March to a mother with Covid-19
tested positive for the virus and developed symptoms of inflammation in
his brain, said Dr. Daniele De Luca, who led the research team and is
chief of the division of pediatrics and neonatal critical care at
Paris-Saclay University Hospitals. The baby, now more than 3 months old,
recovered without treatment and is ``very much improved, almost
clinically normal,'' Dr. De Luca said, adding that the mother, who
needed oxygen during the delivery, is healthy.

Dr. De Luca said the virus appeared to have been transmitted through the
placenta of the 23-year-old mother.

Since the pandemic began, there have been isolated cases of newborns who
have tested positive for the coronavirus, but there has not been enough
evidence to rule out the possibility that the infants became infected by
the mother after they were born, experts said. A recently published
\href{https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/9000/INTRAUTERINE_TRANSMISSION_OF_SARS_COV_2_INFECTION.96099.aspx}{case
in Texas}, of a newborn who tested positive for Covid-19 and had mild
respiratory symptoms, provided more convincing evidence that
transmission of the virus during pregnancy can occur.

In the Paris case, Dr. De Luca said, the team was able to test the
placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and the mother's and baby's blood.

The testing indicated that ``the virus reaches the placenta and
replicates there,'' Dr. De Luca said. It can then be transmitted to a
fetus, which ``can get infected and have symptoms similar to adult
Covid-19 patients.''

A study of the case was published on Tuesday in the journal Nature
Communications.

Dr. Yoel Sadovsky, executive director of Magee-Womens Research Institute
at the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study, said
he thought the claim of placental transmission was ``fairly
convincing.'' He said the relatively high levels of the coronavirus
found in the placenta and the rising levels of virus in the baby and the
evidence of placental inflammation, along with the baby's symptoms,
``are all consistent with SARS-CoV-2
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/health/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html}{infection}.''

Still, Dr. Sadovsky said, it is important to note that cases of possible
coronavirus transmission in utero appear to be extremely rare. With
other viruses, including Zika and rubella, placental infection and
transmission is much more common, he said. With the coronavirus, he
said, ``we are trying to understand the opposite --- what underlies the
relative protection of the fetus and the placenta?''

\href{https://elifesciences.org/articles/58716}{Another study} published
on Tuesday in eLife, an online research journal, may help answer that
question. It found that while cells in the placenta had many of the
receptor proteins that allow viruses to propagate, there was evidence of
only ``negligible'' amounts of a key cell surface receptor and an enzyme
that are known to be involved in allowing the coronavirus to enter cells
and replicate. The study was led by Dr. Robert Romero, chief of the
perinatology research branch at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver ** National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

The report from doctors in Paris said that the woman was 35 weeks
pregnant when she came to the hospital with a fever and a cough that she
developed a couple of days earlier in what was an otherwise healthy
pregnancy. She tested positive for the coronavirus. After three days,
fetal heart monitoring indicated signs of distress, and the baby was
delivered by emergency cesarean section.

    Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without
    symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more
    than 200 other experts, who
    \href{https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798}{have

The baby was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit and was
connected to a ventilator for about six hours, the authors reported. He
seemed to be doing well, but on his third day he became irritable, had
trouble feeding and was experiencing muscle spasms and rigidity.

A brain scan showed some injury to the white matter, which Dr. De Luca
said resembled symptoms of meningitis or inflammation in the brain. He
tested negative for other viruses or bacterial infections that could
have caused such symptoms, while tests of his blood and fluid from his
lungs were positive for coronavirus infection, the authors said. The
baby gradually recovered and left the hospital after 18 days.

The authors said that the highest levels of the coronavirus were found
in the placenta, higher than those in the amniotic fluid and in the
blood of the mother and baby, which Dr. De Luca said suggested that the
virus might be able to replicate in placental cells.

Dr. De Luca, who is also the president-elect of the European Society for
Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care, said his team was analyzing other
suspected cases of placental transmission of the coronavirus.

``This will be helpful for clinicians and policymakers in order to
manage pregnant women, check neonates and reduce the risk of viral
transmission from mothers to neonates,'' he said, adding, ``The good
news is that the baby recovered spontaneously and gradually despite all
this, and this confirms that the disease is milder in early infancy.''
