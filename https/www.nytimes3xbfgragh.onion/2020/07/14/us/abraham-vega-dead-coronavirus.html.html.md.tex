Dies}\label{abraham-vega-48-peacemaking-texas-sheriff-dies}}

Remarried, likely to win re-election in November, he was embarking on a
second act when he died of the novel coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Abraham Vega and Rachel Curry had first met at high school football
games in Tahoka, Texas, when she was covering them as a photographer for
the school newspaper and he was doing the same for The Lynn County
Times. They eventually went their separate ways, married, had two
children each and divorced.

Then it was time for a second chapter. Mr. Vega and Ms. Curry reunited
in 2017 and married the following year in what seemed like a storybook
beginning to a new life.

``People who knew us told us, `You can tell on your faces you made a
difference in each other's lives,''' Ms. Vega said in a phone interview.

By then Mr. Vega was sheriff of Lynn County, in northwest Texas ---
Lynn's first Hispanic sheriff, according to his wife --- and his career
was flourishing. He was renominated in March as the Republican candidate
for the job. His tiny jurisdiction, which is home to about 5,000 people
and a 48-bed jail, is largely Republican, and the party nomination is
tantamount to re-election ahead of the November vote.

As the coronavirus pandemic surged in Texas in recent weeks, Sheriff
Vega thought he had taken every precaution against being infected, his
wife said.

``He had underlying conditions and was so scared of getting it, that
except for the office, he wouldn't go out,'' Ms. Vega said. ``I would go
to the grocery store. But then, last month, a colleague tested positive.
The next day, Abraham did, too.''

Mr. Vega was admitted to a Lubbock hospital, where he spent two weeks,
including nine days on a ventilator. He was then airlifted to a larger
medical center in Dallas and died there on Saturday. He was 48.

The day he entered the hospital was the couple's second wedding
anniversary.

``That was the last time I saw him,'' Ms. Vega, who also tested positive
for the virus but was asymptomatic, said.

Abraham Martin Vega was born on Nov. 7, 1971, in Brownsville, Texas, to
Abelardo Vega, who worked for a telephone company, and Rachel Corona
Saldana, an elementary schoolteacher.

Along with his wife, who is a teacher and executive director of the
Texas Chief Deputies Association, his survivors include his parents; two
children from his first marriage, Marcus and Cori Vega; two stepchildren
from his second marriage, Kaitlyn Lehman and Curry Lehman; his brother,
Mark Vega; his sister, Felicia Valleja; and a granddaughter.

After graduating from Tahoka High School, Mr. Vega was uncertain about a
career, though he was inspired by the commitment of a state trooper who
counseled him, his wife said. He went to work as a dispatcher in the
sheriff's office when he was 19 and never left law enforcement.

Mr. Vega was a jail administrator, chief of the school district police,
deputy sheriff and president of the Texas Chief Deputies Association in
2016, the same year he was elected to a four-year term as Lynn County
sheriff.

By leasing vacant cells to incarcerate inmates from other jurisdictions,
he earned the county more than \$1 million, appointed a deputy to reduce
truancy and encouraged his staff members to further their educations.

``He wasn't the chase 'em down kind of police officer,'' Ms. Vega said.
``He had a servant's heart, and that's what made him a peace officer.''

Indeed, Mr. Vega had that idea tattooed on his chest, a phrase from the
Gospel of Matthew: ``Blessed are the peacemakers.''
