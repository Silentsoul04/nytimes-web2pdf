# Asked About Black Americans Killed by Police, Trump Says, ‘So Are White People’

</div>

The president rejected the fact that Black people suffer
disproportionately from police brutality and made startling remarks
about the Confederate flag and a recent confrontation in St. Louis.

[President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html),
whose re-election prospects have dimmed as Americans question his
handling of the coronavirus outbreak and race relations, on Tuesday
stoked racial grievances yet again with a series of startling remarks
about the [Confederate
flag](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/politics/pentagon-trump-confederate-symbols.html),
victims of police violence and a St. Louis couple who pointed guns at
protesters peacefully marching by their house.

Mr. Trump added to his [long record of racially inflammatory
comments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/trump-race-racism-protests.html)
during an interview with CBS News, in which he brushed off a question
about Black people killed by police officers, saying that white people
are killed in greater numbers.

Mr. Trump reacted angrily when asked about the issue, which has led to
nationwide protests calling for major law enforcement changes.

“Why are African-Americans still dying at the hands of law enforcement
in this country?” the interviewer, Catherine Herridge of CBS News, asked
the president.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“What a terrible question to ask,” Mr. Trump responded. “So are white
people. More white people, by the way.”

Statistics show that while more white Americans are killed by the police
over all, people of color are killed at higher rates. A federal study
that examined lethal force used by the police from 2009 to 2012 found
that a majority of victims were white, but the victims were
disproportionately Black. Black people had a fatality rate at the hands
of police officers that was 2.8 times as high as that of white people.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a separate interview published on Tuesday with the conservative
website Townhall.com, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that a white couple in
St. Louis who confronted peaceful marchers outside their home with guns
had been on the verge of being beaten and having their home burned down.

“They were going to be beat up badly, and the house was going to be
totally ransacked and probably burned down,” Mr. Trump said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Video of the incident, which became a flash point in the national debate
over racial inequality, showed that the protesters at no point
physically threatened the couple.

The president’s remarks were the latest example of his refusal to
acknowledge the racial discrimination that even many in his own party
have said must be addressed. But Mr. Trump, who recently [retweeted a
video of a supporter shouting “white
power”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/28/us/politics/trump-white-power-video-racism.html)
and said he would oppose a bipartisan effort in Congress to remove
Confederate names from military bases, has displayed no intention of
trying to bridge the country’s racial divide.

Asked in the CBS interview how he felt about the use of the Confederate
battle flag in public settings like NASCAR races, the president said:
“With me, it’s freedom of speech. Very simple. Like it, don’t like it,
it’s freedom of speech.”

Asked if he understood that the flag was a painful symbol to many people
as a reminder of slavery, Mr. Trump said, “Well, people love it and I
don’t view — I know people that like the Confederate flag and they’re
not thinking about slavery.” He added, “I just think it’s freedom of
speech, whether it’s Confederate flags or Black Lives Matter or anything
else you want to talk about.”

Four months into a pandemic that has [cost more than 136,000
lives](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
in the United States, and nearly two months after the killing of a Black
man by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a nationwide outpouring of
anger over racial injustice, Mr. Trump still only rarely mentions the
pain that both crises have caused many Americans. Rather than offer
sympathy and compassion, he provokes and attacks.

His comments in the interviews on Tuesday — a day when Florida again
surpassed its previous record for coronavirus deaths while Republicans
[pressed ahead with plans to hold their convention in Jacksonville next
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/politics/florida-virus-republican-convention.html)
— came as he used a news conference that was ostensibly for announcing
new legislation targeting China to thrash his opponent, former Vice
President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)

“His agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee, by
far, in American history,” Mr. Trump said, calling Mr. Biden’s career a
“gift to the Chinese Communist Party.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over the course of his short time as a national political figure, Mr.
Trump has used race, religion and ethnicity [to divide
Americans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/trump-race-racism-protests.html).
Five years ago, he announced that he was seeking the presidency by
denigrating Mexican migrants as rapists and murderers. As a candidate he
then called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the
United States.”

He initially refused to disavow the endorsement of a former Ku Klux Klan
leader, David Duke. He has
[insulted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/04/sports/donald-trump-lebron-james-twitter.html)
the intelligence of Black professional athletes and questioned their
patriotism.

Since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, he has not backed down
but doubled down on making racially divisive and sometimes overtly
racist comments. He has called the coronavirus the “Kung flu.” He
falsely accused a Black NASCAR driver of perpetrating a hoax for
reporting that a noose had been left near his car and criticized the
racing franchise for prohibiting Confederate flags at its events — while
also
[claiming](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268167411230007300?s=20)
to have done “more for Black Americans, in fact, than any President in
U.S. history,” with the “possible exception” of Abraham Lincoln.
