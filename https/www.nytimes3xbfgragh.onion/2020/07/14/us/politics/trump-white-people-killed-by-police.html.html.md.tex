\section{Asked About Black Americans Killed by Police, Trump Says, `So
Are White
People'}\label{asked-about-black-americans-killed-by-police-trump-says-so-are-white-people}}

The president rejected the fact that Black people suffer
disproportionately from police brutality and made startling remarks
about the Confederate flag and a recent confrontation in St. Louis.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html}{President
Trump}, whose re-election prospects have dimmed as Americans question
his handling of the coronavirus outbreak and race relations, on Tuesday
stoked racial grievances yet again with a series of startling remarks
about the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/politics/pentagon-trump-confederate-symbols.html}{Confederate
flag}, victims of police violence and a St. Louis couple who pointed
guns at protesters peacefully marching by their house.

Mr. Trump added to his
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/trump-race-racism-protests.html}{long
record of racially inflammatory comments} during an interview with CBS
News, in which he brushed off a question about Black people killed by
police officers, saying that white people are killed in greater numbers.

Mr. Trump reacted angrily when asked about the issue, which has led to
nationwide protests calling for major law enforcement changes.

``Why are African-Americans still dying at the hands of law enforcement
in this country?'' the interviewer, Catherine Herridge of CBS News,
asked the president.

``What a terrible question to ask,'' Mr. Trump responded. ``So are white
people. More white people, by the way.''

Statistics show that while more white Americans are killed by the police
over all, people of color are killed at higher rates. A federal study
that examined lethal force used by the police from 2009 to 2012 found
that a majority of victims were white, but the victims were
disproportionately Black. Black people had a fatality rate at the hands
of police officers that was 2.8 times as high as that of white people.

In a separate interview published on Tuesday with the conservative
website Townhall.com, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that a white couple in
St. Louis who confronted peaceful marchers outside their home with guns
had been on the verge of being beaten and having their home burned down.

``They were going to be beat up badly, and the house was going to be
totally ransacked and probably burned down,'' Mr. Trump said.

Video of the incident, which became a flash point in the national debate
over racial inequality, showed that the protesters at no point
physically threatened the couple.

The president's remarks were the latest example of his refusal to
acknowledge the racial discrimination that even many in his own party
have said must be addressed. But Mr. Trump, who recently
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/28/us/politics/trump-white-power-video-racism.html}{retweeted
a video of a supporter shouting ``white power''} and said he would
oppose a bipartisan effort in Congress to remove Confederate names from
military bases, has displayed no intention of trying to bridge the
country's racial divide.

Asked in the CBS interview how he felt about the use of the Confederate
battle flag in public settings like NASCAR races, the president said:
``With me, it's freedom of speech. Very simple. Like it, don't like it,
it's freedom of speech.''

Asked if he understood that the flag was a painful symbol to many people
as a reminder of slavery, Mr. Trump said, ``Well, people love it and I
don't view --- I know people that like the Confederate flag and they're
not thinking about slavery.'' He added, ``I just think it's freedom of
speech, whether it's Confederate flags or Black Lives Matter or anything
else you want to talk about.''

Four months into a pandemic that has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{cost
more than 136,000 lives} in the United States, and nearly two months
after the killing of a Black man by a Minneapolis police officer sparked
a nationwide outpouring of anger over racial injustice, Mr. Trump still
only rarely mentions the pain that both crises have caused many
Americans. Rather than offer sympathy and compassion, he provokes and
attacks.

His comments in the interviews on Tuesday --- a day when Florida again
surpassed its previous record for coronavirus deaths while Republicans
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/politics/florida-virus-republican-convention.html}{pressed
ahead with plans to hold their convention in Jacksonville next month}
--- came as he used a news conference that was ostensibly for announcing
new legislation targeting China to thrash his opponent, former Vice
President
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}

``His agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee, by
far, in American history,'' Mr. Trump said, calling Mr. Biden's career a
``gift to the Chinese Communist Party.''

Over the course of his short time as a national political figure, Mr.
Trump has used race, religion and ethnicity
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/trump-race-racism-protests.html}{to
divide Americans}. Five years ago, he announced that he was seeking the
presidency by denigrating Mexican migrants as rapists and murderers. As
a candidate he then called for ``a total and complete shutdown of
Muslims entering the United States.''

He initially refused to disavow the endorsement of a former Ku Klux Klan
leader, David Duke. He has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/04/sports/donald-trump-lebron-james-twitter.html}{insulted}
the intelligence of Black professional athletes and questioned their
patriotism.

Since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, he has not backed down
but doubled down on making racially divisive and sometimes overtly
racist comments. He has called the coronavirus the ``Kung flu.'' He
falsely accused a Black NASCAR driver of perpetrating a hoax for
reporting that a noose had been left near his car and criticized the
racing franchise for prohibiting Confederate flags at its events ---
while also
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268167411230007300?s=20}{claiming}
to have done ``more for Black Americans, in fact, than any President in
U.S. history,'' with the ``possible exception'' of Abraham Lincoln.
