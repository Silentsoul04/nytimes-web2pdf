Younger children in particular are ill-served by remote learning,

Wading into the contentious debate over [reopening
schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/magazine/schools-reopening-covid.html),
an influential committee of scientists and educators on Wednesday
recommended that, wherever possible, younger children and those with
special needs should attend school in person.

Their report — issued by the prestigious National Academies of Science,
Engineering and Medicine, which advises the nation on issues related to
science — is less prescriptive for middle and high schools, [but offered
a framework for school districts to decide whether and how to
open](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/07/schools-should-prioritize-reopening-in-fall-2020-especially-for-grades-k-5-while-weighing-risks-and-benefits),
with help from public health experts, families and teachers.

The committee emphasized common-sense precautions, such as hand-washing,
physical distancing and minimizing group activities, including lunch and
recess.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the experts went further than guidelines issued by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and other groups, also calling for
surgical masks to be worn by all teachers and staff members during
school hours, and for cloth face coverings to be worn by all students,
including those in elementary school.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Regular symptom checks should be conducted, the committee said, and not
just temperature checks. In the long term, schools will need upgrades to
ventilation and air-filtration systems, and federal and state
governments must fund these efforts, the report said.

Online learning is ineffective for most elementary-school children and
special-needs children, the panel of scientists and educators concluded.

To the extent possible, “it should be a priority for districts to reopen
for in-person learning, especially for younger ages,” said Caitlin
Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins and a member of the
committee.

Mary Kathryn Malone, a mother of three children, has been eager for
schools to reopen in Mount Vernon, Ohio, where she lives. Her 9-year-old
daughter is pining for her friends, and her 3-year-old has only
part-time day care — and not while Dr. Malone works.

But she was most worried about her 7-year-old son, who needs help for
his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
dyslexia.

“At one point, we were three full weeks behind on schoolwork,” said Dr.
Malone, who teaches French at Kenyon College. “I was working through my
own job, and when I looked at this mountain accumulating, it was so
stressful.”

[The American Academy of Pediatrics last month also
recommended](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/us/coronavirus-schools-reopening-guidelines-aap.html)
that schools reopen, a position widely cited by the Trump
administration, which has been pushing hard for a return to something
resembling normal life despite soaring infection rates in many states.

Most studies suggest the virus poses [minimal health risks to children
under 18](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/health/coronavirus-schools-reopen.html).
And the report said that evidence for how easily children become
infected or spread the virus to others, including teachers and parents,
is “insufficient” to draw firm conclusions.

Outside experts said they appreciated the report’s distinction between
younger and older children. “I think that’s really smart,” said Dr.
Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.

“The risk is different for a third grader than for a 10th grader, and I
say that as the dad of a third grader and a 10th grader.”

But Dr. Jha and other experts noted that the committee did not address
the level of [community transmission at which opening schools might
become
unsafe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html)
simply because too much virus may be circulating. “They punted the most
critical question,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Committee members said the decision not to recommend a cutoff was
deliberate. “There is no single prevalence or threshold that would be
appropriate for all communities,” Dr. Rivers said.

Dr. Rivers said schools would need to decide how and when to open, close
and reopen schools by taking into account many factors, including
disease levels in the community — and should plan for what to do when
students or teachers become infected.

“Even with extensive mitigation measures, it’s not possible to reduce
the risk to zero, and that has to be part of the discussions,” Dr.
Rivers said.

Reopening schools should be a priority because schools fulfill many
roles beyond providing an education, the authors said. “It’s child care,
it’s nutrition, it’s health services, it’s social and emotional support
services,” said Dr. Enriqueta Bond, the committee’s chair.

“These functions are really undervalued, I think, in the conversation
that’s been taking place.”

The report’s recommendations are largely consistent with those from the
A.A.P., said Dr. Nathaniel Beers, who co-wrote the academy’s guidance.
“The only nuanced difference is that they have acknowledged the
disproportionate impact on younger kids of not being in school,” he
said.

While teenagers may be better able to learn online, they suffer the
social and emotional consequences of being separated from their peers,
Dr. Beers said.

“Adolescence is a period of time in life when you are to be exploring
your own sense of self and developing your identity,” he said. “It’s
difficult to do that if you are at home with your parents all the time.”

Daniel A. Domenech, executive director of the American Association of
School Administrators, said school superintendents were “already
prioritizing in-person learning for the youngest learners.”

The new report is not “groundbreaking,” he said, “but it is helpful in
affirming the touchy job ahead and the need for additional resources to
do right by kids, educators and communities during this school year.”

Some 54 percent of public school districts need to update or replace
facilities in their school buildings, and 41 percent should replace
heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems in at least half of
their schools, according to an analysis by the Government Accountability
Office.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“One of the shocks to me is that over 50 percent of the school buildings
are awful,” Dr. Bond said.

New evidence suggests that the coronavirus may be airborne, and that
many indoor spaces may need better air filtration to prevent infections.
“Between now and September, you’re not going to be able to put in a new
ventilation system,” she added.

In the meantime, schools may be able to opt for simpler solutions:
Before the weather cools, they might emulate their counterparts in
Europe and move classes outdoors, set up tents or build outdoor
classrooms, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins
Center for Health Security.

Schools may also need to hire additional staff to replace educators or
other staff members who may not wish to return, the report noted, and to
implement some of the recommendations, such as enforcing social
distancing in the classroom or ensuring that groups of children remain
with a particular teacher.

Some 28 percent of the more than 3.8 million full-time teachers in the
country are older than 50, and about a third of school principals are
over 55, age groups at high risk of severe illness from the coronavirus.

In one survey, 62 percent of educators and administrators reported that
they were somewhat or very concerned about returning to school while the
coronavirus continues to be a threat, according to the report. “The
school work force issue is really not discussed that much,” Dr. Bond
said.

Racial and socio-economic inequities are another prominent concern. The
communities where children struggle to learn in dilapidated,
understaffed schools are also those hit hardest by the pandemic, said
Keisha Scarlett, a committee member and chief of equity, partnerships
and engagement at the Seattle Public Schools.

families](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/us/coronavirus-schools-attendance-absent.html).
Nationwide, about 30 percent of Indigenous families and about 20 percent
of Black and Latino families do not have access to the internet or have
it only through a smartphone, compared with 7 percent of white families
and 4 percent of Asian families.

Adults in these communities are also more likely to be essential workers
who cannot stay home with their children, Dr. Scarlett said. Rates of
hospitalization for Covid-19 are four to five times higher in [Black,
Latino and Indigenous populations than among
whites](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html).

“Covid-19 exacerbates those disparities,” Dr. Scarlett said.

The report also noted significant differences between rural and urban
schools. Some 26 percent of people in rural districts and 32 percent of
those living on tribal lands do not have reliable internet access.

Samuel Berry-Foster Sr., a sixth-grade science teacher, lives just
outside Asheville, N.C., in a pocket of the Appalachian Mountains, with
his wife and two school-age children.

For his family and for those of many of his students, Mr. Berry-Foster
said, even a simple phone call can be plagued with delays and hangups.
For more than one family member to be online at the same time is
“impossible.”

“What we end up doing is driving about eight miles to a little bitty
library for broadband,” he said. “We sit in the parking lot and do our
meetings and such.”

The C.D.C. has provided limited guidance on reopening schools and
largely puts the onus on district leaders to make judgments they may be
unequipped to make.

The new report offers more detailed guidance for how to reopen,
including a list of the kinds of experts to consult — such as
epidemiologists who can interpret disease transmission rates. Local task
forces should take into account the number of coronavirus infections,
hospitalizations and deaths, and the percentage of diagnostic tests that
are positive.

President Trump has said that even the C.D.C.’s less detailed
recommendations were “very tough and expensive.” But the new report’s
recommended retrofits are likely to be out of reach for most school
districts, costing roughly $1.8 million for a school district with eight
school buildings and about 3,200 students.

“In my view, this has to be a top priority,” Dr. Nuzzo said. “The
economy depends on this, the future of our country depends on this.”
