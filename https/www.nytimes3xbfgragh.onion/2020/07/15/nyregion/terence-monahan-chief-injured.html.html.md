# Top N.Y.P.D. Chief Injured While Making Arrest at a Protest

</div>

Terence A. Monahan, New York’s highest-ranking uniformed chief, was one
of several officers who were attacked on the Brooklyn Bridge, officials
said.

New York City’s top uniformed police officer, two lieutenants and a
sergeant were injured on Wednesday in two separate incidents on the
Brooklyn Bridge, including one that involved an attack with some kind of
stick or pole as protesters marched nearby, officials said.

The altercations were the latest to erupt between officers and the
public in the roughly seven weeks since the city became the scene of
widespread protests against
[police](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/portland-protests.html)
brutality and systemic racism in the aftermath of the killing of George
Floyd in Minneapolis.

And they came on a day when Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a [package of
bills meant to rein in police
abuses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/nyregion/police-reform-nypd.html)
— the most contentious measure being a ban on chokeholds. The department
and police union leaders have said the new laws would make it harder for
officers to do their jobs and lead to an onslaught of crime.

The episode on Wednesday occurred around 9:45 a.m., when Terence A.
Monahan, the Police Department’s chief of department and top uniformed
officer, and other officers tried to
[arrest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/portland-protests.html)
a person who had jumped onto the bridge’s roadway from the adjoining
walkway during a Black Lives Matter protest march, Lt. John Grimpel, a
Police Department spokesman, said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With a small group gathered on the walkway near the officers as they
took the person into custody, someone in a purple shirt ran toward the
crowd and swung a long, thin instrument twice at the police, causing at
least one of the officers to reach for his head as if he had been
struck, according to a 10-second video clip of the episode released by
the department.

The assailant backed away immediately after striking the officers and
was still being sought, Lieutenant Grimpel said. It was not clear
whether the person wielding the stick had a connection to the person who
was being arrested, the lieutenant said.

In a message posted on Twitter along with the video clip, the department
said that three officers had been “violently attacked by protesters
crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.”

“This is not peaceful protest,” the message continued. “This will not be

A [second
post](https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/1283442839884627980)showed
several officers with blood on their heads.

The bridge attack left a lieutenant and a sergeant with cuts on their
scalps and Chief Monahan with an injured hand, Lieutenant Grimpel said.
“We don’t believe it’s broken,” the lieutenant added of the chief’s
hand. A second lieutenant sustained a broken eye socket when he was
punched in a separate incident.

As the top uniformed officer, Chief Monahan is in many ways the public
face of the Police Department’s 36,000 rank-and-file members. He has
criticized many of the criminal justice changes being pushed by
activists and some elected
officials.

During the protests, he has been a somewhat contradictory figure:
showing solidarity with demonstrators by taking a knee on one occasion
and personally overseeing aggressive arrests on another.

As the protests continue, Mr. de Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot
F. Shea have said that officers are acting with restraint, even when
they encounter violent resistance. But there is ample evidence, as
[documented by The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/14/nyregion/nypd-george-floyd-protests.html),
of violence on the part of officers as well.

The protesters who marched across the bridge on Wednesday were headed to
a rally at [City Hall Park in
Manhattan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/nyregion/occupy-city-hall-protest-nypd.html)
that was organized by clergy leaders, among others. By day’s end, 37
people had been arrested in or near the park, six of them for felony
assault, Lieutenant Grimpel said.

Jeffery C. Mays and Andy Newman contributed reporting.
