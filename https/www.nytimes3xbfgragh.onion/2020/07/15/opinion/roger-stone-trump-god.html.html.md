As the start of his prison sentence approached, Roger Stone didn’t
despair.

“I had prayed fervently,” the felon told Mike Allen of Axios in [a phone
interview](https://www.axios.com/roger-stone-interview-campaign-trump-37b8e1d9-cd72-47ea-8401-801b99d1ea0f.html)
a few days ago, adding that he believed that “the whole matter was in
God’s hands” and that “God would provide.”

“And he did,” Stone said.

No, Mr. Stone. *President Trump* provided. That’s who [commuted your
sentence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html)
and set you free, which you have no business being. And this conflation
of human corruption and divine intervention, of “The Apprentice” and the
Almighty, has gone too far and has to stop. It’s an insult to true
faith. It’s cheap.

I’m not going to detail the ways in which godliness and Trumpiness are
at violent odds with each other. I’m not going to delineate the
president’s digressions from the Commandments. That’s an exercise in the
blindingly obvious.

Nor do I care to revisit the question of why so many evangelicals and
other conservative Christians support Trump, because it has been amply
visited and there’s no mystery there. Trump has aligned certain
positions of his — principally, opposition to legal abortion — with
theirs. They’ll accept his profanity in return for his judges. It’s a
calculation, pure and simple: a compromise. Politics is lousy with them.

But I do want to flag the propensity for God talk among Trump’s
unscrupulous minions. I want to object to their use of God as a cover,
their nod to God to justify their service to a president who no doubt
thinks that the Golden Rule refers to the requisite measure of gilding
for a skyscraper or casino.

They have turned God into a prop, a tic, and while they’re welcome to
their rationalizations, they’re not entitled to their righteousness. I’m
not offended on behalf of God. I’m offended on behalf of decency.

Kayleigh McEnany, the relatively new White House press secretary, wears
a silver cross around her neck. As [a recent profile of
her](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/kayleigh-mcenany-trump-evangelicals/613471/)
in The Atlantic by Emma Green pointed out, she publicly faith-shamed
reporters who challenged Trump’s blasé attitude toward the pandemic as a
group that “desperately wants to see these churches and houses of
worship stay closed.”

And in a recent interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network,
McEnany said: “I stand as a Christian woman, someone who believes in
equality and truth and loyalty and honesty.” She also, by all
appearances, believes in Trump, which doesn’t quite square with those
other principles. But it does give her a pedestal.

“Only God could deliver such a savior to our nation and only God could
allow me to help,” Brad Parscale, who is managing Trump’s re-election
campaign,
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1123212317376811009) last
year. Hmm. I don’t know about that. Vladimir Putin and Mark Zuckerberg
played their parts.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who once had McEnany’s job, [suggested that
Trump was
chosen](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/30/donald-trump-evangelicals-god-1294578)
for his current task by God. So did Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state.

I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Bill Barr, the attorney general, more
or less shares that view. The tenor of [a big
speech](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-remarks-law-school-and-de-nicola-center-ethics)
he gave last year at the University of Notre Dame made clear that he
sees himself as a soldier in a holy war between the Judeo-Christian
tradition and godless secularists. He must see Trump as the general,
given [how
obsequiously](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/10/opinion/william-barr-trump.html)
he marches behind him.

I have enormous respect for people of faith, or at least for many of
them, because their conviction can be a wellspring of empathy,
generosity, grace. But those traits also flourish in many people who
don’t belong to any organized religion or, for that matter, don’t
believe in God. And invoking God — as so many of Trump’s enablers do —
is no predictor of rectitude or real devotion. Sometimes it’s just a
reflex. Other times it’s a ruse.

I myself am not conventionally religious. I’m not versed in theology,
either. So I cannot claim to understand God’s design any better than the
Trump aides who drone on about it do. I’m no more tapped into God than
Roger Stone is.

But I’m nonetheless confident that no God would smile on Trump’s
stewardship of this pandemic, during which so many lives are being
needlessly lost. No God would bless Trump’s march across Lafayette
Square, which was [cleared with force and tear
gas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/01/us/politics/trump-st-johns-church-bible.html),
so that he could brandish a Bible for photographers, turning a sacred
text into a partisan bauble.

No God would fail to notice the void of penitence in a president with so
much to atone for. And no God would put Stone, a dirty-trickster who has
never demonstrated any discernible interest in cleansing himself, at the
top of his to-do list, liberating him so that he could rejoin the ranks
of Republicans intent on securing Trump another four years.

Good luck to them. Polls, death tolls and the president’s [increasingly
unhinged
behavior](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-news-conference.html)
suggest that they haven’t a prayer.
