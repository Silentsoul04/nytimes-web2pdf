In America, you should always get a little suspicious when politicians
suddenly [start calling you a
hero](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/coronavirus-humans-vs-heroes.html).
It’s a well-worn trick; they’re buttering you up before sacrificing you
to the gods of unconstrained capitalism and governmental neglect.

A few months ago, it was nurses, doctors and other essential workers who
were hailed as heroes — a perfectly accurate and heartwarming sentiment,
but also one meant to obscure the sorry reality that the world’s richest
country was asking health care workers to treat coronavirus patients
[without providing adequate protective
gear](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/opinion/coronavirus-face-mask.html).

“Please don’t call me a hero,” [a nurse in
Brooklyn](https://slate.com/technology/2020/04/nurse-hero-protest.html)
wrote on a protest sign at the time. “I am being martyred against my
will.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, it’s America’s parents and teachers who are being valorized for
doing a job that really should not require putting their lives on the
line.

At [a White House
event](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-safely-reopening-americas-schools/)
last week to encourage the nation’s schools to reopen, Vice President
Mike Pence laid the heroism on thick. Parents and teachers, he said,
were “two categories of heroes that emerged” in the crisis. Since the
pandemic is all but over, at least in the magical thinking of the Trump
administration, Pence wants parents and teachers to again put on their
capes and save the day. “To open up America again, we got to open up
America’s schools,” he said.

I want schools to reopen as much any parent does. My wife and I were
[driven to the verge of
breakdown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/opinion/coronavirus-parenting-burnout.html)this
spring while trying to home-school our kids while working from home, and
I am freaking out about having to do that again in the fall.

But parents and teachers would be wise to reject any invitation to
unnecessary heroism. I don’t want educating my kids to be a heroic act
of American defiance — I want it to be ordinary. And I’d rather not
sacrifice my children’s teachers, either, so that America’s economy can
begin humming once more.

Again and again in this crisis, the federal government’s callous
incompetence has left Americans with no good options. [Early research on
school
reopening](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks)
suggests that classrooms can be safe when the virus is contained or
declining, and so long as schools take necessary precautions to minimize
the chance that classrooms become superspreaders. But in much of the
nation, the virus remains uncontained, and so we face a grim future.
There will likely be danger and chaos if the schools do not reopen, and
there will be [danger and chaos if they
do](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html?searchResultPosition=1).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The needs of children and working parents have long been ignored by
American lawmakers, but I’ve never felt the government’s neglect as
viscerally as in its inability to make school safe again during a
pandemic.

Shouldn’t getting our kids back to school have been a primary goal of
the federal government throughout the summer? What possible excuse can
anyone muster for falling down on this job?

I’m reminded of that famous presidential call to sacrifice: Ask not what
your country can do for you … because, honestly, it probably won’t do
much of anything, and your best bet when facing a crisis is to [just
learn to live with
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/opinion/coronavirus-trump.html).
(This sounds like a joke, but it’s the actual plan: “The virus is with
us, but we need to live with it,” one anonymous administration official
recently [told NBC
News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/we-need-live-it-white-house-readies-new-message-nation-n1232884).)

Experts say there are many ways to [mitigate the risks of the
coronavirus while reopening the
schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/opinion/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html).
The most obvious of these would have been to reduce the spread of the
virus, but you know how well that’s going.

The federal government could also have provided [the hundreds of
billions of
dollars](https://ccsso.org/blog/ccsso-submits-cost-estimate-safely-reopening-public-schools-after-covid)
that school district officials say is necessary to remake education
during a pandemic. We could have funded hazard pay for teachers and paid
time off for parents, and come up with a plan to repurpose office
buildings or gyms for the space required to teach students while social
distancing.

In May, [Democrats in the House
passed](https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2020/05/covid-relief-schools-60-billion-democrats-bill.html)
a bill that calls for $58 billion in new funds for schools. But the
Republican Senate has not taken up the measure, and President Trump has
done little more than post several all-caps tweets demanding that they
reopen. In cable-news interviews this weekend, Betsy DeVos, the
education secretary, [refused to
say](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/12/politics/betsy-devos-schools-reopening-coronavirus-cnntv/index.html)
if schools should follow the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s [health
guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html),
which calls for strict social distancing, masks and the installation of
physical barriers and improved ventilation to reduce the spread of the
virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

DeVos’s plan, like Trump’s, appears to be little more than wishful
thinking: Go to school. Don’t worry about it. Things will be fine.
You’re a hero\!

Forgive me if I feel less like a hero than like a chump. This week
several large school districts, including Los Angeles and San Diego,
announced that it’s too dangerous to open for in-person instruction. I
expect that we’ll see a wave of others deciding the same, leaving
parents across the country in an impossible bind.

There is a danger that frustrated parents blame teachers for the crisis.
After all, distance learning has been a disaster. It’s unfair, and
likely impossible, for kids to learn by themselves off a screen, and in
my experience, remote learning requires a great deal of parental
oversight, which is difficult or impossible for most overburdened
parents.

But as I tried and failed to educate my kids during months under
quarantine, I gained new appreciation for my children’s teachers, and
I’m wary of asking more of them. Spending a day teaching kids has got
to be one of the most difficult and most thankless job our society asks
professionals to do. It doesn’t strike me as fair to demand that
teachers now risk their lives, too, just because our government couldn’t
be bothered to protect them. Teachers shouldn’t have to be heroes to do
their jobs; educating our children should be heroism enough.
