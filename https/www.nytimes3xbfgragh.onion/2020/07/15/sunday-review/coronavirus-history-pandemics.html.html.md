Nearly 140,000 Americans have been lost to coronavirus, and many experts
fear that the deaths will only accelerate in the fall as cold weather
forces us indoors. By year’s end, half as many Americans may have died
as did in the four years of World War II.

And yet we are still arguing over how to prevent this — each state
struggling over how much lockdown to impose and what its governor can
make its citizens do.

“You know the five stages of grief — denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, acceptance?” asked Dr. Emily Landon, a coronavirus expert at
the University of Chicago medical school. “I think the American people
are in all five of them — but different parts of the country are in
different stages.”

As death stalks us, especially our elders, have we simply become inured
to the idea that many of us are doomed?

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The stock market appears to have priced in a huge wave of deaths. In the
2008-2009 recession, it fell 50 percent and took four years to recover.
In March it fell only 34 percent and has made up much of that ground
already. Looked at with Wall Street’s bloodless arithmetic, that makes
sense: Most of the deaths are among the very elderly and nursing home
residents, who no longer travel or dine out or contribute much to the
economy, and who are a burden on the struggling Medicare and Social
Security Trust Funds.

One can even argue that the acceptance of death as master of us all is
part of the human psyche. But because of modern medicine, we have been
out of touch with our ultimate fate for generations.

We’ve all heard of the Black Death and perhaps the [Plague of
Justinian,](https://www.ancient.eu/article/782/justinians-plague-541-542-ce/)
events that may have killed up to a third of mankind and rewrote the
fates of empires. They seem lost in the mists of time.

At first glance, it looks innocuous, like the ups and downs of the Dow
Jones index. But the longer you stare at the fine print, the more
horrified you become.

This past March, before coronavirus cases began to mount, the annual
death rate in New York City was about six per 1,000 New Yorkers. The
virus’s first wave added about 2.5 more deaths per 1,000 to that
baseline. By contrast, from 1800 into the 1850s, deaths in the city rose
in a relentless series of epidemic spikes, year after year, with only
brief respites in
between.

The annual baseline back then was about 25 deaths per 1,000 New Yorkers,
and in some years the toll reached 50 per 1,000. In other words, in bad
years, New Yorkers saw twice as many people around them die as usual.
And they were used to seeing about four times as much death as we now
do.

The sharpest peaks were the cholera epidemics of 1832, 1849 and 1854.
But plagues came in waves, sometimes more than one simultaneously:
yellow fever, smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhus and
meningitis.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The death rate began dropping after the 1860s. New Yorkers — both
citizens and doctors — had finally stopped arguing and reached consensus
on some basic issues.

First of all, most finally accepted the “germ theory” of disease,
acknowledging that it was caused by invisible enemies, not by swamps,
trash, manure or the other nuisances that underlay the “miasma theory,”
which held that bad smells caused disease. (Only a century earlier,
Americans had given up on the “humors theory,” which posited that
disease was caused by imbalances among blood, urine, sweat and bile that
had to be rebalanced by bleeding, sweating or purging.)

They also agreed that whether immigrants had brought some diseases or
simply suffered from them, no one was safe until everyone was safe, so
they made public health universal.

As a result, New Yorkers took certain steps — sometimes very expensive
and contentious, but all based on science: They dug sewers to pipe filth
into the Hudson and East Rivers instead of letting it pool in the
streets. In 1842, they built the Croton Aqueduct to carry fresh water to
Manhattan. In 1910, they chlorinated its water to kill more germs. In
1912, they began requiring dairies to heat their milk because a
Frenchman named Louis Pasteur had shown that doing so spared children
from tuberculosis. Over time, they made smallpox vaccination mandatory.

Libertarians battled almost every step. Some fought sewers and water
mains being dug through their properties, arguing that they owned
perfectly good wells and cesspools. Some refused smallpox vaccines until
the Supreme Court put an end to that in 1905, in [Jacobson v.
Massachusetts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/09/health/measles-outbreak-vaccinations-brooklyn.html).

In the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, many New Yorkers donned masks but
4,000 San Franciscans formed an Anti-Mask League. (The city’s mayor,
James Rolph, [was fined
$50](https://www.kqed.org/arts/13878268/mindblowing-tales-from-san-franciscos-long-history-with-epidemics)
for flouting his own health department’s mask order.) Slowly, science
prevailed, and death rates went down.

Today, Americans are facing the same choice our ancestors did: We can
listen to scientists and spend money to save lives, or we can watch our
neighbors die.

“The people who say ‘Let her rip, let’s go for herd immunity’ — that’s
just public-health nihilism,” said Dr. Joia S. Mukherjee, the chief
medical office of Partners in Health, a medical charity fighting the
virus. “How many deaths do we have to accept to get there?”

A vaccine may be close at hand, and so may treatments like monoclonal
antibodies that will cut our losses.

Till then, we need not accept death as our overlord — we can simply hang
on and outlast him.
