After a financial hit from the pandemic, the San Francisco company said
business was starting to return from its nose-dive.

SAN FRANCISCO --- Airbnb has resumed its efforts to go public, despite
significant damage to the home rental business caused by the coronavirus
pandemic, Airbnb's chief executive, Brian Chesky, told employees
Wednesday.

The San Francisco company, once valued by investors at \$31 billion, had
planned to file in March to go public, but set aside those plans when
the pandemic halted travel around the world. Since then, Airbnb has
slashed costs, raised
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/technology/airbnb-coronavirus-valuation.html}{emergency
funding} and laid off a quarter of its staff, around 1,900 people.

On a videoconference with employees, Mr. Chesky indicated that the
company's gross bookings --- a sum that includes money paid to hosts ---
had rebounded in recent weeks from their nose-dive.

``This is something I never would have imagined telling you,'' he said
in the meeting, which The New York Times attended. ``It kind of defies
logic in a way.'' He added that the trend could change as lockdowns
returned in some parts of the United States.

Airbnb also announced that Catherine Powell, the company's head of
experiences, would take a new role as global head of hosting as Greg
Greeley, president of the homes division, left the company. Hiroki Asai,
an 18-year veteran of Apple, will join Airbnb to lead its marketing.

The company is trying to repair its relationship with its hosts, who
supply the rentals for its platform and whose income has dried up with
travel halted. Many were outraged when Airbnb
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/technology/airbnb-hosts-coronavirus.html}{allowed
guests to cancel nonrefundable bookings} as the pandemic spread. Mr.
Chesky earlier apologized to hosts for how the decision was
communicated.

In response to the virus, Airbnb has adapted its offerings, including
creating new cleaning initiatives, selling access to ``virtual''
activities done over video streaming and promoting rentals in rural
areas within driving distance.

The company is under pressure from its workers to go public; shares held
by early employees will begin to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/20/technology/airbnb-employees-ipo-payouts.html}{expire
this year}.

Even with the revenue it lost, Airbnb's listing may be welcomed by
investors. Despite record unemployment, surging virus cases and
declarations of a recession, the stock market has been booming,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/technology/ipo-pandemic.html}{particularly
for initial public offerings by tech companies}. In recent weeks, shares
of Lemonade, an online insurance start-up, and NCino, a financial tech
start-up, have more than doubled after listing.

Mr. Chesky closed the meeting by declaring that Airbnb is back. ``We're
not committing to going public this year, but we're not ruling it out,
either,'' he said. ``When the market is ready, we will be ready, because
Airbnb was down but we were not out.''
