*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up

Let’s list some anxieties about digital life: We’re being tracked all
the time. Internet superpowers hold sway over what information we see
and what we buy. Our sensitive information keeps getting
[hacked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/22/business/equifax-settlement.html).

There’s no simple fix for these complex worries. But there’s a step that
works toward addressing them all: Americans deserve a national limit on
the information companies collect about us.

If you want to focus on one broad approach to tackle many of our
internet horribles, remember this motto: Just collect less data, period.

Companies want to harvest as much data about us as possible because —
well, why wouldn’t they? More information could help them target
advertisements at us, [track high-traffic areas in
stores](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/10/business/retail-stores-technology.html)
or show us more dog videos to keep us on their site longer.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For the companies, there’s no downside to limitless data collection, and
there’s little to prevent them from doing so in the United States.

Why should we care? Fair question. (My Opinion section colleagues
[tackled
this](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/26/reader-center/location-tracking-phones-questions.html)
in their [Privacy
Project](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/opinion/internet-privacy-project.html)
series.) Personally, I feel icky knowing that [political campaigns can
buy data showing who attends
church,](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700866/steve-bannon-location-data-carriers-tmobile-att-verizon)
and that the Internal Revenue Service bought [bulk records of people’s
locations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/irs-used-cellphone-location-data-to-try-to-find-suspects-11592587815)
to (ineffectively) hunt for financial criminals. When there’s an arms
race for our personal data, we lose control over where our information
winds up and how it’s used.

And I can’t shake what my colleague [Paul
Mozur](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/paul-mozur) said [about
digital surveillance in Hong
Kong.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/technology/surveillance-protests-hong-kong.html)
For people to feel free, he told me, we need to know that we’re not
always being watched. On some level, I’d bet that goes for Facebook and
[our television
sets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/18/you-watch-tv-your-tv-watches-back/)
just as it does for governments.

Data also consolidates power. If you worry about Google, Facebook and
Amazon having too much influence, you should be aware that at the root
of their power is control over reams of information on where we go, what
we do and what we like.

Competitors then do icky things to play catch up, like buying
information [from data-harvesting
companies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html).
The digital economy is a game of data intrusion one-upmanship.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When we and elected officials try to fight this, our efforts are often
too myopic. Data privacy regulation and legislation has focused on
requiring disclosure [of data-targeted political
advertisements](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/19/us/politics/facebook-google-russia-meddling-disclosure.html),
making privacy policies more clear, or forcing companies to [show their
digital dossiers on
us](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/03/us/ccpa-california-privacy-law.html).

Fine, those are pragmatic steps. Better still is to step back to the
underlying problem: All companies collect too much data about us in the
first place.

I recognize that the devil is in the details, and I’m not offering that.
(I’ll work on it. My Opinion colleagues [had
suggestions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/12/21/opinion/location-data-privacy-rights.html)
for lawmakers and regulators.) Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from
Ohio, released a [draft privacy
bill](https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-proposal-protect-consumers-privacy)
last month that proposed companies collect information only when [it’s
“strictly
necessary.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/18/data-privacy-law-sherrod-brown/)
Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, [introduced a
relatively similar
proposal](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1578/text)
last year.

They weren’t the first to try for a sweeping federal privacy law, and
they probably won’t be the last to fail. But I’m glad they’re trying to
coalesce us around a big idea: Unrestricted harvesting of personal data
has gone too far.

## In praise of unflashy technology

While I was reporting an
[article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-06-07/the-next-big-phones-could-bring-a-billion-people-online?sref=7ooTCNG1)
last year about expanding internet access in parts of Africa, no one
wanted to talk about [high-altitude balloons that transmit the
internet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/world/africa/google-loon-balloon-kenya.html).

Instead, people couldn’t stop praising [metal
poles](https://carrier.huawei.com/en/trends-and-insights/emsite/ruralstar)
that made it far easier and cheaper to bring internet connections to
places where conventional cellphone towers weren’t a good option.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was a useful reminder to me that sometimes the biggest innovations
are the ones we never notice.

David M. Perry, a journalist and academic adviser at the University of
Minnesota,
[wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/style/assistive-technology.html)
in The New York Times this week about how spell-check, smartphone voice
control and other technology we take for granted can be life changing
for people with disabilities.

“Disability technology can be so quotidian that nondisabled users don’t
even notice,” Perry wrote.

To be fair, things like voice-activated helpers were marvels when they
were first introduced, and now we’ve gotten used to them. And we do
still want people to think big. Modern smartphones are an example of a
flashy technology that really did change everything.

But what Perry highlighted is that we sometimes fixate too much on
big-bang technologies that turn out to be impractical — [driverless
cars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/technology/driverless-cars.html),
to pick one example — or are trying to solve problems that people don’t
really have, at the expense of lower-tech ideas that can be magical.

Perry said, for example, that there are constantly ideas to replace the
white canes used by people with vision impairments, and blind people
think the canes are great as is. (Here are some more [boring but
important
technologies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/technology/internet-infrastructure.html).)

Remember that when you get excited about [drones that deliver library
books](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/us/google-wing-drones-virginia-books.html),
[all-seeing shopping
carts](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/amazon-supermarket-will-roll-out-fancy-new-smart-cart-when-it-opens/)
or whatever flashy thing that makes us think, “Cool\!” Sometimes the
stuff that draws the most attention will never work, and the seemingly
simple stuff has the biggest impact.

## Before we go …

  - **Apple scores a legal (and financial) win:** A European court
    [overruled an
    order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/business/apple-eu-ireland-tax.html)
    that would have forced the company to pay $14.9 billion in unpaid
    taxes, the Times tech reporter [Adam
    Satariano](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/adam-satariano)
    reported. In 2016, a European Union regulator said Apple had made
    illegal deals with Ireland to keep its tax bill low.

  - **Memes for a cause in Iran:** People in Iran are [coalescing around
    the hashtag \#DontExecute and other social media
    messages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-protests-capital-punishment.html)to
    push for an end to government executions based on murky charges,
    from drinking alcohol to political activism. My colleague [Farnaz
    Fassihi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/farnaz-fassihi) wrote
    that it was a “rare moment of solidarity among Iranians of varying
    political views around a single issue” in a country where the
    government has brutally crushed other forms of dissent.

  - **Why does that textbook cost $24 million?** Fortune [digs into the
    oddities of computerized
    pricing](https://fortune.com/2020/07/14/wayfair-cabinet-conspiracy-algorithm-amazon-pricing-ecommerce/)
    to explain why a pillow might list for more than $10,000 on Amazon.
    Among the culprits are computers programmed to respond to price
    changes of competing products — with sometimes illogical results —
    and merchants setting artificially high prices so you won’t try to
    buy something.
