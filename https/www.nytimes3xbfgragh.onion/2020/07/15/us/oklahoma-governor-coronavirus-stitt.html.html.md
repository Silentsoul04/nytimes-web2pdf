# Oklahoma Governor Tests Positive for Coronavirus

Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma announced on Wednesday that he tested
positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first governor in the United
States known to have been infected during the pandemic.

Mr. Stitt told reporters in a video news conference that he was feeling
fine and that he did not know where, when or how he had become infected.

Mr. Stitt, a Republican, said that his own infection had not prompted
him to second-guess his response to the virus, which has been less
aggressive than in many other states, including some led by fellow
Republicans. The governor has resisted issuing a statewide mask order,
and continued to do so on Wednesday. He faced criticism early on in the
outbreak, in March, when he [posted a photo of
himself](https://twitter.com/SculptorJon/status/1239021903454453761)
with his children inside a crowded restaurant at a time when many people
in the state were following social distancing protocols.

“I’m probably getting tons of texts right now from other governors
around the country,” he said. “I was pretty shocked that I was the first
governor to get it.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Oklahoma has averaged more than 640 new cases per day over the past
week, more than at any point in the pandemic. On the same day the
governor announced that he had tested positive, the state reported 1,075
new coronavirus cases, surpassing the single-day record set on Tuesday.
The county that includes Oklahoma City, the state capital, has seen some
of the swiftest growth, with more than 200 daily cases on average, more
than double the rate of two weeks ago.

The positive test for Mr. Stitt represents a new frontier for America’s
governors, who have been at the [forefront of responding to the
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/coronavirus-governors.html)
but have so far largely avoided personally confronting the
virus.

have said they tested positive for the virus or antibodies.

Mr. Stitt, 47, said he did not think that he had a serious case.

“It just kind of feels achy, like maybe the start of a little cold is
what it feels like right now, but really I feel fine,” Mr. Stitt said
during the Zoom call while sitting at home.

He said that he received his test results at 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and
that given the timing, he did not believe his infection was linked to
President Trump’s rally in Tulsa on June 20. Mr. Stitt was one of
thousands who attended the rally, where many officials and Mr. Trump’s
supporters decided not to wear masks. A surge in coronavirus cases in
and around Tulsa was most likely tied to the rally, the city’s top
health official said last week.

“I don’t think there was any way it was at the president’s rally,” Mr.
Stitt said Wednesday.

Mr. Stitt has not been shy about not wearing a mask, at public events,
meetings and at Mr. Trump’s rally. But he said he could have been
exposed anywhere at any time.

“You just never know where it is,” he said, adding, “I gassed up at a
gas station and we could have touched the gas pump. You start
second-guessing and wondering all those different things and how you
could have gotten it.” The virus spreads mainly from person to person,
[rather than via contaminated
surfaces](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/health/cdc-coronavirus-touching-surfaces.html),
according to public health experts.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Mr. Stitt’s announcement set off a flurry of testing and self-isolating
among state and local officials who had been in close contact with him
or had recent meetings with him. The governor’s busy, in-person schedule
in recent days will complicate contact tracing efforts. The governor
said that in talking to health officials, he was likely not contagious
before Saturday and that he did not have “the traditional symptoms” of
Covid-19.

On Tuesday morning, hours before he received his test results, Mr. Stitt
attended a [special
meeting](https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/oklahoma-watch-gov-stitt-lashes-out-as-pick-to-run-land-office-is-approved-in/article_677a77e8-9b90-5344-8ad9-d3268fb1fb03.html)
of the state’s Land Office in a conference room at the State Capitol in
Oklahoma City. He did not wear a mask.

Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell, who serves in the governor’s cabinet as secretary
of tourism and branding and who sat unmasked at a conference table
across from Mr. Stitt at the Land Office meeting, said in a Facebook
post that he was going to be tested after learning the news and was
self-isolating at home.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“No one in Oklahoma can say they don’t know anyone who has had it,” Mr.
Pinnell [wrote on
Facebook](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/matt.pinnell.5/posts/10223594197268150).
“We all know someone now and it should absolutely be taken seriously.”

Mr. Stitt said he was tested for the virus on Tuesday but it was unclear
what time. Asked why he had not worn a mask at the morning Land Office
meeting, Mr. Stitt said he has since notified the two people he sat
closest to, Mr. Pinnell and Blayne Arthur, the state agriculture
secretary, that he had tested positive for the
virus.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“Those two were probably six feet away from me,” Mr. Stitt said.

Photographs of the meeting show Mr. Stitt sitting at the head of a
conference table, with the lieutenant governor leaning in to his
immediate left and the agriculture secretary to his right. Mr. Stitt
appears to be sitting closer than six feet to them. Paul Monies, a
reporter for Oklahoma Watch, a nonprofit online news outlet, covered the
meeting, and said it looked to him as if the governor at times could
have been closer than six feet.

Mr. Monies tested positive for the virus after covering the president’s
rally in Tulsa, and had recently returned to work. He said that although
he was wearing a mask at the meeting, he is now considering getting
tested again.

“It was my first in-person meeting back from quarantine,” Mr. Monies
said.

Oklahoma was among the first states to reopen its economy, with stores,
barbershops and salons opening back up on April 24. At the time, the
state had just 3,100 cases. New infections were holding steady — with an
average of 94 new cases a day — but not on a sustained decrease, the
path that is recommended by public health experts before reopening.

Restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and houses of worship were allowed to
reopen shortly afterward, on May 1. Bars — a known source of new
infections across the country — reopened on May 15.

By early June, there were signs of worrisome spread. On June 12,
Oklahoma surpassed more than 200 new confirmed daily cases for the first
time. A little more than a month later, the state has recorded more than
21,000 cases, and the positive test rate is about 8.5 percent, among the
highest in months.

Mr. Stitt has been slow to embrace measures recommended by public health
experts, such as issuing stay-at-home orders and mandating face
coverings in public. While he shut down businesses in the state this
spring, he is [among a handful of
governors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-states-without-stay-home.html)
who never issued formal orders for residents to stay at home during the
pandemic, and he only recently encouraged Oklahomans to wear masks.

He briefly wore a face covering at a news conference on June 30, the
first time he had appeared at a news briefing wearing a mask since the
pandemic began, [The Oklahoman
reported.](https://oklahoman.com/article/5665748/gov-kevin-stitt-urges-oklahomans-to-wear-masks-in-public)
“It’s this easy,” he was quoted as saying.

On Wednesday, the governor said he had no plans to roll back the state’s
reopening or to mandate the use of masks, which he said are matters of
personal responsibility and not within the purview of government. “You
can’t pick and choose what freedoms you are going to give people,” Mr.
Stitt said. “This is something that could be with us for the next 24
months. I don’t think Americans, Oklahomans particularly, want to bunker
in place for the next 24 months.”

Mr. Stitt said he did not have a fever, was self-isolating away from his
family and would be working from home. His wife, Sarah, and their six
children have tested negative.

A member of the Cherokee Nation, Mr. Stitt is the first tribal citizen
to become governor of Oklahoma since the 1950s.

from Chicago.
