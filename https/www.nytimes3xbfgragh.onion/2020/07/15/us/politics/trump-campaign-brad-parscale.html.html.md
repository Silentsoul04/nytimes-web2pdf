# Trump Replaces Brad Parscale as Campaign Manager, Elevating Bill Stepien

</div>

The replacement of Mr. Parscale with Mr. Stepien, who had served as
deputy campaign manager, comes as the president has struggled in public

[President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
on Wednesday shook up his re-election team with less than four months
until November’s vote, replacing his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, in
an acknowledgment of the president’s [diminished
standing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/upshot/poll-2020-biden-battlegrounds.html)
in nearly all public and private polling since the spring.

Mr. Parscale, who was named campaign manager unusually early, in
February 2018, will step out of the job and [Bill
Stepien](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/bill-stepien.html),
currently the deputy campaign manager and a veteran political operative,
will take over. Mr. Parscale will stay on with the campaign, becoming a
senior adviser for data and digital operations.

The move comes as Mr. Trump’s advantages as an incumbent president have
eroded in the face of a pandemic that has killed over [137,000
Americans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
and battered the nation’s economy — once Mr. Trump’s most powerful
argument for re-election. The president has been heavily criticized for
[his handling of the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html)
and the halting federal response to it, and Mr. Trump’s own public
comments have deepened the hole in which he finds himself in national
and battleground state polling.

[Several new
polls](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html)released
Wednesday showed Mr. Trump trailing the presumptive Democratic nominee,
[Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),
by double digits, and in one of them, 62 percent of respondents said
they believed Mr. Trump was “hurting rather than helping” efforts to
combat the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I am pleased to announce that Bill Stepien has been promoted to the
role of Trump campaign manager,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “Brad
Parscale, who has been with me for a very long time and has led our
tremendous digital and data strategies, will remain in that role, while
being a senior adviser to the campaign. Both were heavily involved in
our historic 2016 win, and I look forward to having a big and very
important second win
together.”

Mr. Trump is often described as his own campaign manager, and his
political operation, which is overseen by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law
and a senior White House adviser, has been tailored to his desires.

In recent weeks, as the Trump team has tried to regain its footing, Mr.
Trump brought back Jason Miller, a communications and political
strategist who was a key figure on his 2016 campaign. The president also
elevated Mr. Stepien, who had been a top adviser, to deputy campaign
manager in May, giving him a more expansive role in operations. Mr.
Stepien maintains a low profile, which Mr. Trump prefers, and something
Mr. Parscale did not do.

Mr. Miller and Mr. Stepien have been working closely with another 2016
veteran, Hope Hicks, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump in the White House
who handles his schedule. Another veteran of 2016 whom Mr. Trump likes,
Susie Wiles, a Florida-based Republican operative, was recently brought
back to the campaign.

A person familiar with the planning said there might still be another
addition to the team, such as a campaign chairman.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kushner, in a brief interview, described both Mr. Parscale and Mr.
Stepien — both of whom he hired — as key pieces of the 2016 campaign as
well as the current one. Mr. Parscale was a digital adviser in 2016. Mr.
Stepien, who had been a top political adviser to Gov. Chris Christie of
New Jersey, joined as the Trump campaign’s national field director in
August 2016.

That year, Mr. Trump cycled through several leadership teams, starting
with Roger J. Stone Jr. and then Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort.
The final shake-up came in August 2016, when Kellyanne Conway became the
campaign manager and Stephen K. Bannon [became the campaign chief
executive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/18/us/politics/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-paul-manafort.html).

Throughout the 2020 re-election effort, Mr. Kushner has served as the de
facto campaign manager, according to several people involved in the
effort. He was a key figure in replacing Mr. Parscale.

Mr. Parscale is closely connected to various aspects of the campaign
that he built along with the Republican National Committee. Among the
campaign components that Mr. Parscale set up was the digital
fund-raising apparatus, which gave the president a cushion over the last
few months, when in-person, high-dollar events were impossible to hold
because of the virus.

But for over a year, Mr. Parscale has been the focus of intense scrutiny
and news coverage about his operation and whether he was making an
outsize amount of money from the campaign. Those articles have focused
attention on his purchases of property and cars in Florida, where he
lives, and became a source of irritation for the president, who saw them
as a distraction.

Mr. Parscale was also visible in ways that campaign managers typically
aren’t, appearing in a campaign ad and having his name listed on
fund-raising events.

The president at times berated Mr. Parscale over real and perceived
transgressions, sometimes screaming at him and once threatening to sue
him.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Parscale, who was handpicked by Mr. Kushner and who is close to the
Trump family, lasted longer in the job than most of the people who led
various iterations of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. And campaign aides
emphasized that Mr. Parscale was being asked to stay on, unlike others
who have been let go from the Trump orbit.

Mr. Biden’s campaign seized on the Trump team’s move. “Almost 140,000
Americans have lost their lives and millions more have lost their jobs
because of Donald Trump’s failed leadership,” Andrew Bates, a campaign
spokesman, said in a statement. “The Trump campaign’s game of musical
chairs won’t fix this.”

But Mr. Parscale has no background in politics, and he suffered
something of a mortal wound in the role three weeks ago when a
much-hyped rally in Tulsa, Okla., to “reboot” Mr. Trump’s campaign [was
sparsely
attended](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html).
After Mr. Parscale boasted of nearly one million ticket requests, just
over 6,000 people attended the June 20 event, an embarrassment that Mr.
Trump could not let go of.

The campaign changes had been settled on over the last two days and were
set to be announced on Thursday morning at a 10 a.m. staff meeting, but
word of the moves began reaching reporters on Wednesday evening. Mr.
Parscale was said to have been caught by surprise, and learned of them
only a short time before they became public.

Other senior staff members were also caught by
surprise.
