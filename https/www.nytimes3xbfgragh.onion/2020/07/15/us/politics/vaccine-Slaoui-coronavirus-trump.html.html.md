Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser for the Trump administration’s

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — The scientist leading the Trump administration’s
[coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
program will be allowed to remain a government contractor, a decision
that permits him to avoid ethics disclosures required of federal
employees and maintain his investments in pharmaceutical companies.

Two prominent watchdog groups as well as some Democrats in Congress had
called for the Department of Health and Human Services to require that
the scientist, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a venture capitalist and a former
executive at the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, fall under the
same ethics rules as federal employees.

The office of the inspector general at H.H.S. responded this week that
it could not require such a shift, citing the unusual role that Dr.
Slaoui was playing in the administration amid the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the chief adviser for the vaccine program — called Operation Warp
Speed — Dr. Slaoui is working on a contract that pays him $1. Under the
arrangement, he is exempt from federal disclosure rules that would
require him to list his outside positions, stock holdings and other
potential conflicts of interest.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That arrangement has alarmed lawmakers, who have accused H.H.S. of
helping Dr. Slaoui, an expert in molecular biology and immunology, duck
the usual accountability required of government employees.

The groups that filed the May complaint, Public Citizen and Lower Drug
Prices Now, argued for Dr. Slaoui to be classified as a “special
government employee,” a tag that allows the federal government to hire
outside experts for up to 130 days. The title would make him subject to
ethics rules that also apply to regular government
employees.

The $1 contract, [the groups
said](https://www.citizen.org/article/covid-19-vaccine-czar-moncef-slaoui-should-be-classified-as-a-special-government-employee/),
appears “designed primarily to allow Slaoui to maintain an extensive web
of conflicting financial interests without the need to divest of, recuse
from or disclose those conflicting interests” and “provides Slaoui with
the opportunity to enrich himself, his colleagues and his employers.”

In its reply to the groups, an official in the inspector general’s
office said that Dr. Slaoui’s appointment is expected to stretch beyond
200 days, well past what it said was the “applicable statutory time
limit” for a special government employee.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The inspector general’s office “is not in a position to determine that
the department’s decision was unreasonable when it pursued options other
than an S.G.E. appointment,” the letter, dated July 13, concluded.

In his role, Dr. Slaoui has significant influence over financial
commitments made by the government, which [has so far provided little
information](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/health/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-warp-speed.html)
about Warp Speed’s resources, which agencies the funding is coming from
or how decisions are being made.

“The basic idea that he’s in a really privileged position with lots of
resources to command and that he has a personal financial stake in the
industry is really challenging,” said Margarida Jorge, the campaign
director for Lower Drug Prices Now. **“**Everyone can appreciate that
Slaoui has expertise in the development of vaccines, but expertise and
ethics should not be mutually exclusive.”

A group of Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts, separately
[wrote](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.06.15%20Letter%20about%20Operation%20Warp%20Speed%20conflicted%20adviser%20arrangement.pdf)
last month to Alex M. Azar II, the health secretary, asking for Dr.
Slaoui to be designated a special government employee. They called Dr.
Slaoui’s contract “an attempted end-run around federal ethics rules.”

Ms. Jorge said that her organization and other watchdog groups were
planning to meet Wednesday afternoon to discuss new ways to challenge
Dr. Slaoui’s status.

The Trump administration has invested nearly $4 billion in companies
pursuing coronavirus vaccines. Last week, H.H.S. announced that the
federal government will pay Novavax, a Maryland company that has never
brought a product to market, $1.6 billion to expedite the development of
a [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/health/coronavirus-nasal-vaccines.html).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Dr. Slaoui spent his first days on the job in May [trying to
disentangle](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html)
pieces of his stock portfolio and other ties to pharmaceutical
interests. Before working for the Trump administration, he sat on the
board of Moderna, a biotechnology firm pursuing a coronavirus vaccine.
He sold his shares in the company after the value of his stock holdings
soared following the release of preliminary vaccine trial data.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Trump administration said at the time that Dr. Slaoui would donate
the increased value to cancer research.

In [an
interview](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html)
in May, Dr. Slaoui said he was determined to avoid conflicts and would
re-evaluate any remaining associations if his financial interests stood
to gain more from his new post.

An H.H.S. spokeswoman reiterated on Wednesday that Dr. Slaoui resigned
from Moderna’s board and divested his equity, in addition to leaving
advisory boards of companies “with even the appearance of conflict.”

“H.H.S. ethics officers have determined Dr. Slaoui’s contractor status,
divestiture and board resignations put him in compliance with our robust
department ethical standards,” the spokeswoman said.

Soon after Dr. Slaoui was brought on to Project Warp Speed, its
leadership underwent further upheaval, in part because of his holdings,
according to senior administration officials.

Dr. Peter Marks, a renowned federal scientist who devised and initially
oversaw the Warp Speed project at the Food and Drug Administration,
stepped aside from his role as its lead vaccine specialist, in part
because of concern over what he saw as Dr. Slaoui’s potential conflicts
of interest, the officials said. Dr. Marks is the director of the
F.D.A.’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the office that
approves vaccines.
