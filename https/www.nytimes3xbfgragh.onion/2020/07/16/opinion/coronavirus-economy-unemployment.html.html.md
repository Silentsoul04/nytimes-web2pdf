Some of us [knew from the
beginning](https://krugman.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/11/the-long-haul/)
that Donald Trump wasn’t up to the job of being president, that he
wouldn’t be able to deal with a crisis that wasn’t of his own making.
Still, the magnitude of America’s coronavirus failure has shocked even
the cynics.

At this point Florida alone has an [average daily death
toll](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/all-metrics-per-state)
roughly equal to that of the whole [European
Union](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&deathsMetric=true&dailyFreq=true&smoothing=7&country=USA~EuropeanUnion&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc),
which has 20 times its population.

How did this happen? One key element in our deadly debacle has been
extreme shortsightedness: At [every stage of the
crisis](https://twitter.com/TBPInvictus/status/1281256803788107776)
Trump and his allies refused to acknowledge or get ahead of disasters
everyone paying attention clearly saw coming.

Blithe denials that Covid-19 posed a threat gave way to blithe denials
that rapid reopening would lead to a new surge in infections; now that
the surge is upon us, Republican governors are responding sluggishly and
grudgingly, while the White House is doing nothing at all.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And now another disaster — this time economic rather than
epidemiological — is just days away.

<div class="css-1q1hscp">

</div>

</div>

To understand the cliff we’re about to plunge over, you need to know
that while America’s overall handling of Covid-19 was catastrophically
bad, one piece — the economic response — was actually better than many
of us expected. The [CARES
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/us/coronavirus-senate-stimulus-package.html),
largely devised by Democrats but enacted by a bipartisan majority late
in March, had flaws in both design and implementation, yet it did a lot
both to alleviate hardship and to limit the economic fallout from the
pandemic.

In particular, the act provided vastly increased aid to workers idled by
lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. U.S.
unemployment insurance is normally a weak protection against adversity:
Many workers aren’t covered, and even those who are usually receive only
a small fraction of their previous wages. But the CARES Act both
expanded coverage, for example to gig workers, and sharply increased
benefits, adding $600 to every recipient’s weekly check.

These enhanced benefits did double duty. They meant that there was far
less misery than one might otherwise have expected from a crisis that
temporarily eliminated [22 million
jobs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS); by some measures
poverty [actually
declined](https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/new-poverty-measure-confirms-coronavirus-driven-federal-stimulus-measures-were).

They also helped sustain those parts of the economy that *weren’t*
locked down. Without those emergency benefits, laid-off workers would
have been forced to slash spending across the board. This would have
generated a whole second round of job loss and economic contraction, as
well as creating a huge wave of missed rental payments and evictions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So enhanced unemployment benefits have been a crucial lifeline to tens
of millions of Americans. Unfortunately, all of those beneficiaries are
now just a few days from being thrown overboard.

For that $600 weekly supplement — which accounts for
[most](https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2020-06/Effects-of-Selected-Federal-Pandemic-Response-Programs-on-Personal-Income-May-2020.pdf)
of the expansion of benefits — applies only to benefit weeks that end
“[on or before
July 31](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/additional-600-unemployment-payment-expiration-date-looms-near).”
July 31 is a Friday. State unemployment benefit weeks typically end on
Saturday or Sunday. So the supplement will end, in most places, on
[July 25
or 26](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/the-extra-600-unemployment-benefits-will-end-before-july-31.html),
and millions of workers will see their incomes plunge 60 percent or more
just a few days from now.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two months have gone by since the House passed a [relief
measure](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6800)
that would, among other things, extend enhanced benefits through the
rest of the year. But neither Senate Republicans nor the White House has
shown any sense of urgency about the looming crisis. Why?

Part of the answer is that Trump and his officials are, as always, far
behind the coronavirus curve. They’re still talking about a rapid,
[V-shape
recovery](https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1282349502284865536)
that will bring us quickly back to full employment, making special aid
to the unemployed unnecessary; they’re apparently oblivious to what
everyone else sees — an economy that is [stumbling
again](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/business/economy/economic-recovery-coronavirus-resurgence.html)
as the coronavirus surges back.

Delusions about the state of the economic recovery, in turn, allow
conservatives to indulge in one of their favorite [zombie
ideas](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324005018) — that helping the
unemployed in a depressed economy hurts job creation, by discouraging
people from taking jobs.

Worrying about employment incentives in the midst of a pandemic is even
crazier than worrying about those incentives in the [aftermath of a
financial
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/07/05/opinion/05krugman.html),
but it seems to be at the core of White House
[thinking](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1282737752828764161)
(or maybe that’s “thinking”) about economic policy right now.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One last thing: My sense is that Republicans have a delusional view of
their own bargaining position. They don’t seem to realize that they, not
the Democrats, will be blamed if millions are plunged into penury
because relief is delayed; to the extent that they’re willing to act at
all, they still imagine that they can extract concessions like a blanket
exemption of businesses from [pandemic
liability](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/13/politics/covid-aid-congress-mitch-mcconnell/index.html).

Maybe the prospect of catastrophe will concentrate Republican minds, but
it seems more likely that we’re heading for weeks if not months of
extreme financial distress for millions of Americans, distress that will
hobble the economy as a whole. This disaster didn’t need to happen; but
you can say the same thing about most of what has gone wrong in this
country lately.
