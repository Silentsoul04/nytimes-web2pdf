\textbf{First, we have a brief update on the pandemic:}

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/california-covid-19-cases.html}{California}
recorded its
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html}{highest
number of new cases} on Tuesday, exceeding 10,000 new cases in one day
for the first time, according to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html}{The
New York Times's database}.

New cases lag as an indication of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/california-covid-19-cases.html}{virus's}
spread, and state officials noted that testing had expanded. On Tuesday,
the state reported that \href{https://update.covid19.ca.gov/}{118,321
tests were conducted}.

Still, the milestone was disheartening for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/ca-coronavirus-covid-testing.html}{Californians}
hoping that the surging case numbers might slow as many counties
reinstated restrictions and the state ordered businesses to close.

On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html}{the
most marked rollback yet} of reopening plans. And on Tuesday, state
public health officials unveiled
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/ca-coronavirus-covid-testing.html}{new,
stricter Covid-19 testing guidelines} amid supply shortages and long
waits for results.

\textbf{Now, here's an update from Berkeley, by my colleague}
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/kellen-browning}{Kellen
Browning}:}

The Berkeley City Council on Wednesday morning moved forward with a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/us/berkeley-ca-police-department-reform.html}{first-in-the-nation
plan to prohibit the city's police officers} from conducting traffic
stops and instead train unarmed public works officials to pull over
drivers.

In a 8-0-1 **** virtual vote that occurred shortly before 3 a.m., after
hours of public comment, the Council directed the city manager to begin
studying how to enact a pilot program that would create a department of
transportation with civic officials who would stop drivers for
violations like failing to pause at a stop sign.

Researchers have found
\href{https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/}{widespread racial
bias} nationwide in whom police officers pull over, and proponents of
Berkeley's plan say removing armed cops from the mix would de-escalate
situations that have too often turned fatal for Black drivers.

``Berkeley took a brave action last night to begin the process of
de-policing traffic enforcement and ending pretext stops,'' said
Councilman Rigel Robinson, who proposed the legislation. ``The heaviest
work is ahead of us still, but we've begun a journey that every city in
America needs to make.''

Cities across the country are rethinking
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/us/ca-defund-police.html}{the
roles of law enforcement} agencies, but Berkeley appears to be the first
to seek a change to police officers' traffic enforcement duties. The
Council, which
\href{https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Berkeley-City-Council-passes-a-budget-with-9-2-15378662.php}{previously
cut} the city's Police Department budget by \$9.2 million, also
recommended other police reforms Tuesday night.

A Berkeley Police Department spokesman previously declined to comment on
the traffic proposal. But Sgt. Emily Murphy, the president of the
Berkeley Police Association, raised concerns with
\href{https://twitter.com/henrykleeKTVU/status/1283221786801262592?s=20}{local
television station KTVU} on Tuesday about unarmed public works officials
facing a drunken or armed driver.

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

\textbf{Today's piece, about a mother and daughter, Carolina Tovar and
Leticia Ramirez, was written by Ashley Njoroge:}

Carolina Tovar, 86, and her daughter Leticia Ramirez, 54, lived minutes
apart from each other in Rowland Heights, a community in the San Gabriel
Valley. Everyone in the family knew Ms. Ramirez was her mother's go-to:
She drove her to dialysis treatments, shopping and any place else she
needed to go. They were together so often that Ms. Ramirez's seven
brothers and sisters liked to joke that the two were best friends.

But the mother and daughter were miles apart at different hospitals when
they died of Covid-19 on April 3.

Ms. Ramirez became ill first, in late March, followed soon after by her
mother. Ms. Tovar instructed her family not to put her on a ventilator
if her condition worsened. Her husband, Antonio, had died last January,
months before their 70th anniversary. ``Just let me go,'' she said to
one of her children. ``The love of my life is gone. My kids are fine.''

On a FaceTime call with her family, she blew kisses and blessed each one
of them. They watched as she drew her last breath, with her youngest
daughter, Gina, at her bedside.

A few hours later in another hospital in Los Angeles County, Ms. Ramirez
would also die of Covid-19. Ms. Ramirez, who worked as a receptionist at
a real estate firm, leaves behind a husband and three children.

``We're going to miss them,'' Carol Padilla, Ms. Ramirez's niece, added.
``We're going to continue keeping the family together no matter what.''
