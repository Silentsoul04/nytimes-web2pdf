BANGKOK — No one knows exactly why Thailand has been spared.

Is it the social distancing embedded in Thai culture — the habit of
greeting others with a wai, a prayer-like motion, rather than a full
embrace — that has prevented the runaway transmission of the coronavirus
here?

Did Thailand’s early adoption of face masks, combined with a robust
health care system, blunt the virus’s impact? Was it the outdoor
lifestyle of many Thais, or their relatively low rates of pre-existing
conditions?

Is there a genetic component in which the immune systems of Thais and
others in the Mekong River region are more resistant to the coronavirus?
Or is it some alchemy of all these factors that has insulated this
country of 70 million people?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One thing is certain. Despite an influx of foreign visitors early in the
year from countries badly hit by the coronavirus, Thailand has recorded
fewer than 3,240 cases and 58 deaths. As of Thursday, there had been no
cases of local transmission for about seven weeks.

“I don’t think it is about immunity or genetics alone,” said Dr.
Taweesin Visanuyothin, the Covid-19 spokesman for Thailand’s Ministry of
Public Health. “It has to do with culture. Thai people do not have body
contact when we greet each other.”

“This is how the countries in the Mekong region greet each other as
well,” Dr. Taweesin
added.

It didn’t always look so upbeat. In January, Thailand confirmed the

have begun.

Another wave of infections was set off by people arriving from Japan,
Europe and the United States. A Thai boxing event turned into a
super-spreader event. But after a lockdown was enforced in March,
shuttering businesses and schools, domestic transmissions subsided. All
of Thailand’s recent cases have been among people who arrived from
overseas.

Dr. Wiput Phoolcharoen, a public health expert at Chulalongkorn
University in Bangkok who is researching an outbreak of the coronavirus
in Pattani in southern Thailand, noted that more than 90 percent of
those who tested positive there were asymptomatic, much higher than
normal.

“What we are studying now is the immune system,” he said.

Dr. Wiput said Thais and other people from this part of Southeast Asia
were more susceptible to certain serious cases of dengue fever, a
mosquito-borne virus, than those from other continents.

“If our immune systems against dengue are so bad, why can’t our immune
system against Covid be better?” he
asked.

Though Thailand’s hospitals have not been overwhelmed by coronavirus
patients, the country’s tourism-dependent economy has been battered.

In April, Thailand banned almost all incoming flights, amid the
tightening lockdown. Holidaymakers stopped coming to Bangkok, once the
world’s most visited city. The Thai tourism and sports ministry
estimates that 60 percent of hospitality businesses could close by the
end of the year.

The International Monetary Fund predicts the Thai economy will shrink by
at least 6.5 percent this year. More than eight million Thais may lose
their jobs or income in 2020, the World Bank has said, in a nation
already cleaved by a yawning gap between rich and poor.

Thai households have some of the highest debt loads in Asia, and the
most desperate have lined up at Buddhist temples for handouts of
rice.

        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The country’s large population of migrant workers, many from neighboring
Myanmar and Cambodia, is also hurting. While some people managed to make
it home before the borders closed, others are stuck in Thailand with no
wages from their jobs as hotel cleaners, kitchen hands and food stall
operators.

“Now is when people want more help because it’s been so long and it’s
not going to get better,” Ms. Natalie said.

A sense of normalcy has recently returned to Thailand. Schools have
reopened with children wearing face masks and studying at spaced-out
desks. And in early July, the first holiday weekend in months — Thai New
Year festivities were canceled in April — prompted an uptick in domestic
tourism.

Thailand has also allowed a trickle of foreigners back into the country.
But with the new arrivals comes the risk of contagion.

This week, an Egyptian military pilot was confirmed to have tested
positive for the coronavirus, after he breached quarantine and visited
shopping centers in a Thai beach town. Some schools in the area are now
closed again. Two activists who protested the government’s handling of
the quarantine violation were arrested on Wednesday for contravening
Thailand’s emergency decree.

Questions are also being raised about why migrant workers who were
deported from Thailand arrived home and immediately tested positive for
the disease, despite not being included in the official Thai count of
coronavirus cases. Thailand’s testing rates remain relatively low.

“With the disease still looming,” said Dr. Taweesin, the health ministry
spokesman, “we have to keep our guard
up.”
