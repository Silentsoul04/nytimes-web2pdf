Can the country's low rate of coronavirus infections be attributed to
culture? Genetics? Face masks? Or a combination of all three?

BANGKOK --- No one knows exactly why Thailand has been spared.

Is it the social distancing embedded in Thai culture --- the habit of
greeting others with a wai, a prayer-like motion, rather than a full
embrace --- that has prevented the runaway transmission of the
coronavirus here?

Did Thailand's early adoption of face masks, combined with a robust
health care system, blunt the virus's impact? Was it the outdoor
lifestyle of many Thais, or their relatively low rates of pre-existing
conditions?

Is there a genetic component in which the immune systems of Thais and
others in the Mekong River region are more resistant to the coronavirus?
Or is it some alchemy of all these factors that has insulated this
country of 70 million people?

One thing is certain. Despite an influx of foreign visitors early in the
year from countries badly hit by the coronavirus, Thailand has recorded
fewer than 3,240 cases and 58 deaths. As of Thursday, there had been no
cases of local transmission for about seven weeks.

Thailand's low rate of infection appears to be shared by other countries
in the Mekong River basin. Vietnam has not recorded a single death and
has logged about three months without a case of community transmission.
Myanmar has confirmed 336 cases of the virus, Cambodia 166 and Laos just
19.

Yunnan, the southwestern Chinese province through which the Mekong flows
before meandering to Southeast Asia, had fewer than 190 cases. None are
active now.

``I don't think it is about immunity or genetics alone,'' said Dr.
Taweesin Visanuyothin, the Covid-19 spokesman for Thailand's Ministry of
Public Health. ``It has to do with culture. Thai people do not have body
contact when we greet each other.''

``This is how the countries in the Mekong region greet each other as
well,'' Dr. Taweesin added.

It didn't always look so upbeat. In January, Thailand confirmed the
world's first case of the coronavirus outside of China --- in a tourist
from Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the outbreak is believed to
have begun.

Another wave of infections was set off by people arriving from Japan,
Europe and the United States. A Thai boxing event turned into a
super-spreader event. But after a lockdown was enforced in March,
shuttering businesses and schools, domestic transmissions subsided. All
of Thailand's recent cases have been among people who arrived from
overseas.

Dr. Wiput Phoolcharoen, a public health expert at Chulalongkorn
University in Bangkok who is researching an outbreak of the coronavirus
in Pattani in southern Thailand, noted that more than 90 percent of
those who tested positive there were asymptomatic, much higher than
normal.

``What we are studying now is the immune system,'' he said.

Dr. Wiput said Thais and other people from this part of Southeast Asia
were more susceptible to certain serious cases of dengue fever, a
mosquito-borne virus, than those from other continents.

``If our immune systems against dengue are so bad, why can't our immune
system against Covid be better?'' he asked.

Though Thailand's hospitals have not been overwhelmed by coronavirus
patients, the country's tourism-dependent economy has been battered.

In April, Thailand banned almost all incoming flights, amid the
tightening lockdown. Holidaymakers stopped coming to Bangkok, once the
world's most visited city. The Thai tourism and sports ministry
estimates that 60 percent of hospitality businesses could close by the
end of the year.

The International Monetary Fund predicts the Thai economy will shrink by
at least 6.5 percent this year. More than eight million Thais may lose
their jobs or income in 2020, the World Bank has said, in a nation
already cleaved by a yawning gap between rich and poor.

Thai households have some of the highest debt loads in Asia, and the
most desperate have lined up at Buddhist temples for handouts of rice.

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

After a promised disbursement of emergency government funds was bogged
down in bureaucracy, a woman swallowed rat poison outside of a
government building. She survived, but suicides are up in Thailand.

Covid Thailand Aid, a charity set up in the wake of the pandemic, has
been inundated by pleas from Thais with only a dollar or two left in
their bank accounts, said Natalie Narkprasert, one of the group's
founders.

The country's large population of migrant workers, many from neighboring
Myanmar and Cambodia, is also hurting. While some people managed to make
it home before the borders closed, others are stuck in Thailand with no
wages from their jobs as hotel cleaners, kitchen hands and food stall
operators.

``Now is when people want more help because it's been so long and it's
not going to get better,'' Ms. Natalie said.

A sense of normalcy has recently returned to Thailand. Schools have
reopened with children wearing face masks and studying at spaced-out
desks. And in early July, the first holiday weekend in months --- Thai
New Year festivities were canceled in April --- prompted an uptick in
domestic tourism.

Thailand has also allowed a trickle of foreigners back into the country.
But with the new arrivals comes the risk of contagion.

This week, an Egyptian military pilot was confirmed to have tested
positive for the coronavirus, after he breached quarantine and visited
shopping centers in a Thai beach town. Some schools in the area are now
closed again. Two activists who protested the government's handling of
the quarantine violation were arrested on Wednesday for contravening
Thailand's emergency decree.

Questions are also being raised about why migrant workers who were
deported from Thailand arrived home and immediately tested positive for
the disease, despite not being included in the official Thai count of
coronavirus cases. Thailand's testing rates remain relatively low.

``With the disease still looming,'' said Dr. Taweesin, the health
ministry spokesman, ``we have to keep our guard up.''
