# A New Sticker Aims to Signal Safe Dining in the Pandemic

For a fee, the nonprofit Safe Eats will help restaurants with health
guidelines and reassure customers. But so far, there’s no guarantee that
members will follow the
rules.

You recognize the New York City health department letter grade in the
restaurant window, and maybe even the Michelin seal. Now, you might also
want to look for a blue-and-white sticker that says “[Safe
Eats](https://www.safeats.org/).”

The sticker represents membership in a new nonprofit organization of the
same name, introduced Thursday, that has set standards for what it deems
to be the safe operation of restaurants for on-site dining, takeout and
delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The effort has started with a small collection of restaurants in New
York City. The chef Dan Kluger joined Safe Eats for his restaurant
[Loring
Place](https://www.google.com/search?q=Loring+Place+nyt&oq=Loring+Place+nyt&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.1030j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
in Greenwich Village, where he has been selling takeout meals and has
tables outdoors. He considers it to be a “response to often confusing
directions from government agencies.”

That is the main draw for restaurants: In the absence of consistent,
up-to-date government standards for safe restaurant operation during the
pandemic, Safe Eats provides a list of safety measures to follow. It is
also meant to reassure diners that the member restaurants have made a
commitment to follow those rules.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Safe Eats was started by Carlos Suarez, who owns a group of Greenwich
Village restaurants, including
[Rosemary’s](https://www.rosemarysnyc.com/) and
[Claudette](https://www.claudettenyc.com/); and Yann de Rochefort, the
founder of the [Boqueria](https://boqueriarestaurant.com/) chain in New
York and other cities. Also among the founders and participants in
management is [Zero Hour Health](https://www.zerohourhealth.com/), a
company that provides health and health-crisis management to
restaurants, partly through its app,
Zedic.

The organizers of Safe Eats said that they reached out to the office of
Mayor Bill de Blasio for input, but that the office showed no interest
in getting involved. The health department has its own list of
guidelines that restaurants can consult. “As the city continues to
reopen, we’re committed to helping our restaurants safely adapt to the
changing circumstances,” said Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mr. de
Blasio.

Roslyn Stone, the chief operating officer of Zero Hour Health, said the
rules are changing all the time. “No two days are the same,” she said.
“How can you keep up with it?”

Mr. Suarez said that he and Mr. de Rochefort were “spending so much time
trying to stay on top of all the latest Covid guidelines,” citing more
than a dozen agencies they had to monitor. “What if there was a single
source for safety guidelines that we could rely on? How great would that
be for us.”

In addition to providing the guidelines culled from government agencies
that member restaurants must agree to follow, Safe Eats also relies on
the expertise of Zero Hour Health and other restaurant consultants.

Restaurants, which pay $69 a month to join, must agree to comply with
the protocols. As of now, the organization does not inspect restaurants
for such compliance, though Mr. Suarez said that it intends to at some
point. Currently, diners just have to trust that participating
restaurants are actually complying with the regulations. “We’re keen to
start certification, but we don’t know when,” Mr. Suarez said.

Member restaurants also display a poster that lists the rules the
restaurant has pledged to follow and includes email contact for
consumers to provide feedback. ”The channel for complaints by consumers
or staff is there,” Mr. Suarez said. “It’s not perfect, but a great
first
step.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

For now the rules published by Safe Eats only apply to New York City
restaurants; those in other areas can join without knowing the details
that apply to their communities. Safe Eats hopes to expand into other
cities in the United States and abroad. In addition to the founders’
restaurants and [Loring Place](https://www.loringplacenyc.com/), members
include [Reverence](https://reverence.nyc/) in Harlem and Delicious
Hospitality’s [Charlie Bird](https://www.charliebirdnyc.com/), [Legacy
Records](https://www.legacyrecordsrestaurant.com/) and [Pasquale
Jones](https://www.pasqualejones.com/). Safe Eats has also been endorsed
by the New York Hospitality Alliance and the James Beard Foundation.

Other organizations, including trade groups like the National Restaurant
Association and the California Restaurant Association, have also
published guidance for safely operating during the health crisis, but
they do not require compliance or charge restaurants to be certified.
(The National Restaurant Association has had a restaurant management
certification course with a fee, but that has existed for many years and
was not designed for the pandemic.)
