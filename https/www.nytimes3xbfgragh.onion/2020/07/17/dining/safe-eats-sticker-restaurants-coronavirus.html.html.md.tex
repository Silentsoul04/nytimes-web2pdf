Pandemic}\label{a-new-sticker-aims-to-signal-safe-dining-in-the-pandemic}}

For a fee, the nonprofit Safe Eats will help restaurants with health
guidelines and reassure customers. But so far, there's no guarantee that
members will follow the rules.

You recognize the New York City health department letter grade in the
restaurant window, and maybe even the Michelin seal. Now, you might also
want to look for a blue-and-white sticker that says
``\href{https://www.safeats.org/}{Safe Eats}.''

The sticker represents membership in a new nonprofit organization of the
same name, introduced Thursday, that has set standards for what it deems
to be the safe operation of restaurants for on-site dining, takeout and
delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The effort has started with a small collection of restaurants in New
York City. The chef Dan Kluger joined Safe Eats for his restaurant
\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=Loring+Place+nyt\&oq=Loring+Place+nyt\&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.1030j0j7\&sourceid=chrome\&ie=UTF-8}{Loring
Place} in Greenwich Village, where he has been selling takeout meals and
has tables outdoors. He considers it to be a ``response to often
confusing directions from government agencies.''

That is the main draw for restaurants: In the absence of consistent,
up-to-date government standards for safe restaurant operation during the
pandemic, Safe Eats provides a list of safety measures to follow. It is
also meant to reassure diners that the member restaurants have made a
commitment to follow those rules.

Safe Eats was started by Carlos Suarez, who owns a group of Greenwich
Village restaurants, including
\href{https://www.rosemarysnyc.com/}{Rosemary's} and
\href{https://www.claudettenyc.com/}{Claudette}; and Yann de Rochefort,
the founder of the \href{https://boqueriarestaurant.com/}{Boqueria}
chain in New York and other cities. Also among the founders and
participants in management is
\href{https://www.zerohourhealth.com/}{Zero Hour Health}, a company that
provides health and health-crisis management to restaurants, partly
through its app, Zedic.

The organizers of Safe Eats said that they reached out to the office of
Mayor Bill de Blasio for input, but that the office showed no interest
in getting involved. The health department has its own list of
guidelines that restaurants can consult. ``As the city continues to
reopen, we're committed to helping our restaurants safely adapt to the
changing circumstances,'' said Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mr. de
Blasio.

Roslyn Stone, the chief operating officer of Zero Hour Health, said the
rules are changing all the time. ``No two days are the same,'' she said.
``How can you keep up with it?''

Mr. Suarez said that he and Mr. de Rochefort were ``spending so much
time trying to stay on top of all the latest Covid guidelines,'' citing
more than a dozen agencies they had to monitor. ``What if there was a
single source for safety guidelines that we could rely on? How great
would that be for us.''

In addition to providing the guidelines culled from government agencies
that member restaurants must agree to follow, Safe Eats also relies on
the expertise of Zero Hour Health and other restaurant consultants.

Safe Eats gives advice for operating during and after the pandemic,
offers training, guidance on monitoring employee health and daily
updates on regulations changes --- and gives restaurants the window
decal.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/17/dining/17virus-safeeats2/merlin_174633105_50c1b8b2-3005-4cf3-8a96-b974be8fb125-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Restaurants, which pay \$69 a month to join, must agree to comply with
the protocols. As of now, the organization does not inspect restaurants
for such compliance, though Mr. Suarez said that it intends to at some
point. Currently, diners just have to trust that participating
restaurants are actually complying with the regulations. ``We're keen to
start certification, but we don't know when,'' Mr. Suarez said.

Member restaurants also display a poster that lists the rules the
restaurant has pledged to follow and includes email contact for
consumers to provide feedback. ''The channel for complaints by consumers
or staff is there,'' Mr. Suarez said. ``It's not perfect, but a great
first step.''

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

For now the rules published by Safe Eats only apply to New York City
restaurants; those in other areas can join without knowing the details
that apply to their communities. Safe Eats hopes to expand into other
cities in the United States and abroad. In addition to the founders'
restaurants and \href{https://www.loringplacenyc.com/}{Loring Place},
members include \href{https://reverence.nyc/}{Reverence} in Harlem and
Delicious Hospitality's \href{https://www.charliebirdnyc.com/}{Charlie
Bird}, \href{https://www.legacyrecordsrestaurant.com/}{Legacy Records}
and \href{https://www.pasqualejones.com/}{Pasquale Jones}. Safe Eats has
also been endorsed by the New York Hospitality Alliance and the James
Beard Foundation.

Other organizations, including trade groups like the National Restaurant
Association and the California Restaurant Association, have also
published guidance for safely operating during the health crisis, but
they do not require compliance or charge restaurants to be certified.
(The National Restaurant Association has had a restaurant management
certification course with a fee, but that has existed for many years and
was not designed for the pandemic.)
