# Brandis Kemp, Character Actress and ‘Fridays’ Original, Dies at 76

</div>

Ms. Kemp told comically gruesome fortunes on “Fridays” and made doctors’
lives miserable on “AfterMASH.” She died of a brain tumor and
complications of Covid-19.

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

If you were looking for insight into the future in the 1980s, you
probably wouldn’t want to pay $75 for a Creative Palm Reading.

In that [recurring sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzWfAdgnMXw)
on the late-night show
“[Fridays](https://www.vulture.com/2012/01/fridays-the-snl-ripoff-that-nearly-surpassed-the-original.html),”
a chain-smoking, sometimes deranged psychic played by Brandis Kemp was
sure to take one look at your palm and announce: “Things don’t look
good, man. Not at all. Man, am I bummed\!”

Ms. Kemp was the fashionably frizzy redhead in the sketch-comedy
ensemble of “Fridays” (1980-82), ABC’s answer to “Saturday Night Live,”
which also included Larry David, Michael Richards, Melanie Chartoff and
Ms. Kemp’s husband, [Mark
Blankfield](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0087578/).

One season later, viewers of
“[AfterMASH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIrHkcUgAKs)” (1983-85),
CBS’s “M\*A\*S\*H” sequel, loved to hate her as Alma Cox, the bossy
secretary at Colonel Potter and Corporal Klinger’s new hospital.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Kemp, known in private life as Sally Blankfield, died on July 4 at
her home in Los Angeles. She was 76. The cause was a brain tumor and
complications of Covid-19, according to a statement released by her
niece and two nephews.

The statement noted that Ms. Kemp had died on Independence Day, when the
full moon was in eclipse and fireworks were exploding. She “always knew
how to make an exit,” it said.

Vivian Sally Kemp was born on Feb. 1, 1944, in Palo Alto, Calif., one of
three children of John Lloyd Kemp, a World War I Marine Corps veteran
who died when she was 10, and Vida (Kernohan) Kemp, a hairdresser, who
raised the children alone.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After high school, Sally, as she was known, attended San Jose State
College, Stanford University, where she received an M.F.A. in theater
and literature, and the [American Conservatory
Theater](https://www.act-sf.org/) acting school in San Francisco.

One early job was teaching speech classes for police officers and
firefighters at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. By
the time she moved to Los Angeles, she was a member of Low Moan
Spectacular, a comedy troupe, and doing theater nationwide. She adopted
the name Brandis because there was already a Sally Kemp in Actors
Equity.

In the play “[Bullshot
Crummond](http://lowmoan.com/bullshot/page11.html)” (1978), she played
“the mistress and sometime daughter of the second-most-dangerous man
in Europe,” as the actor turned writer Gardner McKay explained in a
review for The Los Angeles Herald Examiner. “You might leave the
theater,” he suggested, “humming Brandis Kemp’s hideous, mocking laugh.”

Ms. Kemp spent two decades as a busy supporting actress. (Her character
names included Bob’s Mother, Miss Reba and A.A. Woman No. 3.) She made
guest appearances on hit series, including “The Golden Girls,” “E.R.,”
“The Wonder Years,” “Designing Women” and “Perfect Strangers.”

Her films included “Surf II” (1984), a comedy about mutant zombies;
“When a Man Loves a Woman” (1994), about love and alcoholism; and
“[Clifford](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.80a9f7b8-0c08-88ce-659a-3049f235f807?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvc_hbo&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvc_hbo-20)”
(1994), in which Martin Short played a 10-year-old. Her character was an
annoyed airline passenger.

Her final screen role was in the 2006 television movie “The Theory of
Everything” (not to be confused with the later film of the same name
about Stephen Hawking).

She met Mr. Blankfield at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. They married
in 1972 and divorced in 1987.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She was always hands-on, the actress Myra Turley, a longtime friend,
recalled. Last year, when the [stucco on her house needed to be
redone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnuznRkJtow), Ms. Kemp simply
“taught herself how to stucco, got on a ladder and did it
herself.”
