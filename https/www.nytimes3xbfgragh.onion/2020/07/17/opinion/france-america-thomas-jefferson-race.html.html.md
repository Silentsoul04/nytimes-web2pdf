PARIS — Perhaps the root of the mutual fascination that binds France and
the United States is that each sees itself as an idea, a model of some
kind for the rest of the world. This is an immodest but tenacious
notion, bound up with the founding articles and myths of both republics.
No other countries make such claims for the universality of their
virtue.

These are now unfashionable ideas, having their roots in the white
patriarchal societies of the late 18th century.

Beware of fashion. It may overcorrect. I will try to explain.

In France, [the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
Citizen](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/rightsof.asp), adopted
in 1789 as the expression of the ideals of the French Revolution, states
in its first article: “Men are born and remain free and equal in
rights.” The declaration defines these natural rights as “liberty,
property, security, and resistance against oppression,” and says that
liberty “consists of doing anything which does not harm others.”

Thirteen years earlier, in its Declaration of Independence, the United
States set out certain “self-evident” truths: “that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness.” The right to govern stemmed “from the consent of the
governed.” Over the ensuing 15 years, these ideas were enshrined in the
United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

France and the United States were intertwined as political allies, but
also as twinned sources of Enlightenment principles. Thomas Jefferson, a
slave owner, influenced the formulation of the French Declaration and
was an author of America’s founding laws.

The revolutions were sweeping. There was nothing “self-evident” about
them. Out with monarchy, in with “We the people.” Out with divine right,
in with human rights. Out with rule by edict, in with the separation of
powers and the rule of law. So, falteringly, began the liberal
democratic experiment, now under attack.

The experiment was as flawed as Jefferson himself. All men are created
equal. Sounds good, but what about women? ([A Declaration of the Rights
of Woman and the Female
Citizen](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-declaration-of-the-rights-of-woman-and-the-citizen)
was written in France in 1791 by the French feminist Olympe de Gouges.)
And what of Black slaves, their value set in the Constitution at 60
percent of a free human being? Let’s rephrase the sentence: *All white
male property owners are created equal*. Not much of a ring to it, but
has the merit of accuracy.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

And what of France, [trading in slaves well into the 19th
century](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/world/europe/france-george-floyd-racism-slave-trade.html&sa=D&ust=1595005716313000&usg=AFQjCNGxqT9Pi2mklxELxZ0kkuOVj1qY0g),
ushering Jews to emancipation through the principles of the revolution
only to contribute to their mass murder during World War II, fighting a
savage colonial war in Algeria between 1954 and 1962?

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So, a cry goes up. These pretensions of embodying ennobling ideals for
humankind were false, reflecting no more than the narrow worldview of
18th-century white males whose talk of equal rights was shot through
with exploitative hypocrisy.

The perfect becomes the enemy of the good. In an age of absolutist moral
certainty, the most conspicuous feature of humankind — its fallibility —
becomes unpardonable. Can a slave owner be celebrated for penning a
liberating sentence? How can a progressive socialist French president,
François Mitterrand, have been an official of the Vichy regime? Because
the second-most conspicuous feature of human beings is their
contradictory natures.

“I don’t think any people enjoys rooting around in the unpleasant parts
of their past,” Robert Paxton, a prominent American historian whose
groundbreaking work helped bring France to a full [understanding of the
crimes of the Vichy
regime](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1997/11/01/world/us-historian-relates-how-vichy-france-served-nazis.html),
told me. “Denial is often ineradicable. I think on the whole the French
came out of it quicker than we did.”

It took more than a half-century, until 1995, for France, in the person
of President Jacques Chirac, to acknowledge that the French state, and
not some handful of misguided Vichy operatives, [had “committed the
irreparable”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1995/07/17/world/chirac-affirms-france-s-guilt-in-fate-of-jews.html)
in sending some 76,000 French and foreign Jews to their deaths. It was
more than a half-century after France left Algeria that Emmanuel Macron,
while a candidate for the French presidency in 2017, called the French
colonization of Algeria “a crime against humanity” and later, as
president, acknowledged French “atrocities.”

The United States has never formally apologized for slavery. President
Clinton, in Africa more than two decades ago, [managed to say that “we
were
wrong”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1998/03/25/world/clinton-africa-overview-uganda-clinton-expresses-regret-slavery-us.html&sa=D&ust=1595008239423000&usg=AFQjCNGGXNqmVDJsq_LlHavJsYM61duUkQ)
to have “received the fruits of the slave trade.” That was all he could
muster.

Now, in the midst of another push to overcome America’s original sin,
would be a good moment for such an apology.

That, after all, is what democracies like France and the United States
are capable of: continuous adjustment, improvement, recognition of past
mistakes, atonement, progress toward their ideals. If they are, it is
thanks in large part to the flawed brilliance of the architects, direct
or indirect, of the two republics.

We can and should acknowledge their flaws without denigrating their
achievement in spreading the ideas of liberty, free expression and the
rule of law across the face of the earth. The words that issued from
Paris and Philadelphia between 1776 and 1791 have served the cause of
freedom, even if they were the product of minds and cultures foreign to
the Great Awokening of recent years, whose own chief flaw may prove to
be self-righteous intolerance.
