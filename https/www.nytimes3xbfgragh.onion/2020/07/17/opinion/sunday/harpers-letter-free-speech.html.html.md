<div class="css-53u6y8">

An acquaintance came to me a few weeks ago with the rough draft of a
letter about free speech and asked me to sign. I declined, in part
because it denounced “cancel culture.” As I wrote in an email, the
phrase “‘cancel culture,’ while it describes something real, has been
rendered sort of useless because it’s so often used by right-wing
whiners like Ivanka Trump who think protests against them violate their
free speech.”

A little later my acquaintance came back to me with a new version, which
didn’t mention “cancel culture.” Like the people who wrote the letter, I
think [left-wing
illiberalism](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/cancelcolbert-and-return-anti-liberal-left/)
is a problem, though I’ve mostly stopped writing about it since Donald
Trump was elected, because it seems like complaining about a bee sting
when you have Stage IV cancer.

So I signed. The statement, published in Harper’s Magazine as “[A Letter
on Justice and Open
Debate](https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/),”
spawned takes and countertakes, most of them, despite my modest effort,
about “cancel culture.”

At first I avoided wading into discourse about what’s now called the
Letter. It seemed self-indulgent to write about media angst when the
country is self-immolating because of unchecked disease and an economic
catastrophe that’s about to get much worse. But as the debate over free
speech grew and grew, I started to think I was using the burning world
as an excuse to avoid personal discomfort.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From my (privileged) vantage point, several things are happening
simultaneously. The mass uprising following the killing of George Floyd
has led to a necessary expansion of the boundaries of mainstream speech.
Space has been created for daring left-wing ideas, like abolishing the
police, that were once marginalized. Cultural institutions are reckoning
with the racism that leads to mostly white leadership.

At the same time, a climate of punitive heretic-hunting, a recurrent
feature of left-wing politics, has set in, enforced, in some cases,
through workplace discipline, including firings. It’s the involvement of
human resources departments in compelling adherence with rapidly
changing new norms of speech and debate that worries me the most.

In her [scathing
rejoinder](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/)
to the Letter in The Atlantic, Hannah Giorgis wrote, “Facing widespread
criticism on Twitter, undergoing an internal workplace review, or having
[one’s
book](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/american-dirt-controversy/605725/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo5rIn5fI6gIVDorICh1e2wb8EAAYASAAEgJl1_D_BwE)
[panned](https://www.bookforum.com/print/2603/thomas-chatterton-williams-s-confused-argument-for-a-post-racial-society-23610)
does not, in fact, erode one’s constitutional rights or endanger a
liberal society.”

This sentence brought me up short; one of these things is not like the
others. Anyone venturing ideas in public should be prepared to endure
negative reviews and pushback on social media. Internal workplace
reviews are something else. If people fear for their livelihoods for
relatively minor ideological transgressions, it may not violate the
Constitution — the workplace is not the state — but it does create a
climate of self-censorship and grudging conformity.

One of the more egregious recent examples of left-wing illiberalism is
the firing of David Shor, a data analyst at the progressive consulting
firm Civis Analytics. Amid the protests over Floyd’s killing, Shor was
called out online for tweeting about work by Omar Wasow, an assistant
professor of politics at Princeton, that shows a link between violent
protest in the 1960s and Richard Nixon’s vote share.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shor was accused of “anti-Blackness” for seeming to suggest, via Wasow’s
research, that violent protest is counterproductive. (Wasow is Black.)
“At least some employees and clients of Civis Analytics complained
that Shor’s tweet threatened their safety,”
[reported](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/case-for-liberalism-tom-cotton-new-york-times-james-bennet.html)
New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait. After an internal review, Shor was
let go; he was also [kicked
off](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/white-fragility-racism-racism-progressive-progressphiles-david-shor.html)
a progressive industry listserv.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Civis has denied that Shor was fired for a tweet, but an employee [told
The Atlantic’s Yascha
Mounk](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/stop-firing-innocent/613615/)
that the company’s chief executive said, in a staff meeting, “something
along the lines of freedom of speech is important, but he had to take a
stand with our staff, clients, and people of color.”

It should be said that many people on the left, including some who are
often dismissive of the idea of left-wing illiberalism, condemned Shor’s
firing. Surely one reason this episode has been invoked so often is that
there aren’t many comparable examples of such obvious social justice
overreach.

Still, there’s no question that many people feel intimidated. John
McWhorter, an associate professor of English and comparative literature
at Columbia who signed the Harper’s Letter, told me that in recent days
he’s heard from over 100 graduate students and professors, most of them
left of center, who fear for their professional prospects if they get on
the wrong side of left-wing opinion.

Some on the left have argued, fairly, that those worried about people
losing their jobs for running afoul of progressive orthodoxies should do
more to strengthen labor protections, since all sorts of employees are
vulnerable to capricious termination.

In a much-discussed essay on what he called “reactionary liberalism,”
[The New
Republic’s](https://newrepublic.com/article/158346/willful-blindness-reactionary-liberalism)
Osita Nwanevu wrote, “In practice, workers of all stripes often lack the
means and opportunity to defend themselves from unjust firings⁠ — all
the more reason for those preoccupied with ‘cancel culture’ and social
media-driven dismissals to support just-cause provisions and an end to
at-will employment.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This is true; as [Zaid Jilani wrote
recently](https://www.persuasion.community/p/a-better-remedy-for-cancel-culture),
“If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons,
Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views
might cost them their livelihoods.” But it seems strange to me to argue
that in the absence of better labor law, the left is justified in taking
advantage of precarity to punish people for political disagreements.

None of this is an argument for a totally laissez-faire approach to
speech; some ideas *should* be stigmatized.

I recently spoke to Wasow about the reaction to Shor tweeting his paper.
“Much of what we call ‘cancel culture’ is just culture,” he said.
“Culture has boundaries. Every community has boundaries. Those
boundaries are always shifting. In the age of the internet, they move
faster, and therefore where those boundaries are is less clear and less
stable, and it makes it easier for people to cross those lines.”

But it’s a problem when the range of proscribed speech is so wide that
the rules are hard to even explain to those not steeped in left-wing
mores.

Writing in the 1990s, at a time when feminists like Catharine MacKinnon
sought to curtail free speech in the name of equality, the great
left-libertarian Ellen Willis described how progressive movements sow
the seeds of their own destruction when they become censorious. It’s
impossible, Willis wrote, “to censor the speech of the dominant without
stifling debate among all social groups and reinforcing orthodoxy within
left movements. Under such conditions a movement can neither integrate
new ideas nor build support based on genuine transformations of
consciousness rather than guilt or fear of ostracism.”

It’s not always easy to draw a clear line between what Willis described
as “reinforcing orthodoxy” and agitating to make language and society
more democratic and inclusive. As Nicholas Grossman pointed out in [Arc
Digital](https://arcdigital.media/free-speech-defenders-dont-understand-the-critique-against-them-4ed8327c0879),
most signatories to the Letter probably agree that it’s a good thing
that the casual use of racist and homophobic slurs is no longer socially
acceptable. “But those changes came about through private sanction,
social pressure and cultural change, driven by activists and younger
generations,” he wrote.

Willis reminds us that when these changes were happening, the right
denounced them as violations of free expression. Of the conservative
campaign against political correctness in the 1990s, she wrote,
“Predictably, their valid critique of left authoritarianism has segued
all too smoothly into a campaign of moral intimidation,” one “aimed at
demonizing egalitarian ideas, per se, as repressive.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The same is happening today; the president throws tantrums about “cancel
culture” while regularly trying to use the power of the state to quash
speech he dislikes. Because Trump poisons everything he touches, his
movement’s hypocritical embrace of the mantle of free speech threatens
to devalue it, turning it into the rhetorical equivalent of “All Lives
Matter.”

But to let this occur is to surrender what has historically been a
sacred left-wing value. One reason many on the right want to be seen as
free speech defenders is that they understand that the power to break
taboos can be even more potent than the power to create them. Even
sympathetic people will come to resent a left that refuses to make
distinctions between deliberate slurs, awkward mistakes and legitimate
disagreements. Cowing people is not the same as converting them.
