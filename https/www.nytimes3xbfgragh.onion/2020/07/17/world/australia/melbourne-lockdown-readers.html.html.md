[*The Australia
Letter*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline)
*is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau.*

-----

[*Last week’s letter, about the mood in
Melbourne*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/world/australia/melbourne-lockdown.html)
*during our second strict lockdown, prompted a flood of feedback from
readers. People shared with us how they’re coping, thanked us for
mirroring their perspective and criticized us for a lack of
self-awareness. Here is a sampling of those reader responses:*

During the first lockdown, we were all truly “in this together.” Now
it’s just metro Melbourne and the comments from the rest of the
country do make it feel like we’ve done something wrong here, although I
don’t think Melburnians have been more complacent than other parts of
the country. Having gyms close again was really rough. The first time I
went to the gym since they shut, I felt better than I had since March.

That said, we’re going to get through this stronger. It was pretty
likely that this was going to happen, so if we’re first in the country
to get our second wave (I don’t think we’ll be the last), let’s get on
with it. Last time, the never-ending uncertainty was rough, while at
least now I can circle a date in the calendar.

— **Kissairis Muñoz**

—

I missed my 75th birthday celebrations with my extended family, and our
50th wedding anniversary celebrations, thanks to COVID-19 isolation. So
sad. But then, there is next year to celebrate. Hopefully.

— **Joe Slaven, Townsville, Australia**

—

The piece on Melbourne was complete tripe that appears to be written by
some poor soul with no resilience and nothing to do but lay about
wallowing in their own self-pity. This is not reflective of all
Melburnians and I’d suggest not really indicative of most Melbourne
residents. Cozy “fires at the pub,” country trips in winter — what an
idealistic load of rubbish doing nothing other than to paint an
unrealistic picture of this city and it’s inhabitants\!

There is a stark difference between Lockdown 1.0 and Lockdown 2.0. The
first time around it seemed that everyone was making an effort to find
the funny, irreverent and touching moments to brighten all our days.
Then as lockdown started to ease, ugliness started to creep in; in
emotions, in behavior, in words, in government rhetoric. Now in
Melbourne there is very deep anger, anxiety and a sense of division.

So what do I do to try and remain positive?

I am spending less time watching the news, catching highlights and then
turning it off.

I am dipping into loved books and making my way through a backlog of new
potential favorites.

I am walking — no matter the weather. This is not
negotiable.

I am trying to pick up the phone and have conversations instead of
relying on texting and emails. I am touching base with my neighbors. I
am much less inclined to do this than last time, which means it is more
necessary.

I am giving myself the freedom to drink as much coffee as I need to get
through this.

Greetings from Houston, Texas, USA. I normally love these dispatches but
this one gives me pause. We here would love concerns about oysters and
champagne at home, missed sunny vacations and stalled pool laps. But
instead we are grappling with issues associated with a corrupt federal
government which refuses to protect its citizens, political debate
pertaining to masks, a surging virus and economic collapse. The author’s
complaints seem trite in comparison. I wish her concerns were the
problems of this country.

It was great to read the letter from Besha because something shines out
when somebody writes what is clearly the truth, the exact way she is
feeling.

I hope it engenders in all her readers, as it did for me, a feeling of
sympathy, a kind of loving feeling — and I hope that she and her fellow
Victorians discover something special and important in the next few
weeks.

Then, when it is all over, come up here to Queensland for a big hug.

I have always found winter to be daunting (I grew up on the Connecticut
shore — talk about gray, cold winters) and have generally huddled inside
for 12 Melbourne winters. But this year is something different. After
the vicious summer bushfires, the rain started, generous but not
imposing. It has kept on for months, and now Melbourne is green and lush
and sooooo gorgeous. With the help of recently purchased electric bikes,
my partner and I have discovered a vast network of bike and walking
paths from our base. Now those chilly days are simply \*days\* that we
might discover a new route or revisit a favorite.

I grieve for the lost connections and routines, and I am also deeply
grateful to live in a country that cares about people, and I’m knocked
off balance, and I’m worried about our collective mental health. What
helps right the balance for me are the joys of wending along a lush path
on a cool, bright afternoon, of seeing the full sky at sunset, and of
breathing and moving through the world. And having someone to share both
the lockdown and the exploration with — that makes most things just
fine.

— **Katherine Russell**

Today’s letter, bathed in self-pity and almost entirely lacking
perspective, is a paean to middle class self-centeredness. Boo hoo, you
can’t have fake Christmas. Where is the concern for people who are less
fortunate and therefore likelier to get sick and die? Oh, it rains a lot
in winter? Maybe we should take up a collection for your suffering
soul\!

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In parts of the US, we’ve been self-isolating since early March. Six
weeks sounds like a minute to me.

The author sees this new lockdown as something imposed rather than a
call to social good.

She’s swimming, all right. Swimming in blind privilege and self-pity.

I too dread Melbourne winters. I too plan special events or holidays
away to get us through it. I too am dreading another period of remote
learning for my daughter and I too celebrate a significant anniversary
and had planned on being in Spain, but then we thought Queensland, and
now it appears we will be in luck if we can go out for dinner.

There is something different about this lockdown than the first.
Something darker. I also feel the undercurrent among family and friends
— and yes, all those strangers on the internet — of anger,
frustration, darkness and fear.

I greatly appreciated your reminder that once this is done, it will
almost be spring.
