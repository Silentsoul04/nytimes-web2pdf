\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/world/australia/melbourne-lockdown.html}{\emph{Last
week's letter, about the mood in Melbourne}} \emph{during our second
strict lockdown, prompted a flood of feedback from readers. People
shared with us how they're coping, thanked us for mirroring their
perspective and criticized us for a lack of self-awareness. Here is a
sampling of those reader responses:}

During the first lockdown, we were all truly ``in this together.'' Now
it's just metro Melbourne and the comments from the rest of the country
do make it feel like we've done something wrong here, although I don't
think Melburnians have been more complacent than other parts of the
country. Having gyms close again was really rough. The first time I went
to the gym since they shut, I felt better than I had since March.

That said, we're going to get through this stronger. It was pretty
likely that this was going to happen, so if we're first in the country
to get our second wave (I don't think we'll be the last), let's get on
with it. Last time, the never-ending uncertainty was rough, while at
least now I can circle a date in the calendar.

I missed my 75th birthday celebrations with my extended family, and our
50th wedding anniversary celebrations, thanks to COVID-19 isolation. So
sad. But then, there is next year to celebrate. Hopefully.

--- \textbf{Joe Slaven, Townsville, Australia}

---

The piece on Melbourne was complete tripe that appears to be written by
some poor soul with no resilience and nothing to do but lay about
wallowing in their own self-pity. This is not reflective of all
Melburnians and I'd suggest not really indicative of most Melbourne
residents. Cozy ``fires at the pub,'' country trips in winter --- what
an idealistic load of rubbish doing nothing other than to paint an
unrealistic picture of this city and it's inhabitants!

--- \textbf{Mark Pepper}

---

There is a stark difference between Lockdown 1.0 and Lockdown 2.0. The
first time around it seemed that everyone was making an effort to find
the funny, irreverent and touching moments to brighten all our days.
Then as lockdown started to ease, ugliness started to creep in; in
emotions, in behavior, in words, in government rhetoric. Now in
Melbourne there is very deep anger, anxiety and a sense of division.

So what do I do to try and remain positive?

I am spending less time watching the news, catching highlights and then
turning it off.

I am dipping into loved books and making my way through a backlog of new
potential favorites.

I am walking --- no matter the weather. This is not negotiable.

I am trying to pick up the phone and have conversations instead of
relying on texting and emails. I am touching base with my neighbors. I
am much less inclined to do this than last time, which means it is more
necessary.

I am giving myself the freedom to drink as much coffee as I need to get
through this.

Greetings from Houston, Texas, USA. I normally love these dispatches but
this one gives me pause. We here would love concerns about oysters and
champagne at home, missed sunny vacations and stalled pool laps. But
instead we are grappling with issues associated with a corrupt federal
government which refuses to protect its citizens, political debate
pertaining to masks, a surging virus and economic collapse. The author's
complaints seem trite in comparison. I wish her concerns were the
problems of this country.

--- \textbf{Dana M. Gannon}

It was great to read the letter from Besha because something shines out
when somebody writes what is clearly the truth, the exact way she is
feeling.

I hope it engenders in all her readers, as it did for me, a feeling of
sympathy, a kind of loving feeling --- and I hope that she and her
fellow Victorians discover something special and important in the next
few weeks.

Then, when it is all over, come up here to Queensland for a big hug.

I have always found winter to be daunting (I grew up on the Connecticut
shore --- talk about gray, cold winters) and have generally huddled
inside for 12 Melbourne winters. But this year is something different.
After the vicious summer bushfires, the rain started, generous but not
imposing. It has kept on for months, and now Melbourne is green and lush
and sooooo gorgeous. With the help of recently purchased electric bikes,
my partner and I have discovered a vast network of bike and walking
paths from our base. Now those chilly days are simply *days* that we
might discover a new route or revisit a favorite.

I grieve for the lost connections and routines, and I am also deeply
grateful to live in a country that cares about people, and I'm knocked
off balance, and I'm worried about our collective mental health. What
helps right the balance for me are the joys of wending along a lush path
on a cool, bright afternoon, of seeing the full sky at sunset, and of
breathing and moving through the world. And having someone to share both
the lockdown and the exploration with --- that makes most things just
fine.

--- \textbf{Katherine Russell}

Today's letter, bathed in self-pity and almost entirely lacking
perspective, is a paean to middle class self-centeredness. Boo hoo, you
can't have fake Christmas. Where is the concern for people who are less
fortunate and therefore likelier to get sick and die? Oh, it rains a lot
in winter? Maybe we should take up a collection for your suffering soul!

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for

    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

In parts of the US, we've been self-isolating since early March. Six
weeks sounds like a minute to me.

The author sees this new lockdown as something imposed rather than a
call to social good.

She's swimming, all right. Swimming in blind privilege and self-pity.

I too dread Melbourne winters. I too plan special events or holidays
away to get us through it. I too am dreading another period of remote
learning for my daughter and I too celebrate a significant anniversary
and had planned on being in Spain, but then we thought Queensland, and
now it appears we will be in luck if we can go out for dinner.

There is something different about this lockdown than the first.
Something darker. I also feel the undercurrent among family and friends
--- and yes, all those strangers on the internet --- of anger,
frustration, darkness and fear.

I greatly appreciated your reminder that once this is done, it will
almost be spring.
