# Are You Eligible for Food Stamps Now? Maybe, but It’s Complex

States run SNAP, and many students and older people don’t realize
they’re eligible. Without more federal support, millions more may
qualify.

The safety net is starting to unravel.

At the end of the month, struggling Americans could lose the extra $600
per week they’ve been receiving in unemployment insurance. Some
[eviction
protections](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/your-money/coronavirus-eviction-prevention-renters-landlord.html)
are already expiring.

And as people scramble to afford basic needs, hunger looms.

Tens of millions of Americans are in danger. According to Census Bureau
[Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/householdpulsedata) data released
this week, [10.8
percent](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?measures=FIR) of
American adults are experiencing some level of food insecurity.
Louisiana, Nevada and Ohio had the highest rates: 17 to 18 percent. Food
lines have been a feature of newspaper front pages and home pages for
months now.

And yet there is a program that may be able to help millions of
struggling Americans. One that was underused even before the coronavirus
crisis: food stamps, or as they are known in most places now, the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Policy experts and social services administrators are hoping that
everyone whose income has gone to zero or close to it will at least ask.
“If you’ve never accessed these benefits before, it may be because of
the way that SNAP in particular has been portrayed or vilified,” said
Carlos M. Rodriguez, president and chief executive of the Community
FoodBank of New Jersey, which [helps
people](https://cfbnj.org/findfood/) sign up for SNAP. “People do not
understand that this program is here for them at this exact time.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

SNAP is overseen by the Department of Agriculture, which lays out the
rules. States handle applications and administration, and they have some
leeway with the federal regulations. (And with the terms:
[Missouri](https://mydss.mo.gov/food-assistance/food-stamp-program)
still uses the older “food stamp” phrasing.)

As a result, it’s possible to offer some general guidelines for
understanding how the program works, but your state has the final word.
The rules are numerous and complicated, but there are exceptions and
waivers that might apply to you — so don’t be
deterred.

## Am I eligible?

In the 2018 fiscal year, [39.7 million
people](https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/Characteristics2018-Summary.pdf)
qualified in an average month. To do so, they usually had to pass both
income tests and asset tests, though households with elderly or disabled
people may face less strict rules.

In most places, someone living alone can have a gross monthly income of
no more than $1,354 and a net income of $1,041. For a family of four,
the gross income limit is $2,790 while the net income limit is $2,146.
The Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture lists
these limits and many other rules on its website via a [SNAP frequently
asked questions
page](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/recipient/eligibility).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Net income figures account for deductions that the program allows. Those
deductions include allowances for earnings (to encourage work),
dependent care, certain medical expenses and unusually large housing
costs. Applicants generally have to provide documentation.

Money you receive from unemployment payments may reduce or eliminate
your SNAP eligibility. Still, if unemployment is your only income and
you have few assets, it’s worth applying for SNAP to see if you qualify.

The cap on assets is $2,250, or $3,500 if a household has someone 60 or
older or someone with a disability. Homes and most retirement plan
balances don’t count. Vehicles can count, though states have leeway to
set those rules.

## Is there a work requirement?

Yes, [two of them](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/work-requirements).

First, if you’re between the ages of 16 and 59, you’re supposed to
enroll in relevant state training programs, accept suitable offers of
employment and not quit voluntarily or choose to work less than 30 hours
per week. But there are exceptions, including for people caring for
children under 6 years old or incapacitated adults, and those who have a
physical or mental limitation or are participating regularly in a drug
or alcohol treatment program.

There’s another set of rules for people between the ages of 18 and 49
who are both able bodied and have no dependents, including working or
participating in a work program at least 80 hours per month. You can
read more about them on the Department of Agriculture’s
[website](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/work-requirements-policies).

Waivers sometimes apply to work rules as well, which is why it’s
important to apply for SNAP if you’re not sure how your own work
situation applies, instead of just assuming that you’re ineligible.

## How does the application work?

You apply through your state. The Department of Agriculture has a
[map-based directory](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory) on
its website, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities [has
collected](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snap-state-by-state-data-fact-sheets-and-resources)
additional state-by-state information.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For people with no internet access, SNAP’s phone number is
1-800-221-5689. There or via the 211 phone service in many areas, you
can likely find a state program’s phone number.

Most states have online applications and calculators that screen for
eligibility. The application process usually includes an interview,
which can often happen over the phone. The process is supposed to take
no more than 30 days, and it could take less than a week if your income
or assets are particularly low.

To gain access to benefits, you’ll use an electronic benefit transfer
card that works like a debit card in grocery stores. You’ll need to be
ready to recertify eligibility from time to time, which can be a major
obstacle for struggling individuals who may also be trying to navigate
uncertain unemployment schedules or commute without a reliable
vehicle.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“A lot of people roll off at that point,” said Pamela Herd, a Georgetown
University professor and an expert on the “[administrative
burdens](https://www.russellsage.org/publications/administrative-burden)”
that keep otherwise eligible people from getting access to many public
programs.

## How much money might I get?

People who have less get more, but there are limits and they depend on
your family size.

The [maximum monthly
allotment](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/recipient/eligibility) for a
one-person household is $194. For a family of four, the cap is $646.
Cost-of-living adjustments may change those amounts in Alaska, Hawaii,
Guam and the Virgin Islands.

## Are college and graduate students eligible?

Sometimes, yes. A 2018 Government Accountability Office
[report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/696254.pdf) found that 57
percent of low-income students who seemed potentially eligible for SNAP
(and had at least one other additional factor that suggested they were
food insecure) did not report receiving SNAP benefits. That was about
1.8 million people.

Moreover, investigators found that state SNAP employees and some federal
officials admitted confusion about student eligibility rules.

SNAP rules generally keep students whose parents are supporting them (or
those on a meal plan) from getting benefits. Others who have little
income or assets should consult the Agriculture Department’s [bare-bones
guidance](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/students) and inquire further
with their state if they think they might qualify. The [Hope Center for
College, Community and
Justice](https://hope4college.com/about-the-hope-center/) at Temple
University has [a
guide](https://hope4college.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beyond-the-Food-Pantry-Student-Access-to-SNAP.pdf)
for colleges and universities that want to help students.

## What about Social Security recipients?

It depends. If you’re receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits,
you should definitely apply for SNAP. In many instances, someone from a
Social Security office may be able to help.

Some people receiving Social Security retirement benefits may be
eligible for SNAP, too, but as of 2015, [fewer than
half](https://www.fns.usda.gov/pressrelease/2015/020215) of eligible
older Americans were receiving benefits. The Department of Agriculture
has a [separate
section](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility/elderly-disabled-special-rules)
of its website laying out the different eligibility rules for elderly
and disabled people.

## Who can help me sign up?

Carrie R. Welton, director of policy at the Hope Center, a research and
advocacy group, said your first stop should still be the state agency
that determines eligibility. Caseworkers can be both helpful and
empathetic: Ms. Welton recalled her own time on public assistance, when
the person on the other side of the desk started to cry when she
realized that Ms. Welton would need to stop attending college full time
if she hoped to maintain her benefits.

Other organizations may be able to help. Part of Ms. Welton’s work
involves translating federal and state policy to help students who may
be eligible for SNAP and other benefits. College financial aid offices
may be able to assist students, too.

Help may also be available at your local food bank (several hundred
colleges and universities have food banks as well). You can find a food
bank near you using the ZIP code tool on [Feeding America’s
website](https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank).

“We’re pursuing the initiative to feed the people in the lines but help
shorten them as well,” said Mr. Rodriguez, the Community FoodBank of New
Jersey president. “SNAP puts dollars in people’s hands to shop the way
you and I do.”
