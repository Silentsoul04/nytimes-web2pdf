# New Tools for Home Buyers as the Pandemic Upends Real Estate

[Dan
Feder](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/03/27/a-bold-move/),
a graphic designer, and his husband, Don Bacigalupi, a museum director,
have lived in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles for two
years. But they started looking to move closer to their teenage son’s
school when pandemic lockdowns showed they could avoid a commute across
town by working from home.

Yet having moved from Chicago two years ago, they still felt that they
had an outsider’s view of Southern California real estate. They worried,
too, about making a mistake in an uncertain economy.

“With so many unknown variables in the world, we wanted as much
information as we could get before moving forward with such a large
financial decision,” Mr. Feder said. “As an outsider, it’s difficult to
gauge that.”

Buying a home under any circumstances can be stressful. But with some
buyers looking to improve their lives during the pandemic and others
trying to flee congested cities for greater space in the suburbs, the
rush to move could cause unexpected problems. Companies are coming up
with creative ways to help ease the process.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The financial aspect alone is daunting in this economy. Down payments on
a home can be 25 percent to 30 percent of the purchase price, money that
becomes largely untouchable once it’s handed over. But there are other
factors to consider. Carrying costs are one, but so is the nature of a
home as an asset: It may be worth millions of dollars on Zillow, but
selling it for that price can be difficult.

The pandemic has created interrelated dynamics that make the process
more complex. Some buyers want out of their city apartments, having
already been cooped up in them for months this winter. If they have
children, they may be acting quickly to get settled before the school
year starts.

Existing-home sales in the United States [fell 26.6 percent in
May](https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-fall-9-7-in-may-while-nar-expects-strong-rebound-in-coming-months)
from a year earlier, to 3.9 million, according to the National
Association of Realtors, but the pandemic has been a catalyst for many
to move, with suburban areas drawing more interest, according to [a
separate
report](https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-market-recovery-survey-07-09-2020.pdf)
from the Realtor group. For example, the median sale price of a home in
New Canaan, Conn., which is within commuting distance of Manhattan,
[rose 29 percent in
May](https://newcanaanite.com/new-canaan-home-sales-median-price-up-29-in-may-3046583)
from the year before.

The national average interest rate on 30-year fixed mortgages [fell
below 3
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html)
for the first time on record this week, which could spur more people to
buy a home.

There are deals in cities for those with cash and a strong stomach. Some
of those purchases, costing millions of dollars, have been made through
online scrolling and Zoom walk-throughs. But when purchases are driven
by video, what catches the eye sells, and flaws can be missed.

“While various video technologies are changing how we travel and what we
need to see live, I would not advise nor endorse buying any real estate
sight unseen,” said Bill Nimmo, who heads the real estate asset
management group at Wells Fargo Private Bank. “It can make sense to put
a property under contract before visually seeing it, but not to close on
it without seeing it
live.”

The risk of buying anything sight unseen is unavoidable with a project
under development. During the stay-at-home order in New York, 10 buyers
purchased luxury condos for $2 million to $6 million at an unfinished
development, [130 William](https://130william.com/), in the financial
district.

Buyers usually get to peruse a high-end show room, to touch finishes and
see how kitchens and bathrooms will be laid out. But in this case, they
relied on online material, created for each apartment, down to the view
from the windows.

“The shutdown worked to our advantage,” said Scott J. Avram, a senior
vice president at Lightstone, the developer of 130 William. “It turned
out to be a good bet to push more advertising. Buyers were almost a
captive audience.”

Some were persuaded to buy because they could put down a 10 percent
deposit, lock in a low-interest mortgage but not have to close until the
fall, when the building will be finished.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

How people are doing their due diligence in this stressful time is as
distinct as this moment in history.

Some are trying to do traditional due diligence through new services.
This was the case with Mr. Feder. Last year, he fell in love with a
neighborhood on the west side of Los Angeles only to watch flames engulf
it in last season’s wildfires.

“We watched half the neighborhood burn up,” he said. “We have a large
art collection, and we didn’t want to put that at risk.”

So in the pandemic, he turned to a new product offered by PURE Insurance
called Home Spotlight. The report rates a home’s risk for natural
disasters like flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, and it
is meant to show buyers whether PURE would insure the home. Not getting
home insurance through a commercial carrier like PURE, AIG or Chubb
substantially increases the annual premiums.

But the report also details any insurance claims, construction permits
and work done on the home that could point to other problems that are
not apparent at first glance — and certainly not through a video
tour.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,

“If the buyers haven’t been given full disclosure, which is the law in
California, then it causes other questions to come up,” said Steven
Brown, chief executive of Hoffman Brown, an insurance brokerage firm.
“If you didn’t tell me about the toilet that overflowed and cost
$100,000 to fix, what else didn’t you tell us about?”

The report keeps the seller honest; it also slows down a buyer who may
be acting quickly without full information.

A different type of fear — fear of missing out — is driving buyers who
see opportunities as city dwellers flee to the suburbs. Christopher Rim,
founder and chief executive of Command Education, an education
consultant in New York, said he had started getting unsolicited offers
for the TriBeCa loft that he bought less than a year ago. The offers
were for more than the $3 million he paid.

“I figured if I could score a deal on another apartment, it would be a
good trade,” he said.

He began looking for a bigger condo in a less-desirable neighborhood
where prices were cheaper, figuring he would be working from home for
the foreseeable future. But when his lowball offer of $3.5 million offer
on a condo listed for $4.8 million was accepted, Mr. Rim paused. He
worried about getting swept up in the moment.

Now his plan is to be more strategic and wait until the fall, when he is
betting people who have left the city will discount their apartments
even further. “There’s no way school is happening this fall,” he said.
“They’re going to want to offload some inventory.”

In addition to viewing real estate, closing on a property has become
more complicated and time consuming when social distancing is required.
No longer are a dozen people crammed into a law office conference room
to watch a buyer sign a stack of legal documents. But remote closings
actually require greater vigilance and time to ensure mistakes are not
made.

“When you’re face to face with a client, you’re able to go over all the
numbers with them and make sure what they’re signing at the closing is
what they negotiated,” said Sal Strazzullo, a real estate and estate
planning lawyer at Strazzullo Law. “Being on the phone with someone and
having them sign the documents when you read through them — you have to
step up your game.”

He said closings that normally took an hour and a half could stretch on
for 48 hours or more. Recently, he had to amend a closing when money
wired to buy a condo arrived four days late.

Mr. Feder has not found another house in Los Angeles yet, but he and his
husband have bought a weekend home in Palm Springs. They used their
insurer’s home spotlight to assess the renovations that had been done to
it.

“It stood out for its cleanliness, but we saw permits that were pulled
for work on the home,” he said.

In this case, the renovations were purely for aesthetic reasons, but Mr.
Feder felt comfort having the additional background. “This is a very
uncertain age, and there’s a part of you that says, ‘Are we crazy for
making a real estate purchase now?’” he said. “But if you can be
confident and move forward, that’s better.”
