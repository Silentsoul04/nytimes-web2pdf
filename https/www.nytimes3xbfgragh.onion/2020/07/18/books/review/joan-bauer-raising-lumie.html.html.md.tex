Everyone knows you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but
many of us do it anyway. In the case of Joan Bauer's 14th novel,
\textbf{RAISING LUMIE (Viking, 288 pp., \$16.99; ages 10 to 13),} you
might see the jacket photograph of a fuzzy yellow Labrador retriever
puppy and assume you're in for a cozy, heartwarming tale. You would be
wrong. Sort of.

Bauer's story of a 12-year-old girl training a guide dog contains plenty
of touching and gratifying moments. In fact, it's so jam-packed with
inspiring canine cuteness I kept having to excuse myself to dole out
treats to my exuberant mutt. But ``Raising Lumie'' is a wolf in sheep's
clothing --- a sad story wrapped in an uplifting one whose core you
never quite forget, no matter how tickled you are by its woolly
exterior.

Like Walt Disney, Bauer wastes no time dispensing with parents. Olive
Hudson doesn't remember her mom, who died in a car accident when Olive
was 2; her dad, a plumber named Joe, has just died of cancer. (To her
credit, Bauer avoids euphemisms like ``passed.'') Olive's grandmother is
alive and appears to have all her marbles (as my grandmother used to
say), but the orphaned middle schooler is dispatched to a different New
Jersey town to live with Maudie, a half sister she barely knows. Olive
is a list-maker --- it's how she keeps grief at bay --- so in her honor
here are some facts about Maudie: She works as a graphic designer. She's
engaged to Roger, whose best asset is a fancy car. She's unflappable and
unfailingly cheerful.

Either Olive is the most amenable adolescent on the planet or the ones
in my orbit are just unusually crotchety. She's sad to leave everything
and everyone she has ever known, but also totally game to relocate with
Maudie to the Stay Awhile, a big yellow boardinghouse shared by a cast
of charmingly quirky residents including a free-range rabbit named
Bunster. Olive even performs a plumbing miracle mid-move; she fixes a
spraying faucet in the home of a complete stranger, leaving behind a
note: ``This repair is in honor of Joe Hudson, the best plumber in
America.''

Very young readers may appreciate Olive's ``Leapin' lizards!'' approach
to seismic change, but kids her own age may not buy it --- at least not
this summer, when it seems as if loss is everywhere.

Lumie is by far the best character in this book. She's the 8-week-old
puppy Olive meets when she joins Maudie for her first day at her new
job. (Puppies, cinnamon buns and young relatives welcome? Where do I
apply?) According to Olive, Lumie is ``the most adorable dog in North
America \ldots{} a little fur machine that is 150 percent ON.'' And she
just happens to be hanging around the office in preparation for her
future role as a guide dog.

By the time Lumie's designated ``raiser'' gets waylaid at a funeral in
Germany, Olive is the obvious candidate to work with the pup. Everyone
at the Stay Awhile is on board, including Bunster. Olive tells Lumie,
``I'm here to help you get ready to do big things in the world'' --- and
she certainly holds up her end of the bargain. If Bauer's book is made
into a movie, this will be the montage scene: girl and dog exploring the
neighborhood, practicing leash skills, delighting friends and strangers.
When Olive starts seventh grade, Maudie sends regular newspaper-style
dispatches about Lumie's behavior; they're an excellent icebreaker for
Olive to read aloud in the school cafeteria.

Of course this is a temporary arrangement. The idea is for Olive to pass
Lumie along to an owner whose world she'll open in the same way she has
opened Olive's. This plan has hitches --- some more upsetting than
others --- but Olive is a survivor, which makes her fun to root for, and
Lumie is as dear to the reader as any human.

``Raising Lumie'' is a touching, optimistic story about decent,
well-intentioned people, which should be enough to earn it a spot on the
shelf of any tween dog-lover. Maybe I'm getting cynical in middle age,
but I kept unzipping Bauer's carefully spun fleece and finding myself
face to face with the aforementioned wolf. I wonder, would a puppy and a
pack of strangers really take away the pain of Olive's loss? Would they
even make a dent? Hard to say. But who wouldn't want to live in a world
where the answer is yes?
