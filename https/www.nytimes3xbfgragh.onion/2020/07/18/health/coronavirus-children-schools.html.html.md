In the heated debate over reopening schools, one burning question has
been whether and [how efficiently children can spread the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html)
to others.

A [large new
study](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-1315_article) from
South Korea offers an answer: Children younger than 10 transmit to
others much less often than adults do, but the risk is not zero. And
those between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as
well as adults do.

The findings suggest that as schools reopen, communities will see
clusters of infection take root that include children of all ages,
several experts cautioned.

“I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won’t get infected
or don’t get infected in the same way as adults and that, therefore,
they’re almost like a bubbled population,” said Michael Osterholm, an
infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There will be transmission,” Dr. Osterholm said. “What we have to do is
accept that now and include that in our plans.”

Several studies from Europe and Asia have suggested that young children
are less likely to get infected and to spread the virus. But most of
those studies were small and flawed, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of
the Harvard Global Health Institute.

The new study “is very carefully done, it’s systematic and looks at a
very large population,” Dr. Jha said. “It’s one of the best studies
we’ve had to date on this
issue.”

Other experts also praised the scale and rigor of the analysis. South
Korean researchers identified 5,706 people who were the first to report
Covid-19 symptoms in their households between Jan. 20 and March 27, when
schools were closed, and then traced the 59,073 contacts of these “index
cases.” They tested all of the household contacts of each patient,
regardless of symptoms, but only tested symptomatic contacts outside the
household.

The first person in a household to develop symptoms is not necessarily
the first to have been infected, and the researchers acknowledged this
limitation. Children are also less likely than adults to show symptoms,
so the study may have underestimated the number of children who set off
the chain of transmission within their households.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, experts said the approach was reasonable. “It is also from a
place with great contact tracing, done at the point interventions were
being put in place,” said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard
T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Children under 10 were roughly half as likely as adults to spread the
virus to others, consistent with other studies. That may be because
children generally exhale less air — and therefore less virus-laden air
— or because they exhale that air closer to the ground, making it less
likely that adults would breathe it in.

Even so, the number of new infections seeded by children may rise when
schools reopen, the study authors cautioned. “Young children may show
higher attack rates when the school closure ends, contributing to
community transmission of Covid-19,” they wrote. Other studies have also
suggested that the large number of contacts for schoolchildren, who
interact with dozens of others for a good part of the day, may [cancel
out their smaller
risk](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/health/coronavirus-children-transmission-school.html)
of infecting others.

The researchers traced the contacts only of children who felt ill, so
it’s still unclear how efficiently asymptomatic children spread the
virus, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health.

“I think it was always going to be the case that symptomatic children
are infectious,” she said. “The questions about the role of children are
more around whether children who don’t have symptoms are infectious.”

Dr. Rivers was a member of a scientific panel that on Wednesday
[recommended reopening
schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/health/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html)
wherever possible for disabled children and for those in elementary
schools, because those groups have the most trouble learning online. She
said the new study does not alter that recommendation.

The study is more worrisome for children in middle and high school. This
group was even more likely to infect others than adults were, the study
found. But some experts said that finding may be a fluke or may stem
from the children’s behaviors.

These older children are frequently as big as adults, and yet may have
some of the same unhygienic habits as young children do. They may also
have been more likely than the younger children to socialize with their
peers within the high-rise complexes in South
Korea.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“We can speculate all day about this, but we just don’t know,” Dr.
Osterholm said. “The bottom line message is: There’s going to be
transmission.”

He and other experts said schools will need to prepare for infections to
pop up. Apart from implementing physical distancing, hand hygiene and
masks, schools should also decide when and how to test students and
staff — including, for example, bus drivers — when and how long to
require people to quarantine, and when to decide to close and reopen
schools.

But they face a monumental challenge because the evidence on
transmission within schools has been far from conclusive so far, experts
said. Some countries like Denmark and Finland have successfully reopened
schools, but others, like China, Israel and South Korea, have had to
close them down again.

“People, depending on their ideology on school opening, are choosing
which evidence to present — and that needs to be avoided,” said Jeffrey
Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of
Public Health in New York.

Although the new study does not offer definitive answers, he said, it
does indicate that schools can increase virus levels within a community.

“So long as children are not just a complete dead end — incapable of
passing the virus on, which does not seem to be the case — putting them
together in schools, having them mix with teachers and other students
will provide additional opportunities for the virus to move from person
to person,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the same time, Dr. Shaman said, it’s important for children not to
miss out on critical years in education and socialization, and school
districts have the unenviable task of choosing between those options:
“It’s hard trying to find the right balance.”
