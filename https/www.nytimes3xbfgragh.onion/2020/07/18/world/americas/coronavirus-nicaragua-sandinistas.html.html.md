# Nicaragua’s Ruling Sandinistas Fall Victim to Covid-19, Highlighting the Disease’s Spread

The haphazard, politicized response to the pandemic by the country’s
leaders has put the government’s own officials and supporters at
particular risk.

A string of recent deaths across Nicaragua — including mayors, judges,
police officials, sports figures, university rectors and government
bureaucrats — is pointing to the chilling reality that the coronavirus
is devastating this Central American country, although the government is
not publicly acknowledging it.

To critics of the government, the deaths are a result of President
Daniel Ortega’s haphazard and politicized response to the pandemic with
no encouragement of wearing masks or social distancing measures, and
little testing and no stay-at-home orders or shutdowns. Instead, the
government has encouraged large gatherings.

That response seems to have hit members of the governing Sandinista
National Liberation Front party the hardest.

Several young epidemiologists, virologists and related specialists said
in the medical journal
[Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30131-5/fulltext?dgcid=hubspot_email_newsletter_tlcoronavirus20&utm_campaign=tlcoronavirus20&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=86078269&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8f41qmrV7u85F68lutTKp1slx_xOXyc5Fzu2qUDWAPfChM4bWOSz6vuQmIHdTNvM_69PLdY4i7CCZhq1NZ4uM2lCLUgA&_hsmi=86078269)
that Nicaragua’s handling of the coronavirus “has been perhaps the most
erratic of any country in the world to date.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They were the only ones going around without masks,” said Dora María
Tellez, a former health minister under the Sandinistas who broke with
the party, “as the mask came to be considered a sign of opposition.”

Francisco Aguirre Sacasa, a former Nicaraguan ambassador to Washington,
said the deaths of the public officials were strikingly obvious when you
looked at the National Assembly and saw a lot of empty chairs in the
Sandinista side.

“You can’t just ignore that,” he said. “You can’t hide it. You can’t
cover that up,” he added. “It is obvious, obvious, that Sandinistas have
been dying.”

Still, the deaths of few officials have been publicly attributed to
Covid-19 — as is the case with [most virus fatalities in
Nicaragua](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/world/americas/coronavirus-nicaragua-burials.html).
Many are officially designated as “atypical pneumonia.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Officially, the government reports that just 99 people have died from
the virus, although the Citizens Covid-19 Observatory, an anonymous
group of doctors and activists in Nicaragua, has registered 2,397
probable deaths.

“Her kids told me she died of Covid,” Mr. Sacasa said.

The government has now created Covid-only hospital units and mass
disinfection campaigns are being organized by the military. But many
critics say one clear sign that those measures came too late are the
high-profile deaths of the party’s own members.

The government is preparing for its annual July 19 anniversary
extravaganza celebrating the victory of the Sandinista revolution, which
toppled the Somoza family dictatorship in 1979.

The event, held every year at a public square in the capital, Managua,
features hundreds of thousands of people bused in from throughout the
country. They wear matching T-shirts and carry black-and-red party flags
before a dais where all the leading government officials sit.

But this year, for the first time in its 41-year history, the event will
be held as a virtual concert — and absent major members of the party who
have died in recent weeks.

Dampening the festive mood further, on Friday, the United States
Treasury Department sanctioned the son of Mr. Ortega and his wife,
Rosario Murillo, who is also the vice president of the country.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The son, Juan Carlos Ortega, manages a media company “which he uses to
stifle independent voices, spread regime propaganda, and defend the
Ortegas’ violence and repression,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said
in a statement.

Nicaragua, which spent the past two years battling a popular uprising,
was one of a few countries that never shut down schools and businesses
and never issued a stay-at-home order.

Trying to stave off economic collapse, the government continued to
organize mass events, even after the pandemic was raging around the
world.

A March rally, advertised as being held in solidarity for countries
suffering coronavirus deaths, was called “Love in the Time of Covid-19.”
Beauty pageants, boxing matches, art fairs, [food
festivals](https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:102052-festival-de-comidas-de-cuaresma-que-promueve-intur-finalizo-con-exito-en-somoto)and
other events organized by the government also continued as planned, as
Sandinista lawmakers mocked opposition legislators for wearing
masks.

Nicaragua’s response to the pandemic has “been lambasted throughout the
world as one of the worst,” said Mateo C. Jarquín, a Nicaraguan
professor at Chapman University in California who was one of the authors
of the Lancet article.

“We should recognize all governments are struggling,” he wrote. “What
has no excuse is the lack of transparency and the blatant manipulation
of information.”

justifying its approach to the pandemic. The report noted that a
desperately poor country like Nicaragua could ill afford an economic
shutdown. Many people in Nicaragua must work to eat and cannot stay
home, the government said.

But it did not explain why it allowed large gatherings to continue even
as similarly popular, crowded events were canceled
worldwide.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening

Among the recent deaths of Sandinista officials was that of Orlando
Noguera, the former mayor of Masaya, a city 15 miles south of
Nicaragua’s capital. He was best known for a crackdown on
anti-government protesters two years ago that left seven people dead in
his city.

Relatives of Eden Pastora, a government ally and a prominent figure in
the nation’s civil war, said he did not have the illness. But his death
certificate, which was read to The New York Times by a family member,
showed Mr. Pastora died of “atypical pneumonia” — the usual official
designation for a coronavirus death.

Orlando J. Castillo, the head of the government telecommunications
office who had recently been sanctioned for human-rights violations by
the [United States
Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm715)
Department, died on June 2. [Local
media](https://confidencial.com.ni/rosario-murillo-admite-muertes-de-orlando-castillo-y-orlando-noguera/),
citing family sources, said the cause was Covid-19.

When a top police official, Olivio Hernández Salguera, died in May, his
family insisted he had suffered a fatal heart attack. But the media
reported that his body was buried the same day he died, as is customary
in Nicaragua when people die of Covid-19 — suggesting that he had the
disease.

Ms. Tellez, the former Sandinista health minister, provided The Times
with a list of 38 Sandinistas who were believed to have died of the
coronavirus and said some 200 names have circulated on social media.

She also said that Mr. Ortega does not appear to be following his
government’s own strategy because he has not been seen in public for
over a month, the second time he disappeared during the pandemic.

Carlos Fernando Chamorro, editor of Confidencial, a leading news outlet,
said his team has counted some 100 deaths of Sandinistas, including
about 10 well-known figures.

“The problem is that here, nobody officially dies of Covid-19,” he said.

The Nicaraguan government funnels all media inquiries to Ms. Murillo,
the vice president. She did not respond to requests for comment.

In public comments, she has acknowledged the deaths of the prominent
government officials, but did not give the cause. They had “transitioned
to another plane,” Ms. Murillo said.

“We live their legacy with the strength of the revolution,” she said
following the deaths of two officials. “Our revolution makes us strong
every day.”

Orlando Obando Cabrera, a Sandinista regional councilman in Bluefields,
on the Caribbean coast, posted videos on his Facebook page in which he
implored Nicaraguans to stop looking for people to blame for the health
crisis.

“If I die in this struggle and you want to find someone responsible,
don’t look for it in the government,” Mr. Obando said in a video
posted May 26, acknowledging that he was being treated for the illness.
“If something happens to me, don’t blame Daniel, don’t blame Rosario,
don’t blame others.”

Two days later, he vowed to beat Covid-19. On June 13, Mr. Obando died.

Alfonso Flores Bermúdez contributed reporting from Managua, Nicaragua.
