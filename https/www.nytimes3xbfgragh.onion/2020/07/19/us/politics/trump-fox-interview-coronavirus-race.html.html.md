WASHINGTON — An agitated [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
offered a string of combative and often dubious assertions in an
interview aired Sunday, defending [his handling of the

with misleading evidence, attacking his own health experts, disputing

showing him trailing in his re-election race and defending people who
display the Confederate flag as victims of “cancel culture.”

The president’s remarks, delivered in an interview on “Fox News Sunday,”
amounted to a contentious potpourri more commonly found on his Twitter
feed and at his political
rallies.

The difference this time was a vigorous attempt by the host, Chris
Wallace, to fact-check him, leading to several clashes between the two
on matters ranging from the coronavirus response to whether Mr. Trump
would accept the results of the election should he lose.

## The Coronavirus

  - The president made a litany of false claims about his
    administration’s handling of the virus, despite evidence that key
    officials and public health experts advising the president made
    crucial missteps and played down the spread of the disease this
    spring. In the interview, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the United
    States had “one of the lowest mortality rates in the world” from the
    virus.
    
    “That’s not true, sir,” Mr. Wallace said.
    
    “Do you have the numbers, please?” Mr. Trump said. “Because I heard
    we had the best mortality rate.”
    
    The United States has the [eighth-worst fatality
    rate](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality) among the
    countries currently most affected by the coronavirus, and the death
    rate per 100,000 people — 42.83 — ranks it third-worst, according to
    data on the countries most affected by the coronavirus compiled by
    Johns Hopkins University. Mr. Trump said that by increasing testing,
    his administration was “creating trouble for the fake news to come
    along and say, ‘Oh, we have more cases.’”

  - Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the coronavirus case rate in other
    countries was lower than in the United States because those nations
    did not engage in testing. When Mr. Wallace pointed out a low case
    rate across the European Union, the president suggested it was
    possible that those countries “don’t test.” And when Mr. Wallace
    pointed out that the death rate in the United States was rising, Mr.
    Trump replied by blaming China.
    
    “Excuse me, it’s all too much, it shouldn’t be one case,” Mr. Trump
    said. “It came from China. They should’ve never let it escape. They
    should’ve never let it out. But it is what it is. Take a look at
    Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way,
    they’re having cases.”

  - Mr. Trump called Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious
    disease expert, an “alarmist” who provided faulty information in the
    early days of the coronavirus pandemic.
    
    “I don’t know that he’s a leaker,” Mr. Trump said during the
    interview. “He’s a little bit of an alarmist. That’s OK. A little
    bit of an alarmist.”
    
    Mr. Trump said that Dr. Fauci had been against his decision to close
    the borders to travelers from China in January. That is misleading:
    While Dr. Fauci initially opposed the idea on the grounds that a ban
    would prevent medical professionals from traveling to hard-hit
    areas, he supported the decision by the time it was made.
    
    Mr. Trump also said Dr. Fauci had been against Americans wearing
    masks. Dr. Fauci has said he does not regret urging Americans not to
    wear masks in the early days of the pandemic, citing a severe
    shortage of protective gear for medical professionals at the time.

  - Mr. Trump said he doubted whether Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the
    director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was
    correct in predicting that the pandemic would be worse this fall. “I
    don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. “And I don’t think he knows.”
    
    He said public health experts and the World Health Organization “got
    a lot wrong” early on, including a theory that the virus would abate
    as the weather warmed — one that Mr. Trump himself had promoted
    repeatedly. Then the president reiterated his earlier claim,
    unsupported by science, that the virus would suddenly cease one day.
    “It’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right,” Mr. Trump said.
    “Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else.”

## The Election

  - Mr. Trump insulted Fox News pollsters as “among the worst” when
    presented with data that showed him trailing former Vice President
    Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, claiming
    that he had seen polls that showed him winning.
    
    “I understand you still have more than 100 days to this election,
    but at this point you’re losing,” Mr. Wallace told Mr. Trump after
    detailing a new [Fox News
    poll](https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/Fox_July-12-15-2020_Complete_National_Topline_July-19-Release.pdf)
    that showed Mr. Biden leading the president by eight points, 49
    percent to 41 percent, among registered voters.
    
    “First of all, I’m not losing,” Mr. Trump replied, “because those
    are fake polls. They were fake in 2016, and now they’re even more
    fake. The polls were much worse in 2016.”
    
    But in reality, the Fox News poll was much better for him than
    another major survey released Sunday. A [Washington Post-ABC News
    poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-leads-by-double-digits-as-coronavirus-takes-a-toll-on-the-president-post-abc-poll-finds/2020/07/18/8d041884-c840-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html)
    showed Mr. Biden with a double-digit lead: 55 percent to 40 percent
    among registered voters. The numbers were part of a slate of polls
    showing Mr. Biden’s lead widening as the pandemic weighed on the
    president’s approval ratings.
    
    Mr. Trump said he was not worried about losing the election with the
    decision last week to [replace his campaign manager, Brad
    Parscale](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/politics/trump-campaign-brad-parscale.html).
    Mr. Trump called Mr. Parscale “a great digital guy” before saying
    that many of his 2016 campaign hands were getting more involved. He
    did not mention his new campaign manager, [Bill
    Stepien](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/bill-stepien.html),
    by name.

  - When told that Mr. Biden was chosen in the Fox poll as the more
    mentally sound candidate, Mr. Trump disputed that finding and
    defended his cognitive test results to Mr. Wallace, who said he had
    taken the same test that the president had bragged about acing this
    month. Mr. Wallace pointed out that one of the questions asked to
    identify an elephant.
    
    “It’s all misrepresentation,” Mr. Trump said. “Because, yes, the
    first few questions are easy, but I’ll bet you couldn’t even answer
    the last five questions. I’ll bet you couldn’t. They get very hard,
    the last five questions.”

  - Mr. Trump suggested that he might not accept the results of the
    election should he lose. Mr. Wallace, who spent the interview
    grilling the president — a tactic he has used in [other high-profile
    interviews](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/chris-wallace-wants-journalists-to-push-for-the-truth-but-fox-news-often-traffics-in-propaganda/2019/12/15/64cf5b84-1f54-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html)
    — pointed out that Mr. Trump said the same thing in 2016.
    
    “You don’t know until you see,” Mr. Trump said. “It depends. I think
    mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.”
    
    Mr. Trump, who has voted by mail, has [repeatedly
    warned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-vote-fraud-ballot.html),
    without evidence, that mail elections would involve robbed
    mailboxes, forged signatures and ballots printed by foreign
    countries.

## Race and Policing

  - Mr. Trump again tried to attack Mr. Biden, claiming that the former
    vice president wanted to defund the police. The president suggested
    this was evidenced by his work with more progressive Democrats to
    create a charter pledging to work together on matters including
    changes to policing.
    
    “It says nothing about defunding the police,” Mr. Wallace said of
    that document.
    
    “Oh really? It says abolish, it says defund. Let’s go\! Get me the
    charter, please,” Mr. Trump said, before demanding to see the
    document. In a promotional clip of the interview, [Mr. Wallace
    said](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/17/fox-news-chris-wallace-fact-checks-trump-bidens-stance-police/5461970002/)
    the president had been unable to find evidence that Mr. Biden sought
    to defund or abolish the police.

  - When Mr. Wallace asked the president if he could understand why
    Black people would be angry about their increased likelihood to be
    killed by the police, Mr. Trump reiterated a claim [he made in
    another interview last
    week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-white-people-killed-by-police.html):
    that white people are fatally shot in high numbers, too.
    
    “I mean, many, many whites are killed,” Mr. Trump said. “I hate to
    say, but this is going on for decades.”
    
    Statistics show that while more white Americans are killed by the
    police over all, people of color are killed at higher rates.

  - Mr. Trump also refused to back down from supporting people who were
    against abolishing the Confederate flag, even as Mr. Wallace pointed
    out that they had used it in defense of slavery. The president
    equated the movement to pull down the flags and Confederate
    monuments to “cancel culture,” a term more commonly used to describe
    a boycott against a person, often a celebrity, who says or does
    something culturally offensive.
    
    “And you know, the whole thing with cancel culture, we can’t cancel
    our whole history,” Mr. Trump said. “We can’t forget that the North
    and the South fought. We have to remember that. Otherwise we’ll end
    up fighting
again.”
