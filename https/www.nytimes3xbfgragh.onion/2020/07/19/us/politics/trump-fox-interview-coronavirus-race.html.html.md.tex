The president grew agitated as he was fact-checked on polling, race
relations and the coronavirus response by Chris Wallace of Fox News.

WASHINGTON --- An agitated
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html}{President
Trump} offered a string of combative and often dubious assertions in an
interview aired Sunday, defending
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html}{his
handling of the coronavirus} with misleading evidence, attacking his own
health experts, disputing
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/us/politics/trump-polls-senate.html}{polls}
showing him trailing in his re-election race and defending people who
display the Confederate flag as victims of ``cancel culture.''

The president's remarks, delivered in an interview on ``Fox News
Sunday,'' amounted to a contentious potpourri more commonly found on his
Twitter feed and at his political rallies.

The difference this time was a vigorous attempt by the host, Chris
Wallace, to fact-check him, leading to several clashes between the two
on matters ranging from the coronavirus response to whether Mr. Trump
would accept the results of the election should he lose.

\hypertarget{the-coronavirus}{%
\subsection{The Coronavirus}\label{the-coronavirus}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The president made a litany of false claims about his administration's
  handling of the virus, despite evidence that key officials and public
  health experts advising the president made crucial missteps and played
  down the spread of the disease this spring. In the interview, Mr.
  Trump falsely claimed that the United States had ``one of the lowest
  mortality rates in the world'' from the virus.

  ``That's not true, sir,'' Mr. Wallace said.

  ``Do you have the numbers, please?'' Mr. Trump said. ``Because I heard
  we had the best mortality rate.''

  The United States has the
  \href{https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality}{eighth-worst
  fatality rate} among the countries currently most affected by the
  coronavirus, and the death rate per 100,000 people --- 42.83 --- ranks
  it third-worst, according to data on the countries most affected by
  the coronavirus compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Mr. Trump said
  that by increasing testing, his administration was ``creating trouble
  for the fake news to come along and say, `Oh, we have more cases.'''
\item
  Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the coronavirus case rate in other
  countries was lower than in the United States because those nations
  did not engage in testing. When Mr. Wallace pointed out a low case
  rate across the European Union, the president suggested it was
  possible that those countries ``don't test.'' And when Mr. Wallace
  pointed out that the death rate in the United States was rising, Mr.
  Trump replied by blaming China.

  ``Excuse me, it's all too much, it shouldn't be one case,'' Mr. Trump
  said. ``It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They
  should've never let it out. But it is what it is. Take a look at
  Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they're
  having cases.''
\item
  Mr. Trump called Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious
  disease expert, an ``alarmist'' who provided faulty information in the
  early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

  ``I don't know that he's a leaker,'' Mr. Trump said during the
  interview. ``He's a little bit of an alarmist. That's OK. A little bit
  of an alarmist.''

  Mr. Trump said that Dr. Fauci had been against his decision to close
  the borders to travelers from China in January. That is misleading:
  While Dr. Fauci initially opposed the idea on the grounds that a ban
  would prevent medical professionals from traveling to hard-hit areas,
  he supported the decision by the time it was made.

  Mr. Trump also said Dr. Fauci had been against Americans wearing
  masks. Dr. Fauci has said he does not regret urging Americans not to
  wear masks in the early days of the pandemic, citing a severe shortage
  of protective gear for medical professionals at the time.
\item
  Mr. Trump said he doubted whether Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director
  of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was correct in
  predicting that the pandemic would be worse this fall. ``I don't
  know,'' Mr. Trump said. ``And I don't think he knows.''

  He said public health experts and the World Health Organization ``got
  a lot wrong'' early on, including a theory that the virus would abate
  as the weather warmed --- one that Mr. Trump himself had promoted
  repeatedly. Then the president reiterated his earlier claim,
  unsupported by science, that the virus would suddenly cease one day.
  ``It's going to disappear, and I'll be right,'' Mr. Trump said.
  ``Because I've been right probably more than anybody else.''
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-election}{%
\subsection{The Election}\label{the-election}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Mr. Trump insulted Fox News pollsters as ``among the worst'' when
  presented with data that showed him trailing former Vice President
  Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, claiming that
  he had seen polls that showed him winning.

  ``I understand you still have more than 100 days to this election, but
  at this point you're losing,'' Mr. Wallace told Mr. Trump after
  detailing a new
  \href{https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/Fox_July-12-15-2020_Complete_National_Topline_July-19-Release.pdf}{Fox
  News poll} that showed Mr. Biden leading the president by eight
  points, 49 percent to 41 percent, among registered voters.

  ``First of all, I'm not losing,'' Mr. Trump replied, ``because those
  are fake polls. They were fake in 2016, and now they're even more
  fake. The polls were much worse in 2016.''

  But in reality, the Fox News poll was much better for him than another
  major survey released Sunday. A
  \href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-leads-by-double-digits-as-coronavirus-takes-a-toll-on-the-president-post-abc-poll-finds/2020/07/18/8d041884-c840-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html}{Washington
  Post-ABC News poll} showed Mr. Biden with a double-digit lead: 55
  percent to 40 percent among registered voters. The numbers were part
  of a slate of polls showing Mr. Biden's lead widening as the pandemic
  weighed on the president's approval ratings.

  Mr. Trump said he was not worried about losing the election with the
  decision last week to
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/politics/trump-campaign-brad-parscale.html}{replace
  his campaign manager, Brad Parscale}. Mr. Trump called Mr. Parscale
  ``a great digital guy'' before saying that many of his 2016 campaign
  hands were getting more involved. He did not mention his new campaign
  manager,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/bill-stepien.html}{Bill
  Stepien}, by name.
\item
  When told that Mr. Biden was chosen in the Fox poll as the more
  mentally sound candidate, Mr. Trump disputed that finding and defended
  his cognitive test results to Mr. Wallace, who said he had taken the
  same test that the president had bragged about acing this month. Mr.
  Wallace pointed out that one of the questions asked to identify an
  elephant.

  ``It's all misrepresentation,'' Mr. Trump said. ``Because, yes, the
  first few questions are easy, but I'll bet you couldn't even answer
  the last five questions. I'll bet you couldn't. They get very hard,
  the last five questions.''
\item
  Mr. Trump suggested that he might not accept the results of the
  election should he lose. Mr. Wallace, who spent the interview grilling
  the president --- a tactic he has used in
  \href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/chris-wallace-wants-journalists-to-push-for-the-truth-but-fox-news-often-traffics-in-propaganda/2019/12/15/64cf5b84-1f54-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html}{other
  high-profile interviews} --- pointed out that Mr. Trump said the same
  thing in 2016.

  ``You don't know until you see,'' Mr. Trump said. ``It depends. I
  think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.''

  Mr. Trump, who has voted by mail, has
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-vote-fraud-ballot.html}{repeatedly
  warned}, without evidence, that mail elections would involve robbed
  mailboxes, forged signatures and ballots printed by foreign countries.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{race-and-policing}{%
\subsection{Race and Policing}\label{race-and-policing}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Mr. Trump again tried to attack Mr. Biden, claiming that the former
  vice president wanted to defund the police. The president suggested
  this was evidenced by his work with more progressive Democrats to
  create a charter pledging to work together on matters including
  changes to policing.

  ``It says nothing about defunding the police,'' Mr. Wallace said of
  that document.

  ``Oh really? It says abolish, it says defund. Let's go! Get me the
  charter, please,'' Mr. Trump said, before demanding to see the
  document. In a promotional clip of the interview,
  \href{https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/17/fox-news-chris-wallace-fact-checks-trump-bidens-stance-police/5461970002/}{Mr.
  Wallace said} the president had been unable to find evidence that Mr.
  Biden sought to defund or abolish the police.
\item
  When Mr. Wallace asked the president if he could understand why Black
  people would be angry about their increased likelihood to be killed by
  the police, Mr. Trump reiterated a claim
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-white-people-killed-by-police.html}{he
  made in another interview last week}: that white people are fatally
  shot in high numbers, too.

  ``I mean, many, many whites are killed,'' Mr. Trump said. ``I hate to
  say, but this is going on for decades.''

  Statistics show that while more white Americans are killed by the
  police over all, people of color are killed at higher rates.
\item
  Mr. Trump also refused to back down from supporting people who were
  against abolishing the Confederate flag, even as Mr. Wallace pointed
  out that they had used it in defense of slavery. The president equated
  the movement to pull down the flags and Confederate monuments to
  ``cancel culture,'' a term more commonly used to describe a boycott
  against a person, often a celebrity, who says or does something
  culturally offensive.

  ``And you know, the whole thing with cancel culture, we can't cancel
  our whole history,'' Mr. Trump said. ``We can't forget that the North
  and the South fought. We have to remember that. Otherwise we'll end up
  fighting again.''
