Most tourist beds are empty in Spain’s Canary Islands. Bookings are down

ADEJE, Spain — Music blared from a beachfront cafe along the normally
bustling southwestern coast of Tenerife, the largest of Spain’s Canary
Islands. But several tables sat empty, a month after a Covid-19 lockdown
had ended, and the doors to many resorts remained shut.

Though tourism is returning to southern Europe — stretching from
Portugal to Greece — its restart has been sluggish amid new outbreaks in
some countries. Bookings are down 80 percent in Italy despite government
incentives. Ferries to the Greek islands are carrying well under half
the load they once did.

While Europeans are starting to travel more within their own countries,
far fewer are venturing beyond their borders, particularly the holiday
makers from Britain, Germany and other northern countries who typically
[journey
south](https://www.statista.com/topics/3848/travel-and-tourism-in-europe/)
each year, spending billions of euros.

And visitors from outside the continent are few and far
between:<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Just [13
countries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/07/14/world/14reuters-health-coronavirus-eu-travel.html)
are on the list of those considered safe by the European Union, a list
that so far excludes the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The drag is felt acutely in tourist destinations dependent on air
travel, like the Canary Islands, hundreds of miles from mainland Spain.
Airlines carried [15
million](https://www.canarias7.es/economia/canarias-mantuvo-el-liston-de-los-15-millones-de-turistas-en-2019-GN8609091#:~:text=Canarias%20cerr%C3%B3%20el%20a%C3%B1o%202019,Nacional%20de%20Estad%C3%ADstica%20\(INE\).)

As a result, property owners in the Canary Islands have opened only

Jorge Marichal, a Tenerife hotelier who is president of

confederation.

“We are doing our best to highlight the fact that we now have almost no
virus problem — but of course we cannot transport the tourists here
ourselves,” Mr. Marichal said.

Italy has tried to promote national tourism by issuing a so-called
[holiday
bonus](https://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/visualizza_asset.html_589930674.html),
a 150-euro voucher per Italian for lodging, up to €500 per family. Dario
Franceschini, the minister of culture and tourism, told Parliament this
month<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>that about 400,000
vouchers had been issued, worth €183 million in total.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Italian news media painted a less enthusiastic picture. The
newspaper Corriere della Sera [reported that only a small
fraction](https://www.corriere.it/politica/20_luglio_01/oggi-parte-bonus-vacanze-ma-accettano-solo-4-hotel-100-5b37220a-bb5d-11ea-8b38-f3e0b4a46805.shtml?intcmp=emailNLcor_ore12_01072020)
of Italian hotels accept the vouchers.

Greece, though suffering less from the pandemic than either Italy or
Spain, has still seen scant evidence of a rebound in tourism. In the
first 12 days of July, passenger traffic at the Athens airport was down
75 percent from a year ago, and 84 percent at the country’s 14 regional
airports.

Though all of the countries of southern Europe have emerged from
lockdown, new outbreaks there and quarantine orders elsewhere have added
hurdles. This month, Britain said that people coming from Portugal,
among other countries, would be forced to quarantine on arrival, a move
that essentially choked off British tourism
there.

And Britons have traditionally been the top visitors to the Algarve, the
southern region of Portugal. Britain’s move drew fire from Augusto
Santos Silva, Portugal’s foreign minister, who called it
[“absurd](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53288080).” Still, Portugal has
faced a strong uptick in coronavirus cases, including in municipalities
surrounding its capital, Lisbon.

Outbreaks have also occurred around major tourism hubs like Barcelona,
where about three million residents were told on Friday to stay indoors
to help contain the coronavirus.

Carlos García Pastor, the marketing director of Logitravel Group, a
Spanish travel operator that had revenue of about €800 million last
year, said that his company expected earnings to drop at least 50
percent this year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The final result, he said, “will really depend on how many new outbreaks
there are.”

This month, hundreds of thousands of Spaniards were placed back under
temporary lockdown by the regional authorities in Catalonia and Galicia
after new outbreaks. Mr. García Pastor said some clients canceled their
bookings as soon as they heard about the new restrictions.

“Tourism is extremely reactive, for better or worse,” he
said.

In the Canary Islands, home to more than two million full-time

their low coronavirus caseload, less than 1 percent of the nation’s
total. The archipelago’s hotels require guests to wear a face mask in
the lobby and other indoor areas, and they limit the number of people
who can lounge around their swimming
pools.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening

The protocols drew praise from Zurab Pololikashvili, the secretary
general of the World Tourism Organization, an agency of the United
Nations, after his visit to tourism destinations in Italy and Spain this
month.

That portrait of safety contrasts sharply with the picture that emerged
from the Canary Islands in late January, when the archipelago recorded
Spain’s first coronavirus case, a German tourist who tested positive on
the island of La Gomera.

Weeks later, one of the large establishments on Tenerife, the H10 Costa
Adeje Palace, became the first European resort to [lock
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/world/europe/spain-coronavirus.html)
after the virus was detected among Italian guests.

But as the virus rampaged across mainland Spain, the islands quickly
brought their own outbreaks under control. The archipelago has reported
162 deaths, according to the latest official Spanish data, out of 28,420
victims nationwide.

Travel within the Canary archipelago has continued, perhaps even
encouraged a bit by the travel hurdles. Smaller islands like El Hierro
that do not have an international airport have reported an influx of
Canarians this
summer.

But across the islands the doors remain shut to many of the large
resorts normally filled by international package tours. At the recently
reopened Adeje Palace, some guests said they had been relocated there at
the last minute by their travel agents because the hotels they had
booked were still closed.

“A week before leaving Germany, I wasn’t sure that this vacation could
actually go ahead, but I had reached the point where I desperately
needed time away from my hospital work and no longer really cared about
which hotel I would stay in,” said Svetlana Arsenijevic, an anesthetist
from the German city of Halle.

A Swiss tourist, Anaïs Zufferey, said that she and her sister not only
had to switch hotels at the last minute, they also had to set off from
Zurich a day later than planned because their initial flight was
canceled.

“It’s a holiday that has required us to be very flexible,” Ms. Zufferey
said.

But their journey from Tenerife’s airport to their hotel was more than
comfortable — they were the only passengers on a 50-seat shuttle bus.

Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome, and Niki
Kitsantonis from Athens.
