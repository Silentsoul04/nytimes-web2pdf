One of the country’s best-known restaurateurs, Danny Meyer, [announced
five years
ago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/10/15/dining/danny-meyer-restaurants-no-tips.html)
that his [Union Square Hospitality Group](https://www.ushgnyc.com/)
would gradually eliminate tipping. The group’s decision began an
industrywide examination of the age-old practice, but adopting it proved
complicated, especially in New York State, where laws governing tip
distribution are strict.

Still, especially in recent months, many Americans have come to agree
with Mr. Meyer that [tipping
contributes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/24/opinion/tipping.html)
to unequal pay, racism, sexual harassment and power disparities in the
industry.

But on Monday, the company reversed course. Mr. Meyer told his staff
that Union Square Hospitality would abandon what it calls its
“Hospitality Included” policy as its restaurants reopen for outdoor
dining, starting on Thursday with the flagship [Union Square
Cafe](https://www.unionsquarecafe.com/) in the Flatiron district and
extending to the nearby [Gramercy
Tavern](https://www.unionsquarecafe.com/) in the coming weeks. (Some of
the group’s [other businesses](https://www.dailyprovisionsnyc.com/) are
already open for takeout and delivery, and all will shift to tipped
wages immediately.)

Mr. Meyer said in an interview that he still believes that tipping
contributes to inequitable pay, wage instability and other problems, and
that he is collaborating with the national [One Fair
Wage](https://onefairwage.com/saru-jayaraman/)campaign to eliminate it.
But as the restaurants begin rehiring today — about 95 percent of the
staff has been [laid
off](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/dining/union-square-hospitality-group-layoffs.html)
since March — he is unwilling to deny any extra compensation that might
be available to employees in a time of economic crisis.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We don’t know how often people will be eating out, we don’t know what
they are going to be willing to pay,” he said. “We do know that guests
want to tip generously right
now.”

The Hospitality Included model, which eliminated tips in favor of a
consistent hourly wage, was adopted over several years as New York
State’s minimum wage rose to $15 per hour. The extra labor costs for
the restaurant were reflected in menu prices, which increased by 15 to
20 percent. In theory at least, the customer’s actual cost per meal
would be about the
same.

Wilma Cespedes-Rivera, a bartender at Blue Smoke, a Union Square
Hospitality restaurant in Lower Manhattan, has worked for the company
for five years. She said that for servers, the change from tipping to
Hospitality Included was painful, and many talented colleagues left for
other jobs.

“People understood that the goal was a healthier balance,” she said,
“but it wasn’t what we signed up for financially.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In New York State, only employees who spend at least 80 percent of their
time interacting with customers — so-called front-of house-workers like
bartenders, bussers and servers — can legally receive tips; cooks and
kitchen workers (back-of-house employees) cannot.

Especially on weekends, when tabs and tips run higher, the difference in
earnings can be stark, and often generates conflict between the two
groups.

Now that employees like Ms. Cespedes-Rivera will likely again earn more
than kitchen workers, Mr. Meyer said, his group will institute a
revenue-sharing system for back-of-house employees, and their overall
compensation will go up 20 to 25 percent.

After Mr. Meyer announced the move to end tipping in 2015, some other
industry leaders, including David Chang and Tom Colicchio, [tried to
follow
suit](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-limitations-of-american-restaurants-no-tipping-experiment)
at their restaurants. But for most New York restaurateurs, the
experiment did not last; many customers, as well as servers, remain
attached to tipping.

Fair pay, like virtually every aspect of the hospitality business, is
currently being scrutinized by chefs and owners as they contemplate
reopening with reduced capacity, added risks and high costs.

Amanda Cohen, who has maintained a no-tipping policy at her Lower East
Side restaurant [Dirt Candy](https://www.dirtcandynyc.com/) since 2015,
said the national movement away from tipping is gaining momentum during
the pandemic.

“It’s really changing the way people think about work,” she said.
Especially in states where tip sharing and surcharges are allowed, like
California, restaurants are coming up with new ways to compensate
employees that don’t privilege one group over another. “Every little
breakdown in the system helps,” she
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Although a new law in New York State will end the tipped minimum wage
for most workers on Jan. 1, the measure excludes restaurant servers, who
can continue to collect tips and be paid a lower hourly wage.

In December, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office
[described](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-end-subminimum-wage-across-miscellaneous-industries-statewide)
the new law as “the end of the sub-minimum wage,” and announced that the
decision was based on findings from the state Department of Labor that
tipping is disproportionately harmful to “the lowest-paid workers in our
state: women, minorities and immigrants.”

Although the law applies to nail salon workers, dog groomers and many
others, restaurant workers — the largest group of tipped employees in
the state — are exempt.

“Until the law allows all of our workers be paid a fair wage, tips are
the only way to make the system work,” Mr. Meyer said.

But for small-scale restaurateurs facing existential challenges, tipping
policy is “not high on the list” of priorities, said David Helbraun, a
lawyer in Manhattan whose firm represents more than 1,000 restaurants.

He said his clients have one concern these days: cash flow. With
restaurants barely operating for the foreseeable future, rent relief (or
money from governments to pay it and other costs) is all that matters.

“None of the rest of it matters if you can’t pay the rent,” he said.
