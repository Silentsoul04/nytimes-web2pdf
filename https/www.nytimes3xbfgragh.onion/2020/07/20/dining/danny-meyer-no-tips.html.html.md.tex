Policy}\label{danny-meyers-restaurants-will-end-their-no-tipping-policy}}

Union Square Hospitality Group, which helped lead the move away from
tips, changes course as its restaurants reopen.

One of the country's best-known restaurateurs, Danny Meyer,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/10/15/dining/danny-meyer-restaurants-no-tips.html}{announced
five years ago} that his \href{https://www.ushgnyc.com/}{Union Square
Hospitality Group} would gradually eliminate tipping. The group's
decision began an industrywide examination of the age-old practice, but
adopting it proved complicated, especially in New York State, where laws
governing tip distribution are strict.

Still, especially in recent months, many Americans have come to agree
with Mr. Meyer that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/24/opinion/tipping.html}{tipping
contributes} to unequal pay, racism, sexual harassment and power
disparities in the industry.

But on Monday, the company reversed course. Mr. Meyer told his staff
that Union Square Hospitality would abandon what it calls its
``Hospitality Included'' policy as its restaurants reopen for outdoor
dining, starting on Thursday with the flagship
\href{https://www.unionsquarecafe.com/}{Union Square Cafe} in the
Flatiron district and extending to the nearby
\href{https://www.unionsquarecafe.com/}{Gramercy Tavern} in the coming
weeks. (Some of the group's
\href{https://www.dailyprovisionsnyc.com/}{other businesses} are already
open for takeout and delivery, and all will shift to tipped wages
immediately.)

Mr. Meyer said in an interview that he still believes that tipping
contributes to inequitable pay, wage instability and other problems, and
that he is collaborating with the national
\href{https://onefairwage.com/saru-jayaraman/}{One Fair Wage}campaign to
eliminate it. But as the restaurants begin rehiring today --- about 95
percent of the staff has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/dining/union-square-hospitality-group-layoffs.html}{laid
off} since March --- he is unwilling to deny any extra compensation that
might be available to employees in a time of economic crisis.

``We don't know how often people will be eating out, we don't know what
they are going to be willing to pay,'' he said. ``We do know that guests
want to tip generously right now.''

The Hospitality Included model, which eliminated tips in favor of a
consistent hourly wage, was adopted over several years as New York
State's minimum wage rose to \$15 per hour. The extra labor costs for
the restaurant were reflected in menu prices, which increased by 15 to
20 percent. In theory at least, the customer's actual cost per meal
would be about the same.

Wilma Cespedes-Rivera, a bartender at Blue Smoke, a Union Square
Hospitality restaurant in Lower Manhattan, has worked for the company
for five years. She said that for servers, the change from tipping to
Hospitality Included was painful, and many talented colleagues left for
other jobs.

``People understood that the goal was a healthier balance,'' she said,
``but it wasn't what we signed up for financially.''

In New York State, only employees who spend at least 80 percent of their
time interacting with customers --- so-called front-of house-workers
like bartenders, bussers and servers --- can legally receive tips; cooks
and kitchen workers (back-of-house employees) cannot.

Especially on weekends, when tabs and tips run higher, the difference in
earnings can be stark, and often generates conflict between the two
groups.

Now that employees like Ms. Cespedes-Rivera will likely again earn more
than kitchen workers, Mr. Meyer said, his group will institute a
revenue-sharing system for back-of-house employees, and their overall
compensation will go up 20 to 25 percent.

After Mr. Meyer announced the move to end tipping in 2015, some other
industry leaders, including David Chang and Tom Colicchio,
\href{https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-limitations-of-american-restaurants-no-tipping-experiment}{tried
to follow suit} at their restaurants. But for most New York
restaurateurs, the experiment did not last; many customers, as well as
servers, remain attached to tipping.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/20/dining/20unionsquare3/merlin_174686310_a1d67f69-8e33-4567-8521-15b88ecd1dbf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Fair pay, like virtually every aspect of the hospitality business, is
currently being scrutinized by chefs and owners as they contemplate
reopening with reduced capacity, added risks and high costs.

Amanda Cohen, who has maintained a no-tipping policy at her Lower East
Side restaurant \href{https://www.dirtcandynyc.com/}{Dirt Candy} since
2015, said the national movement away from tipping is gaining momentum
during the pandemic.

``It's really changing the way people think about work,'' she said.
Especially in states where tip sharing and surcharges are allowed, like
California, restaurants are coming up with new ways to compensate
employees that don't privilege one group over another. ``Every little
breakdown in the system helps,'' she said.

    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Although a new law in New York State will end the tipped minimum wage
for most workers on Jan. 1, the measure excludes restaurant servers, who
can continue to collect tips and be paid a lower hourly wage.

In December, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's office
\href{https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-end-subminimum-wage-across-miscellaneous-industries-statewide}{described}
the new law as ``the end of the sub-minimum wage,'' and announced that
the decision was based on findings from the state Department of Labor
that tipping is disproportionately harmful to ``the lowest-paid workers
in our state: women, minorities and immigrants.''

Although the law applies to nail salon workers, dog groomers and many
others, restaurant workers --- the largest group of tipped employees in
the state --- are exempt.

``Until the law allows all of our workers be paid a fair wage, tips are
the only way to make the system work,'' Mr. Meyer said.

But for small-scale restaurateurs facing existential challenges, tipping
policy is ``not high on the list'' of priorities, said David Helbraun, a
lawyer in Manhattan whose firm represents more than 1,000 restaurants.

He said his clients have one concern these days: cash flow. With
restaurants barely operating for the foreseeable future, rent relief (or
money from governments to pay it and other costs) is all that matters.

``None of the rest of it matters if you can't pay the rent,'' he said.
