# How to Identify Flawed Research Before It Becomes Dangerous

</div>

Scientists and journalists need to establish a service to review
research that’s publicized before it is peer reviewed.

Researchers have responded to the challenge of the coronavirus with a
commitment to speed and cooperation, featuring the rapid sharing of
preliminary findings through
“[preprints](https://connect.medrxiv.org/relate/content/181),”
scientific manuscripts that have not yet undergone formal peer review.

We are thrilled that researchers have embraced preprints, which are
making new ideas, data and discoveries about the pandemic available to
scientists and the public in almost real time. An example is the work of
Bhramar Mukherjee and her team at the University of Michigan, whose
research modeling the Covid-19 outbreak in India helped guide that
government’s lockdown policies.

But the open dissemination of early versions of papers has created a
challenge: how to ensure that policymakers and the public do not act too
hastily on early studies that are soon shown to have serious errors.

A case in point occurred in April when a group of scientists from
Stanford University posted the results of a study of previous exposure
to the coronavirus in 3,300 residents of Santa Clara, Calif. Their
paper,
[published](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1?versioned=true)
on the preprint server medRxiv, concluded that “the number of infections
is 50- to 85-fold larger than the number of cases detected,” suggesting
that the fatality rates due to the coronavirus were much lower than
previously thought.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Given the policy implications of such a result, it is no surprise that
the study received immediate attention on social media, and in the local
and national press. But the methods and results of the study were
quickly questioned by scientists, who used
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/wfithian/status/1252692357788479488?s=20),
blogs and online comments on medRxiv to air
[concerns](https://undark.org/2020/04/24/john-ioannidis-covid-19-death-rate-critics/)
about the study’s
[design](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/04/19/fatal-flaws-in-stanford-study-of-coronavirus-prevalence/),
the reliability of the antibody tests and the statistical methodology,
including important errors in the basic mathematical formulas.

This coupling of rapid dissemination with an informal, crowdsourced form
of peer review reflects a new and potentially transformative way to do
science. But the speed of modern journalism, and the lack of familiarity
of the press and public with preprints, meant that despite being largely
debunked, the results were pretty much taken at face value.

It has always been a challenge for science journalists to balance the
results of individual studies against the complex and often contentious
process by which science converges on a better understanding of reality.
In the past, because they were generally reporting on studies that had
been through peer review at a scholarly journal, journalists could be
confident that the work they were describing had received at least some
scrutiny from independent scientists, even if that did not guarantee its
accuracy.

But the slow and staid system of journal peer review in its current form
offers little help to journalists in the rapid-fire world of preprints,
especially amid a pandemic when there are strong forces aligned against
patience. The best initial reporting on the Stanford study incorporated
the concerns raised by scientists on Twitter. But we realize that we
cannot rely on this as the sole means of guarding against the overly
hasty application of science reported in preprints.

That is why we and [a group of over 100
scientists](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NgNbxbMq6X4EBY3Zv8sFQhpqLNNOHRce9VfaWbynI5U/edit?usp=sharing)
are calling for American scientists and journalists to join forces to
create a rapid-review service for preprints of broad public interest. It
would corral a diverse contingent of scientists ready to comment on new
preprints and to be responsive to reporters on deadline. This would
provide journalists reliable access to independent scientists to help
deal with today’s growing stream of preprints.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Such a service would collaborate with journals and other respected
organizations working at the interface between science and journalism.
For example, [SciLine](https://www.sciline.org/) — a philanthropically
supported free service for journalists based at the American Association
for the Advancement of Science — mediates hundreds of media interviews
with scientists every year, and similar organizations exist in
[Britain](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/),
[Germany](https://www.sciencemediacenter.de/en/our-offers/portfolio),
[Australia](https://www.smc.org.au/) and [New
Zealand](https://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/). The service would also
collaborate with professional organizations, such as the American
Statistical Association, to recruit a team of volunteers with the
expertise needed to assess new preprints on journalists’ timelines.

We hope that scientists will step up to this need and provide
journalists with the tools they need to better understand the research
and convey its practical message. The public and policymakers must
demand this kind of scrutiny before they turn the latest science on
Covid-19 or anything else into policy or individual action.
