The month after Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Yale historian Timothy
Snyder published the best-selling book “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons From
the Twentieth Century.” It was part of a small flood of titles meant to
help Americans find their bearings as the new president laid siege to
liberal democracy.

One of Snyder’s lessons was, “Be wary of paramilitaries.” He wrote,
“When the pro-leader paramilitary and the official police and military
intermingle, the end has come.” In 2017, the idea of unidentified agents
in camouflage snatching leftists off the streets without warrants might
have seemed like a febrile Resistance fantasy. Now it’s happening.

According to a
[lawsuit](http://opb-imgserve-production.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/original/ag_rosenblum_xxxx_updated_complaint_1595086491349.pdf)
filed by Oregon’s attorney general, Ellen Rosenblum, on Friday, federal
agents “have been using unmarked vehicles to drive around downtown
Portland, detain protesters, and place them into the officers’ unmarked
vehicles” since at least last Tuesday. The protesters are neither
arrested nor told why they’re being held.

There’s no way to know the affiliation of all the agents — they’ve been
wearing military fatigues with patches that just say “Police” — but The
Times reported that some of them are [part of a specialized Border
Patrol
group](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/portland-protests.html)
“that normally is tasked with investigating drug smuggling
organizations.”

The Trump administration has announced that it intends to send a similar
force to [other
cities](https://www.motherjones.com/anti-racism-police-protest/2020/07/trump-border-patrol-cities-portland-chicago/);
on Monday, [The Chicago Tribune
reported](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-police-dhs-deployment-20200720-dftu5ychwbcxtg4ltarh5qnwma-story.html)
on plans to deploy about 150 federal agents to Chicago. “I don’t need
invitations by the state,” Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department
of Homeland Security, [said on Fox
News](https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1285224329878306817?s=20)
Monday, adding, “We’re going to do that whether they like us there or
not.”

In Portland, we see what such an occupation looks like. Oregon Public
Broadcasting reported on [29-year-old Mark
Pettibone](https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/),
who early last Wednesday was grabbed off the street by unidentified men,
hustled into an unmarked minivan and taken to a holding cell in the
federal courthouse. He was eventually released without learning who had
abducted him.

A federal agent shot 26-year-old Donavan La Bella in the head with an
impact munition; he was hospitalized and needed reconstructive surgery.
In a widely circulated video, a 53-year-old Navy veteran was [pepper
sprayed and
beaten](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/20/christopher-david-portland-protest-video/)
after approaching federal agents to ask them about their oaths to the
Constitution, leaving him with two broken bones.

There’s something particularly terrifying in the use of Border Patrol
agents against American dissidents. After the [attack on
protesters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html)
near the White House last month, the military pushed back on Trump’s
attempts to turn it against the citizenry. Police officers in many
cities are willing to brutalize demonstrators, but they’re under local
control. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, however, is under federal
authority, has leadership that’s [fanatically
devoted](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-border-patrol-was-primed-for-president-trump)
to Trump and is saturated with far-right politics.

“It doesn’t surprise me that Donald Trump picked C.B.P. to be the ones
to go over to Portland and do this,” Representative Joaquin Castro,
Democrat of Texas, told me. “It has been a very problematic agency in
terms of respecting human rights and in terms of respecting the law.”

It is true that C.B.P. is not an extragovernmental militia, and so might
not fit precisely into Snyder’s “On Tyranny” schema. But when I spoke to
Snyder on Monday, he suggested the distinction isn’t that significant.
“The state is allowed to use force, but the state is allowed to use
force according to rules,” he said. These agents, operating outside
their normal roles, are by all appearances behaving lawlessly.

Snyder pointed out that the history of autocracy offers several examples
of border agents being used against regime enemies.

“This is a classic way that violence happens in authoritarian regimes,
whether it’s Franco’s Spain or whether it’s the Russian Empire,” said
Snyder. “The people who are getting used to committing violence on the
border are then brought in to commit violence against people in the
interior.”

Castro worries that since the agents are unidentified, far-right groups
could [easily masquerade as
them](https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1284956181400899585?s=20)
to go after their enemies on the left. “It becomes more likely the more
that this tactic is used,” he said. “I think it’s unconstitutional and
dangerous and heading towards fascism.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Friday, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, [tweeted about what’s
happening in
Portland](https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1284294427654197248?s=20):
“Trump and his storm troopers must be stopped.” She didn’t mention what
Congress plans to do to stop them, but the House will soon vote on a
homeland security appropriations bill. People outraged about the
administration’s police-state tactics should demand, at a minimum, that
Congress hold up the department’s funding until those tactics are
halted.

Through the Trump years, there’s been a debate about whether the
president’s authoritarianism is tempered by his incompetence. Those who
think concern about fascism is overblown can cite several instances when
the administration has been beaten back after overreaching. But all too
often the White House has persevered, deforming American life until what
once seemed like worst-case scenarios become the status quo.

Trump has already established that his allies, like Michael Flynn and
Roger Stone, are above the law. What happens now will tell us how many
of us are below it.
