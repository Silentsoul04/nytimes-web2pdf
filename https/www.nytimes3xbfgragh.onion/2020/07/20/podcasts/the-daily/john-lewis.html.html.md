    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

    Today: The life, lessons and legacy of John Lewis. I spoke with my
    colleague, Times editorial board member, Brent Staples.
    
    It’s Monday, July 20.
    
    Brent, I want to start by going back with you to the time when John
    Lewis and others began engaging in nonviolent protests as part of
    the civil rights movement. Where were you during that period?

  - brent staples  
    Like everyone else at the time in the middle ‘60s, I was sitting
    with my parents, watching television —

  - archived recording 1  
    \[MUSIC\] It’s 11:00 p.m., and time for the reporters and the news.

  - archived recording 2  
    Good evening. Bad news for Alabama today. Some school desegregation
    strategy has backfired.

  - archived recording 3  
    Policemen occasionally clubbed demonstrators and used a variety of
    other tactics designed to break their spirit.

brent staples

— and the nightly news of the scenes of people being ravaged by the
police in the South in the streets. And I became attuned to the
revolution that was unfolding in the South, where people had put
themselves in harm’s way to highlight the injustice of Southern
apartheid.

  - archived recording  
    The Southerners, white and Negro, spattered with ketchup and
    mustard, sugar, salt and pepper, were carted off, unprotesting to
    jail.

brent staples

But as I became more politically active, I had difficulty — probably
natural difficulty, understanding how one would put oneself on the line
to be actually beaten and bloodied, and what the utility of that was.
And by that time, the movement in the South had evolved some way.

  - archived recording  
    (SINGING) No more brothers in jail. Off the pigs\! The pigs are
    gonna catch hell.

brent staples

By ‘66, you began to get the Black Power slogans.

  - archived recording  
    They don’t want us to use Black Power. I got news for them.
    \[LAUGHTER\]

brent staples

So I came into consciousness in my teens as a Black Power figure.

  - archived recording  
    This is not a riot, it is a rebellion.

brent staples

It was empowering.

  - archived recording  
    Number two, you are to be proud of your Black brothers and sisters
    at Fifth, because a honky cop touched one of them, and they told
    them, you’ve got to touch all of us.

brent staples

But it took some time into my late teens to begin to understand what had
happened coming up to that. And that is when I become aware of what had
passed before when I was a younger kid.

michael barbaro

In other words, it took you some time to understand why the nonviolent
figures had taken the approach that they had taken.

brent staples

Yes.

michael barbaro

So I want you to take us through John Lewis’s life and how this
philosophy you just described was shaped and how it evolved. So where
does that story begin?

brent staples

John Lewis, he grows up in rural Alabama near Troy, Alabama. His parents
initially were sharecroppers. And you know, sharecropping was a
successor form of slavery. So John was born into that. And his parents,
they were lucky they saved enough money to buy a farm.

But he graduated high school, segregated high school, and wanted to go
to Troy State College, which didn’t admit Black people. And he applied
and sent in his information. And he never heard back. And he wrote a
letter at one point to Martin Luther King. And I presume he wanted some
help in desegregating Troy State.

And Martin Luther King sent him a roundtrip bus ticket. And he went and
he met King, and they formed a relationship. The substance of that, I
don’t know, but it was extremely influential for John. And he left Troy
not long after that and moved to Nashville.

\[music\]

brent staples

He went to seminary in Nashville. And there, he met some of the early
civil rights figures. He met James Lawson — Reverend James Lawson — who
was kind of a philosopher of nonviolent resistance. Lawson had studied
Gandhi’s nonviolent movement and the strategies that Gandhi had deployed
against Britain during the colonial period. And he’d come back with a
deep sense of what the philosophy was and how powerful nonviolence could
be.

michael barbaro

And what exactly is the philosophy?

brent staples

I have John’s memoir here. In 1958, I think it is, Jim Lawson mentions
to him the idea of, quote, “redemptive suffering.” And he explains that
it affects not only ourselves, but it touches and changes those around
us as well. It opens us and those around us to a force beyond ourselves.
A force that is right and moral. The force of righteous truth that is
the basis of human conscious. Suffering puts us and those around us in
touch with our consciences. It open and touches our hearts. It makes us
feel compassion where we need to and guilt if we must. So this idea, to
him, this redemptive suffering, it is at the heart of the philosophy of
nonviolent protest. At the very heart of it. This is a good paragraph
from the book:

“One method of practicing this approach, when faced with a hateful,
angry, aggressive, even despicable person, is to imagine that person —
actually visualize him or her — as an infant, as a baby. If you can see
this full-grown attacker who faces you as a pure, innocent child that he
or she once was, it is not hard to find compassion in your heart.”

But then it wasn’t just a tactic. It was a way of life. It was embracing
the biblical prescription that one must love one’s enemies. That’s a
biblical prescription. And it’s the hardest thing in the world to carry
out.

michael barbaro

Well, so how do we start to see this get carried out among Lewis and
these seminary students in Nashville?

brent staples

Well, Nashville was itself at the time another southern town, where if
you went into a restaurant and sat down the people would just look at
you and the waitresses would say, sorry, this place doesn’t serve
\[EXPLETIVE\]. And that would generally be the end of it. But these
students came in that place and sat down and asked to be fed. And when
they were told that they were not served, they stayed.

And they took a lot of abuse from it. And people spat upon them, beat
them, battered them, and poured condiments over their heads. All kinds
of things. And I remember our friend, David Halberstam, our former
colleague, was working at a newspaper there at the time. He was working
at The Nashville Tennesseean. And this is one of the things he wrote:

“The protest had been conducted with exceptional dignity, and gradually,
one image had come into prevail — that of elegant, courteous, young
Black people, holding to their Gandhian principles, seeking the most
elemental of rights, while being assaulted by young white hoodlums who
beat them up and on occasion extinguished cigarettes on their bodies.”

So you see John Lewis and others being carried away in these, really,
suits and ties and crisp white shirt. And basically refusing to walk
themselves, being completely passive and nonresistant. And this worked
out extremely — I mean, in a very short period of time, it worked out
extremely well in Nashville. After three months of sit-ins, the city
basically caved and became the first major Southern city to begin
desegregating public facilities.

michael barbaro

So very early on, the protest that John Lewis is beginning to
participate in, after he meets Martin Luther King and begins to
understand the strategy, they are starting to show real signs of
effectiveness.

brent staples

Oh, yeah.

michael barbaro

These peaceful, nonviolent protests.

brent staples

Exactly. Yeah. This is astonishing thing, to me, to this day, to
practice the non-violent approach to life. To really embrace it, one
needs to understand that the person who was extinguishing a cigarette in
your throat because you want to sit down at a luncheon counter is as
much a victim as you are. What John was saying — you, in pursuit of
justice, you cannot let violence win your heart. That if you do that,
you’re surrendering, really, to the dark force that you’re trying to
defeat.

michael barbaro

Brent, you’re reading from a memoir that is written in the later years
of John Lewis’s life. But my understanding is that this philosophy that
he embraced and that he practiced, it was not entirely a foregone
conclusion that this would be the way that it went, and that the March
on Washington is an example of a moment where we see a young John Lewis
grappling with which path he’s going to take. Can you tell us the story
of that speech?

brent staples

Well, you see, what I finally figured out is that by the time John
Lewis, at the age of 23, gets to the march on Washington — this is the
most important public gathering of Black people in the century — he has
already been on the Freedom Rides. Integrated groups have taken buses
into the deep south to test laws that forbid segregation on interstate
transport. He’s been arrested on those trips for going into white-only
bathrooms. He’s been beaten just for being on buses with white people.
In the end, John ended up being arrested, like, 40 times.

michael barbaro

Right.

brent staples

And if you look at some of the pictures of the mugshots when he’s
arrested, you can see him smiling because he’s basically saying, you
think you’re afflicting me, but you’re playing into what I want to do.
But he’s still 23 years old. That’s all he is.

And he basically comes into Washington with a speech. And this one
somehow found its way into public. And one of the striking things about
it, he tells people to get into the street and stay in the street until
the revolution is finished. And he names the sort of racist
segregationist senators by name. And state governors, too.

michael barbaro

Wow.

brent staples

I’m going to read from it.

“We won’t stop now. All the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace,
Thurman won’t stop this revolution. The time will come when we will not
confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South,
through the heart of Dixie, the way Sherman did. We shall pursue our own
scorched earth policy and burn Jim Crow to the ground nonviolently.”

michael barbaro

Wow. And to explain that reference, he’s referring to the Union General
who literally burns large sections of the South during the Civil War.

brent staples

Yes, he’s referring to William Tecumseh Sherman. “We shall pursue our
own scorched earth policy and burn Jim Crow to the ground nonviolently.
We shall fragment the south into a thousand pieces and put them back
together in the image of democracy. We will make the action of the past
few months look petty. And I say to you, wake up, America.”

michael barbaro

Brent, that language doesn’t sound, even as it invokes the word,
nonviolent. So what do you think that he meant by those words in that
draft?

brent staples

Well, I’ve come to figure out what he meant. Now, understand, as I was
saying earlier, by the time he renders this speech, he has become
steeped in the nonviolent impulse. But his frame, he was portraying it
as a forceful measure that could be as powerful and changing, as was the
sweep of Sherman through South Carolina and Georgia. What you have here
is, John is working at a very high concept here, right? He’s working at
a high concept. He’s saying, we can be — he was essentially arguing that
nonviolent protests could be transformative. As transformative and as
disruptive as war as carried out by the most feared general in the Union
Army. That is itself a very powerful metaphor. And it’s a testament to
his beliefs and what his approach could do. And he was calling upon
hundreds of thousands of people to come out into the street and make
that a reality. But that’s a high concept. And on the evening news, you
can imagine you’d end up with a snippet of a scorched earth Sherman
burning Atlanta again.

michael barbaro

Right, it might get lost in translation. It might actually undermine the
very thing he’s trying to promote.

brent staples

Exactly. So basically, A. Philip Randolph, Martin Luther King, those
guys prevailed on him to make some changes in it. They were talking
about, let’s not do anything to just not give them a sound bite that’s
going to give us trouble. I can hear him saying it. I don’t have the
tape, but I can hear them saying to John, let’s not give them a sound
bite that’s going to give us trouble. You can say it’s a revolution. You
can call people on the street. You can even call them the Black masses,
if you want to, even though that sounds like communism, right? You could
say those things. But let’s leave off Sherman for next time. Right?
\[LAUGHS\] So Sherman goes out.

  - archived recording (john lewis)  
    We march today for jobs and freedom. But we have nothing to be proud
    of. For hundreds of thousands of our brothers are not here.

brent staples

He talks about marching.

  - archived recording (john lewis)  
    The time will come. We will not confine our marching to Washington.
    We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson —

brent staples

We will march through the street of Jackson, through the streets of
Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of
Birmingham.

  - archived recording (john lewis)  
    But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of
    dignity that we have shown here today. \[APPLAUSE\]
    
    By the forces of our demand, our determination and our numbers, we
    shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put
    them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say, Wake
    up, America\! Wake up\!” For we cannot stop, and we will not and
    cannot be patient. \[APPLAUSE\]

brent staples

So this is pretty much the same. But Sherman is missing.

michael barbaro

So in terms of thinking about the speech that John Lewis drafted versus
the one he delivered, on that historic day, you’re saying it’s not that
the earlier version of the speech shows John Lewis questioning the
nonviolent approach. It’s that he believed in the nonviolent approach,
but that the language he contemplated using — his belief that the power
of that approach could be as powerful as burning — that was determined
to be potentially counterproductive to the nonviolent approach he
believed in.

brent staples

Exactly. But he talks about going back to his hotel room after that
first conversation and just being livid because, of course, it’s a
23-year-old man’s speech. And a 23-year-old man who had been beaten to
an inch of his life while fighting for dignity for Black people. I’m
sure he felt entitled to say any damn thing he wanted to. Because he had
the credibility of the streets behind him and the people in the Douth
beginning to know who he was. And they were going to really know who he
was, come two years later at the voting rights march at Selma.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

Brent, tell me about that. I mean, let’s talk about what happens after
the March on Washington, after John Lewis’s rhetorical wings are ever so
slightly clipped, but he does deliver the essential message. How do we
see this concept of the power of nonviolence actually play out over the
next couple of years?

brent staples

The next big data point becomes the voting rights struggle in Selma,
Alabama. Now it’s important, I think, to dilate for just a second for
the modern listener.

The modern listener needs to understand that in voting arrangements in
the South, before the Voting Rights Act, local registrars had complete
authority to do whatever they wanted with people who came in to register
to vote. They could give you a test and then say you failed it so you
can’t register. And they did that all day long, all day, every day, to
Black people.

In Virginia, a college-educated woman, Black woman, who I believe was a
teacher, went into register at one point and filled the application. And
the registrar handed her a literacy test. You know what it consisted of?
A blank sheet of paper. He asked her, what does this say? And she looked
at it and handed it back, and she said nothing. He said, you’re wrong.
You fail. You can’t register.

Elsewhere in the South, they might ask you if you came in to register to
vote, how many bubbles are there in a bar of soap?

Elsewhere, a famous example in the film “Selma,” where a woman had come
in to register one year, and they asked her, how many judges are there
in the state of Alabama? And she didn’t know. They said, well, you fail.
And she came back the second year. And he said, how many county judges
are there in Alabama? And I think it was 67. And she said 67. And he
said now, before you register, you have to name them.

michael barbaro

Aw.

brent staples

So this was what life was like for Black people seeking to vote in the
South. Now John Lewis’s organization, the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, had already set up a voting rights project in
Selma and had been working on that. But it came to fruition in 1965,
where people had been fed up. And so they staged a march from Selma to
Montgomery to protest in favor of voting rights for Black people.

And then that fateful day, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were
walking. State troopers came out and said, this is unlawful.

  - archived recording  
    It would be detrimental to your safety to continue this march. And
    I’m saying that this is an unlawful assembly. You have to
    disperse. You are ordered to disperse. Go home, or go to your
    church. This march will not continue.

brent staples

You cannot march.

  - archived recording  
    Troopers, here, advance toward the gate.
    
    See that they disperse.

brent staples

And then John said to the sheriff. He said, can I have a word? Because
you know he’s in the front with his little off-white trenchcoat on. And
now there’s a thing about this trenchcoat, right? It’s very light, so
you can see him standing out from everyone else. And the other thing
about it is, once blood gets on it, you can really see it. So I’m sure
that that was premeditated. So he comes out front, and he says, can I
have a word? No, you can’t have a word. And the troopers begin to
advance. And they beat holy hell out of those people. They sent 58
people to the hospital.

John Lewis suffers a fractured skull. And by the time the film is flown
back to New York to be shown on the air — and it’s really one of those
films where you see these people running. You see tear gas and these
billy clubs just going up and down, just beating the shit out of people.
And because John was in front, you could see him holding his head where
he’d been hit. And it was on the ground.

  - archived recording  
    Can we have somebody take somebody to a doctor? \[CROWD CLAMORING\]

brent staples

That, in my opinion — I’m not the historian here — but in my opinion,
that was the ultimate triumph of the nonviolent approach and the
suffering approach as he was saying.

michael barbaro

Why triumphant?

brent staples

Well, it was triumphant because even people who had tried to look away
from what was happening in the South were forced to see the long arm of
the law persecuting people publicly. Not just perscute, trying to kill
them publicly. And also, the Voting Rights Act was pending at that time.
And after this happened, Lyndon Johnson addressed a joint session of
both Houses of Congress, I believe, and said —

  - archived recording (lyndon b. johnson)  
    It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln, the great
    president of another party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
    But emancipation is a proclamation, and not a fact. A century has
    passed, more than 100 years since equality was promised.

brent staples

We cannot delay any longer.

  - archived recording (lyndon b. johnson)  
    A century has passed since the day of promise. And the promise is
    unkept. The time of justice has now come.
    
    We shall overcome.

\[music\]

brent staples

So the Voting Rights Act was signed later that summer in August. It
didn’t take long. So when people come in to register to vote, you can
no longer ask them how many bubbles are in a bar of soap, or to name
every judge in the state. This is a big leap in our time.

michael barbaro

So quite literally, there’s a straight line between the scene of what
happened on that bridge, and something John Lewis knew would be so
powerful — the concept of nonviolent suffering — and the legislative
remedy back in Washington that resulted.

brent staples

Yes.

michael barbaro

Because the world had seen this happen.

brent staples

Right. Yeah, I think so. But also, you begin to see the sort of apex of
this message really is ‘65, ‘66. And at some point, then, John is
replaced in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee presidency by
Stokely Carmichael, a fiery orator and one of the primary enunciaters of
the Black Power movement, that was more consistent with the emerging
radicalism of the time.

michael barbaro

And that was the movement that you felt a part of.

brent staples

Yes. That’s where we came into the story, you know?

michael barbaro

Brent, on some level, you and your cohort must have thought that this
approach, the John Lewis approach, had limitations. Given that by the
time you were a teenager, or maybe even entering your early 20s, there
was this new philosophy taking hold of a more elbows out, less
restrained approach. So how do you think about that?

brent staples

Well, it’s interesting. And I do think about it. What had happened,
really, is every generation, until it educates itself, thinks its
experience is unique. So we thought we were unique. My cousins and I,
and we had our big meetings, and we had our press conferences. And we
had a different rhetorical stance.

But in the end, the tools were exactly the same. The tools were the
sit-in of the administration building. The tool was the sit-in in the
street that ran through campus. The tool was the building takeover.
These were the same tools, man. I mean, I had bigger hair, right? Right?
And I’ll send you a picture. I’ll have \[INAUDIBLE\].

michael barbaro

Please do.

brent staples

I have good hair, though. But if you look back on it, the tools were the
same.

michael barbaro

And it was a foundation that had already been built, even if you didn’t
see it that way at the time.

brent staples

And even if you didn’t know it. You know what I’m saying? Even if you
didn’t know. I keep going back to this point earlier in this story, when
they were doing the Freedom Rides in 1961. They had a big Chinese dinner
in Washington, that people were going off on these Freedom Rides. And a
lot of people wrote their wills, because they thought that they’d be
killed — there’s a chance they’d be killed and never come back. And they
referred to the meal at the Chinese restaurant as “the last supper.”

So these people were willing to put their lives on the line, were
willing to accept the possibility that they would be killed in the
pursuit of justice, and that their dead bodies laying out in public
would be part of a sacrifice that would advance the cause of justice.
That’s profound. No?

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. So with all that in mind, Brent, how are you thinking about John
Lewis’s legacy at this moment, as we talk in the middle of yet another
critical moment in this movement, and when the work is still understood
to be very unfinished.

brent staples

You know, John Lewis, in the waning days of his life, was heartened and
overjoyed to see the global protests that unfolded after the killing of
Mr. Floyd. He talked about it as part of the extension of his work. And
one of the things he said, he essentially — I’m paraphrasing — he said,
the thing’s out of the box now. He said, there’s no going back from
this.

michael barbaro

Hm. And what about the principles of his life? How are you thinking
about those in this moment?

brent staples

Well, I think that, as you see, his point of view was borne out.

  - archived recording  
    \[SHOUTING\] Don’t touch me\! Don’t touch me\! Don’t touch me.

brent staples

The other day, The New York Times had a story in which it had 64
examples, video examples of police brutalizing peaceful demonstrators.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm, I saw it.

brent staples

Right? Now, what is that?

What that is, is what John was talking about. He was talking about this
kind of injustice perpetrated on people who did not deserve it, did not
warrant that kind of treatment. And also, we’ve been seeing in this
unfolding of the Floyd protests in — it’s a repeated theme in the news
stories — white suburbanites, middle class white people, who supported
the police unquestioningly, right? They have changed their minds.

michael barbaro

Hm.

The real persuasive thing is seeing people walking around in the street
with signs, unarmed, not doing anything untoward, and be brutalized.
That turns out to be the most persuasive thing for the society and for
the people to whom it has happening.

Hm. In other words, we are again seeing this idea of the beloved
community playing out, the Gandhian philosophy, this biblical approach
that you described.

brent staples

Yes.

michael barbaro

It’s working. It’s painfully working again.

brent staples

Yes, it’s painful. Lord knows it is. It’s painful. But abuse of the
people in public — people’s constitutional rights — through violence by
police organizations, has broad, rippling consequences. It’s having
broad, rippling consequences. It’s beyond the people who you beat up who
now don’t have confidence in the police. And John saw all that.

michael barbaro

Brent, is there anything from Lewis’s memoir that you haven’t already
shared that you want to leave us with?

brent staples

Well, I don’t know if it fits. But perhaps we should just put that aside
and read from one of John Lewis’s favorite poems. It’s “Invictus” by
William Ernest Henley:

“Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole, I
thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch
of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the
bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody but unbowed. Beyond this place
of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade. And yet the menace
of the years finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how
straight the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll. I am the
master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.”

michael barbaro

Brent, thank you very much. We really appreciate your time today.

brent staples

Well, good to be with you.

    Boy, Congressman Lewis joins us now for his first network TV
    interview since the protests over the death of George Floyd began.
    Congressman John Lewis, it’s so good to see you. I can’t tell you,
    you are such a sight for sore eyes today. It’s really good to see
    you. What would you tell, Congressman, young people, and people,
    quite frankly, who are not so young, about the best way to seek
    justice? You know, there’s been a lot of controversy, a lot of talk
    about the looting. And we should stress that most of the protests
    were very peaceful. But there was some looting. There was some
    disruption. What would you say to people about the best way to
    achieve justice?

  - archived recording (john lewis)  
    It was very moving. It was very moving to see hundreds and thousands
    of people from all over America and around the world taking to the
    streets, to the roadways, to stand up, to speak up, to speak out, to
    do what I call “getting in trouble.”
    
    During the ‘60s, the great majority of us accepted the way of peace,
    the way of love, the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence as a
    way of life, as a way of living. There’s something cleansing,
    something wholesome, about being peaceful and orderly, to stand up
    and with a sense of dignity, and a sense of pride, and never hate.
    
    Dr. King said over and over again, “Hate is too heavy a burden to
    bear.” The way of love is the much better way. And that’s what we
    did. We were arrested. Yes, I was beaten, left bloody and
    unconscious. But I never became bitter or hostile, never gave up. I
    believed that somehow and some way, if it becomes necessary to use
    our bodies to have redeem the soul of a nation, then we must do it.
    Create a society at peace with yourself.

    Today: The life, lessons and legacy of John Lewis. I spoke with my
    colleague, Times editorial board member, Brent Staples.
    
    It’s Monday, July 20.
    
    Brent, I want to start by going back with you to the time when John
    Lewis and others began engaging in nonviolent protests as part of
    the civil rights movement. Where were you during that period?

  - brent staples  
    Like everyone else at the time in the middle ‘60s, I was sitting
    with my parents, watching television —

  - archived recording 1  
    \[MUSIC\] It’s 11:00 p.m., and time for the reporters and the news.

    Policemen occasionally clubbed demonstrators and used a variety of
    other tactics designed to break their spirit.

— and the nightly news of the scenes of people being ravaged by the
police in the South in the streets. And I became attuned to the
revolution that was unfolding in the South, where people had put
themselves in harm’s way to highlight the injustice of Southern
apartheid.

  - archived recording  
    The Southerners, white and Negro, spattered with ketchup and
    mustard, sugar, salt and pepper, were carted off, unprotesting to
    jail.

brent staples

But as I became more politically active, I had difficulty — probably
natural difficulty, understanding how one would put oneself on the line
to be actually beaten and bloodied, and what the utility of that was.
And by that time, the movement in the South had evolved some way.

By ‘66, you began to get the Black Power slogans.

  - archived recording  
    They don’t want us to use Black Power. I got news for them.
    \[LAUGHTER\]

brent staples

So I came into consciousness in my teens as a Black Power figure.

  - archived recording  
    This is not a riot, it is a rebellion.

brent staples

It was empowering.

  - archived recording  
    Number two, you are to be proud of your Black brothers and sisters
    at Fifth, because a honky cop touched one of them, and they told
    them, you’ve got to touch all of us.

brent staples

But it took some time into my late teens to begin to understand what had
happened coming up to that. And that is when I become aware of what had
passed before when I was a younger kid.

michael barbaro

In other words, it took you some time to understand why the nonviolent
figures had taken the approach that they had taken.

brent staples

Yes.

michael barbaro

So I want you to take us through John Lewis’s life and how this
philosophy you just described was shaped and how it evolved. So where
does that story begin?

brent staples

John Lewis, he grows up in rural Alabama near Troy, Alabama. His parents
initially were sharecroppers. And you know, sharecropping was a
successor form of slavery. So John was born into that. And his parents,
they were lucky they saved enough money to buy a farm.

But he graduated high school, segregated high school, and wanted to go
to Troy State College, which didn’t admit Black people. And he applied
and sent in his information. And he never heard back. And he wrote a
letter at one point to Martin Luther King. And I presume he wanted some
help in desegregating Troy State.

And Martin Luther King sent him a roundtrip bus ticket. And he went and
he met King, and they formed a relationship. The substance of that, I
don’t know, but it was extremely influential for John. And he left Troy
not long after that and moved to Nashville.

\[music\]

brent staples

He went to seminary in Nashville. And there, he met some of the early
civil rights figures. He met James Lawson — Reverend James Lawson — who
was kind of a philosopher of nonviolent resistance. Lawson had studied
Gandhi’s nonviolent movement and the strategies that Gandhi had deployed
against Britain during the colonial period. And he’d come back with a
deep sense of what the philosophy was and how powerful nonviolence could
be.

michael barbaro

And what exactly is the philosophy?

brent staples

I have John’s memoir here. In 1958, I think it is, Jim Lawson mentions
to him the idea of, quote, “redemptive suffering.” And he explains that
it affects not only ourselves, but it touches and changes those around
us as well. It opens us and those around us to a force beyond ourselves.
A force that is right and moral. The force of righteous truth that is
the basis of human conscious. Suffering puts us and those around us in
touch with our consciences. It open and touches our hearts. It makes us
feel compassion where we need to and guilt if we must. So this idea, to
him, this redemptive suffering, it is at the heart of the philosophy of
nonviolent protest. At the very heart of it. This is a good paragraph
from the book:

“One method of practicing this approach, when faced with a hateful,
angry, aggressive, even despicable person, is to imagine that person —
actually visualize him or her — as an infant, as a baby. If you can see
this full-grown attacker who faces you as a pure, innocent child that he
or she once was, it is not hard to find compassion in your heart.”

But then it wasn’t just a tactic. It was a way of life. It was embracing
the biblical prescription that one must love one’s enemies. That’s a
biblical prescription. And it’s the hardest thing in the world to carry
out.

michael barbaro

Well, so how do we start to see this get carried out among Lewis and
these seminary students in Nashville?

brent staples

Well, Nashville was itself at the time another southern town, where if
you went into a restaurant and sat down the people would just look at
you and the waitresses would say, sorry, this place doesn’t serve
\[EXPLETIVE\]. And that would generally be the end of it. But these
students came in that place and sat down and asked to be fed. And when
they were told that they were not served, they stayed.

And they took a lot of abuse from it. And people spat upon them, beat
them, battered them, and poured condiments over their heads. All kinds
of things. And I remember our friend, David Halberstam, our former
colleague, was working at a newspaper there at the time. He was working
at The Nashville Tennesseean. And this is one of the things he wrote:

“The protest had been conducted with exceptional dignity, and gradually,
one image had come into prevail — that of elegant, courteous, young
Black people, holding to their Gandhian principles, seeking the most
elemental of rights, while being assaulted by young white hoodlums who
beat them up and on occasion extinguished cigarettes on their bodies.”

So you see John Lewis and others being carried away in these, really,
suits and ties and crisp white shirt. And basically refusing to walk
themselves, being completely passive and nonresistant. And this worked
out extremely — I mean, in a very short period of time, it worked out
extremely well in Nashville. After three months of sit-ins, the city
basically caved and became the first major Southern city to begin
desegregating public facilities.

michael barbaro

So very early on, the protest that John Lewis is beginning to
participate in, after he meets Martin Luther King and begins to
understand the strategy, they are starting to show real signs of
effectiveness.

brent staples

Oh, yeah.

michael barbaro

These peaceful, nonviolent protests.

brent staples

Exactly. Yeah. This is astonishing thing, to me, to this day, to
practice the non-violent approach to life. To really embrace it, one
needs to understand that the person who was extinguishing a cigarette in
your throat because you want to sit down at a luncheon counter is as
much a victim as you are. What John was saying — you, in pursuit of
justice, you cannot let violence win your heart. That if you do that,
you’re surrendering, really, to the dark force that you’re trying to
defeat.

michael barbaro

Brent, you’re reading from a memoir that is written in the later years
of John Lewis’s life. But my understanding is that this philosophy that
he embraced and that he practiced, it was not entirely a foregone
conclusion that this would be the way that it went, and that the March
on Washington is an example of a moment where we see a young John Lewis
grappling with which path he’s going to take. Can you tell us the story
of that speech?

brent staples

Well, you see, what I finally figured out is that by the time John
Lewis, at the age of 23, gets to the march on Washington — this is the
most important public gathering of Black people in the century — he has
already been on the Freedom Rides. Integrated groups have taken buses
into the deep south to test laws that forbid segregation on interstate
transport. He’s been arrested on those trips for going into white-only
bathrooms. He’s been beaten just for being on buses with white people.
In the end, John ended up being arrested, like, 40 times.

michael barbaro

Right.

brent staples

And if you look at some of the pictures of the mugshots when he’s
arrested, you can see him smiling because he’s basically saying, you
think you’re afflicting me, but you’re playing into what I want to do.
But he’s still 23 years old. That’s all he is.

And he basically comes into Washington with a speech. And this one
somehow found its way into public. And one of the striking things about
it, he tells people to get into the street and stay in the street until
the revolution is finished. And he names the sort of racist
segregationist senators by name. And state governors, too.

michael barbaro

Wow.

brent staples

I’m going to read from it.

“We won’t stop now. All the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace,
Thurman won’t stop this revolution. The time will come when we will not
confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South,
through the heart of Dixie, the way Sherman did. We shall pursue our own
scorched earth policy and burn Jim Crow to the ground nonviolently.”

michael barbaro

Wow. And to explain that reference, he’s referring to the Union General
who literally burns large sections of the South during the Civil War.

brent staples

Yes, he’s referring to William Tecumseh Sherman. “We shall pursue our
own scorched earth policy and burn Jim Crow to the ground nonviolently.
We shall fragment the south into a thousand pieces and put them back
together in the image of democracy. We will make the action of the past
few months look petty. And I say to you, wake up, America.”

michael barbaro

Brent, that language doesn’t sound, even as it invokes the word,
nonviolent. So what do you think that he meant by those words in that
draft?

brent staples

Well, I’ve come to figure out what he meant. Now, understand, as I was
saying earlier, by the time he renders this speech, he has become
steeped in the nonviolent impulse. But his frame, he was portraying it
as a forceful measure that could be as powerful and changing, as was the
sweep of Sherman through South Carolina and Georgia. What you have here
is, John is working at a very high concept here, right? He’s working at
a high concept. He’s saying, we can be — he was essentially arguing that
nonviolent protests could be transformative. As transformative and as
disruptive as war as carried out by the most feared general in the Union
Army. That is itself a very powerful metaphor. And it’s a testament to
his beliefs and what his approach could do. And he was calling upon
hundreds of thousands of people to come out into the street and make
that a reality. But that’s a high concept. And on the evening news, you
can imagine you’d end up with a snippet of a scorched earth Sherman
burning Atlanta again.

michael barbaro

Right, it might get lost in translation. It might actually undermine the
very thing he’s trying to promote.

brent staples

Exactly. So basically, A. Philip Randolph, Martin Luther King, those
guys prevailed on him to make some changes in it. They were talking
about, let’s not do anything to just not give them a sound bite that’s
going to give us trouble. I can hear him saying it. I don’t have the
tape, but I can hear them saying to John, let’s not give them a sound
bite that’s going to give us trouble. You can say it’s a revolution. You
can call people on the street. You can even call them the Black masses,
if you want to, even though that sounds like communism, right? You could
say those things. But let’s leave off Sherman for next time. Right?
\[LAUGHS\] So Sherman goes out.

  - archived recording (john lewis)  
    We march today for jobs and freedom. But we have nothing to be proud
    of. For hundreds of thousands of our brothers are not here.

brent staples

He talks about marching.

  - archived recording (john lewis)  
    The time will come. We will not confine our marching to Washington.
    We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson —

brent staples

We will march through the street of Jackson, through the streets of
Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of
Birmingham.

  - archived recording (john lewis)  
    But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of
    dignity that we have shown here today. \[APPLAUSE\]
    
    By the forces of our demand, our determination and our numbers, we
    shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put
    them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say, Wake
    up, America\! Wake up\!” For we cannot stop, and we will not and
    cannot be patient. \[APPLAUSE\]

brent staples

So this is pretty much the same. But Sherman is missing.

michael barbaro

So in terms of thinking about the speech that John Lewis drafted versus
the one he delivered, on that historic day, you’re saying it’s not that
the earlier version of the speech shows John Lewis questioning the
nonviolent approach. It’s that he believed in the nonviolent approach,
but that the language he contemplated using — his belief that the power
of that approach could be as powerful as burning — that was determined
to be potentially counterproductive to the nonviolent approach he
believed in.

brent staples

Exactly. But he talks about going back to his hotel room after that
first conversation and just being livid because, of course, it’s a
23-year-old man’s speech. And a 23-year-old man who had been beaten to
an inch of his life while fighting for dignity for Black people. I’m
sure he felt entitled to say any damn thing he wanted to. Because he had
the credibility of the streets behind him and the people in the Douth
beginning to know who he was. And they were going to really know who he
was, come two years later at the voting rights march at Selma.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

Brent, tell me about that. I mean, let’s talk about what happens after
the March on Washington, after John Lewis’s rhetorical wings are ever so
slightly clipped, but he does deliver the essential message. How do we
see this concept of the power of nonviolence actually play out over the
next couple of years?

brent staples

The next big data point becomes the voting rights struggle in Selma,
Alabama. Now it’s important, I think, to dilate for just a second for
the modern listener.

The modern listener needs to understand that in voting arrangements in
the South, before the Voting Rights Act, local registrars had complete
authority to do whatever they wanted with people who came in to register
to vote. They could give you a test and then say you failed it so you
can’t register. And they did that all day long, all day, every day, to
Black people.

In Virginia, a college-educated woman, Black woman, who I believe was a
teacher, went into register at one point and filled the application. And
the registrar handed her a literacy test. You know what it consisted of?
A blank sheet of paper. He asked her, what does this say? And she looked
at it and handed it back, and she said nothing. He said, you’re wrong.
You fail. You can’t register.

Elsewhere in the South, they might ask you if you came in to register to
vote, how many bubbles are there in a bar of soap?

Elsewhere, a famous example in the film “Selma,” where a woman had come
in to register one year, and they asked her, how many judges are there
in the state of Alabama? And she didn’t know. They said, well, you fail.
And she came back the second year. And he said, how many county judges
are there in Alabama? And I think it was 67. And she said 67. And he
said now, before you register, you have to name them.

michael barbaro

Aw.

brent staples

So this was what life was like for Black people seeking to vote in the
South. Now John Lewis’s organization, the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, had already set up a voting rights project in
Selma and had been working on that. But it came to fruition in 1965,
where people had been fed up. And so they staged a march from Selma to
Montgomery to protest in favor of voting rights for Black people.

And then that fateful day, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were
walking. State troopers came out and said, this is unlawful.

  - archived recording  
    It would be detrimental to your safety to continue this march. And
    I’m saying that this is an unlawful assembly. You have to
    disperse. You are ordered to disperse. Go home, or go to your
    church. This march will not continue.

brent staples

You cannot march.

  - archived recording  
    Troopers, here, advance toward the gate.
    
    See that they disperse.

brent staples

And then John said to the sheriff. He said, can I have a word? Because
you know he’s in the front with his little off-white trenchcoat on. And
now there’s a thing about this trenchcoat, right? It’s very light, so
you can see him standing out from everyone else. And the other thing
about it is, once blood gets on it, you can really see it. So I’m sure
that that was premeditated. So he comes out front, and he says, can I
have a word? No, you can’t have a word. And the troopers begin to
advance. And they beat holy hell out of those people. They sent 58
people to the hospital.

John Lewis suffers a fractured skull. And by the time the film is flown
back to New York to be shown on the air — and it’s really one of those
films where you see these people running. You see tear gas and these
billy clubs just going up and down, just beating the shit out of people.
And because John was in front, you could see him holding his head where
he’d been hit. And it was on the ground.

  - archived recording  
    Can we have somebody take somebody to a doctor? \[CROWD CLAMORING\]

brent staples

That, in my opinion — I’m not the historian here — but in my opinion,
that was the ultimate triumph of the nonviolent approach and the
suffering approach as he was saying.

michael barbaro

Why triumphant?

brent staples

Well, it was triumphant because even people who had tried to look away
from what was happening in the South were forced to see the long arm of
the law persecuting people publicly. Not just perscute, trying to kill
them publicly. And also, the Voting Rights Act was pending at that time.
And after this happened, Lyndon Johnson addressed a joint session of
both Houses of Congress, I believe, and said —

  - archived recording (lyndon b. johnson)  
    It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln, the great
    president of another party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
    But emancipation is a proclamation, and not a fact. A century has
    passed, more than 100 years since equality was promised.

brent staples

We cannot delay any longer.

  - archived recording (lyndon b. johnson)  
    A century has passed since the day of promise. And the promise is
    unkept. The time of justice has now come.
    
    We shall overcome.

\[music\]

brent staples

So the Voting Rights Act was signed later that summer in August. It
didn’t take long. So when people come in to register to vote, you can
no longer ask them how many bubbles are in a bar of soap, or to name
every judge in the state. This is a big leap in our time.

michael barbaro

So quite literally, there’s a straight line between the scene of what
happened on that bridge, and something John Lewis knew would be so
powerful — the concept of nonviolent suffering — and the legislative
remedy back in Washington that resulted.

brent staples

Yes.

michael barbaro

Because the world had seen this happen.

brent staples

Right. Yeah, I think so. But also, you begin to see the sort of apex of
this message really is ‘65, ‘66. And at some point, then, John is
replaced in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee presidency by
Stokely Carmichael, a fiery orator and one of the primary enunciaters of
the Black Power movement, that was more consistent with the emerging
radicalism of the time.

michael barbaro

And that was the movement that you felt a part of.

brent staples

Yes. That’s where we came into the story, you know?

michael barbaro

Brent, on some level, you and your cohort must have thought that this
approach, the John Lewis approach, had limitations. Given that by the
time you were a teenager, or maybe even entering your early 20s, there
was this new philosophy taking hold of a more elbows out, less
restrained approach. So how do you think about that?

brent staples

Well, it’s interesting. And I do think about it. What had happened,
really, is every generation, until it educates itself, thinks its
experience is unique. So we thought we were unique. My cousins and I,
and we had our big meetings, and we had our press conferences. And we
had a different rhetorical stance.

But in the end, the tools were exactly the same. The tools were the
sit-in of the administration building. The tool was the sit-in in the
street that ran through campus. The tool was the building takeover.
These were the same tools, man. I mean, I had bigger hair, right? Right?
And I’ll send you a picture. I’ll have \[INAUDIBLE\].

michael barbaro

Please do.

brent staples

I have good hair, though. But if you look back on it, the tools were the
same.

michael barbaro

And it was a foundation that had already been built, even if you didn’t
see it that way at the time.

brent staples

And even if you didn’t know it. You know what I’m saying? Even if you
didn’t know. I keep going back to this point earlier in this story, when
they were doing the Freedom Rides in 1961. They had a big Chinese dinner
in Washington, that people were going off on these Freedom Rides. And a
lot of people wrote their wills, because they thought that they’d be
killed — there’s a chance they’d be killed and never come back. And they
referred to the meal at the Chinese restaurant as “the last supper.”

So these people were willing to put their lives on the line, were
willing to accept the possibility that they would be killed in the
pursuit of justice, and that their dead bodies laying out in public
would be part of a sacrifice that would advance the cause of justice.
That’s profound. No?

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. So with all that in mind, Brent, how are you thinking about John
Lewis’s legacy at this moment, as we talk in the middle of yet another
critical moment in this movement, and when the work is still understood
to be very unfinished.

brent staples

You know, John Lewis, in the waning days of his life, was heartened and
overjoyed to see the global protests that unfolded after the killing of
Mr. Floyd. He talked about it as part of the extension of his work. And
one of the things he said, he essentially — I’m paraphrasing — he said,
the thing’s out of the box now. He said, there’s no going back from
this.

michael barbaro

Hm. And what about the principles of his life? How are you thinking
about those in this moment?

brent staples

Well, I think that, as you see, his point of view was borne out.

brent staples

The other day, The New York Times had a story in which it had 64
examples, video examples of police brutalizing peaceful demonstrators.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm, I saw it.

brent staples

Right? Now, what is that?

What that is, is what John was talking about. He was talking about this
kind of injustice perpetrated on people who did not deserve it, did not
warrant that kind of treatment. And also, we’ve been seeing in this
unfolding of the Floyd protests in — it’s a repeated theme in the news
stories — white suburbanites, middle class white people, who supported
the police unquestioningly, right? They have changed their minds.

michael barbaro

Hm.

  - archived recording  
    \[CROWD CLAMORING\]

brent staples

The real persuasive thing is seeing people walking around in the street
with signs, unarmed, not doing anything untoward, and be brutalized.
That turns out to be the most persuasive thing for the society and for
the people to whom it has happening.

michael barbaro

Hm. In other words, we are again seeing this idea of the beloved
community playing out, the Gandhian philosophy, this biblical approach
that you described.

brent staples

Yes.

michael barbaro

It’s working. It’s painfully working again.

brent staples

Yes, it’s painful. Lord knows it is. It’s painful. But abuse of the
people in public — people’s constitutional rights — through violence by
police organizations, has broad, rippling consequences. It’s having
broad, rippling consequences. It’s beyond the people who you beat up who
now don’t have confidence in the police. And John saw all that.

  - archived recording  
    \[CROWD CLAMORING\]

michael barbaro

Brent, is there anything from Lewis’s memoir that you haven’t already
shared that you want to leave us with?

brent staples

Well, I don’t know if it fits. But perhaps we should just put that aside
and read from one of John Lewis’s favorite poems. It’s “Invictus” by
William Ernest Henley:

“Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole, I
thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch
of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the
bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody but unbowed. Beyond this place
of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade. And yet the menace
of the years finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how
straight the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll. I am the
master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.”

michael barbaro

Brent, thank you very much. We really appreciate your time today.

brent staples

Well, good to be with you.

\[music\]

  - archived recording  
    Boy, Congressman Lewis joins us now for his first network TV
    interview since the protests over the death of George Floyd began.
    Congressman John Lewis, it’s so good to see you. I can’t tell you,
    you are such a sight for sore eyes today. It’s really good to see
    you. What would you tell, Congressman, young people, and people,
    quite frankly, who are not so young, about the best way to seek
    justice? You know, there’s been a lot of controversy, a lot of talk
    about the looting. And we should stress that most of the protests
    were very peaceful. But there was some looting. There was some
    disruption. What would you say to people about the best way to
    achieve justice?

  - archived recording (john lewis)  
    It was very moving. It was very moving to see hundreds and thousands
    of people from all over America and around the world taking to the
    streets, to the roadways, to stand up, to speak up, to speak out, to
    do what I call “getting in trouble.”
    
    During the ‘60s, the great majority of us accepted the way of peace,
    the way of love, the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence as a
    way of life, as a way of living. There’s something cleansing,
    something wholesome, about being peaceful and orderly, to stand up
    and with a sense of dignity, and a sense of pride, and never hate.
    
    Dr. King said over and over again, “Hate is too heavy a burden to
    bear.” The way of love is the much better way. And that’s what we
    did. We were arrested. Yes, I was beaten, left bloody and
    unconscious. But I never became bitter or hostile, never gave up. I
    believed that somehow and some way, if it becomes necessary to use
    our bodies to have redeem the soul of a nation, then we must do it.
    Create a society at peace with yourself.

  - Mr. Lewis, a son of sharecroppers and an apostle of nonviolence who
    was bloodied at Selma, Ala., and across the Jim Crow South in the
    historic struggle for racial equality, and who then carried a mantle
    of moral authority into Congress, [died on
    Friday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html).
    He was 80.

  - Bipartisan [praise poured in for the civil rights
    leader](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/politics/john-lewis-dies-reaction.html),
    as friends, colleagues and admirers reached for the appropriate
    superlatives to sum up an extraordinary life.

  - Mr. Lewis risked his life for justice, [The Times’s editorial board
