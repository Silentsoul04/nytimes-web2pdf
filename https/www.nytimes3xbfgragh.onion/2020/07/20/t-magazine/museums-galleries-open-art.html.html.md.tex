\section{In a Time of Crisis, Is Art
Essential?}\label{in-a-time-of-crisis-is-art-essential}}

T's 2020 summer art issue coincides with a breakdown of the status quo,
both in the art world and the real one. Not for nothing, we've titled it
``True Believers.''

For the last two summers, T has published an
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/issue/t-magazine/2018/06/08/ts-art-issue}{online
art issue} in which we celebrate artistic freedom in the face of
overwhelming odds. Traditionally, these odds have revolved around an
international supply chain largely fueled by greed: The small but
powerful ecosystem that we refer to as ``the art world'' has always
exploited artists to protect its profit margins.

It goes without saying that this year, the stakes are different. This
has been a summer of a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus}{global
pandemic}, of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/nyregion/rent-strike-coronavirus.html}{rent
strikes} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/teens-protest-black-lives-matter.html}{protests}
against
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles}{state-sanctioned
murder and inequality}, of autocratic
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/us/politics/esper-milley-trump-protest.html}{threats
of violence} from elected officials. All of us have been made to witness
and reckon with the failure of our established systems of power.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/issue/t-magazine/2020/07/02/true-believers-art-issue}{\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/06/29/tmag-art-embeds-new/assets/images/art_issue_gif_special_editon.gif}}

In the coming months, museums and galleries will try to find ways of
safely keeping their doors open to the public, but as this process
begins, I can't help but think of the footage of European soccer teams
playing in empty arenas to a backing track of audience applause: It
\emph{looks} familiar, but something is off. The old way of life isn't
so distant, but it no longer suits our current reality. Up until March,
when the pandemic shut down much of the world, I had a certain monthly
ritual that I valued a great deal but never thought much about because I
took for granted that I would always be able to do it: On some weekday
afternoon, when I would look across the street from my desk in the Times
building to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and feel particularly
hopeless about my ability to finish whatever work I had to finish that
day, I'd take an hour or so to walk around the galleries in Chelsea, or
hop on the E train to the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/museum-of-modern-art}{Museum
of Modern Art} to see how fast I could get through a show amid the
throng of tourists. Doing this would reset my mood like a clock. It was
so easy to be reminded how lucky I was to live in a place where great
art was constantly available to me, and to have a profession in which my
job was mainly to look at it. A lot worse has been lost in the past few
months than this ritual, but I wasn't aware how much I missed it until I
wrote down its memory. Even having a desk in an office now feels foreign
to me.

But as the foundations of our very existence have gone awry, the basic
premise of T's art issue still stands. Which is to say: Artists have
kept working, even through the days when it feels like the world might
end, or days when it feels as if it already has. I can't say this is as
much a surprise as it is an affirmation of the notion that art is
essential, if you'll allow me the use of a word that has taken on a
greater meaning as of late. We've called this issue
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/issue/t-magazine/2020/07/02/true-believers-art-issue}{True
Believers},'' our initial reasoning being that a number of the pieces
we're publishing this week are about artists who have undertaken nearly
impossible tasks and persisted, through sheer willpower --- from
resurrecting the dead (in the case of the French sculptor Marguerite
Humeau) to trying to map out nothing less than space and time themselves
(in the way of the land artist Charles Ross, who has spent nearly 50
years constructing a naked-eye observatory in the New Mexico desert).

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

    Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without
    symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more
    than 200 other experts, who

But in retrospect, ``True Believers'' feels less to me like a theme than
a modus operandi: All art is an act of faith --- a faith that life
itself, with all its tragedies and flaws, can be improved by creating
something new and putting it out into the world. I'm not sure we'll ever
go back to what life was just a few months ago, but I do have faith that
artists will remain a crucial part of whatever new one we come up with.
