Felony charges have been filed against a St. Louis couple who pointed
guns at protesters marching past their home last month in an episode
that was [captured on
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dOLB1K2Zio) and drew the
attention of a divided nation, including President Trump.

The couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, were charged on Monday by the
Circuit Attorney’s Office in St. Louis with unlawful use of a weapon,
for exhibiting a semiautomatic rifle “in an angry or threatening
manner,” according to the complaint. The charge is a Class E felony
that carries a possible penalty of up to four years in prison.

The circuit attorney in St. Louis, [Kimberly M.
Gardner](http://www.circuitattorney.org/OfficeOverview.aspx), said the
couple created a dangerous situation involving “peaceful, unarmed
protesters.”

“It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those
participating in nonviolent protest,” she said in a statement.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Gardner, a Democrat, said she would not seek jail time for the
couple were they to be convicted, but rather would seek to place them in
a diversion program, like community service.

Late Monday night, the attorney general of Missouri, Eric Schmitt, a
Republican, filed a motion to have the charges against the McCloskeys
dismissed, [saying in a
statement](https://ago.mo.gov/home/news/2020/07/20/attorney-general-schmitt-files-brief-defending-missourians-second-amendment-rights)
that state law “provides broad rights to Missourians who are protecting
their property and lives from those who wish to do them harm.”

In a statement, the couple’s lawyer, Joel J. Schwartz, called the
charges “disheartening.” He said that his clients, who are personal
injury lawyers, support freedom of speech.

“However,” he added that it “must be balanced with the Second Amendment
and Missouri law, which entitle each of us to protect our home and
family from potential threats.”

The governor of Missouri, Mike Parson, a Republican, has come to the
couple’s defense, saying in[a radio
interview](https://www.kmov.com/news/gov-parson-says-pardon-likely-if-st-louis-couple-charged/article_5ecedf8a-236e-50dd-a83c-a012a0b4079b.html)
that he would most likely pardon them and that “I don’t think they’re
going to spend any time in jail.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The couple [recently appeared at a virtual campaign
event](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-patricia-mccloskey-guns-kimberly-guilfoyle-interview-trump-camapign/)
for Mr. Trump, who said last week that [prosecution of the couple was “a
disgrace.”](https://youtu.be/70Jzf0NhBv8?t=21)

Asked about Mr. Parson’s comment about a possible pardon for the couple
if they are convicted, Ms. Gardner said, “Right now, it’s still an open
case so there’s been no disposition to pardon.”

“I think that’s a waste of taxpayer dollars to look at this issue when
there has not been a final disposition,” she added.

[Senator Josh Hawley of
Missouri](https://twitter.com/SenHawleyPress/status/1283797174342623232),
a Republican, called for a civil rights investigation into Ms. Gardner
last week, contending that the pending case “is a politically motivated
attempt to punish this family for exercising their Second Amendment
rights.”

The Circuit Attorney’s Office responded to Mr. Hawley’s call on Twitter,
saying that it was baseless and that Ms. Gardner would not be bullied by
a United States senator or anyone else.

Ms. Gardner said on Monday that the call for a Justice Department
inquiry was a “failed distraction” by leadership, from the White House
down to the governor, from the coronavirus pandemic.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, who previously said it was
reviewing the senator’s request, did not immediately return a call
Monday night seeking comment.

On June 28, protesters marched past the McCloskeys’ home, which is on a
private street, on their way to the home of Mayor Lyda Krewson, a
Democrat, who lives nearby. Ms. Krewson had angered local residents
after she read the names and addresses of people who said the police
should be defunded on Facebook Live.

As demonstrators passed the house, Mr. McCloskey, 63, held a
semiautomatic rifle and Ms. McCloskey, 61, held a semiautomatic handgun,
according to the complaint and probable cause statement from the
prosecutor’s office.

Both pointed their weapons at the protesters, the prosecutor’s office
said. Ms. McCloskey’s finger was “on the trigger” and she acted with an
“excited demeanor,” the office noted.

Mr. McCloskey has said he and his wife feared for their lives.

[Mr. McCloskey said in an interview last
month](https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/interview-man-with-rifle-during-st-louis-protest/63-eeb61c07-4adc-4df0-a7d0-000d40a89e78)
with KSDK, a local television station, “I really thought it was storming
the Bastille, that we would be dead and the house would be burned and
there was nothing we could do about it.”

He continued: “It was a big crowd and they were aggressive, wearing body
armor and screaming at us and threatening to harm us. And how they were
going to be living in our house after they kill us.”

In the interview, Mr. McCloskey said he supported the Black Lives Matter
movement.

The McCloskeys have a long history of conflict with others over private
property, [according to The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/portland-place-couple-who-confronted-protesters-have-a-long-history-of-not-backing-down/article_281d9989-373e-53c3-abcb-ecd0225dd287.html),
which reviewed public records for a report on the couple last week.
