``It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner,'' a prosecutor
in the city said.

Felony charges have been filed against a St. Louis couple who pointed
guns at protesters marching past their home last month in an episode
that was \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dOLB1K2Zio}{captured on
video} and drew the attention of a divided nation, including President
Trump.

The couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, were charged on Monday by the
Circuit Attorney's Office in St. Louis with unlawful use of a weapon,
for exhibiting a semiautomatic rifle ``in an angry or threatening
manner,'' according to the complaint. The charge is a Class E felony
that carries a possible penalty of up to four years in prison.

The circuit attorney in St. Louis,
\href{http://www.circuitattorney.org/OfficeOverview.aspx}{Kimberly M.
Gardner}, said the couple created a dangerous situation involving
``peaceful, unarmed protesters.''

``It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those
participating in nonviolent protest,'' she said in a statement.

Ms. Gardner, a Democrat, said she would not seek jail time for the
couple were they to be convicted, but rather would seek to place them in
a diversion program, like community service.

Late Monday night, the attorney general of Missouri, Eric Schmitt, a
Republican, filed a motion to have the charges against the McCloskeys
dismissed,
\href{https://ago.mo.gov/home/news/2020/07/20/attorney-general-schmitt-files-brief-defending-missourians-second-amendment-rights}{saying
in a statement} that state law ``provides broad rights to Missourians
who are protecting their property and lives from those who wish to do
them harm.''

In a statement, the couple's lawyer, Joel J. Schwartz, called the
charges ``disheartening.'' He said that his clients, who are personal
injury lawyers, support freedom of speech.

``However,'' he added that it ``must be balanced with the Second
Amendment and Missouri law, which entitle each of us to protect our home
and family from potential threats.''

The governor of Missouri, Mike Parson, a Republican, has come to the
couple's defense, saying
in\href{https://www.kmov.com/news/gov-parson-says-pardon-likely-if-st-louis-couple-charged/article_5ecedf8a-236e-50dd-a83c-a012a0b4079b.html}{a
radio interview} that he would most likely pardon them and that ``I
don't think they're going to spend any time in jail.''

The couple
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-patricia-mccloskey-guns-kimberly-guilfoyle-interview-trump-camapign/}{recently
appeared at a virtual campaign event} for Mr. Trump, who said last week
that \href{https://youtu.be/70Jzf0NhBv8?t=21}{prosecution of the couple
was ``a disgrace.''}

Asked about Mr. Parson's comment about a possible pardon for the couple
if they are convicted, Ms. Gardner said, ``Right now, it's still an open
case so there's been no disposition to pardon.''

``I think that's a waste of taxpayer dollars to look at this issue when
there has not been a final disposition,'' she added.

\href{https://twitter.com/SenHawleyPress/status/1283797174342623232}{Senator
Josh Hawley of Missouri}, a Republican, called for a civil rights
investigation into Ms. Gardner last week, contending that the pending
case ``is a politically motivated attempt to punish this family for
exercising their Second Amendment rights.''

The Circuit Attorney's Office responded to Mr. Hawley's call on Twitter,
saying that it was baseless and that Ms. Gardner would not be bullied by
a United States senator or anyone else.

Ms. Gardner said on Monday that the call for a Justice Department
inquiry was a ``failed distraction'' by leadership, from the White House
down to the governor, from the coronavirus pandemic.

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, who previously said it was
reviewing the senator's request, did not immediately return a call
Monday night seeking comment.

On June 28, protesters marched past the McCloskeys' home, which is on a
private street, on their way to the home of Mayor Lyda Krewson, a
Democrat, who lives nearby. Ms. Krewson had angered local residents
after she read the names and addresses of people who said the police
should be defunded on Facebook Live.

As demonstrators passed the house, Mr. McCloskey, 63, held a
semiautomatic rifle and Ms. McCloskey, 61, held a semiautomatic handgun,
according to the complaint and probable cause statement from the
prosecutor's office.

Both pointed their weapons at the protesters, the prosecutor's office
said. Ms. McCloskey's finger was ``on the trigger'' and she acted with
an ``excited demeanor,'' the office noted.

Mr. McCloskey has said he and his wife feared for their lives.

McCloskey said in an interview last month} with KSDK, a local television
station, ``I really thought it was storming the Bastille, that we would
be dead and the house would be burned and there was nothing we could do
about it.''

He continued: ``It was a big crowd and they were aggressive, wearing
body armor and screaming at us and threatening to harm us. And how they
were going to be living in our house after they kill us.''

In the interview, Mr. McCloskey said he supported the Black Lives Matter
movement.

The McCloskeys have a long history of conflict with others over private
property,

to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch}, which reviewed public records for a
report on the couple last week.
