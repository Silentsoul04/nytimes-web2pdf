# Trump Threatens to Send Federal Law Enforcement Forces to More Cities

As federal agents patrol Portland and head to Chicago, Democrats call

WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to deploy [federal law
enforcement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/nyregion/nypd-protester-van.html)
to Chicago and threatened on Monday to send agents to other major cities
— all controlled by Democrats.

Governors and other officials reacted angrily to the president’s move,
calling it an election-year ploy as they squared off over crime, civil
liberties and local control that has spread from
[Portland](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/us/portland-protests-navy-christopher-david.html),
Ore., across the country.

With camouflage-clad agents already [sweeping through the streets of
Portland](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/portland-protests.html),
more units were poised to head to Chicago, and Mr. Trump suggested that
he would follow suit in New York, Philadelphia, Detroit and other urban
centers. Governors and other officials compared his actions to
authoritarianism and vowed to pursue legislation or lawsuits to stop
him.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president cast the confrontation in overtly political terms as he
seeks an issue that would gain traction with voters at a time when many
of his own supporters have soured on his leadership amid a deadly
pandemic and economic collapse. Trailing badly in the polls with just
over 100 days until the election in November, Mr. Trump assailed the
“liberal Democrats” running American cities and tied the issue to his
presumptive fall opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“I’m going to do something — that, I can tell you,” Mr. Trump told
reporters in the Oval Office. “Because we’re not going to let New York
and Chicago and Philadelphia and Detroit and Baltimore and all of these
— Oakland is a mess. We’re not going to let this happen in our
country. All run by liberal Democrats.”

The president portrayed the nation’s cities as out of control. “Look at
what’s going on — all run by Democrats, all run by very liberal
Democrats. All run, really, by radical left,” Mr. Trump said. He added:
“If Biden got in, that would be true for the country. The whole
country would go to hell. And we’re not going to let it go to hell.”

Democrats said the president was the one out of control. Senator Jeff
Merkley of Oregon said he would introduce legislation to limit the role
of federal agents in cities like Portland. “This isn’t just an Oregon
crisis,” he said. “It’s an American crisis. We need to stop Trump before
this spreads.”

He added, “We won’t let these authoritarian tactics stand.”

Federal agents in Portland have snatched protesters off the streets and
thrown them into unmarked vehicles without explaining why they were
being detained or arrested, according to some of those who have been
seized. Oregon’s governor, Kate Brown, has called it “a blatant abuse of
power,” and the city’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, has called it “an attack on
our democracy.” The state attorney general has filed a lawsuit seeking a
restraining order against the federal agents for what she called
unlawful tactics.

Few are denying the city has a violent crime problem. Sixty-three people
were shot in Chicago over the past weekend, 12 of them fatally. The
White House referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security,
which declined to comment, as did the Justice Department.

The Department of Homeland Security has put about 2,000 officials from
Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the
Transportation Security Administration and the Coast Guard on standby to
be quickly deployed to cities. At least 200 members of “rapid deployment
teams” were sent to Washington, D.C., Portland, Pennsylvania and
Seattle, the agency said this month. Many tactical agents from those
teams from Customs and Border Protection and ICE are now in Portland.

Some cities have seen increased levels of crime since the protests over
[George Floyd’s death while in police
custody](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html)
in Minneapolis, but no president in modern times has threatened to send
in federal law enforcement over local opposition.

In contrast to the president’s claims, many major cities [remain safer
than they were decades ago, despite the recent
uptick](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/tables/table-1)
in crime. Some protesters, including in Portland, have targeted federal
property and officers with rocks and fireworks, and some protests weeks
ago resulted in damage to businesses and looting. But most of the
demonstrations throughout the United States have largely been peaceful.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago made clear on Monday that the federal
agents would be no more welcome in her city than they have been in
Portland. “We don’t need federal agents without any insignia taking
people off the street and holding them, I think, unlawfully,” she said
at a morning news conference before reports of the deployment were
confirmed. “That’s not what we need.”

In a four-page letter to Mr. Trump sent later in the day and obtained by
The New York Times, Ms. Lightfoot said if the president really wanted to
help Chicago, he should enact gun control, do more to curb the
coronavirus and invest in community programs.

“Any other form of militarized assistance within our borders that would
not be within our control or within the direct command of the Chicago
Police Department would spell disaster,” she wrote.

Trump administration officials said the deployment to Chicago was
separate from the operation in Portland, which ostensibly was to protect
the federal courthouse there.

But the Homeland Security Investigations agents have broad authority to
enforce federal laws in cities, and the Trump administration deployed
them this year to so-called sanctuary cities in an enhanced arrest
campaign against undocumented immigrants. The administration has also
previously deployed federal officials to combat crime in Chicago,
[including agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/30/us/chicago-guns-violence-atf-police.html).

The Department of Homeland Security asserted that it was acting within
the law, pointing to 40 U.S. Code 1315. Chad F. Wolf, the department’s
acting secretary, can deputize officers in any department agency, like
ICE, Customs and Border Protection or the Secret Service, “as officers
and agents for duty in connection with the protection of property owned
or occupied by the federal government and persons on the property,”
according to the law.

But the federal agents would not be limited to guarding federal
property. Under the law, the agents could also conduct investigations of
crimes committed against a federal property or federal officer
throughout the city, Department of Homeland Security officials have
said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Carrie Cordero, a senior fellow for the Center for a New American
Security, said that the federal statute did provide flexibility to tap
members of various agencies to assist in guarding federal property, but
that it was never intended to send border agents trained to investigate
a drug cartel to crack down on protesters in the streets.

“What’s happening is the administration is using D.H.S. to perform
basically a federal policing function, which in my view is
unconstitutional and is certainly not what Congress intended when it
created the department,” she said.

Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at
Austin, said it was not clear how federal agents could occupy the
streets of a city that is 99 percent not federal property. “It’s of
course the prerogative of the federal government to enforce federal law
and protect federal property,” Mr. Vladeck said. “It is not the job of
the federal government to be a general police force for all crimes.”

Governors, mayors and other officials from the cities that Mr. Trump
named on Monday quickly rejected the uninvited intervention of federal
agents.

“It is deeply disturbing that President Trump is once again choosing to
spread hateful rhetoric and attempting to suppress the voices of those
he doesn’t agree with,” said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.

John Roach, a spokesman for Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, said the city
had not suffered through the problems that others have after Mr. Floyd’s
death. “Detroit is one of the few large cities in the country that has
experienced no fires, no stores looted and never requested the National
Guard during the protests,” he said. “Not sure where the president is
getting his information.”

Asked on Monday about whether he had heard the president’s mention of
Oakland, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California — not known for his brevity —
responded curtly: “No, and we’d reject it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Philadelphia, the district attorney likened the clash to the fight
against fascism in World War II and threatened to criminally charge
federal agents sent to his city if they exceeded their authority.
“Anyone, including federal law enforcement, who unlawfully assaults
and kidnaps people will face criminal charges from my office,” [said the
district attorney, Larry
Krasner](https://twitter.com/AlexSilverman/status/1285309263347429376).
“At trial, they will face a Philadelphia jury.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Wolf dismissed the complaints, making clear that he had no intention
to pull back regardless of the objections. “I don’t need invitations by
the state, state mayors, or state governors to do our job,” Mr. Wolf
said on Fox News. “We’re going to do that, whether they like us there or
not.”

The dispatch of federal agents to cities has become a new front for a
president seeking to regain political momentum heading into a fall
campaign season. Eager to recast protests against racial injustice after
the George Floyd killing into an us-versus-them battle for law and
order, Mr. Trump in recent days has repeatedly blamed Democrats for
countenancing violence and failing to stand up to crime.

Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said federal
agents had “done a fantastic job” in Portland, which was “totally out of
control,” and he assailed the governor and other officials there for not
welcoming the help. “These are anarchists,” he said. “And the
politicians out there, yes, they’re weak, but they’re afraid of these
people. They’re actually afraid of these people. And that’s why they
say, ‘We don’t want the federal government helping.’”

He said other cities were in similar need of federal intervention,
naming some of the nation’s largest urban centers. “How about Chicago?”
he said on Monday. “I read the numbers where many people killed over the
weekend. We’re looking at Chicago, too. We’re looking at New York.”

The policy closely mirrored the politics. At the same time the president
was weighing the use of federal power, his campaign [posted an

“You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America,” the ad said.
