# After Dismissing Coronavirus Surge, Trump Wants to Talk About the Virus Again

The president said he would resume the pandemic briefings that he called
off in April, a tacit acknowledgment that the public health crisis he
had hoped to put behind him was still ravaging much of the country.

WASHINGTON — By the time he canceled the show midseason, even [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/politics/trump-florida-convention.html)
had grown weary of his televised [coronavirus
briefings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/arts/television/trump-briefings.html).
Angry at the reviews, he declared the briefings “[not worth the time &
effort,”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1254168730898173953)
a conclusion shared by his own advisers and allies who had come to see
them as hurting more than helping.

But while the freewheeling sessions with their cascades of
misinformation and petty outbursts [had become
self-destructive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-press-briefing.html),
nothing else has taken their place as a way for Mr. Trump to get his
message out given his lack of success reviving his favorite campaign
rallies. And so, the president said on Monday that he was bringing back
the virus briefings nearly two months after calling them off.

The decision to resume the briefings amounts to a tacit acknowledgment
that the public health crisis that Mr. Trump has sought to put behind
him is still ravaging much of the country as he heads toward a fall
election season trailing badly in the polls. [With new infections,
hospitalizations and now deaths on the
rise](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
especially in the South and West, it has become increasingly difficult
for the president to simply shrug off the outbreaks as mere “embers”
that can be easily smothered.

Even so, as he opted to focus renewed presidential time to discussing
the pandemic with the public again amid [concern from
Republicans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/19/us/politics/republicans-contradict-trump-coronavirus.html)
that he was not taking it seriously enough, Mr. Trump, a former reality
television star, attributed the move not to the increasing threat of the
virus but to the fact that the briefings had garnered high television
ratings.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I was doing them and we had a lot of people watching, record numbers
watching in the history of cable television. There’s never been anything
like it,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “It’s a great way
to get information out to the public as to where we are with the
vaccines, with the
therapeutics.”

He was right about the ratings — his briefings were attracting an
[average audience around 8.5
million](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/business/media/trump-coronavirus-briefings-ratings.html),
or roughly the equivalent of the season finale of “The Bachelor” — and
he said he would probably start again on Tuesday at 5 p.m., the same
hour as before because it would attract viewers. “We had a good slot,”
he said.

The briefings could in effect serve as a substitute for the campaign
rallies that Mr. Trump tried to restart. His first attempt fizzled when
he [filled only a third of an arena in Tulsa,
Okla.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html),
and his second — set for Portsmouth, N.H. — [was scrubbed amid
concerns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-nh-rally-postponed.html)
that it too would not draw many people, although the campaign cited the
weather as the proximate reason for canceling. That one was never
rescheduled, even though the campaign said it would be, nor have any
other rallies been announced.

Mr. Trump’s aides have grown increasingly uncertain about how to
communicate his message on the spread of the virus against the reality
of a president who has shown almost no ability to stay focused during
the course of scheduled events. For weeks, some Trump advisers have said
the White House needs to do more to brief the public on the rise in
hospitalizations and deaths.

But the idea of resuming the briefings became another dispute in the
eternal turf wars within the Trump team. Two of his closest advisers,
Jared Kushner and Hope Hicks, had been fine with the administration
conducting virus briefings so long as they were not at the White House
complex where Mr. Trump might want to join them. Mark Meadows, the White
House chief of staff, has preferred not drawing attention to the virus
at all.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, publicly said that the
president’s poll numbers were better when he was doing the briefings and
that she hoped he would again. Vice President Mike Pence’s team has also
wanted him to do more, but the president’s communications aides bristled
at the vice president appearing at them when they thought Mr. Trump
should be leading the effort. By the end of last week, Mr. Kushner and
Ms. Hicks were rethinking their concerns, according to people familiar
with the discussions.

“The pandemic is the No. 1 topic of conversation around family dinner
tables and Zoom conversations, so the president is smart to ensure his
message is getting into those discussions,” said Cliff Sims, a former
White House media aide under Mr. Trump. “If we learned anything during
the 2016 campaign and in the White House, it’s that he’s always his own
best messenger and our ability to shape the debate is always bolstered
by having him out front.”

But Democrats scoffed at the notion that the president would handle the
briefings any better this time around. “It’s pretty clear that the
resumption of briefings is more about Trump feeding his own ego, in an
absence of other forums, and sharing his own distorted version of
history directly with his base than it is about sharing fact-based
updates with the American public,” said Jen Psaki, a White House
communications director under President Barack Obama.

The original coronavirus briefings from March to April were
made-for-television events, with scientific information provided by
public health experts often overshadowed by a confrontational president
castigating governors, lawmakers, China, reporters and others he deemed
insufficiently grateful to him for his leadership. He used them to
defend his administration’s response to the virus and to promote a pet
drug as a possible treatment over the advice of his own experts.

Mr. Trump eventually [quit holding
them](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-briefings.html)
after he was widely mocked for suggesting that people might be able to
counter the virus by[ingesting or injecting disinfectants like
bleach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html),
an offhand comment that sent public health agencies scrambling to warn
the public not to try such an approach because it could be fatal.

But in recent weeks, the surge of cases has frustrated Mr. Trump’s
effort to play down the seriousness of the continuing pandemic. The
United States now records more than twice as many cases each day as it
did during the height of the daily briefings, and the number of deaths,
which had fallen substantially, has begun to rise again as well.

White House officials have said in recent days both that the president
is [too busy to
attend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-defends-bungled-handling-of-coronavirus-with-falsehoods-and-dubious-claims/2020/07/19/1b57cb3e-c9e6-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html)
coronavirus task force meetings and that he is [“working around the
clock”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/19/us/politics/republicans-contradict-trump-coronavirus.html)
on the virus. But even as hospitals fill up and governors reverse
decisions to reopen, Mr. Trump has continued to insist that the virus
would simply vanish on its own.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In his comments on Monday, he was a little less dismissive. “Frankly, a
lot of the country is doing well — a lot of the people don’t say it, as
you understand,” he said. “But we’ve have had this big flare-up in
Florida, Texas, a couple of other places. And so I think what we’re
going to do is I’ll get involved and we’ll start doing briefings.”

Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New
York.
