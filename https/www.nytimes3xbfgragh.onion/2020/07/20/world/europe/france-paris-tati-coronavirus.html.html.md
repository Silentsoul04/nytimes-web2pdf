The famed department store Tati is shutting. And a lot of people are

PARIS — Tati is a ghost of what it once was, and soon it won’t even be
that. Shelves that were crammed with dish-scrubbers and brassieres for
$1.50 and plaster figurines of smiling bunnies are now bare. Exits are
still numbered — how else to find your way out through the crowds — but
the aisles are empty. There are no crowds.

It’s as though the discount department store, a once-thronged wonder of
Paris more visited than the Eiffel Tower, is willing itself out of
existence, fading like a Cheshire cat’s smile back into the hinterlands
on both sides of the Mediterranean where many of its famous pink gingham
shopping bags ended up. The official end, in any case, is not far-off
for Tati, which revolutionized postwar shopping in France and stamped
its identity on the entire vibrant neighborhood of Barbès, on the edge
of Montmartre.

Tati is a victim of Covid-19, its latest owners say, and sharply
declining sales. But the trends that have killed it go back much
further.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The great bales of 50-cent stockings and dollar underwear that once
crowded the sidewalks in front of the store, on the Boulevard de
Rochechouart, are no longer enough. Bargain-basement shoppers have long
since had more socially enhancing options among the international
chains.

“Bring me your little thieves\!” Tati’s founder, Jules Ouaki, a Jewish
immigrant from Tunisia who had fought for the Free French in World War
II, used to tell the press, a sly nod to both his humble clientele and
the raffish immigrant district of Barbès that he transformed. Both made
him rich. His success was once studied in French business schools.

The vicissitudes of the Ouaki family — the bankruptcies, the failed
ventures into high fashion by Mr. Ouaki’s son, his rock bands, horses
and coauthorship of a book with the Dalai Lama — were covered over the
years by the French media like episodes of “Dallas.”

Now Tati, named by Jules Ouaki after his Tunisian mother, is losing
money fast. The last Tati store in France, the Barbès flagship, will be
gone by the end of the year. But despite its problems, it still fills a
niche and will be missed.

“Even people on the dole could shop here,” said Alger Djemila, clutching
the vaunted gingham as she emerged one day last week from the annex off
Boulevard de Rochechouart.

So infused is Barbès with the spirit of Tati ** that residents and the
few shoppers left have trouble imagining the neighborhood without it,
after over 70 years of fruitful coexistence.

“Without Tati, Barbès is dead,” proclaimed Nawel Bahiti, another
shopper. “When Tati closes, the whole neighborhood will shut down,”
insisted Bernard Le Huerou, a retiree who had ridden up on his bike.

These are exaggerations: This rambunctious mix of Algiers, Dakar and
Paris at the foot of tourist-dominated Montmartre is unkillable. But at
the very least the neighborhood over which Mr. Ouaki ruled for decades
“like a customary prince,” as L’Express ** put it in a 1980 profile,
will be changed, just as he himself changed
it.

Newsreels from the 1970s show him beaming over the jostling
elbow-to-elbow shoppers, few of them, at that time, immigrants. Now,
“the entire neighborhood will be disfigured,” said Odette Osmanovic, a
retiree who had come to commiserate at Tati’s doorstep last week with a
fellow Barbès resident.

“Thanks to the presence of Tati, Barbès itself, today, seems almost like
a brand name,” wrote Emmanuelle Lallement, a University of Paris
anthropologist who has closely studied the intimate relationship between
the two.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

She has focused on how much of what surrounds Tati — the Barbès culture
of street vendors hawking foodstuffs and clothing — appears as an
extension of the store, and inspired by it.

Even today the first thing you see off the metro, from the elevated
platform at Barbès-Rochechouart station, is the giant old “Tati, The
Lowest Prices” sign on top of its central seven-story Haussmann-style
building, a former cafe transformed by Mr. Ouaki.

The sign dominates the meek towers of Sacré-Coeur church in the near
distance, commerce taking precedence over the sacred.

After the war, shopping in France still inhabited a 19th-century world;
if you entered a store, you generally had to buy something. Often you
had to ring a bell to enter. It was an intimidating experience.

Mr. Ouaki democratized it, reinventing shopping for a postwar generation
of French eager to buy but limited in means. He put enormous bales of
discount clothing out on the sidewalks of Barbès. The customers were
free to rummage through them, feel the merchandise, not even enter the
store.

“He got rid of the door, and the window,” Ms. Lallement said.

On the boulevard, Tati ** extends nearly a full block, incorporating the
old bordellos and hotels that Mr. Ouaki gradually bought up, going from
the 150 square feet he started with in 1948, to over 9,000 square feet
of shopping space by the
1980s.

“He changed it from a nighttime to a daytime district,” said Ms.
Lallement, and for his efforts was awarded the Légion d’Honneur,
France’s highest civil distinction.

By the early 1980s, Tati was drawing 25 million customers a year and had
expanded all over France. Specially chartered buses would come up from
the provinces for day shopping
trips.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“We had half the population of France that shopped with us,” said Hubert
Assous, the former chief executive of Tati, now retired in Israel, who
married into the family. “It was complete madness, for sales. When we
opened in the provinces, we would be taken by storm.”

When the sons took over after Mr. Ouaki’s death from cancer in 1983,
“they didn’t adapt to the times,” Mr. Assous said. “Nothing was
anticipated. We were navigating from day to day.”

A succession of failed ventures and expansions — Russia, South Africa,
Fifth Avenue in New York, jewelry, a travel agency, high fashion —
failed to pan out.

“No longer cheap but chic,” Fabien Ouaki, Jules Ouaki’s son, insisted
was the new mantra for the store. It was a fatal miscalculation, and the
company was sold in receivership in 2004.

Subsequent owners failed to invest, said the workers’ union and Mr.
Assous. The company that owns the store now, the GPG Group, said sales
dropped 60 percent between October and May. “The store must close, for
good,” it said in a news release.

When the store closes, 34 people will lose their jobs, a union official
said.

For the remaining customers, it is one more unwelcome transformation at
a time when too many are afoot. There is a kind of disbelief.

“No, no,” said Sabrina Miloua, a customer toting the gingham. “This is
too good here. They sell stuff, you can afford it.”

“We bought all of our dishes here,” she said. “All the clothing for the
children.”

“Everything, everything,” her friend, Ms. Bahiti, said.
