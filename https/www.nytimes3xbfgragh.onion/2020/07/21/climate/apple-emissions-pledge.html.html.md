Apple said on Tuesday its devices would be carbon-neutral by 2030,

The titans of the tech industry like to think of themselves as solvers
of big world problems, and, lately, they’re tripping over themselves to
show that they are working to solve a problem for which they, too, are
culpable: climate change.

Apple on Tuesday became the latest tech giant to promise to do more to
reduce the emissions of planet-warming greenhouse
gases,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>announcing [in a
statement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/)
that, by 2030, “every Apple device sold will have net-zero climate
impact.”

Apple said it aimed to reduce emissions by 75 percent in its
manufacturing chain, including by recycling more of the components that
go into each device and nudging its suppliers to use renewable energy.
As for the remaining 25 percent of emissions, the company said it
planned to balance them by funding reforestation projects. The company
also said it planned to improve energy efficiency in its operations.

Forests absorb carbon dioxide, and reforestation has become a popular
way for companies to offset the greenhouse gas emissions that they
produce, including from factories.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Climate advocates describe these offset efforts as inadequate because
they allow emissions to grow at a time when the scientific consensus
demands that emissions be cut in half by 2030 in order to avoid the
worst effects of climate change — and be reduced to zero by 2050.

Separately on Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it would [require its
suppliers to report their
emissions](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/07/21/carbon-negative-transform-to-net-zero/),
as a first step toward making reductions.

Like other corporate pledges, both are entirely voluntary.

“It feels like there’s a virtuous follow-the-leader thing happening
here,” said Simon Nicholson, co-director for the Institute for Carbon
Removal Law and Policy at American
University.

He noted the limitations of the pledge, though. “What Apple has signaled
here is the beginning of a strategy on the carbon-removal side,” Dr.
Nicholson said. “Holding carbon in forests for a year or two isn’t going
to cut it. It needs to be held in forests for the long term, which means
centuries.”

Big Tech’s role in global warming varies from company to company.
Amazon, Facebook and Google all use enormous amounts of energy and water
for their data centers. Amazon relies on gas-guzzling trucks and
packages that themselves have a huge environmental footprint; even
recycling uses a lot of energy. And makers of devices — like Amazon,
Apple, Google and Microsoft — produce greenhouse gas emissions through
their supply chains, which involve contractors that do the actual
manufacturing in different parts of the world.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The pressure on companies to do something about their climate footprint
comes both from within the ranks of their employees and from advocacy
groups on the outside.

Not only are they under scrutiny for the emissions they produce.
Internet companies, like Facebook, have been criticized for allowing the
spread of disinformation about climate science. Greenpeace took aim at
Google, Microsoft and Amazon for using their artificial intelligence and
cloud computing services to help oil producers find and extract oil and
gas deposits, which [Greenpeace said is “significantly
undermining”](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/oil-in-the-cloud/)
the tech companies’ other climate commitments.

One by one, the giants of Silicon Valley have been compelled to address
their own role in the climate
crisis.

it would no longer build customized artificial intelligence technology
or machine learning algorithms for the oil and gas
sector.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>It has also pledged to
include recycled material in its devices, including its popular
Chromebook computers, by 2022.

[Amazon announced last September its bid to be

by 2040, while its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, committed $10 billion to
fund climate science and advocacy.

Amazon’s move came after sustained calls from its own employees to
reduce emissions to zero by 2030, a full 10 years earlier than the
company’s current target. Its employees also pressed Mr. Bezos to stop
offering custom cloud-computing services to the oil and gas industry and
to suspend campaign donations to politicians who deny climate science.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Amazon continues to do business with fossil fuel companies, but Mr.
Bezos said the company would take a “hard look” at its political
donations. Amazon said it would reduce
its<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>climate change impact by,
among other things, buying a fleet of 100,000 electric delivery trucks.
But, like Apple, Amazon’s pledge to be net-zero by 2040 relies on
reforestation projects to offset its continuing emissions. The company
has also said it plans to improve energy efficiency in its operations.

Microsoft this year said it would draw down more emissions than it adds
and also somehow [remove all the
emissions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/01/16/business/bc-us-microsoft-climate-pledge.html)
the company has ever produced. It promised to invest $1 billion in what
it called climate innovations, but it left untouched its partnerships
with oil and gas companies.

Facebook announced that it would use 100 percent renewable energy in its
facilities and reduce water use in its data centers, though it has said
little about what it will do to stop the spread of climate
disinformation on its platform.

Apple’s net-zero pledge is notable in that it seeks to address the main
source of its greenhouse gas emissions: from the manufacturing of its
phones, tablets and computers by its contractor companies.

Apple’s statement on Tuesday underscored the need for businesses like it
to pivot away from fossil fuels for the sake of its own bottom line. “We
have a generational opportunity,” said Lisa Jackson, a company vice
president responsible for environmental issue, “to help build a greener
and more just economy, one where we develop whole new industries in the
pursuit of giving the next generation a planet worth calling home.”

Elizabeth Jardim, who works on corporate issues at Greenpeace USA,
cautiously welcomed the pledge as a step up from the company’s previous
commitments, noting in an email that “as with all ‘carbon neutral’ or
‘carbon negative’ goals, it is critical to see detailed plans for how
the company will pursue deep decarbonization rather than a reliance on
offsetting or weak nature-based carbon removal initiatives.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Jardim also urged large, profitable companies to throw their weight
behind policies like the Green New Deal.

On Twitter, Edward Maibach, of the George Mason University Center for
Climate Change Communication, [called the Apple
pledge](https://twitter.com/MaibachEd/status/1285571592832131074) “a big
step in the right direction, if they make good on it. Next, they should
lobby governments worldwide to increase their commitments to the Paris
Climate Agreement.”
