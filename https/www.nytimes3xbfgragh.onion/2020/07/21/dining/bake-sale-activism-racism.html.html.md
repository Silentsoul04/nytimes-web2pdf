Like a lot of 13-year-olds, Daniella Senior loved to bake, and thought
she might become a pastry chef.

Unlike most of them, she already had six employees.

Ms. Senior started out on her own, collecting and filling orders for
miniature sweets while growing up in Santo Domingo, in the Dominican
Republic. “I was getting up at 4 a.m. every day before school to bake,”
she said. Her mother, who had lent her $200 in seed money, made her
bring on professional help.

As the coronavirus swept through the Northeast this spring, closing
thousands of restaurants, Ms. Senior, 31, went back to baking. With the
Washington pastry chef [Paola
Velez](https://www.instagram.com/smallorchids/?hl=en) (who also has
roots in the Dominican Republic), she repurposed her kitchens and
remaining employees as doughnut producers for a bake sale they called
[Doña Dona](https://www.instagram.com/donadonadc/).

They created doughnuts with Dominican flourishes of tamarind, pineapple,
guava and meringue, and sold them online, offering curbside pickups once
a week. In May, the effort raised $6,000, enough to pay the bakers and
donate a thousand dollars to [Ayuda](https://www.ayuda.com/), a national
nonprofit group that provides help to low-income immigrants.

But in June, when the [killing of George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html)and
the debate over racial justice seized the nation’s attention, Ms. Velez,
29, said she saw that the scale of a traditional bake sale was
inadequate to the cause. “It will make us feel good, but it won’t do
anything to make real change,” she said. “We had to go big.”

She went big. As of last week, [Bakers Against

It’s a given in the hospitality business that chefs show up for their
communities in big and small ways: feeding emergency medical workers,
cooking at charity benefits, donating dinners and sponsoring Little
League teams. Since Mr. Floyd’s death on May 25, as protests against
systemic racism arose across the country, many chefs have emptied their
walk-in refrigerators to feed protesters and medical workers, and formed
organizations like [No Us Without You](https://www.nouswithoutyou.la/),
a Los Angeles group dedicated to food security for undocumented
restaurant cooks.

But it is pastry chefs and bakers who have been leading the industry
into activism, transforming bake sales into blockbuster political
fund-raisers for a variety of causes. And in a part of the cooking world
long dominated at the top by white women (and white men before them),
the voices of Latinx, Black and Asian women are rising — and raising
real money for the fight against
racism.

[Southern Restaurants for Racial
Justice](https://www.instagram.com/srrj_coalition/?hl=en), a new group
started by three pastry chefs — [Lisa Marie
Donovan](https://www.instagram.com/lisamariedonovan/?hl=en) in
Nashville, [Sarah O’Brien](http://www.littletartatl.com/who-we-are/) in
Atlanta and [Cheryl Day](https://www.instagram.com/cherylday/?hl=en) in
Savannah, Ga. — raised $100,000 for [Color Of
Change](https://colorofchange.org/), a racial-justice advocacy group,
with a Father’s Day bake sale.

On June 19 — Juneteenth — more than 50 Los Angeles-area chefs and bakers
contributed to Pies For Justice, which raised $36,000 before selling out
just five minutes after going live online. And in a global online bake
sale the next day, more than 2,000 people contributed baked goods to
Bakers Against Racism, and raised $1.9 million in donations.

Why bakers and pastry chefs? Many of them say that in the restaurant
world, pastry is still dismissed as women’s work. Those who succeed —
especially if they are not white — are used to fighting to be heard; for
them, baking is a language of protest.

[Mallory Cayon](https://www.instagram.com/malkc/?hl=en), who helped
create the cult-favorite brunch recipes at [Sunday in
Brooklyn](https://www.sundayinbrooklyn.com/), in Williamsburg, has
remained head pastry chef as the [Sunday
Hospitality](https://www.sundayhg.com/) group grew to four restaurants:
two in Brooklyn and two in Los Angeles. She said that for the first time
since she entered the profession, she is in a workplace where the pastry
operation (mostly staffed by women) is on equal footing with the
“savory” side of the kitchen (mostly men).

“It starts in culinary school, because you look around and all the
bakers are girls,” said Ms. Cayon, 30, who said she was surprised at the
time that gender imbalance in the field remained so persistent, long
after most workplaces had become more inclusive. “The men who do it are
deemed less masculine.”

[Dianna Daohueng](https://www.instagram.com/dough_eung/?hl=en), the
culinary director at [Black Seed
Bagels](https://www.blackseedbagels.com/) in New York City, said that
working your way up in the restaurant business as a woman, as a person
of color or as a first-generation American — or, in her case, all three
— means confronting prejudice every day.

“Just being a minority in the kitchen and in life turns you into a
natural activist,” said Ms. Daohueng, 38, whose parents immigrated from
Thailand before she was born.

Ms. Day, of [Back in the Day
Bakery](https://backinthedaybakery.com/index.html#/) in Savannah, took a
different path to protest baking. She was raised in Los Angeles, but
spent summers in Tuscaloosa, Ala., learning to bake from her
grandmother. “That was my culinary school,” she said.

She also came to see how baking skills have defined Black women’s lives,
especially in the South. “My great-grandmother was both enslaved and a
pastry cook who was famous for her biscuits and cakes,” she said. “There
is power in that.” (Ms. Day, 59, has just completed a cookbook based on
her Southern lineage, to be published by Artisan next year.)

Bake sales for civil-rights causes have a long history among
African-Americans. But the current surge of public protest baking
started during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.

Social media posts about “stress baking” and “anger baking” turned up a
few years earlier. But [Tangerine
Jones](https://twitter.com/tangerinejones), a Black artist in Brooklyn,
began what she tagged “rage baking” in 2015 to channel her anger about
the overt racism she saw in the Trump campaign’s messaging. She gave her
baked goods away to friends and neighbors, and went on to use the term
to identify herself on Instagram and Twitter. (In February, an anthology
titled “Rage Baking,” edited by two white women who [did not
credit](https://medium.com/@tangerinejones/the-privilege-of-rage-e5b2cb53d238)
Ms. Jones, was [widely
criticized](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/21/dining/rage-baking-book-tangerine-jones.html)
for appropriating her idea and language.)

After the election, leading pastry chefs began to speak out. In 2017,
[Natasha Pickowicz](https://www.instagram.com/natashapickowicz/?hl=en)
organized a high-profile ticketed bake sale in New York, to raise money
for Planned Parenthood. It became an annual event, with sales rising
from $8,000 in 2017 to $100,000 in 2019. That same year, Los
Angeles-area chefs led by the baker [Zoe
Nathan](https://www.huckleberrycafe.com/our-story/) formed [Gather For
Good](https://www.andgatherforgood.com/new-page), holding frequent
outdoor bake sales to benefit the American Civil Liberties Union and
other free-speech advocates.

Last year’s marquee event was an all-cake sale for Planned Parenthood,
with ornate, outspoken creations decorated with female reproductive
organs, coat hangers and slogans like “Keep The Government Out of My
Vagina\!”

“The election made people brave enough to talk about immigration rights,
environmental rights and racial justice,” said Stephanie Chen of
[Sugarbear Bakes](http://www.sugarbearbakes.com/), who contributed a
“Mind Your Own Uterus” cake. (She is also a founder of Gather for
Good.)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Ms. Chen](https://www.instagram.com/sugarbearbakes/?hl=en), 36, was a
global advertising executive for the Apple iPhone before leaving the
technology industry to bake full time. From that marketing perspective,
she noted that bake sales — traditional, friendly, sugarcoated —
function not only as fund-raisers, but also as dialogue openers with
people who otherwise might not engage with the movement.

“It’s a way of bringing information that isn’t about protest or
violence,” she said.

The migration of bake sales to social media — especially Instagram,
where beauty shots of pastries and bread loaves draw enormous attention
— has transformed them into even more powerful
tools.

Pelini](https://www.instagram.com/badwolf_88/?hl=en), and the chef and
baker [Rob Rubba](https://www.instagram.com/robrubba/?hl=en), who is
also a graphic artist. (“Cute but disruptive” is how Ms. Velez described
the group’s visual identity.)

They tweaked the bake-sale model in a way that ultimately allowed it to
go viral — by not collecting any of the money that was raised.

The organizers created the name and hashtag, shared images and language
that bakers could use on social media in a Google Doc, and suggested
organizations to donate to, though each baker was allowed to decide
where to direct the funds. Individual bakers did the rest, connecting
with their local communities for orders and deliveries of everything
from brown-sugar [pan

to calamansi lime crinkle cookies (made in Chicago by the
Filipina-American baker [Camelia
Camara](https://www.instagram.com/cameliabakes/?hl=en)) to zucchini
bread (Mr. Rubba’s grandmother’s recipe).

“We didn’t want it to have to be slick and sponsored,” Mr. Rubba said.
“The bakers and the buyers are equal participants in this movement.”

More than 2,500 bakery owners, pastry chefs and home bakers
participated, including clusters that materialized in Berlin, Paris and
London and as far afield as Australia, Tanzania and Turkey.

“The bigger it got, the more afraid I was of taking this huge stand,”
said Ms. Velez, who noted that chefs — especially in Washington — are
often advised to stay out of politics to preserve a broad customer base.
“But the backlash never came.”

Though bake sales have been successful, the outlook for bakers is not
rosy.

“We are always the first department to get cut,” Ms. Pelini said.
Restaurant owners know that they can easily resort to serving ice cream
or cookie plates instead of labor-intensive desserts.

Almost every chef interviewed for this article had lost a job or closed
a bakery, at least temporarily, during the pandemic. The kitchen
assistants who worked for them, many of them low-income immigrants, are
often ineligible for unemployment and lack access to health care.

Most of the chefs say they are baking because it is currently the only
practical action they can take against chaos and injustice.

“I don’t know policy, I am not a lawyer who can get people out of
prison, but I can make cookies,” Ms. Pelini said. “And maybe if I sell
someone cookies, it can open a conversation about why we are making
them.”
