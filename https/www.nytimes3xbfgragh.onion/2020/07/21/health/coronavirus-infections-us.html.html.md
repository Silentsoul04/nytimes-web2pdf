The number of people infected with the coronavirus in different parts of
the United States was anywhere from two to 13 times higher than the
reported rates for those regions, according to [data released
Tuesday](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html)
by the [Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/health/cdc-schools-coronavirus.html).

[The
findings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html)
suggest that large numbers of people who did not have symptoms or did
not seek medical care may have kept the virus circulating in their
communities.

The study indicates that even the hardest-hit area in the study — New
York City, where nearly one in four people has been exposed to the virus
— is nowhere near achieving herd immunity, the level of exposure at
which the virus would stop spreading in a particular city or region.
Experts believe 60 percent of people in an area would need to have been
exposed to the coronavirus to reach herd immunity.

The analysis, based on antibody tests, is the largest of its kind to
date; a study of a subset of cities and states was released last month.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“These data continue to show that the number of people who have been
infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 far exceeds the number of
reported cases,” said Dr. Fiona Havers, the C.D.C. researcher who led
the study. “Many of these people likely had no symptoms or mild illness
and may have had no idea that they were infected.”

About 40 percent of infected people do not develop symptoms, but they
may still pass the virus on to others. The United States now tests
roughly 700,000 people a day. The new results highlight the need for
much more testing to detect infection levels and contain the viral
spread in various parts of the country.

For example, in Missouri, the prevalence of infections is 13 times the
reported rate, suggesting that the state missed most people with the
virus who may have contributed to its outsized
outbreak.

Dr. Havers emphasized that even those who do not know their infection
status should wear cloth face coverings, practice social distancing and
wash their hands frequently.

The researchers analyzed blood samples from people who had routine
clinical tests or were hospitalized to determine if they had antibodies
to the coronavirus — evidence of prior infection. They had released
[early data from six cities and
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/27/health/coronavirus-antibodies-asymptomatic.html)
in June. The [study published in the JAMA Internal Medicine

on Tuesday expands that research by including four more regions. They
also posted data from later time periods for eight of those 10 sites to
the C.D.C.’s website on Tuesday.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The results indicate that in vast swaths of the country, the coronavirus
still has touched only a small fraction of the population. In Utah, for
example, just over one percent of people had been exposed to the virus
by early June. The rate was 2.2 percent for Minneapolis-St. Paul as of
the first week of June, 3.6 percent for the Philadelphia metropolitan
region as of May 30 and 1 percent for the San Francisco Bay Area as of
April 30.

In some regions, the gap between estimated infections and reported cases
decreased as testing capacity and reporting improved. New York City, for
example, showed a 12-fold difference between actual infections and the
reported rate in early April, and a 10-fold difference in early May.

“This is not coming as a shock or surprise to epidemiologists,” Carl
Bergstrom, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Washington
in Seattle, said in an email. “All along, we have expected that only
about 10 percent of the cases will be reported.”

Tracking the numbers over time can provide useful insights into the
virus’ spread and about a region’s capacity to cope with the epidemic,
other experts said.

“The fact that they’re sort of marking it out over time and looking at
it over a longer duration will actually be super-informative,” said Dr.
Rochelle Walensky, a researcher at Harvard University who wrote an
editorial accompanying the JAMA paper.

For example, South Florida ticked up to 2.9 percent as of April 24 from
1.9 percent just two weeks earlier. Missouri’s numbers barely budged
from 2.7 percent as of April 26 to 2.8 percent as of May 30. Numbers for
both regions are likely to be much higher in the next round of analyses
because of the surge of infections in those regions since those dates.

New York City showed the biggest leap in its rate, from 6.9 percent as
of April 1 to 23.3 percent as of May 6, consistent with its outbreak.

The city’s estimate closely matches the 22.7 percent prevalence found by

which tested patrons in supermarkets from April
19-28.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Some experts criticized the state survey at the time because people
shopping during the lockdown were more likely to be young, or might have
recovered from illness and felt safe.

“These consistent results offer mutual support to two very different
methods used,” Eli Rosenberg, an epidemiologist at the State University
of New York at Albany and lead author of the state study.

The C.D.C. study also has limitations, Dr. Walensky said, because many
of the people who ventured out during the lockdowns for tests or were
hospitalized would have been severely ill, and might not have been
representative of the general population.

epidemic curve and varied in terms of the amount of testing that they
did,” she said.

The study also did not collect data on race, ethnicity, diagnostic and
symptom history or prevention behaviors, Dr. Rosenberg said. “The
approach used in the grocery store study allows for these data
collections by pairing the specimen collection with a survey,” he said.

Still, experts said the findings were valuable, despite limitations.

“This population may not be exactly representative of the population as
a whole, but the hope is that it is close enough to allow us to draw
meaningful conclusions,” Dr. Bergstrom said.

Several recent studies have suggested that antibody levels, especially
in people with mild or no symptoms, may quickly decline. If that’s true,
surveys like the C.D.C.’s might reflect only people who were infected
within the previous two to three months, Dr. Rosenberg said, “and
complicate interpretation of results over time.”
