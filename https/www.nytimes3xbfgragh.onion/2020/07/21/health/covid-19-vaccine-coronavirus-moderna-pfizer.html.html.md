# Some Vaccine Makers Say They Plan to Profit From Coronavirus Vaccine

</div>

Moderna, which is receiving $483 million from the U.S. government, told
lawmakers it would not sell its vaccine at cost. Pfizer has said it
would also profit, but has so far taken no government money.

Executives from four companies in the race to produce a [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html) — AstraZeneca,
Johnson & Johnson,
[Moderna](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html)
Therapeutics and
[Pfizer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html)
— told lawmakers on Tuesday that they are optimistic their products
could be ready by the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021. All four
companies are [testing vaccines in human clinical
trials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html).

Three of the firms — AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna — are
getting federal funds for their vaccine development efforts. AstraZeneca
and Johnson & Johnson pledged to the lawmakers that they would produce
hundreds of millions of doses of their vaccines at no profit to
themselves. Moderna, however, which has been granted $483 million from
the government to develop its product, made no such promise.

“We will not sell it at cost,” said Dr. Stephen Hoge, the president of
Moderna*.*

Many Democratic lawmakers [have
argued](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-trump-moderna.html)
that federal funding for vaccine development should include provisions
to guarantee affordability and guard against profiteering.

At the Congressional hearing on Tuesday, some House members raised
concerns about Pfizer’s decision to reject federal funds, suggesting it
could lead to price-gouging and a lack of transparency.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We didn’t accept the federal government funding solely for the reason
that we wanted to be able to move as quickly as possible with our
vaccine candidate into the clinic,” said John Young, Pfizer’s chief
business officer.

“We’ll price our potential vaccine consistent with the urgent global
health emergency that we’re facing,” Mr. Young said, adding that “a
vaccine is meaningless if people are unable to afford it.”

Representative Dr. Raul Ruiz, Democrat of California, also questioned
whether failing to address the financial stakes of vaccine development
early on could keep these products out of “the hands of the people that
need this
most.”

“I don’t want to look back, and then have health equity be an
afterthought,” Dr. Ruiz said. “It has to be prioritized.”

The hearing held by members of the House energy committee’s oversight
panel was punctuated by notes of optimism from executives from each
company, several of whom referred to promising early results from
studies in people. On Monday, AstraZeneca and Pfizer [released
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/world/covid-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
indicating that their vaccines could stimulate strong immune responses
with only minor side effects.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, the actual effectiveness and durability of these responses
against the virus have yet to be determined. No vaccine candidates have
been proven effective for preventing infection by the coronavirus, or
for protecting people from the severe effects of
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-allocation.html),
the disease caused by the virus.

Panel members [pressed
the](https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-pathway-to-a-vaccine-efforts-to-develop-a-safe-effective-and)
company executives for a commitment to maintain the highest standards
for a vaccine, and not sacrifice quality for the sake of expediency. An
ideal vaccine, several committee members stressed, would not only be
safe and effective, but also be straightforward enough to manufacture en
masse and available to the public at low cost.

“It is possible that a Covid-19 vaccine may become available by the end
of this year or early next year,” said Representative Diana DeGette,
Democrat of Colorado and the panel’s chairperson. “That’s a rare bit of
good news in this harrowing
time.”

A fifth contender, Merck, painted a far less rosy picture of the vaccine

process be rushed. “We do not expect to be able to accelerate the safety

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Merck’s chief executive, Kenneth Frazier, has [previously
cautioned](https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/merck-ceo-frazier-says-covid-19-vaccine-hype-a-grave-disservice-to-public)
against coronavirus vaccine hype and warned that a hurried approval
process could damage prospects for protecting the public.

In a
[statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-action-help-facilitate-timely-development-safe-effective-covid)
released on June 30, the Food and Drug Administration noted that any
vaccine candidate vying for approval would need to prevent or ameliorate
disease in at least 50 percent of the people who received it.
Manufacturers won’t have a good sense of these metrics until the
completion of **** so-called Phase 3 clinical trials, which enroll
thousands of participants — some of whom are vaccinated, some of whom
aren’t — and track their infection status over the course of multiple
months.

Federal approval isn’t the only goal of vaccine development, the
executives said. Once this milestone is met, the vaccines will still
need to be administered widely and also be accessible to a range of
populations particularly those that have been disproportionately
affected by the virus. Those would include the elderly, people with
