Vaccine}\label{some-vaccine-makers-say-they-plan-to-profit-from-coronavirus-vaccine}}

Moderna, which is receiving \$483 million from the U.S. government, told
lawmakers it would not sell its vaccine at cost. Pfizer has said it
would also profit, but has so far taken no government money.

Executives from four companies in the race to produce a

vaccine}~---~AstraZeneca, Johnson \& Johnson,

Therapeutics and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html}{Pfizer}
---~told lawmakers on Tuesday that they are optimistic their products
could be ready by the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021. All four
companies are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{testing
vaccines in human clinical trials}.

Three of the firms --- AstraZeneca, Johnson \& Johnson and Moderna
---~are getting federal funds for their vaccine development efforts.
AstraZeneca and Johnson \& Johnson pledged to the lawmakers that they
would produce hundreds of millions of doses of their vaccines at no
profit to themselves. Moderna, however, which has been granted \$483
million from the government to develop its product, made no such
promise.

``We will not sell it at cost,'' said Dr. Stephen Hoge, the president of
Moderna*.*

Many Democratic lawmakers
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-trump-moderna.html}{have
argued} that federal funding for vaccine development should include
provisions to guarantee affordability and guard against profiteering.

At the Congressional hearing on Tuesday, some House members raised
concerns about Pfizer's decision to reject federal funds, suggesting it
could lead to price-gouging and a lack of transparency.

``We didn't accept the federal government funding solely for the reason
that we wanted to be able to move as quickly as possible with our
vaccine candidate into the clinic,'' said John Young, Pfizer's chief
business officer.

``We'll price our potential vaccine consistent with the urgent global
health emergency that we're facing,'' Mr. Young said, adding that ``a
vaccine is meaningless if people are unable to afford it.''

Representative Dr. Raul Ruiz, Democrat of California, also questioned
whether failing to address the financial stakes of vaccine development
early on could keep these products out of ``the hands of the people that
need this most.''

``I don't want to look back, and then have health equity be an
afterthought,'' Dr. Ruiz said. ``It has to be prioritized.''

The hearing held by members of the House energy committee's oversight
panel was punctuated by notes of optimism from executives from each
company, several of whom referred to promising early results from
studies in people. On Monday, AstraZeneca and Pfizer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/world/covid-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{released
data} indicating that their vaccines could stimulate strong immune
responses with only minor side effects.

Still, the actual effectiveness and durability of these responses
against the virus have yet to be determined. No vaccine candidates have
been proven effective for preventing infection by the coronavirus, or
for protecting people from the severe effects of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-allocation.html}{Covid-19},
the disease caused by the virus.

Panel members
\href{https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-pathway-to-a-vaccine-efforts-to-develop-a-safe-effective-and}{pressed
the} company executives for a commitment to maintain the highest
standards for a vaccine, and not sacrifice quality for the sake of
expediency. An ideal vaccine, several committee members stressed, would
not only be safe and effective, but also be straightforward enough to
manufacture en masse and available to the public at low cost.

``It is possible that a Covid-19 vaccine may become available by the end
of this year or early next year,'' said Representative Diana DeGette,
Democrat of Colorado and the panel's chairperson. ``That's a rare bit of
good news in this harrowing time.''

But, she added, ``we must remind ourselves that plenty can still go
wrong. And so the anticipated timeline is not guaranteed.''

A fifth contender, Merck, painted a far less rosy picture of the vaccine
development landscape. Dr. Julie Gerberding, the company's executive
vice president and chief patient officer, made no promises about when
its product would be ready, citing concerns about safety should the
process be rushed. ``We do not expect to be able to accelerate the
safety assessment,'' Dr. Gerberding said.

Merck's chief executive, Kenneth Frazier, has
\href{https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/merck-ceo-frazier-says-covid-19-vaccine-hype-a-grave-disservice-to-public}{previously
cautioned} against coronavirus vaccine hype and warned that a hurried
approval process could damage prospects for protecting the public.

In a
\href{https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-action-help-facilitate-timely-development-safe-effective-covid}{statement}
released on June 30, the Food and Drug Administration noted that any
vaccine candidate vying for approval would need to prevent or ameliorate
disease in at least 50 percent of the people who received it.
Manufacturers won't have a good sense of these metrics until the
completion of **** so-called Phase 3 clinical trials, which enroll
thousands of participants --- some of whom are vaccinated, some of whom
aren't --- and track their infection status over the course of multiple
months.

Federal approval isn't the only goal of vaccine development, the
executives said. Once this milestone is met, the vaccines will still
need to be administered widely and also be accessible to a range of
populations particularly those that have been disproportionately
affected by the virus. Those would include the elderly, people with
underlying medical conditions and Black, Latino and Native Americans.

In written statements to the panel,
\href{https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Testimony\%20-\%20Pangalos\%2020200721_0.pdf}{AstraZeneca},
\href{https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Testimony\%20-\%20Douoguih\%2020200721_0.pdf}{Johnson
\& Johnson} and
\href{https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Testimony\%20-\%20Young\%2020200721_0.pdf}{Pfizer}
reaffirmed their commitment to diversity in their vaccine development
pipelines to ensure that these vulnerable communities will also benefit
from their products.

Dr. Macaya Douoguih, who is ** head of clinical development and medical
affairs of Johnson \& Johnson's Janssen Vaccines, said at the hearing
that her company would be leveraging its past experience with community
outreach, noting the importance of equipping higher-risk populations
with accurate information about the disease.

And Dr. Hoge, of Moderna, said that his company is actively enrolling
people ``representative of the diversity of America'' into Phase 3
trials.

The subcommittee also stressed the importance of worldwide distribution
of any vaccines proven effective against the coronavirus to ensure
global health.

``None of us are safe until all of us are safe,'' Mr. Young said.
