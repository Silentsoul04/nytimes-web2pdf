\section{Michael Cohen Claims in Suit He Was Imprisoned to Stop Trump
Book}\label{michael-cohen-claims-in-suit-he-was-imprisoned-to-stop-trump-book}}

President Trump's former lawyer said in court papers that officials
returned him to prison to prevent him from finishing a book that paints
the president as a racist.

D. Cohen} says it was no secret that he was writing a jailhouse
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/nyregion/michael-cohen-donald-trump-prison.html}{tell-all
book} about his former boss, President Trump. He spent hours at a
stretch working on his manuscript in a prison library before he was
released on furlough in May because of the coronavirus.

Then, earlier this month, federal officials abruptly sent Mr. Cohen back
to prison because he balked at signing an agreement that would have let
him stay at home with a key restriction: He would not have been allowed
to publish his book before the November elections.

Now Mr. Cohen has responded with a lawsuit claiming that the government
has violated his First Amendment rights by returning him to custody and
interrupting his writing.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday night, asked
a judge to once again release Mr. Cohen and let him to serve the
remainder of his three-year sentence back in home confinement.

The complaint, filed on Mr. Cohen's behalf by private lawyers and the
American Civil Liberties Union, accuses Attorney General William P. Barr
and federal prison officials of using his return to prison as a way to
stop the publication of the book, which, court papers say, paints the
president as a racist.

``The government cannot imprison Michael Cohen for writing a book about
President Trump,'' said Ben Wizner, director of the A.C.L.U.'s Speech,
Privacy and Technology Project.

The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. The
Bureau of Prisons said in a statement that it would not comment on
pending litigation or legal proceedings.

The judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein, scheduled a hearing for Thursday.

This latest twist in Mr. Cohen's long-running saga began in May when he
was allowed to go home from a minimum-security prison camp in Otisville,
N.Y., about 75 miles northwest of New York City, as part of an effort by
the Bureau of Prisons to curb the spread of coronavirus behind bars. He
had expected to serve the rest of his term in home confinement.

But
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/nyregion/michael-cohen-arrested.html}{federal
officials returned him to prison on July 9} after they claimed that he
refused to sign an agreement promising, in part, that he would not
publish a book while still serving his time.

In an affidavit filed with his suit, Mr. Cohen, 53, argued that he
never, in fact, refused to sign the agreement, but merely had his lawyer
ask a few questions about what it required. ``I was shocked,'' he wrote,
``when three U.S. Marshals later arrived with handcuffs and shackles to
take me into custody.''

Mr. Cohen also said that he never hid the fact that he was writing a
book about Mr. Trump, noting that he spent his mornings working on the
manuscript ``in plain sight'' in the prison's law library, and also
discussed his project with prison officials, staff members and other
inmates.

The book, he said, was tentatively titled ``Disloyal: The True Story of
Michael Cohen, Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.''

According to his lawsuit, the book will give a glimpse into Mr. Cohen's
``firsthand experiences with Mr. Trump'' and offer ``graphic details
about the president's behavior behind closed doors.''

``The narrative describes pointedly certain anti-Semitic remarks against
prominent Jewish people and virulently racist remarks against such Black
leaders as President Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela,'' the lawsuit
says.

One of Mr. Cohen's private lawyers, E. Danya Perry, said in court papers
that she had asked federal prosecutors who had handled Mr. Cohen's case
to intervene on his behalf and urge the Bureau of Prisons to give him a
second chance to be transferred to home confinement.

But, she said, when the prosecutors responded that the decision was up
to prison officials and they could not say when it would be made, Mr.
Cohen's legal team opted to go to court. A spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.

A legal bulldog who once bragged he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump,
Mr. Cohen
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion\%2F2018\%2F08\%2F21\%2Fnyregion\%2Fmichael-cohen-guilty-plea-trump-takeaways.html}{pleaded
guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and other crimes}
connected to a scheme to pay hush money to two women --- a former adult
film actress and a former Playboy model --- who claimed they had had
affairs with Mr. Trump before he was president.

In his guilty plea, he pointed the finger at the president, telling the
court that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange the hush money payments
for the purpose of influencing the 2016 election. Mr. Trump has denied
the allegations.

Mr. Cohen's lawyers argued in the new lawsuit that his project was only
the latest book critical of the president that Mr. Trump and his allies
have sought to keep from being published.

In June, the Justice Department
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/us/politics/john-bolton-book-publication.html}{asked
a judge to delay the release of ``The Room Where it Happened,''} a
memoir by John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser who,
among other things, confirmed accusations at the heart of the Democratic
impeachment case over the president's dealings with Ukraine. The judge
ultimately denied the request.

On the same day that Mr. Bolton's book was published, Mr. Trump's
younger brother, Robert S. Trump, filed
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/politics/mary-trump-book-court.html}{a
suit seeking to stop the publication of a family tell-all written by
their niece, Mary L. Trump}.

After a few weeks of whirlwind litigation, the judge in that case sided
with Ms. Trump,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/us/politics/mary-trump-book.html}{allowing
her to publish her memoir}, which accused Mr. Trump of embracing
cheating ``as a way of life'' and of paying someone to take his college
entrance exams.

When Mr. Cohen was sent back to prison, he was immediately placed in
solitary confinement. Locked down for 23 hours a day without access to a
computer, he wrote in his affidavit, he has been unable to edit his
manuscript.

``Given my hope to communicate my impressions, ideas, and political
thoughts through my book in September 2020, in advance of the
presidential elections,'' he added, ``this time is a critical
juncture.''
