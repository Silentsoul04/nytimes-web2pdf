The Legislature should use a rare, brief summer session to make key
reforms ahead of the November elections.

New York's Legislature is meeting virtually, for the most part, this
week, tackling unfinished business amid the coronavirus pandemic that
has wreaked havoc on the state's health and its finances.

Given what New York and other hard-hit states are up against, the
Legislature has its work cut out for it. At least one form of relief
state lawmakers can deliver in this brief and unusual summer session is
swiftly passing a package of reforms to make it easier for New Yorkers
to vote --- a no-brainer ahead of an important presidential election.

Voting in New York is still
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/15/opinion/new-york-ranked-choice-voting.html}{harder
than it should be}. Across the state, election boards are too often
packed with partisan patronage appointees rather than independent
professionals. Voters often have faced lengthy lines or broken machines
at poll sites. In 2014 and 2015, New York City improperly purged roughly
\href{https://www.vox.com/2018/9/13/17855254/new-york-city-voters-rolls-purges-missing-names-2018-midterms}{200,000
voters} from the rolls.

Practices that are straightforward in other states, like voting by
absentee ballot, can be an ordeal in New York. In the state's
congressional primary elections last month, for example, thousands of
absentee ballots
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/nyregion/voting-nyc-primary.html}{failed
to arrive} in time for people to vote. In other cases, absentee ballots
may have been invalidated because of postmarking delays by the U.S.
Postal Service. At least two candidates and a small group of voters have
\href{https://gothamist.com/news/cuomo-board-elections-sued-disenfranchising-thousands-voters-over-postmark-problems-absentee-ballots}{sued}
Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the State Board of Elections over these
irregularities.

Fixing the state's antiquated voting system now is a priority. The
Legislature can do some of that work this week, by passing three smart
bills.

\href{https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8806}{The first},
sponsored by Senator Michael Gianaris and Assemblywoman Latrice Walker,
would enact sweeping automatic voter registration, which has proved to
be among the best ways to improve turnout elsewhere in the nation.
Medicaid applicants, for example, would be automatically registered to
vote as long as they are U.S. citizens or do not check a box declining
the voter registration. The program would work the same way at the
Department of Motor Vehicles, New York City's public housing authority
and several other widely used agencies.

Another bill would make it easier to vote by absentee ballot in this
year's election, as well as in next year's mayoral elections.

The State Constitution allows voters to cast absentee ballots in only
six situations, and it requires voters to designate one on their
\href{https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/download/voting/AbsenteeBallot-English.pdf}{ballot
application}. They include absence from New York on Election Day,
temporary or permanent illness or disability, care-taking duties for
someone who is ill or physically disabled, detention in jail or prison
and being in a Veterans Health Administration hospital. Efforts are
underway to overturn this rule, but doing so will require a
constitutional amendment, a yearslong process.

In the meantime, legislators can approve a
\href{https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8015/amendment/d}{bill}
before them this week that would expand the state's definition of
temporary illness to include concerns over contracting or spreading the
coronavirus. The measure, sponsored by Senator Alessandra Biaggi and
Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, would help New Yorkers safely vote amid
the pandemic.

\href{https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8370/amendment/b}{A
third vital voting reform} under consideration, sponsored by Senator
Zellnor Myrie and Assemblyman Charles D. Lavine, would require election
boards to notify voters of clerical errors that could otherwise
invalidate their ballot and then give them seven days to respond. Right
now, election boards are permitted to toss ballots over errors like
failing to sign the envelope the ballot is mailed in or writing the
wrong date on a ballot.

Albany has earned a reputation as a place of dysfunction and corruption,
thanks to bad behavior by politicians of both parties. Perhaps with
members legislating remotely, those lawmakers can think beyond the
capital's toxic atmosphere.

These voting bills are the kind of unglamorous reforms that could
transform the state into a model of good government. Given the assault
on voting rights elsewhere, this is a refreshing thing to behold.
