Something dangerous is taking shape within the Department of Homeland
Security.

We got our first glimpse of it last week in Oregon, when unidentified
federal agents clad in camouflage and tactical gear descended on
Portland, beat and tear-gassed protesters and pulled others into
unmarked vehicles for [arrest and
questioning](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/17/portland-protests-federal-arrests/).

Apparently cobbled together using personnel from Customs and Border
Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation
Security Administration and the Coast Guard, these “[rapid deployment
teams](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-launches-rapid-deployment-teams-federal-monuments-july/story?id=71552901)”
are formally tasked with securing federal buildings from graffiti and
vandalism in tandem with the Federal Protective Service, which is
ordinarily responsible for the job. But they’re being used to suppress
protests in what appears to be an election year gambit by the Trump
administration to create images of disorder and chaos on which the
president can then campaign. “This political theater from President
Trump has nothing to do with public safety,” [Kate Brown, the Democratic
governor of Oregon, said last
week](https://www.wweek.com/news/2020/07/16/oregon-gov-kate-brown-says-president-trump-is-invading-portland-as-an-election-stunt/).
“Trump is looking for a confrontation in Oregon in the hopes of winning
political points in Ohio or Iowa.”

The official tasked with coordinating all this action, the acting
secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, is an
enthusiastic participant, casting protesters as “violent anarchists and
extremists” in order to justify what’s been done to them. “The city of
Portland has been under siege for 47 straight days by a violent mob
while local political leaders refuse to restore order to protect their
city,” [Wolf
said](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-long-lasting-violence-portland).
“This siege can end if state and local officials decide to take
appropriate action instead of refusing to enforce the law.”

On Sunday, Wolf’s deputy, Ken Cuccinelli (whose [official
title](https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/leadership/kenneth-t-ken-cuccinelli-senior-official-performing-the-duties-of-the-director-us-citizenship-and#:~:text=%3B%20Director%20\(vacant\)-,Kenneth%20T.,Mr.)
is “Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary for
the Department of Homeland Security”), [told
NPR](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/dhs-under-boss-were-taking-this-national)
that Homeland Security would be taking these tactics nationwide. Wolf
affirmed this, telling Fox News that his agency can act with or without
local cooperation. “I don’t need invitations by the state, state mayors
or state governors to do our job,” he said. “We’re going to do that,
whether they like us there or not.” President Trump likewise
[vowed](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-to-send-federal-agents-dhs-chicago)
to send federal law enforcement agents to several more cities, amid
reports that a Portland-like force was [headed to
Chicago](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-police-dhs-deployment-20200720-dftu5ychwbcxtg4ltarh5qnwma-story.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There’s more. In addition to its rapid deployment teams, the Department
of Homeland Security has also authorized domestic surveillance of
Americans on the basis of the president’s June executive order on the
protection of statues and monuments. Writing for [the Lawfare
blog](https://www.lawfareblog.com/dhs-authorizes-domestic-surveillance-protect-statues-and-monuments),
the legal scholars Steve Vladeck and Benjamin Wittes explain that the
“animating premise” of the new rules “is that the threat to monuments
and statues is a homeland security threat warranting intelligence
analysis and collection by federal officials.” The administration, they
continue, is using the “cover of minor property damage” to “justify
intelligence gathering against ordinary Americans” for “peacefully
protesting their government.”

The United States is no stranger to the use of military or
quasi-military force against protesters. During the Whiskey Rebellion, a
tax revolt of farmers and distillers in western Pennsylvania that
culminated in 1794, President George Washington raised a federal militia
to meet insurgents in the field. To break the Pullman Strike of 1894,
during which workers shut down rail traffic in much of the country,
President Grover Cleveland deployed federal troops to Chicago, sparking
a confrontation that ended in the deaths of 30 workers. And in 1932,
under orders from President Herbert Hoover, Gen. Douglas MacArthur
confronted the Bonus Army — a group of World War I veterans who camped
out in Washington, D.C., petitioning the government for their promised
bonuses for military service — with infantry, cavalry and tanks.

The difference lies less in the acts themselves than in the ways these
events developed. Use of military force against strikers and protesters
is certainly controversial, but for the most part it unfolds along clear
lines of responsibility and involves powers expressly granted to the
president. As the example of Washington and the Whiskey rebellion
demonstrates, it was part of the constitutional design. President
Trump’s internal security force was, by contrast, created out of
public view, using loopholes and expansive interpretations of the law.
The reason Customs and Border Protection can be used to police a protest
in Portland is, for example, because the Department of Homeland Security
can supplement law enforcement from one agency with personnel from
another.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are other elements beyond the fact of its existence that make the
emergence of an internal security force extremely troubling. As a
candidate, Trump actively cultivated both the leadership and the
rank-and-file of the border police and ICE. In turn, they gave him his
support — unions for both
[agencies](https://www.npr.org/2016/03/30/472420387/border-patrol-union-endorses-donald-trump)
[endorsed](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/immigration-customs-enforcement-union-endorses-trump-228664)
Trump for president. Under his leadership, these agencies have shown
themselves to be deeply simpatico with the administration’s draconian
approach to immigration at the southern border, with aggressive action
against migrants, asylum-seekers and unauthorized immigrants.

A secretive, nationwide police force — created without congressional
input or authorization, formed from highly politicized agencies, tasked
with rooting out vague threats and answerable only to the president — is
a nightmare out of the fever dreams of the founding generation,
federalists and antifederalists alike. It’s something Americans continue
to fear and for good reason. It is a power that cannot and should not
exist in a democracy, lest it undermine and destroy the entire project.

Democrats, thankfully, seem to recognize this. “We live in a democracy,
not a banana republic. We will not tolerate the use of Oregonians,
Washingtonians — or any other Americans — as props in President Trump’s
political games,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday, in [a
joint statement](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/71820) with
Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon. “The House is committed to
moving swiftly to curb these egregious abuses of power immediately.”

But rhetoric isn’t enough. The House must act and act now. In addition
to holding hearings and investigations — including eliciting testimony
from Wolf and other officials — Democrats should condition final passage
[of its Homeland Security appropriations
bill](https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/appropriations-committee-approves-fiscal-year-2021-homeland-security-funding)
on a complete halt to operations in Portland and other cities and the
dissolution of the response force. Should Democrats find themselves in
control of both legislative branches and the White House next year, they
should also use the opportunity to
[amend](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-acting-secretaries-dhs-fvra-senate-reform.html)
the relatively obscure Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which Trump has
used to install loyalists in high-level positions without Senate
confirmation.

There’s also the issue of the Department of Homeland Security itself.
Since its creation in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the department
has been criticized for its size, scope and waste. “It goes without
saying that I observed up-close the dysfunction, turf battles, and
inherent limitations in an entity that does so much,” Matt Mayer, a
Homeland Security official under George W. Bush,
[wrote](http://reason.com/archives/2015/06/23/president-bush-was-right-before-he-was-w)
in 2015. Report after report — from [congressional oversight
committees](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/minority-media/final-coburn-oversight-report-finds-major-problems-in-dhs),
from [the Government Accountability
Office](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/16/AR2008091603200_pf.html)
— show an agency practically defined by waste and dysfunction. And if
the Trump years have shown anything, it is that the agencies within
D.H.S., and especially ICE and C.B.P., are in desperate need of
root-and-branch reform or some other fundamental change.

Should President Trump fail to win re-election, perhaps the way to
prevent a replay of the abuse in Portland is to dismantle the
institution behind it. Just as local communities do not need militarized
police officers, the federal government does not need an alphabet soup
of militarized law enforcement agencies, as well as the cultures of
[prejudice](https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-border-patrol-facebook-group-agents-joke-about-migrant-deaths-post-sexist-memes)
and
[brutality](https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/ice-and-border-patrol-abuses)
that have gone along with them. If and when we close the book on Trump,
perhaps we should use the opportunity to close the book on Homeland
Security too.
