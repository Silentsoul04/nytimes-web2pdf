\subsection{Waiting Out the Storm}\label{waiting-out-the-storm}}

Pigeons arrived on our fire escape, grooming one another. A couple.
Affectionate. But they weren't pigeons. There was something un-pigeonly
about them. My wife called them ``generic birds.'' Search: ``generic,
monogamous birds of N.Y.C.'' We discovered: ``Morning doves!'' No,
actually: ``Mourning doves,'' named after their gray feathers and
melancholy song. I play a recording of their plaintive call. One cocks
its head in recognition. (My wife thinks he was looking at a tree.) We
sit inside. They sit outside. Bonded pairs waiting out this storm,
listening to ambulance sirens mix with the sound of mourning. ---

\subsection{A Nose Like Mine}\label{a-nose-like-mine}}

I was 23, the age when she'd made the decision to carry me, then pass me
on. He picked me up from the Atlanta airport in a limo with a bottle of
champagne. I loved him immediately and as recklessly as he'd probably
once loved her. ``I always wanted you,'' he said, his musician's voice
so different from that of Eugene, the Irish Catholic father who raised
me. I studied my birth-father's long hair, broad shoulders, calloused
fingers and nose that dipped like mine. He isn't perfect, I learned. But
he's the only man who's written me a song. --- \emph{Erin Carpenter}

\subsection{`The Nicest Separated Couple I
Know'}\label{the-nicest-separated-couple-i-know}}

My grandparents are the nicest separated couple I know. After 28 years
living under different roofs, they decided to shelter together during
lockdown --- much to the surprise of my family. From our video calls, I
catch glimpses of their laughter and gentle teasing. I smile watching
them on the same screen as they tell me about their daily walks and
budding herbs in their Montreal garden. Their happy cohabitation is a
silver lining, but it makes me wonder: Why didn't they stay together all
this time? --- \emph{Kat Chan}

\subsection{New Cat, Old Cat}\label{new-cat-old-cat}}

Meet my new cat, Chips. He is like a suitcase carnival: He plops down
his tent and turns a field into a festival. Before we left the shelter,
everyone came to say goodbye. A week after his homecoming, Chips stopped
eating. I brought him to the hospital and found out he has leukemia ---
which is to say, he is still on his way to somewhere else. The bright
striped tent is always packed up a little too fast. Meet my old cat,
Chips. He was only here for a bit. When he left, everyone came to say
goodbye. --- \emph{Mo David}
