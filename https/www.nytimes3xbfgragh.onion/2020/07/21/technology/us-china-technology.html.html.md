*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up

Technology is part of the [tug of
war](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/world/asia/cold-war-china-us.html)
between the [United States and
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html).
But let me offer some advice: When you hear an American technology
executive mention China, put on your hmmmm face. Ditto when you hear a
U.S. government official talk about China in the context of technology.

U.S. tech companies love to suggest that anything that hurts them
somehow opens the door to China’s technology dominance. And American
politicians sometimes appear to fan fears of Chinese technology for
selfish reasons.

There are legitimate concerns about China’s shaping global technology
norms, [seeking to swipe America’s tech
secrets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/business/china-technology-transfer.html),
[sponsoring criminal
hackers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-china-covid-19-vaccine-research/2020/07/21/8b6ca0c0-cb58-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html)
or using tech for political aims. But how can the American public fairly
evaluate technology policy when powerful people and companies use “but
China …” as a catchall boogeyman?

I get a pain behind my eyes when a U.S. tech boss brings up China.
“Breakup strengthens Chinese companies,” read [notes from Facebook’s
Mark
Zuckerberg](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/11/us/mark-zuckerberg-senate-hearing-notes.html)
for a congressional hearing two years ago. We’ll likely hear lines like
this when he and three other American tech C.E.O.s [testify at a
congressional
hearing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/technology/amazon-apple-alphabet-facebook-congress-antitrust.html)
next week about their companies’ power.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The implication — often
[repeated](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/facebook-or-china/) by
Zuckerberg and
[other](https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-breaking-will-only-help-china/)
tech
[executives](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/14/tech/sundar-pichai-google-antitrust/index.html)
— is that if U.S. lawmakers put speed bumps in front of America’s
digital stars, then … something something … China will rule technology.

If it feels like I skipped some steps, that’s what the tech companies
are doing. If they brought up worries about China giving a leg up to
homegrown tech companies through financial assistance or [spreading
government propaganda
online](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/us/politics/coronavirus-china-disinformation.html),
I might have some sympathy. But what they’re doing instead is fanning
China fear in a disingenuous attempt to distract us.

Americans can want our companies to thrive AND want our corporations to
have guardrails. Protecting Americans from potential technology abuses
doesn’t destroy U.S. innovation or strengthen any Chinese company.

U.S. government officials have a “but China” problem, too. President
Trump’s campaign ran ads on Facebook in recent days [that accused
TikTok](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/19/politics/trump-campaign-ads-facebook-tiktok),
the video app from the Chinese internet company ByteDance, of spying on
Americans by harvesting information from people’s smartphones. (The
researchers who identified the data collection mentioned in the ads said
that [many other smartphone apps do the same
thing](https://www.mysk.blog/2020/03/10/popular-iphone-and-ipad-apps-snooping-on-the-pasteboard/).)

Look, I understand in principle why U.S. officials are [concerned about
TikTok’s corporate
owner](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/technology/tiktok-washington-lobbyist.html),
and likewise about the role of China’s technology giant Huawei as an
[essential cog in the
internet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html).
It’s also fair for politicians [and Attorney General William P.
Barr](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/us/politics/barr-china.html)
to question whether American tech companies are hurting the country when
they comply with Chinese laws and norms.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But politicians, like American tech bosses, engage in fearmongering
about Chinese tech so often that it’s hard to know when to believe them.

If politicians and policymakers wanted to do more to support U.S.
technology, they could consider investing more money domestically in
critical tech, [including computer
chips](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/technology/trump-tsmc-us-chip-facility.html)
and artificial intelligence. They could help more foreign students stay
in the United States to [start the next great American
companies](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/06/trump-immigrant-entrepreneurs/561989/).
They could craft effective public health measures to tame a pandemic
that threatens the competitiveness of U.S. companies.

Or they can say “but China” and let us fill in the blanks in this
catchall fear tactic. When you hear U.S. tech executives or politicians
blurt out China, remind yourself to consider what they really mean.

## Three suggestions to bridge the internet divide

One of the inequalities that this pandemic has exposed is just [how
devastating it can
be](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html)
for Americans who can’t access or afford reliable internet service for
remote work, school and other activities.

In [a recent
editorial](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/opinion/sunday/broadband-internet-access-civil-rights.html),
The New York Times wrote that it can’t be acceptable for millions of
Americans [to go without an essential service of modern
life](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/opinion/sunday/broadband-internet-access-civil-rights.html),
or be forced to [sit in parking
lots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/technology/parking-lots-wifi-coronavirus.html)
to piggyback on reliable internet service.

I asked Greg Bensinger, a [member of the Opinion section’s editorial
board](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/opinion/editorialboard.html),
to follow up with three policies that he believed would help improve the
country’s internet service. Here’s what he said:

**1) We need a better count of who lacks internet access:** The first
challenge is correctly tallying how many Americans don’t have access to
fast internet service. The Federal Communications Commission’s estimate
of 21 million relied on self-reporting from internet service providers,
but they can count an entire census block as being covered [if just one
address has fast internet
access](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/technology/rural-america-digital-divide-coronavirus.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Independent estimates place the number at 42 million or more without
good service.

It’s important to get it right because these numbers dictate federal
spending on extending broadband service. The F.C.C. should instead use
accounting methods that are [independently
verifiable](https://broadbandnow.com/research/fcc-underestimates-unserved-by-50-percent)
and dive into census blocks to see the breadth of coverage.

**2) Revamp a subsidy for low-income Americans:** In cities that
generally have good internet networks, monthly subscription fees are a
burden, as are costs for laptops and tablets to access the internet. The
F.C.C. has programs for subsidizing telephone service for low-income
Americans — particularly the one known as Lifeline — that could be
revamped to include subsidies for monthly internet costs.

**3) Get the government involved upfront in paying for internet
infrastructure:** The federal government should directly fund an
internet build out. As it stands today, internet service providers
generally seek subsidies from the government after they have built
internet networks. That doesn’t give companies an incentive to reach
areas where profits may be harder to come by because the funds aren’t
guaranteed upfront.

## Before we go …

  - **Privacy loopholes in virus-fighting software:** Google and Apple
    have collaborated on smartphone technology that they pitched as a
    privacy-preserving way for health authorities to identify people who
    might have been exposed to the coronavirus. And yet, as my colleague
    Natasha Singer wrote, on Google’s Android phones, the technology
    requires people to turn on their location settings, which [could let
    Google follow those people as they roam
    around](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/technology/google-covid-tracker-app.html).
    
    And in South Korea, among the world’s leaders in digital public
    health, a mobile app that helps enforce coronavirus quarantines was
    found to have [serious security flaws that made people’s private
    information vulnerable to
    hackers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/technology/korea-coronavirus-app-security.html).
    The security holes were fixed, my colleagues reported.

  - **Virtual musical concerts might be pretty good now?** In the
    beginning of the pandemic, concerts streamed live on Instagram were
    pretty awkward. Musicians and fans have started to figure out how
    and where to hold relatively effective live performances online. My
    colleagues [have a run down on lingering
    questions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/arts/music/concerts-livestreams.html)
    — like will people pay big bucks for this? — and suggestions for the
    [10 best quarantine-era virtual
    concerts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/arts/music/best-quarantine-concerts-livestream.html).

  - **Internet stars face blowback from their product backlash:** Some
    online influencers and celebrities in Sri Lanka [told BuzzFeed
    News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/unilever-sri-lankan-influencers-skin-whiteners)
    that they faced professional backlash for publicly opposing skin
    lightening creams that they believed perpetuated the racist idea
    that light skin was more desirable.
