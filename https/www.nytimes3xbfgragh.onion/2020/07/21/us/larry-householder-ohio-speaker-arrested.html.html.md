# Powerful Ohio Republican Is Arrested in $60 Million Corruption Scheme

</div>

The House speaker was connected with a conspiracy to enact a $1.3
billion bailout of an energy company, the F.B.I. said.

Federal agents on Tuesday arrested one of the most powerful officials in
Ohio state government, the Republican House speaker, along with a former
state Republican Party chairman and three other people in what law
enforcement officials described as a $60 million scheme to bail out a
foundering energy company.

In a criminal complaint, the F.B.I. described a wide-ranging conspiracy
in which the energy company helped finance the election of the House
speaker, Larry Householder, in 2018. It then allegedly bankrolled an
effort led by Mr. Householder to pass a $1.3 billion bill subsidizing
two troubled nuclear power plants and a campaign to defeat a 2019
referendum to repeal that bill.

Along the way, the company also put $500,000 into Mr. Householder’s
personal accounts, including more than $100,000 to pay for costs related
to a home he owned in Florida, according to the complaint. Millions more
were paid in bribes to Mr. Householder’s co-conspirators, the complaint
said.

The conspiracy was “likely the largest bribery, money-laundering scheme
ever perpetrated against the people of the state of Ohio,” the United
States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, David M. DeVillers,
said in a news conference.Though the criminal complaint did not name the
energy company, the two nuclear power plants were owned by FirstEnergy
Solutions, a former subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

FirstEnergy Solutions is now known as Energy Harbor, [a separate
corporate entity](https://www.energyandpolicy.org/energy-harbor/) from
FirstEnergy Corp. Energy Harbor owns the two nuclear plants that Mr.
Householder helped bail out, according to the Energy and Policy
Institute. The institute said that the criminal complaint indicates that
three entities — FirstEnergy Corp., FirstEnergy Solutions and
FirstEnergy Service Co., another subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. —
together provided the $60 million for the scheme.

FirstEnergy Corp. **** said in a statement on Tuesday that it had
received subpoenas “in connection with the investigation surrounding
Ohio House Bill 6,” and intended to cooperate with investigators. Energy
Harbor said they are reviewing the complaint and will cooperate with the
investigation.

Mr. Householder, 61, who was arrested on his farm east of Columbus on
Tuesday morning, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine, officials said. He is the second recent Ohio House
speaker to be ensnared in a federal investigation, following Cliff
Rosenberger, [who resigned in 2018 but has yet to be charged with a
crime](https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/fbi-case-continues-year-after-ohio-house-speaker-rosenberger-resigned/MprQEzliOlvmk9jRkGbVyN/).

The speaker, a mainstay of Ohio politics who is up for re-election this
year, previously served as House speaker until 2004, when he reached
term limits amid reports of possible corruption, the complaint said. He
was never charged, however, and successfully reclaimed his old seat in
2016 before being elected speaker in 2019.

Also arrested in the conspiracy was Matt Borges, a former chairman of
the Ohio Republican Party and ally of John Kasich, a former Ohio
governor who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.
After Donald J. Trump won the presidency in 2016, he [intervened to oust
Mr.
Borges](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/06/us/politics/donald-trump-transition.html).
Last month, [Mr. Borges started a super PAC](https://rightsidepac.com/)
aimed at convincing Republicans to vote against Mr. Trump in November.

The other people charged in the scheme were Jeff Longstreth, a political
strategist for Mr. Householder; Juan Cespedes, a lobbyist also close to
Mr. Householder; and Neil Clark, a lobbyist.

Dave Anderson, the policy and communications manager for the Energy and
Policy Institute, a nonprofit organization that supports clean energy,
said FirstEnergy Solutions needed Mr. Householder’s help because its
coal and nuclear plants could not generate electricity cheaply enough to
compete with newer and cleaner forms of energy. The bailout legislation,
House Bill 6, helped support two of the company’s nuclear plants and
several coal plants, Mr. Anderson said.

“Once he was elected,” Mr. Anderson said of Mr. Householder, “he made
passing this bill a top priority of his.” It was signed by Gov. Mike
DeWine in 2019.

On Tuesday, Mr. DeWine called for Mr. Householder’s resignation. “This
is a sad day for Ohio,” the governor said in a statement.

FirstEnergy Solutions filed for bankruptcy in 2018, and after
restructuring became known as Energy Harbor in February.

Funds from FirstEnergy financed the successful campaigns of what Mr.
DeVillers called “Team Householder” — 21 candidates who subsequently
supported Mr. Householder as speaker. All but one voted for House Bill
6.

Much of the company’s money went to a nonprofit organization called
Generation Now that supported political and lobbying campaigns. A major
portion, as much as $38 million, was spent defeating a referendum to
repeal the bailout bill. The complaint described the payments as “akin
to bags of cash” that were “not regulated, not reported, not subject to
public scrutiny.”

Ohio’s secretary of state, Frank LaRose, said he had referred 19
possible violations of Ohio campaign finance laws relating to the
conspiracy to the Ohio Elections Commission.

House Republicans issued a statement on Tuesday saying they were
“shocked” to learn about the charges against Mr. Householder. “To our
knowledge, no other member of the Ohio General Assembly is under
investigation in connection with these allegations. We have not been in
contact with Speaker Householder today,” the statement says.

Mr. DeVillers said the investigation was continuing.

Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting.
