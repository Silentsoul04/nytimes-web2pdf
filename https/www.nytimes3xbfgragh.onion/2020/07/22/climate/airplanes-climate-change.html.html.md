# E.P.A. Proposes Airplane Emission Standards That Airlines Already Meet

</div>

Staving off a lawsuit, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed
new regulations to hold airlines to the carbon dioxide emissions
standards they created.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday made public the
federal government’s first proposal to control planet-warming pollution
from airplanes, but the draft regulation would not push the airlines
beyond emissions limits they have set for themselves.

President Trump is still pressing forward on his three-and-a-half-year
rollback of environmental standards, and the proposed airline rule would
stave off an impending lawsuit by putting the federal government in
compliance with a legal requirement that it regulate airplane greenhouse
emissions.

“This is the third time in the past two years that this administration
has taken major action to regulate greenhouse gases in a way that is
legally defensible, reduces CO2 and protects American jobs,” Andrew
Wheeler, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said on a
telephone call with reporters Wednesday morning.

Mr. Wheeler said he was referring to a [2019 regulation on greenhouse
emissions from power
plants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html)and
an [April rule governing emissions from vehicle
tailpipes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/climate/trump-fuel-economy.html).
Both of those rules replaced far more stringent climate change standards
developed by the Obama administration, and in both cases the new rules
allow for more planet-warming emissions than their predecessors.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The airline rules would be similar; critics say the substance of the
proposal does little more than codify a set of standards largely created
by the aviation industry itself, and is unlikely to diminish the
industry’s contribution to global warming.

The new proposal on airplane emissions, which would be open to public
comment before being legally finalized, is modeled after [a plan drafted
largely by international airline companies and adopted in 2016 by the
International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations
body.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/09/business/energy-environment/un-agency-proposes-limits-on-airlines-carbon-emissions.html)
That plan required a 4-percent reduction in fuel consumption of new
aircraft starting in 2028 compared with 2015 deliveries.

“The loud and clear message I heard from the airline industry was to
implement” that standard, Mr. Wheeler
said.

Airline manufacturers praised the rule. Bryan Watt, a spokesman for
Boeing, called the new rule “a major step forward for protecting the
environment and supporting sustainable growth of commercial aviation and
the United States economy.”

Environmentalists have long said aviation emissions need to be reduced
to prevent the worst effects of global warming. Air travel accounts for
about 2.5 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, a far smaller
share than emissions from passenger cars or power plants. But those
emissions are projected to triple by 2050, according to the
International Civil Aviation Organization.

Analysts and environmentalists said the neither the existing United
Nations standard nor its formal adoption by the United States would do
anything to lower aviation emissions because the airline industry met
that standard years ago.

“Those standards are just a joke,” said Clare Lakewood, an attorney with
the Center for Biological Diversity, an advocacy group. “They don’t
require any meaningful emissions reductions.”

Daniel Rutherford, program director for aviation with the International
Council for Clean Transportation, said the standard would not require
any new investment in fuel-efficient technology. According to an
upcoming analysis by Mr. Rutherford’s group, new aircraft had met the
2028 standard by 2016.

The future of the proposal will be determined by the results of the
November election. It is unlikely that the rule will be finalized before
the end of this year, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has
campaigned on [a platform of aggressive climate
action](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/climate/trump-biden-environment.html).
If he wins the presidency, his administration would most likely ignore
the Trump proposal and write a new, more stringent one.

The Trump administration’s adoption of the aviation pollution standard
appears timed to avoid a lawsuit that would compel it to begin
regulating airplane emissions.

Because the aircraft manufacturers around the world must demonstrate
that they are in compliance with the United Nations standard, airlines
in the United States had asked the Trump administration to enact a
domestic version of that standard. That way, companies could continue to
sell American-made planes abroad.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last year, Nancy Young, the vice president for environmental affairs at
Airlines for America, a group that lobbies for the airline industry,
testified to Congress that her members needed the federal government to
create a legal certification demonstrating that American-made aircraft
comply with the international standard.

“If U.S. aircraft manufacturers cannot have their products certified to
the internationally agreed standards, U.S. airlines will not be able to
purchase these aircraft for international service,” she said.

In 2016, [the Obama administration released a legal conclusion known as
an “endangerment finding,” which determined that the planet-warming
pollution produced by airplanes endangers human health by contributing
to climate
change](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/26/us/politics/epa-airplane-pollution.html).
The endangerment finding did not include the details of a regulation,
but it set off a legal requirement under the Clean Air Act for the
E.P.A. to establish a rule.

In January, several environmental groups filed a legal notice of their
intent to sue the Trump administration for its failure to meet that
requirement, giving 180 days notice. That notice expires on July 28, but
with the release of the draft rule, the environmental groups no longer
have grounds to sue the administration to release a regulation on
aviation pollution.
