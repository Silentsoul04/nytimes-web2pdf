Reports of reinfection instead may be cases of drawn-out illness. A
decline in antibodies is normal after a few weeks, and people are
protected from the coronavirus in other ways.

The anecdotes are alarming. A woman in Los Angeles [seemed to
recover](https://www.foxla.com/news/southern-california-woman-tests-positive-for-covid-19-for-second-time-after-initial-recovery)
from Covid-19, but weeks later took a turn for the worse and tested
positive again. A New Jersey doctor
[claimed](https://dailyvoice.com/new-jersey/monmouth/news/central-jersey-doctor-reports-patients-reinfected-with-coronavirus/790555/)
several patients healed from one bout only to become reinfected with the
coronavirus. And another doctor said a second round of illness was a
reality for some people, and was much more severe.

These recent accounts tap into people’s deepest anxieties that they are
destined to succumb to Covid-19 over and over, feeling progressively
sicker, and will never emerge from this nightmarish pandemic. And these
stories fuel fears that we won’t be able to reach herd immunity — the
ultimate destination where the virus can no longer find enough victims
to pose a deadly threat.

But the anecdotes are just that — stories without evidence of
reinfections, according to nearly a dozen experts who study viruses. “I
haven’t heard of a case where it’s been truly unambiguously
demonstrated,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H.
Chan School of Public Health.

Other experts were even more reassuring. While little is definitively
known about the coronavirus, just seven months into the pandemic, the
new virus is behaving like most others, they said, lending credence to
the belief that herd immunity can be achieved with a vaccine.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It may be possible for the coronavirus to strike the same person twice,
but it’s highly unlikely that it would do so in such a short window or
to make people sicker the second time, they said. What’s more likely is
that some people have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus
taking a slow toll weeks to months after their initial exposure.

People infected with the coronavirus typically
[produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
molecules called antibodies. Several teams have recently reported that
the levels of these antibodies decline in
[two](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149633v1?%253fcollection=)
to [three months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
causing some consternation. But a drop in antibodies is perfectly normal
after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
immunologist at Harvard University.

Many clinicians are “scratching their heads saying, ‘What an
extraordinarily odd virus that it’s not leading to robust immunity,’ but
they’re totally wrong,’” Dr. Mina said. “It doesn’t get more textbook
than this.”

Antibodies are not the only form of protection against pathogens. The
coronavirus also provokes a
[vigorous](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888v1)
[defense](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062349v2?%253fcollection=)
from
[immune](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20100636v1?%253fcollection=)
cells that [can kill the
virus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32473127/) and quickly rouse
reinforcements for future battles. Less is known about how long these
so-called memory T cells persist — those that recognize other
coronaviruses may linger for life — but they can buttress defenses
against the new coronavirus.

“If those are maintained, and especially if they’re maintained within
the lung and the respiratory tract, then I think they can do a pretty
good job of stopping an infection from spreading,” said Akiko Iwasaki,
an immunologist at Yale University.

Megan Kent, 37, a medical speech pathologist who lives just outside
Boston, first tested positive for the virus on March 30, after her
boyfriend became ill. She couldn’t smell or taste anything, she
recalled, but otherwise felt fine. After a 14-day quarantine, she went
back to work at Melrose Wakefield Hospital and also helped out at a

On May 8, Ms. Kent suddenly felt ill. “I felt like a Mack truck hit me,”
she said. She slept the whole weekend and went to the hospital on
Monday, convinced she had mononucleosis. The next day she tested
positive for the coronavirus — again. She was unwell for nearly a month,
and has since learned she has antibodies.

“This time around was a hundred times worse,” she said. “Was I
reinfected?”

There are other, more plausible explanations for what Ms. Kent
experienced, experts said. “I’m not saying it can’t happen. But from
what I’ve seen so far, that would be an uncommon phenomenon,” said Dr.
Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at
Baylor College of Medicine.

Ms. Kent may not have fully recovered, even though she felt better, for
example. The virus may have secreted itself into certain parts of the
body — as the Ebola virus is known to do — and then resurfaced. She did
not get tested between the two positives, but even if she had, faulty
tests and low viral levels can produce a false negative.

Given these more likely scenarios, Dr. Mina had choice words for the
physicians who caused the panic over reports of reinfections. “This is
so bad, people have lost their minds,” he said. “It’s just
sensationalist click bait.”

In the early weeks of the pandemic, some people in China, Japan and
South Korea tested positive twice, [sparking similar
fears](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-reinfection.html).

South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[investigated 285 of those
cases](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030),
and found that several of the second positives came two months after the
first, and in one case 82 days later. Nearly half of the people had
symptoms at the second test. But the researchers were unable to grow
live virus from any of the samples, and the infected people hadn’t
spread the virus to others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It was pretty solid epidemiological and virological evidence that
reinfection was not happening, at least in those people,” said Angela
Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York.

Most people who are exposed to the coronavirus [make
antibodies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html)
that can destroy the virus; the more severe the symptoms, the stronger
the response. (A few people don’t produce the antibodies, but that’s
true for any virus.) Worries about reinfection have been fueled by
recent studies suggesting that these antibody levels plummet.

For example, a study published in June found that antibodies to one part
of the virus [fell to undetectable
levels](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/health/coronavirus-antibodies.html)within
three months in 40 percent of asymptomatic people. Last week, a study
that has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal showed that
neutralizing antibodies — the powerful subtype that can stop the virus
from infecting cells — [declined
sharply](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20148429v1)
within a month.

“It’s actually incredibly depressing,” said Michael Malim, a virologist
at King’s College London. “It’s a huge drop.”

But other work suggests that the antibody levels decline — and then
stabilize. In [a study of nearly 20,000
people](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151126v1)
posted to the online server MedRxiv on July 17, the vast majority made
plentiful antibodies, and half of those with low levels still had
antibodies that could destroy the virus.

“None of this is really surprising from a biological point of view,”
said Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn Mount Sinai School of
Medicine who led that study.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Mina agreed. “This is a famous dynamic of how antibodies develop
after infection: They go very, very high, and then they come back down,"
he said.

He elaborated: The first cells that secrete antibodies during an
infection are called plasmablasts, which expand exponentially into a
pool of millions. But the body can’t sustain those levels. Once the
infection wanes, a small fraction of the cells enters the bone marrow
and sets up shop to create long-term immunity memory, which can churn
out antibodies when they’re needed again. The rest of the plasmablasts
wither and
die.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In children, each subsequent exposure to a virus — or to a vaccine —
boosts immunity until, by adulthood, the antibody response is steady and
strong.

What’s unusual in the current pandemic, Dr. Mina said, is to see how
this dynamic plays out in adults, because they so rarely experience a
virus for the first time.

Even after the first surge of immunity fades, there is likely to be some
residual protection. And while antibodies have received all the
attention because they are easier to study and detect, memory T cells
and B cells are also powerful immune warriors in a fight against any
pathogen.

A study published July 15, for example, looked at three different
groups. In one, each of 36 people exposed to the new virus had [T cells
that recognize](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z) a
protein that looks similar in all coronaviruses. In another, 23 people
infected with the SARS virus in 2003 also had these T cells, as did 37
people in the third group who were never exposed to either pathogen.

“A level of pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV2 appears to exist in
the general population,” said Dr. Antonio Bertoletti, a virologist at
Duke NUS Medical School in Singapore.

The immunity may have been stimulated by [prior
exposure](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/48/eabd2071) to
coronaviruses that cause common colds. These T cells may not thwart
infection, but they would blunt the illness and may explain why some
people with Covid-19 have mild to no symptoms. “I believe that cellular
and antibody immunity will be equally important,” Dr. Bertoletti said.

Vaccine trials that closely track volunteers may deliver more
information about the nature of immunity to the new coronavirus and the
level needed to block reinfection. Research in [monkeys offers
hope](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/07/01/science.abc5343):
In a study of [nine rhesus
macaques](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/19/science.abc4776),
for example, exposure to the virus induced immunity that was [strong
enough to
prevent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-harvard.html)
a second infection.

Researchers are tracking infected monkeys to determine how long this
protection lasts. “Durability studies by their nature take time,” said
Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston who led the study.

Dr. Barouch and other experts rejected fears that herd immunity might
never be reached.

“We achieve herd immunity all the time with less than perfect vaccines,”
said Dr. Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global
Health. “It’s very rare in fact to have vaccines that are 100-percent
effective.”

A vaccine that protects just half of the people who receive it is
considered moderately effective, and one that covers more than 80
percent highly effective. Even a vaccine that only suppresses the levels
of virus would deter its spread to others.

The experts said reinfection had occurred with other pathogens including
influenza — but they emphasized that those cases were exceptions, and
the new coronavirus was likely to be no different.

“I would say reinfection is possible, though not likely, and I’d think
it would be rare,” Dr. Rasmussen said. “But even rare occurrences might
seem alarmingly frequent when a huge number of people have been
infected.”
