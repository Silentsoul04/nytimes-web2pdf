# ‘Blue Lives Matter’ and ‘Defund the Police’ Clash in the Streets

</div>

A recent number of pro-police rallies have led to fights and arrests as
civilian New Yorkers turn on one another over their view of the N.Y.P.D.

Clashes between protesters and the police were familiar sights in the
days after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer.
But a new kind of unrest has emerged in recent days: confrontations
between New Yorkers who support law enforcement and those who are
pressing for an overhaul of the Police Department.

There have been raw encounters in Brooklyn, Queens and in Manhattan, as
civilian groups identifying themselves as pro-police have led marches in
support of the men and women in blue.

The pro-police rallies also attract counterprotesters. Violent clashes
and arrests have played out this month as unsettling images of
civilian-versus-civilian rage echo back to past periods of racial
violence in the city. New Yorkers are shouting, not at police officers,
but over their shoulders, at one another.

Diane Atkins, a Bay Ridge resident, attended pro-police events in
Brooklyn on a Saturday and a Sunday earlier this month. “We wanted to
stand up for our police officers,” Ms. Atkins said. “These are everyday
New Yorkers who could be your friends, family and neighbors.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most of the pro-police events have been neighborhood-based and organized
by local residents, using Facebook and other social media outlets to
gain traction. Others have been co-organized by local political groups,
such as the Brooklyn Conservative Party, though most organizers try to
refrain from discussing politics at their rallies.

The crowds, which are overwhelmingly white, have been a mix of retired
officers, their friends and family and other attendees who have said
they are rallying support for law and order. Many law enforcement
supporters feel local officers have been wrongly vilified since Mr.
Floyd’s death. The rise of pro-police rallies is also a reaction to
legislative efforts to shrink the Police Department.

But the rallies, often known as “Back the Blue” or “Blue Lives Matter”
events, have been met by Black Lives Matter backers — racially diverse
groups of protesters who are outraged at gatherings that they see as
undermining their own cause.

“For pro-cop rallies to come down into the streets and yell ‘white lives
matter’ or ‘blue lives matter,’ it almost takes away from the
conversation,” said 18-year-old Abdullah Akl, who helped organize a
counterprotest in Bay Ridge. “We aren’t fighting against individual
police, we are fighting against the institution as a whole and all the
racism practices within.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Organizers of counterprotests have said that they intend their
demonstrations to be [“a peaceful, nonviolent show of
opposition.”](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/10I6F6sJfQB5NtZecobxN6mZ2Ua1eT0qe5PvZzGL0WrI/mobilebasic)

But quelling public anger has proved to be difficult for both sides.
Earlier this month in Brooklyn, in the Dyker Heights and Bay Ridge
neighborhoods, hundreds turned out for pro-police rallies that were
interrupted by protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement, and
tensions [quickly escalated in
confrontations](https://nypost.com/2020/07/11/blue-and-black-lives-matter-protesters-clash-in-nyc/)
largely split along racial lines.

At the rally in Bay Ridge, pro-police participants waved American and
Thin Blue Line flags and election signs for President Trump.
Counterprotesters arrived with Black liberation flags and Black Lives
Matter banners. Fists and insults flew even as police officers stood
between the two groups.

Several people were seen being taken away by officers. The police later
said two people were arrested in Bay Ridge, one for throwing a helmet
into a crowd and the other for attempted assault.

Days later, a more violent clash took place on the Brooklyn Bridge.

A march of clergy to promote peace [was joined by a group of off-duty
police
officers](https://gothamist.com/news/blue-lives-matter-protesters-and-nypd-hijacked-black-led-prayer-march-organizers-say)
heading to City Hall Park. Black Lives Matter protesters planned to meet
the march halfway. Before the two groups could face off, a few dozen
on-duty officers halted the Black Lives Matter protesters.

Again, violence broke out, but this time solely between police and Black
Lives Matter protesters. When a protester was being arrested on the
bridge, a woman attacked officers with a cane, the police said. Among
the targets were Terence A. Monahan, the Police Department’s chief of
department and top uniformed officer, who [sprained a
finger](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/nyregion/terence-monahan-chief-injured.html).
Other officers bled from head injuries, and several protesters were
injured. The police said 36 people were
arrested.

The incidents have each been separate, without a single group organizing
all the various “Blue Lives” events, but they share a frustration with
the criticism of police behavior and tactics and the calls to defund the
police.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The smartphone videos filmed at the events and shared on social media
tend to focus on the loudest and most volatile voices in attendance, but
others have quietly sought to mobilize backing for law enforcement.

Mary Ziegler, 43, who lives in Burnt Hills, N.Y., near Schenectady,
created a Facebook group **** to rally support for the police. In a
little over a month, the group has grown to over 9,000 members from
across the country.

“I would say this movement to ‘Back the Blue’ was galvanized when calls
to defund and abolish the police became a very real force in this
country,” Ms. Ziegler said in an email.

She recently created a Facebook event to organize a pro-police rally in
Albany next month.

President Trump has attacked calls to [defund the
police](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/politics/trump-police-reform.html?searchResultPosition=3),
calling the demand a fad. And earlier this month, he criticized [Mayor
Bill de
Blasio](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/nyregion/black-lives-matter-trump-tower-nyc.html)
for allowing “Black Lives Matter” to be painted on the street outside
Trump Tower. On Twitter, Mr. Trump said the painted motto will “further
antagonize New York’s Finest.”

It may have instead inspired them to create their own message: Last
week, two [police advocacy groups called
for](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/07/16/group-wants-blue-lives-matter-mural-near-nypd-headquarters)
a “Blue Lives Matter” painting on a street near 1 Police Plaza in Lower
Manhattan.

Some pro-police rally attendees insist that their mission is not to
antagonize Black Lives Matter protesters. At a recent police rally in
Staten Island, Scott LoBaido, 55, told participants the message should
be kept positive.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I emphasized if you’re going to spew anti-B.L.M. rhetoric, that will
not be tolerated at this rally,” he said.

And not everyone in pro-police circles favors the rallies. The Brooklyn
Young Republican Club turned down an invitation to the rally in Dyker
Heights, according to Joel Acevedo, 25, the president of the
organization.

“Good police do not need defending,” Mr. Acevedo said. “You can be
pro-police and still support accountability to a police system that
perpetuates inequities in Black communities. They’re not mutually
exclusive.”

The mere presence and timing of the nascent movement — and the “Blue
Lives” language — has upset protesters calling for overhaul of policing.

“The logic is nonsense,” said Noah Weston, 35, an activist from Bay
Ridge who attended two pro-police rallies as a counterprotester. On
Saturday, he was treated at an emergency room after someone kicked him
in the groin.

“Blue is their uniform, and they can take it off,” he said. “But Black
people can’t stop being Black at their leisure.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Protesters who want to defund the police said they plan to disrupt
future pro-police rallies and are training their members on how to
respond to an angry reception.

Some who attended recent counterprotests said police officers were
aggressive toward Black Lives Matter protesters [while being lenient
with pro-police attendees when trying to
intervene](https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-accused-protecting-violent-blue-lives-matter-marchers-bay-ridge)
during confrontations.

Joseph Imperatrice, 35, the founder of the group Blue Lives Matter-NYC,
attended the pro-police march in Bayside, Queens, in mid-July where
violent confrontations with Black Lives Matter protesters erupted.

The consistency of counterprotests and altercations at pro-cop rallies
has made Mr. Imperatrice cautious.

“That doesn’t mean I won’t go,” Mr. Imperatrice said. “But I’ll
definitely think twice.”
