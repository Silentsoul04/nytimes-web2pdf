As a respite from [a chaotic spring spent under
quarantine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/opinion/coronavirus-parenting-burnout.html),
my family booked a weeklong vacation last month in a cozy, remote house
in the California desert. While the kids cannonballed into the saltwater
pool and my wife sped through several novels, I spent my time in the sun
doing exactly the sort of thing you’d imagine an opinion columnist might
do on summer vacation: I read two hot new books about macroeconomics.

Wait, don’t leave\! I promise this isn’t as dry as it sounds.

The first book was “[The Price of
Peace,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/books/review-price-of-peace-john-maynard-keynes-zachary-carter.html?auth=login-email&login=email)”
Zachary Carter’s incisive biography of the British economist John
Maynard Keynes, which illustrates the awesome power of economic theory
to alter the fates of nations and the lives of millions of people. The
second was “[The Deficit
Myth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/opinion/us-deficit-coronavirus.html),”
in which the economist Stephanie Kelton convincingly overturns the
conventional wisdom that federal budget deficits are somehow bad for the
nation.

I’m [on record as a
doomer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/opinion/coronavirus-worst-case.html),
but in different ways, these tomes sparked the first real note of
optimism I’ve felt about America’s future in quite a while. Together,
they suggest a compelling political, moral and economic case for the
federal government to begin to do, again, what it once saw as its duty —
to make big, bold and even expensive investments to improve the lives of
Americans, and perhaps of people around the world.

In the last few years, and especially in the hellish last couple of
months, [the United States has come to feel like a failed
state](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/).
The coronavirus is spreading, the economy is crumbling, society is
fragmenting, our [infrastructure is falling
apart](https://www.businessinsider.com/asce-gives-us-infrastructure-a-d-2017-3#bridges-c-2),
health care is inadequate and costly, child care is impossible, and
[life expectancy is
declining](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/26/health/life-expectancy-rate-usa.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The federal government is not only often unwilling to help, but
seemingly incapable of it. To get just about anything done anymore,
Uncle Sam must go hat in hand to the behemoth private companies that now
rule much of our lives. [Please,
Google,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/opinion/coronavirus-trump.html)
will you create a coronavirus testing website? Please, Walmart, will you
set up in-person testing sites?

And whenever anyone is brave enough to suggest that the government
itself should provide useful services to Americans — whether big-ticket
items like health care, child care and college education, or smaller
things like an upgraded electric grid or a national broadband service —
the first reaction from many on the right and the left is one of defeat
and resignation. “How will you pay for it?” they ask. And, often, the
whole conversation stops right there, because with a [$26.5 trillion
national
debt](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/pd_debttothepenny.htm),
America looks hopelessly broke.

It is not. Kelton argues that our government’s inability to provide for
citizens isn’t due to a lack for money; instead, our leaders lack
political will.

Kelton — who has worked as an economist for Democrats in the Senate and
as an adviser to Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaigns — is one of the
leading proponents of [Modern Monetary Theory, or
M.M.T](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/16/18251646/modern-monetary-theory-new-moment-explained).
The theory argues that because the government is in charge of its own
currency, it cannot “run out” of money the way a household or a business
can, and it therefore does not need to raise taxes to fund government
spending.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This doesn’t mean that the government’s resources are infinite, just
that deficits are not a true limit on what’s possible. Instead of being
constrained by deficits, Kelton and other M.M.T.ers argue, policymakers
should care about “real” measures of economic activity: unemployment and
inflation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Whatever the deficit, if unemployment is rife, it’s an indication that
aggregate demand is low; to boost demand, the government can freely
spend, spend, spend — and should stop spending only when there is a
danger that it will lead to a rise in prices — that is, inflation — not
because deficits will soar. In practice, Kelton and other M.M.T.ers
propose a federal jobs guarantee, in which the government would hire
anyone who needs a job for a set wage. The policy, she argues, would
promote full employment while keeping inflation stable.

M.M.T. is controversial even among left-leaning economists — Lawrence H.
Summers, who once worked as Barack Obama’s director of the National
Economic Council, has called it [“a recipe for
disaster”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-lefts-embrace-of-modern-monetary-theory-is-a-recipe-for-disaster/2019/03/04/6ad88eec-3ea4-11e9-9361-301ffb5bd5e6_story.html)
— and it’s easy for non-economists to get lost in the
[many](https://crookedtimber.org/2020/06/01/modern-monetary-theory-neither-modern-nor-monetary-nor-mainly-theoretical/)
technical
[debates](https://www.bradford-delong.com/2019/03/james-montier-wonders-why-people-hate-mmt-he-is-about-to-discover-that-mmt-hates-him.html)
surrounding the idea.

But one doesn’t need to buy into everything about M.M.T. to see Kelton’s
fundamental point — that in the 40 years since Ronald Reagan won the
White House, both the left and the right have been unnecessarily
obsessed with deficits, to the detriment of the well-being of citizens.

The cruelest example of this mind-set occurred [after the Great
Recession
in 2008](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/18/opinion/obama-2008-financial-crisis.html).
At the time, many experts suggested that an adequate response to the
downturn would require the government to spend a trillion dollars or
more to boost demand. Instead, Obama and his aides, worried about
sticker shock, lowballed their stimulus, and millions of people remained
unemployed.

In the decade since that recession, many economists and lawmakers have
[grown less worried about
deficits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/16/business/deficits-virus-economists-trump.html),
because red ink has not led to economic calamity. That’s to the good:
Deficits are rarely questioned when lawmakers are spending on the
military or on tax cuts for corporations, so it’s only fair that they
aren’t constrained by deficits when spending on things like health care,
child care and education.

And right now, in the midst of a pandemic, the economy needs as much
help as it can get. In March, Congress passed and the president signed
the CARES Act, which provided more than $2 trillion in economic
stimulus. Studies show that it has had a remarkable effect — despite a
steep increase in unemployment due to the virus, the expansion in aid
[prevented a rise in
poverty](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/us/politics/coronavirus-poverty.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But [most of that stimulus will soon come to an
end](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/us/politics/coronavirus-poverty.html).
Congress is working on [another relief
package](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/21/politics/stimulus-negotiations-congress-latest/index.html),
but already lawmakers are fighting about its size: Democrats in the
House p[assed a $3 trillion
bill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/politics/house-simulus-vote.html);
Trump and Senate Republicans are looking at something closer to [$1
trillion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-relief-bill-phase-4-trump-republicans-1-trillion/).

Near the end of his Keynes book, Carter writes that Keynesianism “is not
so much a school of economic thought as a spirit of radical optimism,
unjustified by most of human history and extremely difficult to conjure
up precisely when it is most needed: during the depths of a depression
or amid the fevers of war.”

We are in similarly dire straits now — and one way we might escape is to
do what Keynes would suggest we do: spend our way toward a better
tomorrow.
