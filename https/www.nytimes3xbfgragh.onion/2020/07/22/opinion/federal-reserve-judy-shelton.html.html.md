Having failed in past attempts to put unqualified ideologues on the
Federal Reserve Board, President Trump is giving it another try — and is
closer to victory than previously.

The nominee in question — Judy Shelton, known for taking
long-discredited positions on the monetary system — makes Mr. Trump’s
earlier [rejected
choices](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/02/business/stephen-moore-fed.html)
seem almost conventional. Among other heretical stances, she has
supported the abolition of the Federal Reserve itself, putting her in a
position to undermine the very institution she is being nominated to
serve.

“Why do we need a central bank?” Ms. Shelton [asked
in](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123811225716453243) a Wall Street
Journal essay in 2009. She wants monetary policy set by the price of
gold, a long-abandoned approach that would be akin to a Supreme Court
justice embracing the Code of Hammurabi.

Regrettably, after much hesitation and with evident reluctance even from
Republicans, the Senate Banking Committee [voted Tuesday to
advance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/business/economy/shelton-federal-reserve-trump-senate.html)
Ms. Shelton’s nomination to the full Senate. We mustn’t let her
nomination become overshadowed by the many other daunting challenges we
face at the moment. When her name reaches the full Senate floor, four
Republicans must find the courage to join the Democrats in voting no and
rebuffing her appointment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Federal Reserve is an indispensable player in managing our economy.
Period. It has also, commendably, remained largely free of partisanship.
The nominees of past presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike, have
chosen to work collegially and without personal agendas to fulfill its
critical mission.

Now, as he has done so often elsewhere in the government, Mr. Trump is
doing his best to politicize this remarkable institution.

For starters, had Ms. Shelton’s prescriptions been followed, the Fed’s
response to the arrival of the virus would have been disastrously wrong
instead of extraordinarily constructive.

Her view that interest rates should be “rules based” would have
prevented the central bank’s emergency cuts.

Her past opposition to the Fed buying bonds to help stimulate the
economy — as it did successfully during the 2008 financial crisis —
would have prevented the central bank from standing up many of the
rescue programs that are now helping to keep the economy afloat.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Her notion that the Fed must consult with Congress, [rather than act
independently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/21/trumps-fed-nominee-judy-shelton-recently-questioned-need-an-independent-central-bank/)
as is considered the best practice among developed countries, would have
introduced damaging delays, politics and, likely, policy misfires as
ill-equipped members of Congress tried to grapple with the intricacies
of monetary policy.

Then there’s the gold standard, a significant culprit in deepening the
Great Depression and abandoned decades ago by every country in the world
(including the United States in 1973). By rigidly fixing prices to a
single commodity, a gold standard exaggerates economic swings, on
balance for the worse.

Between 1880 and 1933, the United States experienced at least five
full-fledged banking crises; in the past 87 years, we’ve had two. Though
promoted as smoothing price movements, a gold standard in fact magnifies
them, as a comparison of the pre-Depression period to the post-World War
II era makes clear.

In a 2012 poll, [not one of 40 prominent
economists](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/gold-standard/) supported
disinterring this misguided policy.

A few other weird ideas from Ms. Shelton: She has questioned the
accuracy of government statistics. She wants a single currency for North
America. (Does she not know how badly the euro has worked?)

On at least two existential issues, Ms. Shelton has shown a willingness
to not let principles stand in the way of career advancement. Until her
confirmation hearing, [she
backed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/02/13/trumps-fed-nominee-judy-shelton-could-be-trouble-key-gop-senators-express-concerns-about-her-outlier-views/)
getting rid of federal deposit insurance, a key protection for
individual savers. Her long opposition to low-interest rates
notwithstanding, [last year she
flip-flopped](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/19/fed-meets-trumps-potential-next-pick-wants-see-lower-rates-fast-possible/)
to Mr. Trump’s view that low rates are, in fact, a great idea.

Concern within the Senate Banking Committee was obvious during its
protracted consideration. “Nobody wants anybody on the Federal Reserve
that has a fatal attraction to nutty ideas,” John Kennedy, Republican of
Louisiana, [said in
February](https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-senator-raises-concerns-over-sheltons-fed-candidacy-11581608467).
But then, like so many Republicans unwilling to cross a revengeful
president, Mr. Kennedy capitulated.

To be sure, one iconoclastic and outspoken member of a seven-person
board (who are part of a 12-member committee that sets interest rates)
may not change the Fed’s decisions. But if Mr. Trump wins re-election,
he will have the chance to nominate a new chair of the Fed when Jerome
Powell’s term expires in 2022.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although he appointed Mr. Powell to the chairmanship, at times since
then the president has [taken to Twitter and other
forums](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/24/business/economy/federal-reserve-trump.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)
to assail him for raising rates in December 2018 and for taking too long
to lower them in 2019.

God help us if the next chair is Ms. Shelton or anyone else with her
views. Senate Republicans must recognize this danger and show some
backbone.
