The pandemic, an unemployment surge and unrest over racial inequality
have made more Americans
[feel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/opinion/covid-anxiety.html)
isolated, [anxious or
depressed](https://www.kff.org/statedata/mental-health-and-substance-use-state-fact-sheets/).
Psychological distress [could prove
temporary,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/health/coronavirus-mental-health-anxiety.html)
but the hurt and the [ripple effects are
serious](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/15/upshot/drug-overdose-deaths.html)
nevertheless.

Now here’s some good news. Benjamin F. Miller, a psychologist and chief
strategy officer for Well Being Trust, a national foundation focusing on
mental and spiritual health, told me something hopeful: In part because
of technology, this moment in history contains the makings of more
accessible and effective mental health care for everyone.

“Probably one of the most profound impacts that technology had in the
pandemic is that the care now comes to the patients,” Dr. Miller said.

He’s talking about the many physicians, therapists and clinicians
shifting to seeing patients by web video or over the telephone. Not
everyone loves health care through a computer screen, but Dr. Miller
said it has removed barriers that prevented many people from accessing
mental health services.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Care can now be just a FaceTime call away, and U.S. insurers quickly
made changes that allowed more people to get help on their terms.

I’ve been thinking about how peripheral technology has felt these last
few months. Sure, we’ve relied on technology for work, school and
staying in touch, but brave essential workers, capable political and
public health leaders and effective institutions matter more than
anything else.

Dr. Miller reminded me that technology doesn’t have to cure the
coronavirus to be an enabler for good. He said he believed that
technology has an important role to play in what he hoped would become a
larger restructuring of American health
care.

But first, some capable people and institutions had to cut red tape to
let technology in.

Since the start of the pandemic, Medicare and many private health
insurers have changed policies to reimburse practitioners for patient
visits by phone or web video at somewhere close to the payment rate of
in-person visits.

Privacy rules were relaxed to let people use familiar web video services
like Skype and not only medical-specific video sites. (Yes, this comes
with a possible risk to patient information.)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Telemedicine for all types of health care remains a tiny fraction of
patient care, but many more people and providers [have tried and liked
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/well/mind/teletherapy-mental-health-coronavirus.html).
Nearly every major mental health organization is pressing policymakers
to make those temporary changes permanent, Dr. Miller said.

Technology is not a panacea, Dr. Miller stressed. (Reader: May you
remember this sentence always, about everything in tech.) Lack of
internet access or discomfort with technology still holds some people
back from telemedicine, Dr. Miller said. And tech doesn’t resolve the
stigma that can be associated with mental health services or close gaps
in health insurance coverage.

But Dr. Miller said technology’s role in mental health during the
pandemic is a gift that he hoped would be the start of work to better
structure mental health services, integrate them into the rest of health
care and ensure they get enough resources to help everyone.

Dr. Miller’s essential message wasn’t about technology at all. Because
so many of us have felt stress and isolation recently, he hoped that we
can now talk openly about the importance of healthy minds and bodies,
and better understand people who live with mental distress.

“Now that we know how hard this is, I hope we have empathy,” he said.

## TV commercials and the maturation of tech

If you want one statistic that shows technology companies’ maturation
[from iconoclastic underdogs to the
mainstream](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/technology/big-tech-underdogs.html),
look at advertising.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Amazon now spends more money on promoting itself in television
commercials, internet ads and other spots than any company in the United
States, according to an
[analysis](https://s3-prod.adage.com/s3fs-public/2020-07/lnafp_aa_20200713_locked.pdf)
of 2019 advertising trends by the publication AdAge. Google was No. 6.
(I first read about this in the [Axios Media Trends
newsletter](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-media-trends-d14d7aa7-b160-4449-b01d-447b83fa18e5.html).)

Companies that make physical devices, like Apple, used advertising for
years to shape our perceptions. But until quite recently, Amazon and
many of America’s upstart internet companies thought advertising was
kinda tacky.

“Advertising is the price you pay for having an unremarkable product or
service,” the Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos
[quipped](https://blog.seattlepi.com/amazon/2009/05/28/amazons-jeff-bezos-on-kindle-advertising-and-being-green/)
more than 10 years ago. Last year, Bezos said that [he had changed his
mind](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/02/jeff-bezos-says-hes-had-a-change-of-heart-on-advertising--now-amazon-is-the-fifth-biggest-ad-spender-in-the-us-.html).

Why the change? Well, technology is becoming just like every other
product. There’s not much difference between a Ford and Toyota pickup
truck, so those companies know they must persuade you to feel warm and
fuzzy about their model. Picking an app or an online shopping company
likewise has become a lot about picking one that makes you feel good.

And as tech companies wanted us to turn over more of our habits and
lives to them, they needed to pitch themselves harder. Amazon, for
example, spends a lot of money advertising its movies, internet TV
gadgets and voice assistants to turn our homes into all-Amazon zones.

There’s a similar pattern to tech companies’ spending on policy
persuasion. They used to consider lobbying unseemly or unimportant, and
now America’s tech powers are [among the country’s biggest
lobbyists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/22/amazon-facebook-google-lobbying-2019/).

There you go. Tech is not a special species anymore. It is big and
everywhere, and that means the industry’s leading lights spend a lot of
money to stay on top.

## Before we go …

  - **Tackling a dangerous conspiracy:** Twitter announced a series of
    sweeping actions intended to remove or hide more accounts and
    material related to QAnon, a movement promoting baseless
    conspiracies that has proliferated on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter,
    my colleague Kate Conger
    [reported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/technology/twitter-bans-qanon-accounts.html).
    People who believe in QAnon’s intricate and false theories have
    [committed
    violence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/09/us/politics/qanon-trump-conspiracy-theory.html)
    and harassed people online, and internet companies have been under
    pressure to do more to combat the spread of this and other harmful
    material. Facebook is also preparing to take similar steps to limit
    the reach of QAnon content, Kate wrote.

  - **The criticism is coming from inside the house:** The Times ****
    tech reporter Karen Weise writes about Tim Bray, a respected
    technologist and Amazon executive who recently quit the company and
    [became one of its highest-profile
    critics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/technology/amazon-critic-tim-bray.html).
    Bray is using the mind-set and tools of Amazon — including the
    intense, six-page internal memos called PRFAQs — to articulate how
    and why he believes Amazon hurts competition and should be broken
    apart.

  - **Big tech versus the big scourge of climate change:** Somini
    Sengupta and Veronica Penney of The New York Times [walk
    through](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/climate/apple-emissions-pledge.html)
    what Apple, Microsoft and other large tech companies are doing to
    combat planet-warming carbon emissions, and where their rhetoric
    might fall short of their actions. (I’ll have more in tomorrow’s
    newsletter about technology and climate change.)
