### **Dear Tripped Up,**

I’m booked on a [Cunard Line](https://www.cunard.com/en-us)
trans-Atlantic cruise in May 2021. The reservation was made using credit
from an April sailing that was canceled due to Covid-19. Because I
canceled my reservation a week before Cunard itself canceled the
sailing, I was not given the opportunity to get a refund.

But I am almost 80 and I feel it is unfair for me to be locked into
traveling next spring when I am so fearful of the coronavirus. I feel as
though I’ve been penalized for canceling a voyage that was canceled
anyway. Based on what you know about the cruise industry and its
response to the pandemic, what should I do? Susan

### Dear Susan,

I’ve gotten emails from several Times readers who share your trepidation
about cruising. Given the rates of [coronavirus infections on
ships](https://www.cunard.com/en-us/contact-us/travel-health-advisories)
and all of the challenges with health and safety measures, some
travelers feel not-so-great about the idea of boarding a ship anytime
soon.

New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [paint an
especially bleak
picture](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/travel/coronavirus-cruise-ban-extended.html):
From March 1 to July 10, 80 percent of ships in the agency’s
jurisdiction were affected by the coronavirus. Since March 14, the
C.D.C. has devoted more than 38,000 hours to managing outbreaks on
cruise ships.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although certain small ships [have

operations this summer, most ocean vessels that sail to or from United
States ports are suspended through Sept. 30, according to the C.D.C.’s
extended [No Sail
Order.](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0716-cruise-ship-no-sail-order.html)
Still, many cruise lines are delaying their relaunch date even further.

So, yes, because cruising is a mess right now, it’s not totally
unreasonable to be anxious about what next spring will look like.

To win back consumer confidence, maintain cash flow and assure the
safety of future passengers and crew members, the cruising industry
needs to take massive action. Companies say they are hammering out
health protocols and testing upgrades like ultraviolet technologies and
H.V.A.C. systems. Meanwhile, docked ships and blank passenger manifests
have created a revenue crunch, and certain lines are downsizing their
fleets accordingly. Schedules continue to change; as a result,
customer-service channels are churning in overdrive.

“We’ve seen lines cancel their sailings in small batches — usually a
couple of months at a time — in an effort to process fewer cancellations
at once, but they’re still dealing with far more booking adjustments
than they’re used to en masse,” said Colleen McDaniel, the editor in
chief of [Cruise Critic](https://www.cruisecritic.com/), a major
cruise-planning website.

Perhaps fitting for an industry that’s so in flux, reader complaints
about cruise refunds and credits have felt especially bizarre. One woman
was told by a cruise line customer-service representative that in order
to get a refund, she would need to stop posting complaints about the
company on Twitter. (She didn’t; that’s how I found her.) Another was
asked to prepay for a cruise a full 33 months in advance — highly
unusual for a system that runs on deposits and final payments. (One
cruise-editor friend, upon hearing these anecdotes, deemed them a good
“alarm for the industry” about how customer-service reps are trained.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of the biggest — and consumer-friendliest — changes in cruising can
be seen in cancellation policies. While specifics vary by cruise line,
in general, the possibility of a refund shrinks (or disappears) the
closer one gets to the departure date. Pre-pandemic, most lines allowed
changes and cancellations up until 90 days in advance; now, many allow
them as close as a day or two before departure.

The hitch, though, is exactly the question your scenario raised: If you
do cancel a cruise reservation before the cruise line itself cancels the
sailing, can you get your money back? Or are you forced, as you were, to
accept a credit for a future cruise?

Another Times reader, Minhgiao, encountered this issue when her
septuagenarian parents canceled their [Viking
Cruises](https://www.vikingcruises.com/) reservation right before the
cruise line canceled the sailing in early March. That close to the
departure date, they were not offered a refund (though eventually
customer service agreed to give them a voucher).

“This was not only unsympathetic to the situation of a world pandemic,
but also unethical,” wrote Minhgiao. “Our parents are old and a lot
could happen in a year so the chance of them actually using the travel
vouchers was
unknown.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

I reached out to Viking and was able to help get Minhgiao’s parents
their cash back ($11,594 total). But in the last couple of months, as
the pandemic swelled, Viking eased its [cancellation
policy](https://www.vikingcruises.com/oceans/risk-free-guarantee.html)
anyway. Now, guests who book by the end of July can cancel up to 24
hours before departure for either a cash refund or a voucher (less the
standard $100 cancellation fee). With August nigh, it’s likely the
window for risk-free booking will further expand.

Far more typical, said Ms. McDaniel, is what you encountered with
Cunard.

“For most cruises that are canceled by the line, cruisers are able to
receive refunds,” she said. “But for travelers canceling on their own,
most lines are only offering compensation in terms of future cruise
credit.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Flexible booking terms and the likelihood of more canceled sailings in
the future are two of the reasons most cruise experts I know now
recommend waiting as long as possible to bow out of a reservation. There
is no magic number, so what that means depends on the line you’re
sailing with, when you book, the length of the itinerary, final-payment
deadlines and other factors. Individual booking and cancellation
policies will continue to change as we head into fall.

That said, May feels like an especially long time to have to wait and
see — even more so when you aren’t looking forward to the trip. The last
thing anyone needs more of right now is dread. Luckily, you’re off the
hook: That ship may end up sailing after all, but, when reached by
email, Cunard agreed to convert your cruise credit into a refund.
