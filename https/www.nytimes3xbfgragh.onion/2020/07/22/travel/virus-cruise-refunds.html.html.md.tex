The future of the cruise industry remains very unclear, so it's not
totally unreasonable to be anxious about what next spring will look
like.

I'm booked on a \href{https://www.cunard.com/en-us}{Cunard Line}
trans-Atlantic cruise in May 2021. The reservation was made using credit
from an April sailing that was canceled due to Covid-19. Because I
canceled my reservation a week before Cunard itself canceled the
sailing, I was not given the opportunity to get a refund.

But I am almost 80 and I feel it is unfair for me to be locked into
traveling next spring when I am so fearful of the coronavirus. I feel as
though I've been penalized for canceling a voyage that was canceled
anyway. Based on what you know about the cruise industry and its
response to the pandemic, what should I do? Susan

I've gotten emails from several Times readers who share your trepidation
about cruising. Given the rates of
\href{https://www.cunard.com/en-us/contact-us/travel-health-advisories}{coronavirus
infections on ships} and all of the challenges with health and safety
measures, some travelers feel not-so-great about the idea of boarding a
ship anytime soon.

New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/travel/coronavirus-cruise-ban-extended.html}{paint
an especially bleak picture}: From March 1 to July 10, 80 percent of
ships in the agency's jurisdiction were affected by the coronavirus.
Since March 14, the C.D.C. has devoted more than 38,000 hours to
managing outbreaks on cruise ships.

Although certain small ships
\href{https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/news/world/cruise-ships-return-to-danube-with-strict-safety-rules-on-board-475270/}{have
resumed} operations this summer, most ocean vessels that sail to or from
United States ports are suspended through Sept. 30, according to the
C.D.C.'s extended
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0716-cruise-ship-no-sail-order.html}{No
Sail Order.} Still, many cruise lines are delaying their relaunch date
even further. Cunard is
\href{https://www.cunard.com/en-us/contact-us/travel-health-advisories}{paused
until November.} Carnival Cruise Line has already
\href{https://www.carnival.com/health-and-sailing-updates?icid=default_butterbar_health\&safety_06032020}{canceled
some sailings} into 2021.

So, yes, because cruising is a mess right now, it's not totally
unreasonable to be anxious about what next spring will look like.

To win back consumer confidence, maintain cash flow and assure the
safety of future passengers and crew members, the cruising industry
needs to take massive action. Companies say they are hammering out
health protocols and testing upgrades like ultraviolet technologies and
H.V.A.C. systems. Meanwhile, docked ships and blank passenger manifests
have created a revenue crunch, and certain lines are downsizing their
fleets accordingly. Schedules continue to change; as a result,
customer-service channels are churning in overdrive.

``We've seen lines cancel their sailings in small batches --- usually a
couple of months at a time --- in an effort to process fewer
cancellations at once, but they're still dealing with far more booking
adjustments than they're used to en masse,'' said Colleen McDaniel, the
editor in chief of \href{https://www.cruisecritic.com/}{Cruise Critic},
a major cruise-planning website.

Perhaps fitting for an industry that's so in flux, reader complaints
about cruise refunds and credits have felt especially bizarre. One woman
was told by a cruise line customer-service representative that in order
to get a refund, she would need to stop posting complaints about the
company on Twitter. (She didn't; that's how I found her.) Another was
asked to prepay for a cruise a full 33 months in advance --- highly
unusual for a system that runs on deposits and final payments. (One
cruise-editor friend, upon hearing these anecdotes, deemed them a good
``alarm for the industry'' about how customer-service reps are trained.)

One of the biggest --- and consumer-friendliest --- changes in cruising
can be seen in cancellation policies. While specifics vary by cruise
line, in general, the possibility of a refund shrinks (or disappears)
the closer one gets to the departure date. Pre-pandemic, most lines
allowed changes and cancellations up until 90 days in advance; now, many
allow them as close as a day or two before departure.

The hitch, though, is exactly the question your scenario raised: If you
do cancel a cruise reservation before the cruise line itself cancels the
sailing, can you get your money back? Or are you forced, as you were, to
accept a credit for a future cruise?

Another Times reader, Minhgiao, encountered this issue when her
septuagenarian parents canceled their
\href{https://www.vikingcruises.com/}{Viking Cruises} reservation right
before the cruise line canceled the sailing in early March. That close
to the departure date, they were not offered a refund (though eventually
customer service agreed to give them a voucher).

``This was not only unsympathetic to the situation of a world pandemic,
but also unethical,'' wrote Minhgiao. ``Our parents are old and a lot
could happen in a year so the chance of them actually using the travel
vouchers was unknown.''

I reached out to Viking and was able to help get Minhgiao's parents
their cash back (\$11,594 total). But in the last couple of months, as
the pandemic swelled, Viking eased its
\href{https://www.vikingcruises.com/oceans/risk-free-guarantee.html}{cancellation
policy} anyway. Now, guests who book by the end of July can cancel up to
24 hours before departure for either a cash refund or a voucher (less
the standard \$100 cancellation fee). With August nigh, it's likely the
window for risk-free booking will further expand.

Far more typical, said Ms. McDaniel, is what you encountered with
Cunard.

``For most cruises that are canceled by the line, cruisers are able to
receive refunds,'' she said. ``But for travelers canceling on their own,
most lines are only offering compensation in terms of future cruise
credit.''

Flexible booking terms and the likelihood of more canceled sailings in
the future are two of the reasons most cruise experts I know now
recommend waiting as long as possible to bow out of a reservation. There
is no magic number, so what that means depends on the line you're
sailing with, when you book, the length of the itinerary, final-payment
deadlines and other factors. Individual booking and cancellation
policies will continue to change as we head into fall.

That said, May feels like an especially long time to have to wait and
see --- even more so when you aren't looking forward to the trip. The
last thing anyone needs more of right now is dread. Luckily, you're off
the hook: That ship may end up sailing after all, but, when reached by
email, Cunard agreed to convert your cruise credit into a refund.
