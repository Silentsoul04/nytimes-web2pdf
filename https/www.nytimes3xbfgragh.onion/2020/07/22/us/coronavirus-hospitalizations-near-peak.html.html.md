They are hooked up to ventilators, relying on the machines to breathe.
They are taking experimental drugs that doctors hope will ease their
agony. They are isolated from their families, fighting to recover on
their own.

More people are on track to be hospitalized with the coronavirus in the
United States than at any point in the pandemic, a disturbing sign of
how the current surge has spread widely and is seriously sickening as
many people as ever.

Across the country, 59,628 **** people were being treated in hospitals
on Wednesday, according to [the Covid Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily), nearing an earlier
peak of 59,940 on April 15, when the center of the outbreak was New
York.

more than twice as many as a month ago, and deaths have also started
trending upward, with an average of more than 800 daily. But
hospitalizations may be the clearest measure of how widely the virus is
causing the most serious illnesses, and could offer a glimpse of what is
ahead.

“Once you get to the point of being hospitalized or in the I.C.U., some
notable portion of those people will die,” said Natalie E. Dean, an
infectious-disease expert at the University of Florida. Even when
patients walk out of the hospital, “we don’t know what the long-term
consequences are,” she said. “Surviving doesn’t mean thriving.”

Not long ago, things seemed to be improving. Fewer than 28,000 patients
were hospitalized as of mid-June, when a new surge of cases was
appearing throughout the Sun
Belt.

The uptick in hospitalized patients around the country reflects a
different phase of the pandemic — a widening geographic area, especially
across the South, for the most serious illnesses compared with what had
been a relatively concentrated crisis in the spring.

Back then, nearly one in five hospitalized patients were in New York,
and the [city had to set up mobile
morgues](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/02/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-bodies.html)
to keep up with the rising deaths. Now, the situation looks far
different, and California, where the virus is surging, has reported more
cases than New York. In the past week, both Florida and Texas [have
added an average of more than 10,000 reported cases each
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
with California not far behind.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The spike in hospitalizations for the virus has been driven in part by
people younger than 50. That group made up nearly 40 percent of the
hospitalizations as of earlier this month, compared with 26 percent in
late April, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html). The
shift offers one hopeful sign: Young people are less likely to die from
the virus.

The majority of hospitalizations — about 60 percent — are now in the
South, [according to the Covid Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/regional-current-hospitalizations),
which is run by The Atlantic and collects state hospitalization data.

The tracking project’s data is the most complete tally of
hospitalizations available and relies largely on figures reported by
state and local health officials. Still, there are gaps in available
information. Florida [began reporting daily hospitalization numbers only
this
month](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243899367.html),
and the tracking project’s website does not include hospitalization
figures for Hawaii and Kansas because it says those states do not
provide the data.

In some places with lots of seriously ill patients, the rise in
hospitalizations has tested the limits of local hospital systems. Some
of the most severely battered communities are in Texas, where more than
10,800 people were being treated in hospitals for the virus on
Wednesday, a record high for the state. The situation is most acute in
the Rio Grande Valley on the Texas-Mexico border, where more than a
third of families live in poverty.

“Our hospitals are maxed out. They are at 100 percent capacity,” said
Frank Torres, the emergency management coordinator for Willacy County.
He described paramedics and patients spending hours in ambulances before
they could enter hospitals. Inside, patients are left in the halls of
chaotic emergency departments, waiting for a bed.

“It’s just an overwhelming mess,” he said.

But in a sprawling state like Texas, the crisis is not always as
apparent as it was in densely packed New York City, where sirens were
frequently heard and [people emerged from windows and balconies each
night](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/10/nyregion/nyc-7pm-cheer-thank-you-coronavirus.html)
to support front-line workers, sending cheers all around the city.

In San Antonio, an official with Christus Health told reporters that its
hospital system was running out of space for morgues and was preparing
to store bodies in refrigerated trucks even as ordinary life is
proceeding in other parts of the city. One of the biggest movie theaters
in the area, the Palladium, remains open for discounted $5
showings.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with

The broadening crisis means that even hospitals in states without the
worst outbreaks are feeling the strain. In Oklahoma, hospitalizations
have been on the rise since mid-June, and about 80 to 90 percent of
hospital beds have been filled in recent days. Even so, its situation
seemed enviable compared with neighboring Texas.

“Houston hospitals are calling Oklahoma hospitals trying to place their
sick patients,” said Dr. George Monks, president of the Oklahoma State
Medical Association. Summers are typically a slower season for
hospitals, Dr. Monks said, which has left him worried about the
well-being of health care workers and the long months ahead.

“There is just no pool of doctors and nurses available that we can hire
to come in and help,” he said. “You can’t hire them from Texas. They’ve
got their hands full.”

Aubree Gordon, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University
of Michigan, said the rise in cases and hospitalizations appeared to
reflect people returning to pre-pandemic behaviors, such as going to
bars or gathering with friends. The number of hospitalizations, she
said, was sure to rise further, and she said some political leaders
seemed wary of imposing restrictions again.

“Those locations are more hesitant than before to shut down because they
feel like they shut down before and it didn’t prevent them from having
the big outbreak,” Dr. Gordon said.

In and around Miami, so many patients have packed hospitals that daily
reports routinely show wards at over 100 percent capacity — a sign the
facilities have filled their regular beds and are operating with
additional beds set up solely to accommodate the
surge.

“I always worry about having a scenario like we saw in New York where
the hospital system is overwhelmed,” said Dr. Yvonne Johnson, the chief
medical officer at South Miami Hospital. “Right now, we are handling
things.”

At Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, some coronavirus patients are
being treated in a large, air-conditioned tent in the hospital parking
lot until a room opens up, said Dr. Lilly Lee, the hospital’s director
of emergency medicine. She said that the hospital had treated a wave of
younger patients in June, but that more older people are now coming in
with the virus.

“Over the past week, we’ve noticed that the patients are more 60, 70,”
she said. “That was our concern initially: That some of these younger
people out there would cause illness in the older and more vulnerable
population.”
