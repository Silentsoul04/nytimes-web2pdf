\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd.html}{Derek
Chauvin}, the former Minneapolis police officer accused of killing
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/george-floyd-who-is.html}{George
Floyd}, was charged with multiple tax-related felonies, prosecutors
announced on Wednesday.

Mr. Chauvin and his wife, Kellie Chauvin, failed to file income tax
returns and pay Minnesota income taxes, and underreported and underpaid
income taxes,
\href{https://www.co.washington.mn.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3065}{according
to Washington County prosecutors}. The investigation into six years of
tax filings, prosecutors said, also showed that the Chauvins did not pay
the proper amount of sales tax on a vehicle.

The charges against Mr. Chauvin and Ms. Chauvin, who filed for divorce
days after Mr. Floyd's death on May 25, come after an investigation by
the Minnesota Department of Revenue and the Oakdale Police Department.

``Whether you are a prosecutor or police officer, or you are doctor or a
realtor, no one is above the law,'' the county's chief prosecutor, Pete
Orput, said in a statement.

Mr. Chauvin, 44, was previously charged with second-degree murder and
second-degree manslaughter after he held his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck
for more than eight minutes during an arrest. The deadly encounter with
Mr. Floyd, which bystanders captured on video, led to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles}{weeks
of nationwide protests} demanding police reform.

During his 19-year tenure as a police officer, Mr. Chauvin was the
subject of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/us/george-floyd-police-records-chauvin.html}{at
least 16 misconduct complaints}. He was fired along with three other
officers charged with aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyd's death, and is
awaiting trial in a Minnesota state prison.

A defense lawyer representing Mr. Chauvin could not immediately be
reached for comment about the tax evasion charges. It was unclear
whether Ms. Chauvin had a lawyer in the case.

A tax investigation into the Chauvins began last month, according to the
prosecutors, who say that the Chauvins filed fraudulent tax returns from
2014 through 2019, and that they failed to timely file state income tax
returns from 2016 through 2019.

The complaint claims that Mr. and Ms. Chauvin were aware of their failed
tax obligations because revenue officials had reached out to them
multiple times last year about a missing 2016 tax return.
