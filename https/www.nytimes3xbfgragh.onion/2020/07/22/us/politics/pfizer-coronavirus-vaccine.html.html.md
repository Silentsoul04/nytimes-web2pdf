WASHINGTON — As nations around the world race to lock up [coronavirus
vaccines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html)
even before they are ready, the Trump administration on Wednesday made
one of the largest investments yet, announcing a nearly $2 billion
contract with
[Pfizer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html)
and a German biotechnology company for 100 million doses by December.

The contract is part of what the White House calls the Warp Speed
project, an effort to drastically shorten the time it would take to
manufacture and distribute a working
[vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/upshot/vaccine-coronavirus-government-purchase.html).
So far, the United States has put money into more than a half dozen
efforts, hoping to build manufacturing ability for an eventual
breakthrough.

Europe has a parallel effort underway. Germany recently took a 23
percent stake in a German firm, CureVac, that [President Trump once
tried to
lure](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/world/europe/cornonavirus-vaccine-us-germany.html)
to American shores in hopes that its vaccine, if successful, would be
distributed in the United States first. A [European-led fund-raising
effort in
May](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/world/europe/eu-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
brought $8 billion in pledges from the world’s governments,
philanthropists and leaders for coronavirus vaccine research, even with
the United States sitting out the conference.

China, meantime, has militarized the effort: Researchers associated with
the Academy of Military Medical Sciences have developed one of China’s
leading vaccine candidates, and another Chinese firm, Sinopharm Group,
announced in June that it was beginning Phase 3 trials in the United
Arab Emirates.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Pfizer contract, an agreement to ensure the pharmaceutical giant has
a market for its work, is the biggest splash yet by the Americans. No
vaccine has yet been developed, and it is not clear whether the Pfizer
version will work. But if the vaccine being produced by Pfizer and
BioNTech, the German firm, proves to be safe and effective in clinical
trials, the companies say they could manufacture those first 100 million
doses by the end of the year.

Under [the
arrangement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200722005438/en/Pfizer-BioNTech-Announce-Agreement-U.S.-Government-600),
the federal government would obtain that first batch for $1.95 billion,
or about $20 a dose, with the rights to acquire up to 500 million more,
or 600 million total. Americans would receive the vaccine for free.
Before it could be distributed, it would need emergency approval by the
Food and Drug Administration. But the U.S. government does not pay the
nearly $2 billion until the drug is approved and the first 100 million
doses are delivered.

Pfizer said that large-scale safety and efficacy trials were to begin
this month, with regulatory review set for as early as October, although
nothing was guaranteed.

“Depending on success in clinical trials, today’s agreement will enable
the delivery of approximately 100 million doses of vaccine being
developed by Pfizer and BioNTech,” Alex M. Azar II, the health
secretary, said in a statement announcing the deal.

On Monday, Pfizer and
[AstraZeneca](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/health/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca.html),
a British-Swedish drug company developing a potential
[vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/06/09/magazine/covid-vaccine.html)
with Oxford University, [released
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/world/covid-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
suggesting that their vaccines could stimulate strong immune responses
with only minor side effects.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But unlike AstraZeneca, which has also obtained funding from the U.S.
government, Pfizer did not receive a contract for its earlier research
and development efforts — only for the doses and their
distribution.

By refusing funding up until now, Pfizer was able to avoid drawn-out
contractual negotiations and get its vaccine to trials, company
officials say.

“We didn’t accept the federal government funding solely for the reason
that we wanted to be able to move as quickly as possible with our
vaccine candidate into the clinic,” John Young, Pfizer’s chief business
officer, said on Tuesday at [a congressional
hearing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/health/covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-moderna-pfizer.html)
with executives from five vaccine manufacturers.

Pfizer and BioNTech are developing a
[vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline.html)
candidate that uses genetic material from the virus, [known as messenger
RNA](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/health/pfizer-vaccine-coronavirus.html),
to stimulate the immune system without making the recipient sick. The
technology can create a vaccine quickly, but has not yet produced one
that has been approved and
marketed.

[Moderna](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html),
a Massachusetts biotech company, received $483 million from the U.S.
government for its vaccine development and is also using mRNA
technology. By putting the might of an industry giant behind it, Pfizer
is making the technology mainstream.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The lack of a track record has prompted some skepticism about this
approach, but Dr. Kathrin Jansen, a senior vice president and the head
of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, dismissed the criticism.

“That’s not a scientific mind-set — that just because it’s new, it will
fail,” she said in an interview.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Earlier in her career, Dr. Jansen worked for Merck, where she led its
development of a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, which is caused by
a virus. The vaccine, Gardasil, has been successful. It, too, used a
technology that was new at the time and faced considerable skepticism.

Dr. Jansen said Pfizer had placed its bet on messenger RNA not just
because the technology could produce a vaccine quickly, but also because
its review of previous work by BioNTech on experimental cancer vaccines
suggested the approach could cause a powerful immune response. Before
the coronavirus pandemic, the two companies had been collaborating on
flu vaccines.

Vaccines using mRNA consist of genetic material from part of the virus,
encased in tiny particles made of fat that help it get into human cells.
The messenger RNA then prompts the cells to churn out a tiny piece of
the virus, causing the immune system to attack the real virus if the
person is exposed. In essence, the patient’s cells become factories for
a harmless fragment of the virus.

These vaccines set off several different kinds of immune responses, Dr.
Jansen said, which is important because scientists do not know yet which
type will be most potent against the coronavirus.

Dr. Jansen described making such a vaccine as a clean, fast process that
required a relatively small footprint to produce many
doses.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

She added that it “has the potential to be fast to produce a product
that is very well defined and very pure.”

Several other companies are also making such vaccines, and each has its
own formulation of the genetic material and types of fat used to encase
it.

The large vaccine studies set to begin this month will each include
30,000 people, with some getting placebo shots. The [Food and Drug
Administration has
said](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/development-and-licensure-vaccines-prevent-covid-19)
that to be considered effective, a coronavirus vaccine should protect 50
percent of the people who receive it.

Companies hope to show proof of effectiveness by the fall, but that will
depend on enrolling enough volunteers in areas where the infection rate
is high enough to see a significant difference between the vaccinated
people and the placebo group.

“We think we will see the end points, given that the infection rates are
going up, up, up,” Dr. Jansen said. “If the stars are aligned, it could
be next fall. But everything has to be right.”

Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at
the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said that
Pfizer, unlike some smaller pharmaceutical companies that the government
had contracted with, did not need research money because it was likely
to have the infrastructure and early data it needed to speed its vaccine
to trials without federal assistance.

“Pfizer is a company that has a lot of expertise in making vaccines,” he
said. “They knew that any negotiation with the government could have
delayed the start” of trials, which he said the company knew how to set
up rapidly.

He added that the $1.95 billion agreement was a way to guarantee a
market for the vaccine at the end of production, since prominent
drugmakers have historically been hesitant to spend on infectious
disease outbreaks.

“Advance purchase agreements have been one way we’ve been able to
acquire vaccines and countermeasures against certain threats that
pharmaceutical companies have traditionally stayed away from,” he said.

The agreement with Pfizer, which the company and the Department of
Health and Human Services announced Wednesday morning, is the largest
one yet for Operation Warp Speed. The federal government announced this
month that it would pay the Maryland-based company
[Novavax](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html)
$1.6 billion to expedite the development of a [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html).

“We’ve been committed to making the impossible possible by working
tirelessly to develop and produce in record time a safe and effective
vaccine to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” Dr. Albert
Bourla, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a news
release.
