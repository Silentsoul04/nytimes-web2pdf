Tensions between [China and the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/world/asia/us-china-consulate.html)
have reached the most acute levels since the countries normalized
diplomatic relations more than four decades ago, with the American
government’s ordering that China [close its Houston
consulate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
being just the latest example.

In defense, trade, technology, human rights and other categories,
actions and reprisals by one side or the other have escalated sharply
under President Trump’s administration, despite his repeated expressions
of admiration for President Xi Jinping of China.

The administration is even weighing a [blanket
ban](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/politics/china-travel-ban.html?searchResultPosition=3)
on travel to the United States by the 92 million members of China’s
ruling Communist Party and the possible expulsion of any members
currently in the country, an action that would likely invite retaliation
against American travel and residency in China.

“I think we’re in a dangerous and precipitous spiral downward, not
without cause, but without the proper diplomatic skills to arrest it,”
said [Orville Schell](https://asiasociety.org/orville-schell), director
of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. The severity
of the confrontation, he said, “has jumped the wall from specific and
solvable challenges to a clash of systems and values.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Craig Allen](https://www.uschina.org/craig-allen), president of the
U.S.-China Business Council, said he was alarmed by the increasing
invective from two superpowers that together represent 40 percent of
global economic output. “If we are yelling at each other and slamming
doors, then the world is a very unstable place, and businesses are not
able to plan,” he said.

Here is a look at what has happened in the past few years to exacerbate
the tensions:

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump and his subordinates have blamed China for spreading the
coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan
late last year. They have repeatedly described the virus in racist and
stigmatizing terms, calling it the Wuhan virus, China virus and Kung
Flu.

On July 4, Mr. Trump said China “[must be held fully
accountable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDZtbUpK6zM).” The
administration also has defunded and [ordered a severing of
ties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-who.html?searchResultPosition=2)
with the World Health Organization, accusing it of having abetted
shortcomings in China’s initial response to the outbreak. On Tuesday,
the Justice Department [accused Chinese
hackers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/politics/china-hacking-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
of attempting to steal information about American research on a virus
vaccine.

For its part, China has rejected the administration’s attacks over the
virus and has criticized the poor American government response to the
outbreak. Chinese propagandists also have promoted the countertheory,
with no evidence, [that American soldiers may have been the original
source of the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html)
during a visit to Wuhan last October.

## A severe test on trade ties

Mr. Trump won office in 2016 partly on his accusations that China was
exploiting the country’s trade relationship with the United States by
selling the country far more than it purchased. In office, he decreed a
series of punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, and China retaliated, in a
trade war that has now lasted more than two years. While a truce was
effectively declared in January with the [signing of what the
administration called a ‘Phase 1’ trade
deal](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf),
most tariffs were not
eased.

The Trump administration has increasingly challenged China’s assertions
of sovereignty and control over much of the South China Sea, including
vital maritime shipping lanes. Just last week, Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo, who has described China as a major security threat, decreed that
most of China’s claims in the South China Sea are “[completely
unlawful](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/world/asia/south-china-sea-pompeo.html?searchResultPosition=2),”
setting up potential military confrontations between Chinese and U.S.
naval forces in the Pacific.

## A widening battle over technology

China has long been accused by successive U.S. administrations of
stealing American technology. The Trump White House has escalated the
accusations further by seeking an international blacklisting of Huawei,
China’s largest technology company, calling it a front for China’s
efforts to infiltrate the telecommunications infrastructure of other
nations for strategic advantage.

The company’s chief financial officer, [Meng
Wanzhou](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/world/canada/huawei-extradition-meng-wanzhou.html?searchResultPosition=2),
has been detained in Canada since December 2018 on an extradition
warrant to the United States on fraud charges. Last week Britain
declared it was siding with the United States in[barring Huawei products
from its high-speed wireless
network.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html?searchResultPosition=1)

by ordering the expulsions of journalists from The New York Times, The
Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, and took other steps that
suggested further impediments to American press access in China were
looming. The New York Times, concerned about the possibility of further
limitations on journalists working in China, [announced last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/business/media/new-york-times-hong-kong.html?searchResultPosition=1)

## Expulsions of students

The Trump administration has taken steps to cancel the visas of
thousands of [Chinese graduate

and researchers in the United States who have direct ties to

American officials knowledgeable about the
planning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/us/politics/china-hong-kong-trump-student-visas.html).
Such expulsions portend possible further educational restrictions, and
the Chinese government could retaliate by imposing its own visa bans on
Americans.

Last November, Mr. Trump, with bipartisan support, [signed
legislation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/27/us/politics/trump-hong-kong.html?searchResultPosition=1)
that could penalize Chinese and Hong Kong officials who suppress dissent
by democracy advocates in Hong Kong, the former British colony and Asian
financial center that was guaranteed some measure of autonomy by China.

In May Mr. Trump said he was [taking steps to end Hong Kong’s
preferential trading

with the United States after China passed [a sweeping new security
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/05/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law.html)
that could be used to stifle any form of expression deemed seditious by
China. The Chinese authorities have denounced the measures and vowed to
retaliate.

## Repression of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang

This month the Trump administration [imposed
sanctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/world/asia/trump-china-sanctions-uighurs.html?searchResultPosition=1)
on a number of Chinese officials, including a senior member of the

abuses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/10/world/asia/china-xinjiang-rights.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer)
by China in the Xinjiang region against the country’s largely Muslim
Uighur minority.

Beijing promised retaliation against American institutions and
individuals it deemed guilty of “egregious” conduct in issues concerning
Xinjiang, a vast Western expanse in China where the authorities have
placed a million people in [labor
camps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/16/world/asia/xinjiang-china-forced-labor-camps-uighurs.html)

For the Chinese government, American actions taken in the name of
defending people living anywhere in China constitute blatant
interference in its internal politics — a grievance with deep-seated
roots going back to its struggles with imperialist powers in the 19th
century.

In May the Trump administration [approved a $180 million arms
sale](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/21/politics/us-taiwan-arms-sale/index.html)
to Taiwan, part of a [far bigger arms
deal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/06/us/politics/trump-taiwan-arms-sale.html?searchResultPosition=1)
that has angered the Chinese authorities, who regard the self-governing
island as part of China. Another longstanding source of Chinese anger is
the American deference to the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader-in-exile
of Tibet, the former Himalayan kingdom in China’s far west.

In 2018 Mr. Trump [signed a
bill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/21/world/asia/trump-china-tibet.html?searchResultPosition=4)
that penalizes Chinese officials who restrict American officials,
journalists and other citizens from going freely to Tibetan areas. Last
November the State Department’s ambassador at large for international
religious freedom, Samuel D. Brownback, [warned that only Tibetans could
choose the successor to the Dalai
Lama](https://www.state.gov/ambassador-at-large-for-international-religious-freedom-samuel-brownback/),
who turned 85 this month, setting up a new clash with Beijing, which
contends it will choose his successor.
