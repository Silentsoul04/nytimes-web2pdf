WASHINGTON — The United States has abruptly ordered China to close its
consulate in Houston, accusing diplomats of aiding economic espionage
and the attempted theft of scientific research as the Trump
administration [sharply
escalates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-us-china.html)
its [moves against
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/world/asia/us-china-consulate.html).

China vowed to retaliate, calling the action illegal. Hours after the
administration issued its order on Tuesday, consulate employees [burned
papers in open metal
barrels](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/hfd-responds-reports-burning-classified-documents-chinese-consulate/285-33117055-f7c1-4626-b4b5-ae8c252401d5)
in a courtyard of the Houston building, prompting police officers and
firefighters to rush to the area.

The move comes as President Trump’s campaign strategists, anxious about
[his failures on the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html),
are pushing a comprehensive anti-China message in an appeal to Mr.
Trump’s supporters.

It was unclear what had immediately prompted the crackdown on the
consulate, which must close by Friday, although the State Department
said China was directing “massive illegal spying and influence
operations.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

David R. Stilwell, who oversees policy for East Asia and the Pacific at
the State Department, said in an interview that the Houston consulate
had a history of engaging in “subversive behavior” and was the epicenter
of research theft in the United States. He gave few details to support
that assertion, though other American officials released a document with
more information on Wednesday night.

He cited one example: He said the consul general, Cai Wei, the top
Chinese official there, and two other diplomats were caught using false
identification to escort Chinese travelers on May 31 to the gate area of
a charter flight from George Bush Intercontinental Airport.

Mr. Stilwell said that some of China’s [attempted scientific
thefts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/04/health/china-nih-scientists.html)
in the United States had accelerated over the last six months, and could
be related to efforts to develop a
[vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
for the coronavirus, although he presented no evidence.

A seven-page document compiled by American law enforcement officials and
obtained by The New York Times broadly outlined several F.B.I.
investigations linked to the Houston consulate. Those included attempts
to illegally transfer medical research and other sensitive information
from institutions in the area; talent recruitment plans to persuade more
than 50 researchers, professors and academics in the area to turn over
tightly held research or information to Chinese institutions; and the
coercion of Chinese citizens in the United States whom the Chinese
government has deemed as wanted fugitives to return to their homeland.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been a leader in aggressively
pushing hard-line policies on China, said Wednesday at a news conference
in Copenhagen that the Trump administration was “setting out clear
expectations as to how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave.”
He warned that the United States would “take actions” to protect its
interests.

Mr. Trump said during a news conference on Wednesday evening that “it’s
always possible” his administration would close more Chinese missions.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement, “The U.S.
accusations are groundless fabrications.” In Beijing, a spokesman for
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the United States to
immediately reverse the decision.

“Otherwise China will certainly make legitimate and necessary
reactions,” said the spokesman, Wang Wenbin. His remarks suggested
that China would, at a minimum, close an American consulate in China.

The consulate in Houston has about 60 employees. There are six other
Chinese diplomatic missions in the United States: the embassy in
Washington, an office at the United Nations and consulates in New York,
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.

The F.B.I. has issued an arrest warrant for a Chinese student or
researcher, Tang Juan, who sought refuge in the San Francisco consulate
after American investigators discovered she had not disclosed her
affiliation with the Chinese military and executed a search warrant to
seize her electronic devices, according to the seven-page document.
Chinese diplomats across the United States have helped military officers
hide their identities, said John C. Demers, the assistant attorney
general for national security. (Axios [first
reported](https://www.axios.com/san-francisco-consulate-harboring-chinese-military-researcher-fbi-17325706-7983-4b17-aa6f-f19a450b646b.html)
on Ms. Tang on Wednesday.)

The closing of the consulate in Houston may be less detrimental to the
United States’ relations with Beijing than shutting down a different one
would be. It is the “sister” diplomatic mission to the American
consulate in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak
first emerged. The State Department evacuated its consulate in Wuhan
after the initial outbreak; it is not clear when it might fully reopen.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Wang called the move illegal under international law, and described
it as the latest in a series of aggressions.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

“For some time, the United States government has been shifting the blame
to China with stigmatization and unwarranted attacks against China’s
social system, harassing Chinese diplomatic and consular staff in
America, intimidating and interrogating Chinese students and
confiscating their personal electrical devices, even detaining them
without cause,” he said.

[Cheng Xiaohe](https://carnegietsinghua.org/experts/1536), an associate
professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in
Beijing, said the United States had never taken such a step against
China since the two countries established diplomatic relations on Jan.
1, 1979.

“If the relationship between China and the United States continues to
deteriorate unchecked,” he said in a telephone interview in Beijing,
“the next result will be the severing of diplomatic relations.”

The Trump administration’s decision was a significant escalation of its
effort to tighten the reins on Chinese diplomats, researchers, scholars,
journalists and others in the United States.

It comes during rising tensions that have been inflamed by the pandemic
and Beijing’s repressive moves in Hong Kong, and that now touch on
virtually all aspects of the relationship, even though Mr. Trump himself
has [vacillated
wildly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/politics/trump-china-bolton.html)
on China. He has regularly praised Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, and
pleaded with Mr. Xi for help with re-election, while failing to
denounce, and at some points explicitly endorsing, China’s repression in
Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region.

The administration’s restrictions have included issuing [travel
rules](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/16/world/asia/china-state-department-diplomats.html)
for diplomats and requiring several Chinese state news organizations to
register as diplomatic entities while limiting their visas. The
administration is also considering [a travel
ban](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/politics/china-travel-ban.html)
on members of the Communist Party and their families. Such a move, if
enacted, could affect an estimated 270 million people, and it has been
widely criticized as too sweeping to be practical.

to Chinese military institutions. Some officials estimated that would
result in the expulsion of thousands of Chinese citizens from the United

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said [in a speech this
month](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states)
that the agency was opening a new China-related counterintelligence
investigation every 10 hours. Of the examples he cited, four involved
researchers in states under the jurisdiction of the Houston consulate.

On Monday, the Justice Department announced visa fraud charges against
Song Chen, a visiting Stanford University researcher accused of
concealing her active membership in the Chinese military. In January,
[the F.B.I. announced it was
seeking](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/yanqing-ye) a
Boston University student, Yanqing Ye, who had hidden her affiliation
with the People’s Liberation Army when applying for a visa. American
officials believe Ms. Ye is in China.

In December, the U.S. authorities arrested a Chinese cancer-cell
researcher, Zaosong Zheng, at Boston Logan International Airport and
[charged him with trying to
smuggle](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/harvard-university-professor-and-two-chinese-nationals-charged-three-separate-china)
21 vials of stolen biological research back to China.

In April 2019, officials at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston [said they were investigating several
scientists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/22/health/md-anderson-chinese-scientists.html)
for improper disclosures. The officials did not identify the scientists,
two of whom had resigned. But redacted investigative reports referred to
ties to China or Chinese residents or institutions.

And on Tuesday, the Justice Department said it had [indicted two Chinese
hackers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/politics/china-hacking-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
accused of trying to steal information about coronavirus vaccine
research.

There have been other clashes over suspected espionage by employees at
Chinese missions. In September, the State Department [secretly
expelled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/15/world/asia/us-china-spies.html)
two employees of the Chinese Embassy in Washington who were accused of
driving with their wives onto a sensitive military base in Virginia.
That was believed to be the first such expulsions in more than three
decades. Beijing [demanded a
reversal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/16/world/asia/china-spies-explusion-military-base.html)
of the action.

Some former officials voiced skepticism over the Trump administration’s
latest move.

Daniel Russel, who served in Mr. Stilwell’s job during the Obama
administration, said closing the Houston consulate “further reduces the
few remaining diplomatic channels between the two sides and is a step
that will prove difficult to reverse.”

“The China accusation that this move has more to do with presidential
politics than with intellectual property is hard to argue with,” said
Mr. Russel, now a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

In 2017, the Trump administration ordered Russia to close its consulate
in San Francisco, along with two annexes near New York and Washington,
in retaliation for Russian restrictions on the number of American
diplomats in Moscow. Those moves stemmed from the furor over Russia’s
interference in the 2016 presidential election, the fallout from which
is still felt, despite Mr. Trump’s outreach to the Russian president,
Vladimir V. Putin.

The effect of the Houston closure on relations — and travel — would in
the short term be minimal compared with the diplomatic furor it has
already incited. Consulates mainly process visas for travelers visiting
China; the one in Houston handled those for southern American states,
like Texas and Florida. Travel between the two countries has been
severely limited in any case because of the pandemic.

“The consulate was not chosen at random, once the decision was made to
try to take action to disrupt more strongly both political influence
activities by the government of China and theft of intellectual
property,” Mr. Demers
said.

The State Department [began evacuating its American
staff](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/us/coronavirus-flights-wuhan.html)
from the Wuhan consulate in late January during the coronavirus outbreak
there — a move that China at the time criticized as stoking panic. It
has also significantly reduced operations at the embassy in Beijing and
its other consulates, with many diplomats returning to the United
States.

In recent weeks, the department has begun to slowly return diplomats and
their families — only to face rigorous health screening and quarantine
rules that the Americans had complained were onerous and even in
violation of the Vienna Conventions on diplomatic and consular
relations. The Houston consulate closure could add another obstacle to
efforts by the American diplomats to return.
