Video
App}\label{tiktoks-parent-said-to-weigh-selling-a-majority-stake-in-the-video-app}}

The move would reduce ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance, amid
escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.

ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is weighing its ownership
options for the popular video app after the Trump administration
threatened to ban the app from the United States this month, according
to people briefed on the discussions.

One path that ByteDance, a privately held company in China, is
discussing with its biggest backers is a potential deal that would
essentially carve out the app, said the people, who were not authorized
to speak publicly. Under that plan, TikTok would receive new investments
from existing ByteDance investors --- including the investment firms
Sequoia and General Atlantic --- with the Chinese company retaining a
minority holding, these people said.

ByteDance has raised billions in funding and is valued at \$100 billion,
according to the research firm PitchBook. Its other investors include
Tiger Global Management, KKR, NEA, SoftBank's Vision Fund, GGV Capital
and Hony Capital.

The talks, which were reported earlier by
\href{https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bytedance-investors-discuss-tiktok-purchase}{The
Information}, are at a preliminary stage, these people cautioned, and no
option has been decided.

A spokesman for TikTok declined to comment on the details of any deal
discussions. In recent weeks, ``there have been numerous suggestions
made by external people not involved in the company's internal
discussions,'' the spokesman said.

It is unclear whether the Trump administration would consider such a
plan enough to defuse what it views as the national security risks of
ByteDance's ownership.

For now, ByteDance faces pressure on multiple fronts in the United
States, caught in an
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-cold-war.html}{intensifying
cold war} as Mr. Trump blames Beijing for the spread of the coronavirus,
for fights over control of the South China Sea and for reciprocal bans
of journalists in each country.

ByteDance now stands alongside Huawei, the telecommunications giant, as
a major target of the Trump administration's campaign against Chinese
tech companies on national security grounds.

Last year, the federal panel that reviews transactions for national
security
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/technology/tiktok-national-security-review.html}{began
examining} ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, the American app
that became TikTok. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and
other lawmakers had expressed concerns over potential censorship within
the app, as well as any sharing of TikTok user data with the Chinese
government.

The panel could ultimately order ByteDance to divest Musical.ly's
American assets, or at least change how it transfers and stores data
around the world.

In February, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, criticized
what he called a ``pattern of secrecy'' around ties between China and
TikTok and Apple. This month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the
administration was considering
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/07/mike-pompeo-tiktok-ban-350384}{banning
Chinese social media apps} on national security grounds.

In response, TikTok announced that it would evaluate changes to its
corporate structure.

Criticism of TikTok's Chinese ownership is a bipartisan issue: A
\href{https://thehill.com/policy/technology/508412-house-approved-defense-bill-would-ban-tiktok-from-government-devices}{defense
spending bill} approved by the Democratic-controlled House this week
includes a provision that would ban use of the video app on government
devices.

This month, Amazon told its employees to delete TikTok from their
phones, citing security concerns, but
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/technology/tiktok-amazon-security-risk.html}{backtracked
hours later}. Other companies, including Wells Fargo, went through with
the bans. Branches of the U.S. military have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/04/us/tiktok-pentagon-military-ban.html}{barred}
personnel from using the app.

The United States is not the only country to express reservations about
TikTok.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html}{India
banned the app} and dozens of other Chinese services last month over
national security concerns.

ByteDance has rejected claims that it is a national security risk,
saying TikTok is run separately from its Chinese operations and pointing
out that the app is unavailable in China. In recent weeks, the app has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/technology/tiktok-washington-lobbyist.html}{enlisted
a bevy of lobbyists} to press its case in the halls of Congress, though
its executives have declined to testify before lawmakers.

ByteDance also hired Kevin Mayer, a respected American senior executive
at the Walt Disney Company, as TikTok's chief executive this year. Peter
Navarro, a senior White House trade official, has since called Mr. Mayer
\href{https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/trump-advisor-navarro-calls-tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-an-american-puppet.html}{an
``American puppet''} for ByteDance.

Despite the concerns, TikTok has only grown, fueled by young people and
the boredom of those quarantined at home during the coronavirus
pandemic. The app has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/business/media/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer.html}{downloaded}
1.9 billion times --- 172 million times in the United States ---
according to SensorTower.
