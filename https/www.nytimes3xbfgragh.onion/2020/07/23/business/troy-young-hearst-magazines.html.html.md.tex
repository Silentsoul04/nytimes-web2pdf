\emph{{[}Update:}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/business/media/hearst-troy-young-replacement-president.html}{\emph{Debi
Chirichella is named Interim Head at Hearst}}\emph{.{]}}

The president of Hearst's magazine division resigned Thursday, one day
after The New York Times
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/business/media/hearst-harassment-troy-young.html}{reported
on his history of lewd}, sexist remarks in the workplace.

The executive, Troy Young, was elevated to lead the magazine division in
2018 as the face of digital transformation, even though at least four
employees had complained about what they viewed as bullying and
harassing conduct to the human resources department or senior
executives, according to four former Hearst employees, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation.

The
Times\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/business/media/hearst-harassment-troy-young.html}{reported
Wednesday} that Mr. Young had made suggestive comments about sex toys,
emailed pornography to a senior editor and made explicit remarks to a
junior employee.

On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Young, 52, sent an email to staff apologizing
for his behavior but characterizing The Times's report as a
misrepresentation of ``the culture that we have built at Hearst
Magazines.'' He said he was ``deeply reflective on what I can learn from
this moment'' and was ``committed to the work I need to do here.''

``I recognize that the incidents cited in the NYT article are
particularly offensive to women and I want to make clear they do not
represent who I am as a person nor do they reflect some of the most
important relationships in my life,'' he wrote in the email.

Five hours later, Hearst's chief executive, Steven R. Swartz,
\href{https://www.hearst.com/-/a-message-from-steve-swartz-2}{emailed
staff} to say he and Mr. Young had agreed it was in ``the best interest
of all of us'' that Mr. Young resign, effective immediately.

``I honestly never thought this day would happen and I have tears of
relief and shock streaming down my face,'' Abby Gardner, a former
digital director for Cosmopolitan,
\href{https://twitter.com/abbygardner/status/1286426583729942531?s=21}{posted
on Twitter}.

In the Times article, Michelle Ruiz, a former senior editor at
Cosmopolitan, described an encounter with Mr. Young that took place
before he was promoted and when she was heavily pregnant. ``So, is the
baby mine?'' he said, as she recalled it.

``For an executive at the company to suggest that he'd impregnated me
was clearly inappropriate,'' said Ms. Ruiz, now a contributing editor at
Vogue.com. ``There's a real hypocrisy to elevating this man to lead a
company populated with magazines that are preaching women's empowerment
on their covers.''

Current and former Hearst Magazines staff members also described a
culture of discrimination that has long been ignored.

Prachi Gupta, who covered politics for the Cosmopolitan site during the
2016 presidential campaign, said she felt that Black and brown women
were made to ``feel less than equal'' at the company.

``Because there were no women of color in leadership positions, I was
not able to seek advice or counsel when I was pushed into some of the
uncomfortable positions,'' she told The Times.

In a June 6
\href{https://twitter.com/prachigu/status/1269362844522426371?s=20}{Twitter
post}, Ms. Gupta, who is Indian-American, wrote: ``From the get-go, I
was tokenized. A white P.R. person at Hearst told me that it would be
easy to book me for media appearances because my look was `very on
trend,' and it was clear she meant that I wasn't white.''

''I'm glad to hear that Mr. Young is stepping down,'' Ms. Gupta said on
Thursday. ``If the company is interested in fostering a better culture,
this should be a starting point that includes many other structural
changes throughout the organization.''
