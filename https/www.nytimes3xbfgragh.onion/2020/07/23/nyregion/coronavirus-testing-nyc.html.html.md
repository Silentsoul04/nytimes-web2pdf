<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nearly four months after the pandemic’s peak, New York City is facing
such serious delays in returning [coronavirus
test](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/15/us/coronavirus-testing-decrease.html)
results that public health experts are warning that the problems could
hinder efforts to reopen the local economy and schools.

Despite repeated pledges from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de
Blasio that testing would be both widely accessible and effective,
thousands of New Yorkers have had to wait a week or more for results,
and at some clinics the median wait time is nine days. One prominent
local official has even proposed the drastic step of limiting testing.

The delays in New York City are caused in part by the outbreak’s spike
in states like California, Florida and Texas, which has strained
laboratories across the country and touched off a renewed national
testing crisis.

But officials have also been unable to adequately expand the capacity of
state and city government laboratories in New York to [test
rapidly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html)
at a time when they are asking more New Yorkers to get tested to guard
against a second wave.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The delays limit the ability of public health officials to quickly
identify — and isolate — people who are infected while also diminishing
the usefulness of [New York City’s contact-tracing
program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/nyregion/nyc-contact-tracing.html).
They also can lead to growing blind spots that obscure the extent of the
virus’s spread, which could spell trouble as the city tries to reopen.

As a result, some public officials and laboratory executives say New
York’s strategy of allowing anyone and everyone who wants a test to get
one is unsustainable.

“I’m afraid that we have to prioritize people with symptoms, someone who
has been exposed, or someone whose work puts them in contact with a lot
of people,” said a city councilman, Mark Levine, a Manhattan Democrat
who heads the Council’s health committee. “That’s what I’m about to call
for, but I don’t think City Hall wants to.”

New York was once the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States,
[suffering more than 30,000
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html),
far more than any other state. But by shutting down in March and April,
it has significantly slowed the spread of the virus. The [Northeast has
emerged as the only
region](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/coronavirus-northeast-governors.html)
in the country to beat back the outbreak.

When the pandemic peaked in the city, testing was relatively scarce, and
prominent elected officials, from President Trump to Mr. Cuomo and Mr.
de Blasio, said they would ensure that in the future, there would be
more than enough.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As capacity expanded, New York City authorities began encouraging
[everyone to get tested, and urged
people](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/covid-19-testing-sites/)
to get tested repeatedly, setting a target of 50,000 tests per day.

In recent weeks, about[20,000
to 35,000](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page)
people are tested most weekdays, a demand that has put a strain on local
labs.

City public health officials said they were growing increasingly alarmed
by the delays, pointing out that widespread testing and quick turnaround
times were needed to reduce transmission by asymptomatic and
pre-symptomatic patients, [who are believed to play a major
part](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/27/world/europe/coronavirus-spread-asymptomatic.html)
in the virus’s spread.

“This is becoming a problem,” said Dr. Jay Varma, a City Hall adviser
who has a critical role in the city’s testing and contact-tracing
program. “Any lag in this process can make it more difficult to have
case and contact tracing be
effective.”

Still, Gareth Rhodes, an aide to Mr. Cuomo and a member of his virus
response team, said that there was a priority placed on tests for people
with Covid-19 symptoms and those who reported being exposed to someone
who is positive for the virus. He added that some labs could return such
tests in less than 24 hours.

But if someone has no symptoms and no known exposure, he said, “I’m less
concerned if the result comes back in five, six, seven days.”

Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that he was moving to address delays in
testing. He blamed the national surge in cases for the waits and said
labs were overwhelmed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Asked how delays were able to mount in New York City after the mayor
pledged to prioritize testing, Mr. de Blasio said the city had to “reset
the equation” after cases spiked across the country.

“I’ve been consistent — we want fast turnaround times and we want the
maximum number of people tested, and that has been working
overwhelmingly until we hit this glitch,” the mayor told reporters.

On Thursday, the governor defended the state’s performance, noting that
longer delays were being seen because some heavily used labs were
“getting overwhelmed” by demand for results from other states.

New York processes about 70 percent of its tests at a network of more
than 200 private labs, which the state has enlisted to process
specimens, Mr. Cuomo said. It was redirecting some samples to
underutilized facilities, he added, which resulted in average wait times
for results from those labs of 2.6 days.

But Mr. Cuomo conceded that some samples sent to busy national labs had
wait times that averaged six to 10 days, and sometimes even longer.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

And the governor said the problems could get even worse in the fall,
during flu season, when labs would be asked to process samples looking
for that infection. “The flu tests will eat at the capacity,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New York City is finding ways to lessen its reliance on commercial
laboratories, like Quest Diagnostics, where backlogs sometimes mean
waits of up to two weeks. The city’s Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene is vowing to expand its own capacity to conduct tests.

But the delays may get worse before they get better. The reasons are
complex, but are largely driven by a simple fact: Demand for coronavirus
tests has grown faster than laboratory capacity. And demand is likely to
increase with the start of the school year, particularly with some
universities requiring the tests for students.

“The pressure put on us by the higher-ed community, who wants every kid
to have a negative test to show up on campus, will soon put a strain on
the testing system,” said Scott J. Becker, the chief executive of the
Association of Public Health
Laboratories.

The current crisis carries some echoes of February and March, when
limited testing capacity and a disastrous
[series](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/cdc-coronavirus-lab-contamination-testing.html)
of
[missteps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html)
by the [federal
government](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/us/cdc-coronavirus.html)
meant relatively few sick New Yorkers were able to get tested. The virus
spread rapidly — and largely undetected.

The nation’s testing capacity has expanded significantly since then.
More than [750,000
tests](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/usa) are
administered across the nation on some days.

But even as laboratories try to increase capacity, some supplies are
getting more difficult to obtain. In particular, the cartridges that
have been critical for quick testing at many hospitals are growing
scarcer, said Dr. Dwayne Breining, who oversees laboratories at
Northwell Health, New York’s largest hospital system.

“There are effects in our area from what’s going on in the rest of the

appropriate.”

As of early July, results for about a quarter of coronavirus tests in
New York City were returned within 24 hours, Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman
for the mayor, said. But a quarter of tests took more than six days, she
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an

        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with

Some of the longest delays are at the dozens of CityMD walk-in clinics
that have blanketed the city in recent years. Thousands of New Yorkers
seek tests there each day.

CityMD sends many coronavirus tests to a Quest Diagnostics laboratory in
Teterboro, N.J., for processing. Quest Diagnostics has cited [a range of
factors](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates) for
why turnaround times have been doubling or tripling, including the
growing number of orders from employees returning to work and from
hospitals that have resumed elective surgeries, but need first to screen
patients.

“We’re not taking specimens from southern parts of the country and
moving those to the Teterboro, New Jersey, lab,” Wendy Bost, a
spokeswoman for Quest Diagnostics, said. “The Teterboro lab is dealing
with volume that is coming from the region.”

Across the nation, test results on average take [slightly more than two
days](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates) for
priority samples, Quest Diagnostics said. But for everyone else, the
wait times have been getting much longer — up two weeks in some
instances.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some other laboratories have managed to keep turnaround times shorter.
The city’s public hospital system, which runs a network of health
clinics and community testing sites, sends many samples to BioReference
Laboratories, which currently has a turnaround time of two to three days
for nonpriority samples, said Dr. Jon R. Cohen, executive chairman of
BioReference, one of the nation’s largest commercial laboratories.

BioReference is using a “pooling” technique, where if a batch tests
negative, all the samples are deemed negative. If it tests positive,
each sample must be individually tested.

For now, City Hall’s strategy for reducing turnaround times has been to
advertise free testing at city-run sites, where the waits tend to be
shorter, city officials
said.

The Health Department is also working on transforming nine clinics that
had been used to test and treat patients for sexually transmitted
diseases and tuberculosis into coronavirus testing sites. That would
expand the city’s public laboratory capacity considerably.

The health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, said these sites would be
able to process “a couple of thousand tests a day.”

Stories of long waits for results have become common among New Yorkers.

Lee Ziesche, 31, said she went to get a virus test on July 5 at a CityMD
location in her Brooklyn neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant, as a
precaution after her boyfriend’s roommate started feeling sick. She said
she got her results on July 20.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I wasn’t that worried about myself, but the reflection on how the
system is working was super concerning,” she said. “It makes it really
hard for us to return to normal when it takes two weeks for us to get
tests.”

Zach Honig, 34, who lives in the Financial District, said he was tested
on July 12 in anticipation of a trip to Maine and still had not gotten
his results.

“Honestly, I don’t even really see the point in getting tested,” he
said. “Even if I get a positive result, I imagine I wouldn’t even be
contagious anymore. It’s just not really practical.”

So far, the delays do not seem to have contributed to an uptick of
transmission, but a second wave of the outbreak looms.

“That seriously undermines the entire purpose of testing — both to
inform people they are contagious so they are quarantined and also to
trigger the contact tracing to find out who else may have been exposed,”
Mr. Levine, the councilman, said. “With a delay of seven days, you can
be pretty certain the virus will spread.”

Dr. Varma, the City Hall adviser, said it would be a mistake to restrict
testing to only the symptomatic. Despite the lag times, he said, it made
sense “to push through and stick with your strategy of expanding testing
as much as possible.”

Testing and contact tracing are tightly linked: After people with active
virus infections are discovered through testing, contact tracers
interview them about whom they in turn may have infected. Then contact
tracers try to get these contacts into quarantine before they become
contagious.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The longer test results take, the more likely contact tracers will
simply be tracking the spread of the virus from person to person, rather
than stopping it, said Charles King, an AIDS activist, and member of a
City Hall appointed group advising the contact-tracing program.

“Frankly, if you can’t get results within 24 hours,” Mr. King said, “you
do start losing the utility of the exercise.”

Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Troy Closson contributed reporting.
