\section{Samantha Hickey, Nurse With a Gift for Diagnosis, Dies at
45}\label{samantha-hickey-nurse-with-a-gift-for-diagnosis-dies-at-45}}

Ms. Hickey trained dozens of junior colleagues and exercised rare skills
as a diagnostician over more than 20 years as a nurse in southwestern
Idaho. She died of Covid-19.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Samantha Hickey, a nurse practitioner, once diagnosed a child's disease
in a single day after the child's family had fruitlessly sought answers
for roughly a year.

``The providers weren't really hearing what the family said,'' said
Crystal Belcourt, a former trainee of Ms. Hickey's at St. Luke's
Children's Pediatrics in Caldwell, Idaho, where Ms. Hickey worked. ``The
biggest thing that I learned from Sam is to listen.''

Ms. Belcourt said the case was an example of Ms. Hickey's ``Sherlock
Holmes'' approach --- teasing apart a complicated medical situation by
closely studying what she heard from patients and their families.
Sympathy for her patients, she added, powered Ms. Hickey's zest for
solving medical mysteries.

Ms. Hickey died on July 13 at St. Luke's Meridian Medical Center in
Meridian, Idaho. She was 45. Her husband, Robb Hickey, said the cause
was Covid-19.

Only two people under 50 have died of Covid-19 in Idaho, according to
\href{https://public.tableau.com/profile/idaho.division.of.public.health\#!/vizhome/DPHIdahoCOVID-19Dashboard_V2/Story1}{the
state's Department of Health and Welfare}.

During her more than 20 years as a nurse in southwest Idaho, Ms. Hickey
trained numerous other nurses and became a mentor to many, her husband
said.

``She was,'' he said, ``a tenacious mama bear.''

Samantha Ray Simonis was born on Oct. 5, 1974, in La Grande, Ore. Her
father, Ray, worked as an engineer with the Union Pacific Railroad, and
her mother, Linda Huddleston, worked in food services at the La Grande
Country Club.

Ms. Hickey graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Science degree in
nursing from Oregon Health \& Science University in Portland, and in
2009 she earned a Master of Science in nursing from Graceland University
in Independence, Mo.

She married Dusty Berg in 1994; they divorced in 2009, and she married
Mr. Hickey the next year. In addition to Mr. Hickey, she is survived by
two sons from her first marriage, Devan and Jackson Berg; a son, Reed,
and a daughter, Blakelee, from her second marriage; and two sisters,
Jamie Lester and Rachel Seaman.

After Ms. Hickey graduated from high school at 17, the Portland Trail
Blazers considered hiring her for their dance squad, but she was
disqualified after those in charge found out she was two years under the
minimum age requirement. She was later known to break out into tap-dance
routines at home, and she bought her children tap shoes so they could
join her.

She encouraged Mr. Hickey, who had worked for many years as a paramedic,
to attend medical school, which she had once dreamed of doing herself.
She supported the family financially while he studied. (He is entering
his third year.)

The region around Caldwell, where Ms. Hickey lived and worked, has
experienced a steadily growing spike in virus cases in recent weeks.
According to Mr. Hickey, his wife saw a patient who had tested positive
around a week before her death.

The family and the St. Luke's Health Foundation plan to create a
scholarship fund in Ms. Hickey's name to support nursing education.
Friends and relatives said they also hope that Ms. Hickey's good health
and young age draw attention to the seriousness of the virus and the
need to follow public health protocols.

``She would want her death to be something that others could learn
from,'' Ms. Belcourt said.
