Like other realms, American intellectual life has been marked by a
series of exclusions. The oldest and vastest was the exclusion of people
of color from the commanding institutions of our culture.

Today, there’s the exclusion of conservatives from academic life. Then
there’s the exclusion of working-class voices from mainstream media. Our
profession didn’t used to be all coastal yuppies, but now it mostly is.
Then there’s the marginalization of those with radical critiques — from
say, the Marxist left and the theological right.

Intellectual exclusion and segregation have been terrible for America,
poisoning both the right and the left.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Conservatives were told their voices didn’t matter, and many reacted in
a childish way that seemed to justify that exclusion. A corrosive spirit
of resentment and victimhood spread across the American right — an
intellectual inferiority complex combined with a moral superiority
complex.

For many on the right the purpose of thinking changed. Thinking was no
longer for understanding. Thinking was for belonging. Right-wing talk
radio is the endless repetition of familiar mantras to reassure
listeners that they are all on the same team. Thinking was for conquest:
Those liberals think they’re better than us, but we own the libs.

Thinking itself became suspect. Sarah Palin and Donald Trump
reintroduced anti-intellectualism into the American right: a distrust of
the media, expertise and facts. A president who dispenses with the pen
inevitably takes up the club.

Intellectual segregation has been bad for the left, too. It produced
insularity. Progressives are often blindsided by reality — blindsided
that Trump won the presidency; blindsided that Joe Biden clinched the
Democratic presidential nomination. The second consequence is fragility.
When you make politics the core of your religious identity, and you
shield yourself from heresy, then any glimpse of that heresy is going to
provoke an extreme emotional reaction. The third consequence is
conformity. Writers are now expected to write as a representative of a
group, in order to affirm the self-esteem of the group. Predictability
is the point.

In some ways the left has become even more conformist than the right.
The liberal New Republic has less viewpoint diversity than the
conservative National Review — a reversal of historical patterns.
Christopher Hitchens was one of the great essayists in America. He would
be unemployable today because there was no set of priors he wasn’t
willing to offend.

Now the boundaries of exclusion are shifting again. What we erroneously
call “cancel culture” is an attempt to shift the boundaries of the
sayable so it excludes not only conservatives but liberals and the
heterodox as well. Hence the attacks on, say, Steven Pinker and Andrew
Sullivan.

This is not just an elite or rare phenomenon. Sixty-two percent of
Americans say they are afraid to share things they believe, according to
a
[poll](https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#_blank)
for the Cato Institute. A majority of staunch progressives say they feel
free to share their political views, but majorities of liberals,
moderates and conservatives are afraid to.

Happily, there’s a growing rebellion against groupthink and exclusion. A
Politico
[poll](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412)
found that 49 percent of Americans say the cancel culture has a negative
impact on society and only 27 say it has a positive impact. This month
Yascha Mounk started [Persuasion](https://www.persuasion.community/), an
online community to celebrate viewpoint diversity and it already has
more than 25,000 subscribers.

After being pushed out from New York magazine, Sullivan established his
own newsletter, [The Weekly
Dish](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/subscribe), on Substack, a
platform that makes it easy for readers to pay writers for their work.
He now has 60,000 subscribers, instantly making his venture financially
viable.

Other heterodox writers are already on Substack. [Matt
Taibbi](https://taibbi.substack.com/) and Judd Legum are iconoclastic
left-wing writers with large subscriber bases. [The
Dispatch](https://thedispatch.com/) is a conservative publication
featuring Jonah Goldberg, David French and Stephen F. Hayes, superb
writers but too critical of Trump for the orthodox right. The Dispatch
is reportedly making about $2 million a year on Substack.

The first good thing about Substack is there’s no canceling. A young,
talented heterodox thinker doesn’t have to worry that less talented
conformists in his or her organization will use ideology as an outlet
for their resentments. The next good thing is there are no ads, just
subscription revenue. Online writers don’t have to chase clicks by
writing about whatever Trump tweeted 15 seconds ago. They can build deep
relationships with the few rather than trying to affirm or titillate the
many.

It’s possible that the debate now going on stupidly on Twitter can
migrate to newsletters. It’s possible that writers will bundle, with
established writers promoting promising ones. It’s possible that those
of us at the great remaining mainstream outlets will be enmeshed in
conversations that are more freewheeling and thoughtful.

Mostly I’m hopeful that the long history of intellectual exclusion and
segregation will seem disgraceful. It will seem disgraceful if you’re at
a university and only 1.5 percent of the faculty members are
conservative. (I’m looking at you,
[Harvard](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/3/faculty-support-warren-president/)).
A person who ideologically self-segregates will seem pathetic. I’m
hoping the definition of a pundit changes — not a foot soldier out for
power, but a person who argues in order to come closer to understanding.
