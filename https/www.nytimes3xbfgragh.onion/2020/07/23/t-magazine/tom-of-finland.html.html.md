# Eight Artists on the Influence of Tom of Finland

</div>

Touko Valio Laaksonen, who would have been 100 this year, transformed
depictions of queer eroticism in art through his hyper-real,
hypermasculine style.

[Tom of
Finland](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/22/t-magazine/art/robert-mapplethorpe-tom-of-finland.html)’s
influence is so vast that it can be hard to calculate. Through sheer
force of imagination, the artist was able to manifest a hyper-real,
hypermasculine style of queer erotic illustration that would end up
inspiring not just legions of visual artists but entire subcultures. Any
time a stylist puts a young pop star in a leather biker cap for a
magazine shoot, the impact of Tom of Finland is not far-off.

The year 2020 marks the centennial of the birth of this artist, born
Touko Valio Laaksonen, who died in 1991. Exhibitions, both virtual and
in reopened spaces, have been staged or planned in locales as far-flung
as [Los
Angeles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/08/20/t-magazine/los-angeles-city-guide.html),
[London](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/15/t-magazine/london-wellness.html),
Tokyo,
[Paris](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/26/t-magazine/paris-wellness.html),
[Berlin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/23/t-magazine/berlin-guide.html)
and [Tallinn,
Estonia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/24/travel/tallinn-estonia-vilnius-lithuania-52-places.html).
These commemorative shows are part of a larger, slower shift over the
past few decades, one that has seen the artist’s leather-clad figurative
work recast more firmly into an institutionally approved art
cannon.

In 2013, the artist’s work was included in a two-person exhibition with
the gay erotic art trailblazer — and, as it happens, the originator of
Laaksonen’s famous pseudonym — [Bob Mizer](http://bobmizer.org/) at the
[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles](https://www.moca.org/). Tom of
Finland drawings are in the permanent collection at the [Museum of
Modern
Art](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/museum-of-modern-art)
in New York. Even Laaksonen’s home country and namesake, in which
homosexuality was criminalized until 1971, has come around to the
artist’s importance: In 2014, it made a series of stamps honoring Tom
of Finland, and a successful 2017 biopic was produced in the
country.

But the artist’s work has had a long road to wider acceptance. From a
young age, he took an interest in leather and uniforms — particularly
those of local loggers and farmers — which would become his primary
stylistic touchstone: Sailors flex and embrace in his work, and bikers
touch bulges. This early attraction was amplified during a stint **** in
the Finnish military, in which Laaksonen saw action in Finland’s 1941
Continuation War against the U.S.S.R., which landed his country on the
wrong side of World War II history until it **** switched sides late in
1944, and later through the emergent biker subculture, inspired by
[Marlon
Brando](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/marlon-brando)
in the 1953 film “The Wild One.” (It should be noted that though the
uniforms of the German military were an influence on the artist,
Laaksonen was decidedly anti-racist.)

An initially secretive postwar art practice begun **** while the artist
was working a day job at an advertising agency developed into a career,
spurred on **** by a successful submission, in 1956, **** to Mizer’s
magazine, Physique Pictorial, which had to be branded as a fitness
magazine as a cover, though that didn’t always work (Mizer was charged
with obscenity in 1954). Early pieces published under the Tom of Finland
moniker were more suggestive than explicit, but the artist’s work
evolved with the loosening of both legal and social constraints. Even
so, many of Laaksonen’s later, more explicit drawings retained the
winking affability seen in his more formative work.

In 1978, Laaksonen made his first trip to Los Angeles, where he would
end up establishing the Tom of Finland Company with his muse and close
friend [Durk
Dehner](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/slideshow/2016/02/23/t-magazine/inside-tom-house-tom-of-finland-in-los-angeles.html),
in order to fight rampant copyright infringement. That company would
expand into the nonprofit [Tom of Finland
Foundation](https://www.tomoffinland.org/), which to this day retains
headquarters in an Echo Park Craftsman house and continues to be an
important community hub.

Throughout this timeline, Tom of Finland has remained a quintessential
artist’s artist. In the early 1960s, the pioneering, boundary-pushing
gay artist [Robert
Mapplethorpe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/23/t-magazine/robert-mappelthorpe-michael-cunningham-elif-batuman-hilton-als.html),
according to [Patti
Smith](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/10/07/t-magazine/patti-smith-m-train-objects.html),
discovered Tom of Finland’s work in a used bookstall in Times Square.
Mapplethorpe would become a crucial link in exposing Laaksonen’s work to
the contemporary art world. Mapplethorpe attended Laaksonen’s debut San
Francisco exhibition at the pioneering queer art gallery Fey-Way
Studios. Dehner facilitated the show, and Mapplethorpe’s enthusiasm
helped the artist land an exhibition at Robert Samuel Gallery in New
York two years later.

In 1985, the artist [Mike
Kelley](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/08/t-magazine/art/mike-kelley-mobile-homestead.html)
brought Tom of Finland to CalArts, the legendary Southern California art
school, to give a talk. In his introduction, Kelley called Tom of
Finland “an incredible inspiration in my work.” In context, it was a
bold statement. “CalArts was steeped within the dogma of conceptual art,
and Tom, of course, was anything but that,” the gallerist [David
Kordansky](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/09/10/david-kordansky-art-dealer-profile/),
who represents Tom of Finland’s work through the foundation, says.

S.R. Sharp, who is the vice-president and curator at the Tom of Finland
Foundation, says artists like Kelley revered Tom because his art did
nothing less than offer permission to explore sexuality and explicit
imagery in their own work. “And they always have remembered that,” Sharp
says. “And they’ve carried his legacy for many, many, many years.”

T talked to a wide range of artists about Tom of Finland’s influence for
**** what would have been his 100th
birthday.

### **[Elmgreen & Dragset](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/04/22/modern-amusement/), Berlin-based artist duo**

Tom of Finland’s art is unabashedly gay and celebratory of a subculture
and sexual rituals that were considered perverse when his drawings first
appeared in public. It seems absolutely devoid of the Protestant
reservedness, darkness, angst and pietism that has otherwise affected
the Nordic culture. In spite of the depictions of rough sexual
practices, there is something almost innocent and sweet about Tom of
Finland’s drawings, like it’s all playacting. Seen in today’s light, his
leather-clad muscle men don’t seem that different from [Tove Jansson’s
Moomintroll](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/15/t-magazine/art/moomin-tove-jansson-adventures-moominland.html)
fantasy figures.

When we curated the Nordic Pavilion at the 53rd Venice Biennale in 2009,
we installed a whole wall with Tom of Finland drawings. Even at that
time his art was considered controversial. It’s funny to think that only
a few years later Tom of Finland’s drawings appeared on national stamps
and on bedsheets and cushion covers from the traditional Finnish textile
company Finlayson, founded in 1820.

### **Cassils, Los Angeles-based performance artist**

Tom of Finland’s is probably the only artwork that I’ve ever jerked off
to. Those hot drawings scalded an impression onto my tender, young queer
brain fairly early on. I lived in Echo Park from 2009 to 2016. Visiting
Tom’s house was a refuge; knowing that it is still care taken by his
former lover enacts and makes present a rich, deep history. Its like a
portal to the queer culture I always aspired to but has mostly been
erased these days by digital platforms and
capitalism.

His formal mastery as a draftsman is really remarkable. You don’t see
people with that kind of skill set anymore. Forget about the subject
matter, the ability to draw that well is a pleasure to witness. Also,
the absurdity of Tom’s house as a living, breathing kinky institution: I
recall going there, and seeing this huge, huge butt plug holding open
the front door with this ancient Lab snoozing on the mat, and then,
looking up to the ceiling and instead of fixing a crack, they’d ****
hired a young queer artist, [Hector
Silva](http://www.worldoftomoffinland.com/tomsblog/weekly-artist-focus-hector-silva/),
to come in and paint a facade that’s as if you’re looking up somebody’s
kilt. That incredible amount of detail and labor and eroticism went into
absolutely every part of his life.

For a long time, there was no language around transness, or folks that
were gender nonconforming or nonbinary. And I think, similarly, perhaps
when Tom of Finland was forging this iconic style, he really took
ownership over his definition of what it was to be a homosexual, which
was perhaps, at that time, a term that was viewed as weak or derogatory.
For him to manifest this totally fantastical, empowered erotic vision,
it was completely contrary to that. So, I think that aspect of his
imagining is something that has definitely influenced me as an artist,
in terms of me being able to understand and forge a possibility for
myself.

Working for the Tom of Finland Company for several years, I was able to
see firsthand not only the breadth and amazing development of Tom’s
characters and story lines but also how widely seen the work became —
through distribution of Tom’s own publications but, more important, hand
to hand and fan to fan. I take from that a very valuable lesson about
artistic practice: By pursuing and portraying the particulars of your
own personal desires — as idiosyncratic, abhorrent, irresponsible or far
too subjective as your current situation may make it seem — you might
just someday inspire the lives of others, many of whom may be worlds and
lifetimes
away.

### **[Catherine Opie](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/02/t-magazine/catherine-opie.html), Los Angeles-based photographer**

As a longtime Angeleno and definitely someone who has been a part of a
larger queer leather community here, I know how important Tom of Finland
was in terms of brotherhood. So even though it wasn’t necessarily for
me, Tom’s house always provided an amazing community resource. But for
me as a dyke, I could not find myself in Tom of Finland’s work beyond
drag.

In a certain way, there was always a position of separatism with the
leather men compared to the leather dykes. Which is why I’m so
interested in the influence that Tom of Finland had on \[the Canadian
artist and publisher\] [G. B.
Jones](https://coopercolegallery.com/artist/g-b-jones/). For the first
time within G. B. Jones’s zines, in which she adopted the style of Tom
of Finland, I was able to see my own community and my own self, versus
the fantasies that many of us carried of being leather daddies.

Tom of Finland, what he modeled for us in his drawings, was actually a
butch drag. We ended up adopting this — it was a way for us to do drag
as a community. But G. B. Jones, with her drawings, all of a sudden made
it part of our queer culture — we could think of ourselves as being
women and leather dykes versus just doing
drag.

### **Simon Haas, of the Los Angeles-based artist duo the** **[Haas Brothers](http://www.thehaasbrothers.com/)**

My college boyfriend gave me a Tom of Finland Kake comic for my 21st
birthday, when I was studying at the Rhode Island School of Design. I
was a recently out-of-the-closet painting student filled with angst
about my sexuality and my art, and this was my first exposure to art
that made me feel like I belonged. Tom of Finland’s deft pencil work and
the immediate eroticism are enough to make any young gay boy a quick
fan, but after a decade of looking at his drawings, I understand that
his work transcends pornography and occupies a space of queer
spirituality. I came for the giant phalluses and stayed for the joy of
being a gay person. Tom’s drawings are unapologetically happy and have
not a shred of shame in them — an incredible rarity in any depiction of
homosexuality, even now. Tom had the fortitude of spirit to celebrate
men at *play* at a time when most of the world considered gay people to
be an abomination. I am 64 years his junior, and I have yet to discover
within myself the kind of fearless happiness that Tom manifested in his
work. Tom had such an abundance of radical self-acceptance that his work
continues to impart the spirit of self-love onto gay men everywhere. I
will never know Tom, but I can sincerely say that I love him with all my
heart.

We kind of take Tom of Finland for granted, because, let’s be honest, as
gay men, do we really need any more images of super muscular white
dudes? No, of course not. But, also, he was an excellent portraitist,
probably the last of the greatest of them, in a world where the camera
has become omni-accessible.

Also, when he was creating, I don’t think anybody really understood how
out of vogue or how hyper-questioned hypermasculinity would become. But
the thing that was absolutely radical was that he was doing this in the
’40s. When you do the residency \[Purnell was a resident at the Tom of
Finland Foundation in 2019\], you get access to his room, and I saw
drawings from when he was like 8 years old, and he’s doing these little
comics about cops and robbers. So, he was definitely all about dudes in
uniforms.

When I was the artist in residence there, it says Tom of Finland, so you
would expect a bunch of German dudes in leather, but it was a pretty
diverse group of people. The people who run that organization are very,
very near and dear to me. I think they still have a very, very deep and
intentional hand in L.A. queer radical art. The month I was there, I saw
that house be a welcoming spot for so many different people — so many
walks of queer life.

It’s a thing that I think is seemingly dead in San Francisco — the house
is maybe the last bastion of the radical, queer, underground meeting
place. But also through the filter of these still amazing drawings. With
Tom of Finland, it’s important to be able to place him in his time
period. He was definitely doing something that was going to get his ass
killed, but he said, “This is my art. This is the type of beauty I want
to enact in the world,” and there is no way to not be in awe of
that.

In the pocket-size Physique Pictorial magazines, I first saw Tom of
Finland drawings. As a frustrated, horny adolescent thinking myself
alone in my perverse desires, I reveled in his mind-blowing sex
fantasies. But I never thought those men or what they were up to could
be real. In the late ’50s and early ’60s, few men had the physiques he
idealized. And I saw no evidence that Tom’s world existed beyond his
imagination. But that didn’t stop me from joining in his adventures with
my dick in hand. Years later, I learned that Tom drew with one hand and
held his dick in the other. That revelation speaks to the authenticity
of his art.

Tom wanted us to feel the charge of his desires in our loins. I agree
with [Richard
Ellmann](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1987/05/14/obituaries/richard-ellmann-dies-at-69-eminent-james-joyce-scholar.html)’s
observations on [Oscar
Wilde](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/02/t-magazine/oscar-wilde-temple-london.html),
that life would repeat itself tediously were it not for the daemonic
changes art forces upon it. I also agree with Ellmann’s idea that the
artist makes models of experience that people rush to try out. Tom of
Finland perfectly exemplifies this observation. Before Tom, the
homosexual stereotype was a narrowly limited negative one. But Tom
opened a door to an alternate, robust way of being queer. He invited us
to dress and play with hypermasculine images of ourselves and
illustrated myriad sexual adventures we could realize. Tom of Finland
expanded our vision of what was possible for us to experience. How many
artists’ work has changed our culture so profoundly? That we celebrate
Tom’s 100th birthday today is a testament to the transformative power of
his work.
