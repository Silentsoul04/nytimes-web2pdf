*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up
here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/signup/OT) *to
receive it weekdays.*

A growing share of Americans are [concerned about the
environment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/briefing/coronavirus-brian-kemp-washington-redskins-your-friday-briefing.html),
and the big U.S. tech companies would seem to be in a position to lead
the way on fighting climate change.

They’re rich and staffed with smart people, and they have generally
[pledged to do more to reduce the carbon
emissions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/climate/apple-emissions-pledge.html)
that warm the planet.

My colleague [Somini
Sengupta](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/somini-sengupta), who
writes about climate change and used to cover the tech industry, walked
me through confusing climate change terms and how tech companies and all
of us can help slow global warming.

**Shira: What does it mean when a company pledges to go “[carbon
neutral](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/)”
or “[carbon
negative](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/07/21/carbon-negative-transform-to-net-zero/)?”**

**Somini:** A company will still produce carbon emissions, but it will
offset that by doing things that absorb emissions from the atmosphere —
like planting forests. Trees are great\! They absorb carbon dioxide. At
least some portion of Amazon’s and Apple’s climate action plans involve
reforestation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But that’s not enough. Climate scientists say global emissions must be
cut by half by 2030 if we stand a chance of averting the worst impacts
of warming.

**How do tech companies contribute to climate change, and how are they
helping?**

First, the industry uses lots of electricity, including for [computer
data
centers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/technology/internet-infrastructure.html).
If much of that comes from coal, it creates a boatload of planet-warming
emissions. This is a relatively easy problem to solve if companies [use
renewable
energy](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/sustainability-timeline/),
which is expanding fast and getting
cheaper.

[Amazon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/10/technology/amazon-climate-change-letter.html),
Google and Microsoft have also gotten
[attention](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/oil-in-the-cloud/)
for selling technology to help the oil and gas industry extract fossil
fuels, which are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Google
[promised to
stop](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/google-ai-greenpeace-oil-gas.html).

Other areas to watch: Can Apple, Amazon and Google compel manufacturers
of their devices to reduce factory emissions and switch to cleaner
energy? And can they reuse and recycle the materials inside of devices?
In general, recycled materials are better for the environment.

Then there’s the question of how much internet companies like Facebook
are helping spread [disinformation on climate
science](https://heated.world/p/fact-check-of-viral-climate-misinformation).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Is it effective for** **[companies to pick their own
paths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/23/business/corporate-climate-davos.html)**
**on climate change? What about governments?**

As a former technology reporter, this moment reminds me of when big U.S.
tech companies didn’t want
[regulations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/10/31/technology/no-us-action-so-states-move-on-privacy-law.html)
on data privacy. They changed their privacy policies and promised to do
better.

It’s possible that big tech companies are again setting themselves
voluntary targets to forestall national legislation, like on emissions
standards. Both
[Britain](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-becomes-first-major-economy-to-pass-net-zero-emissions-law)
and the [European
Union](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-to-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-zero-by-2050-11576203017)
now require their countries to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
That’s bound to affect tech and every other industry.

**What can we do as consumers of technology?**

We can [educate
ourselves](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/year-of-living-better/how-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint)
on what goes into the technology we buy, what the climate impacts are
and how long a product might last.

We can also [think about what we
buy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/technology/personaltech/tech-that-lasts.html)
in the first place. Making shiny new things contributes to global
warming. So does shipping, delivering and returning stuff. We can help
by making our existing products or devices [last
longer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/technology/personaltech/make-your-tech-last-longer.html)
by replacing the battery or making a repair, or [buying
used](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/28/technology/personaltech/taking-the-stigma-out-of-buying-usedelectronics.html).

## Three ways to enjoy scary technology

*Instead of*
[*doomscrolling*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/technology/coronavirus-doomscrolling.html)
*today, how about flopping on the sofa to take in great entertainment
about … uh … nightmarish technology?*

*Margot Harrison, a fiction writer and editor at the Vermont newspaper
Seven Days, offered us three recommendations for works dealing with
malevolent technology. Her latest novel, “*[*The
Glare*](https://www.lbyr.com/titles/margot-harrison/the-glare/9781368005654/)*,”
was released this month. Also check out* [*her recent
essay*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/books/review/cyber-horror-virtual-life-uncanny-valley.html)

**[“Infinite Detail: A
Novel”](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374175412)** **by Tim
Maughan**

In this 2019 dystopian novel, the only thing scarier than the
all-pervasive presence of the internet is its abrupt disappearance. The
story is told in alternating sections labeled “Before” and “After.” In
the former, anarchist hackers unravel the web that holds us all; in the
latter, they deal with the consequences of succeeding beyond their
wildest dreams.

While depicting many all-too-plausible extensions of control and
surveillance technology, Maughan suggests that it’s impossible to take a
simple stand for or against the machines with which our ways of life are
already
fused.

**[“Feed”](https://www.candlewick.com/cat.asp?mode=book&isbn=0763662623)**
**by M.T. Anderson**

This was the book that convinced me that young adult fiction might be
especially open to exploring technological anxieties because teens have
never known a world offline.

Anderson envisions a future in which everyone has an implant feeding
them entertainment, social interactions and micro-targeted advertising.
The concept isn’t new, but Anderson’s narrator has an unforgettable
voice: Holden Caulfield with a near-lethal injection of swaggering
early-aughts MTV.

**The** **[“Nosedive”
episode](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/21/arts/television/review-black-mirror-finds-terror-and-soul-in-the-machine.html)**
**of “Black Mirror”**

No piece of fiction has channeled my personal anxieties about social
media quite as effectively as this.

In a near future in which people’s status and livelihood depend directly
on the ratings others give them, a young woman makes a fatal series of
small mistakes that zero out her social credit. It’s a nightmare that
might convince you to put down the phone.

## Before we go …

  - **The cyberattack deterrence isn’t working:** To fight cyberattacks
    from China and Russia, the U.S. government for years has tried to
    name, shame and indict those behind them, and sometimes even
    counterattacked. But those punishments [haven’t been sufficient to
    deter continued cyberattacks and disinformation
    operations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/china-russia-trump-cyberattacks.html),
    reported David E. Sanger, the Times national security correspondent.

  - **You can’t pry this phone out of my hand:** Just about every tech
    company in the world considers India the emerging internet gold
    rush, but the companies are finding one big barrier: Many millions
    of Indians opt for basic cellphones over smartphones. This makes
    life harder for Netflix, Facebook and WeChat. The Chinese tech
    publication Abacus looks at why [the basic cellphone in India is far
    more
    appealing](https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3093597/can-google-and-jio-convert-indias-feature-phone-diehards-android?utm_medium=email&utm_source=mailchimp&utm_campaign=enlz-abacusnews_chatbox&utm_content=20200722&MCUID=91b7d58ca3&MCCampaignID=88e0c9f17d&MCAccountID=3775521f5f542047246d9c827&tc=18)
    than that Nokia you had in the early 2000s.

  - **Our national cake obsession didn’t last long:** Five minutes ago,
    it was impossible to avoid surreal social media videos of [cakes
    disguised as Crocs, pickles or human
    heads.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/style/what-is-the-cake-meme.html)
    Now the craze is dying, [NBC News
    reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/internet-went-crazy-over-cake-going-mainstream-can-end-trend-n1234588).
    Like any fun thing, weird cake was ruined because The Olds got into
    it. (I am An Old as well. I swear. It’s fine.)
