Michael R. Bloomberg’s gun control organization will focus its political
advertising spending this fall on eight states where it aims to help
Democrats flip three Senate seats, wrest control of state legislatures
and lift former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
to victory in Florida.

The group, Everytown for Gun Safety, is making an initial $15 million
investment in digital advertising in the states, an opening outlay of
the $60 million it has pledged to spend during the 2020 campaign.

It includes $5 million earmarked for Florida, the lone state where
Everytown plans on advertising in the presidential contest; $3.5 million
in Texas, where the group is targeting six House races; and $1 million
to $1.5 million in Arizona, Iowa and North Carolina — three states where
it will advertise in Senate races — as well as in Minnesota and
Pennsylvania.

The group also plans an initial $500,000 investment in Georgia, where,
in addition to the state legislative contests, the group will advertise
on behalf of Representative Lucy McBath, a suburban Atlanta Democrat
[who used to work as an Everytown
spokeswoman](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/24/us/politics/lucy-mcbath-georgia-black-lives-matter.html).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though the coronavirus pandemic and protests over racial disparities in
policing have dominated Americans’ attention this summer, John
Feinblatt, Everytown’s president, said he believed gun violence was more
important to voters now than it had ever
been.

“Post-Covid, our polling tells us it’s more critical to voters than
ever,” Mr. Feinblatt said in an interview on Wednesday. “It’s become a
litmus test for voters, as it was in Virginia.”

Everytown aims to replicate its success from Virginia’s 2017 and 2019
elections, when it backed Democrats who [overturned a generation of
Republican control of the state
legislature](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/05/us/politics/virginia-elections.html)
with investments that pale in comparison to what major statewide races
cost.

The group is now aiming to install Democratic allies atop state
governments, through which it then hopes to [enact sweeping gun control
measures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/us/virginia-democrats-new-laws.html),
as Virginia did this year.

Everytown remains largely backed by Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire
former mayor of New York, but it has an increasing number of outside
contributors, [including Connie Ballmer, the wife of the former
Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer. Ms. Ballmer gave $7 million in
April](https://twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/1283561968436015106).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The organization’s focus on digital advertising comes during what its
top political aides said was the fastest change in media consumption
habits since the dawn of the digital age. With millions of Americans
homebound because of the pandemic, nearly half of all television
consumption is now on streaming platforms.

“2020 looks more like 2025,” said Charlie Kelly, a senior Everytown
political adviser.

Mr. Kelly estimated that the cost to reach voters on digital platforms
across enough competitive state legislative districts to flip a state
chamber was a fraction of the resources required in a federal or
statewide race. Mr. Kelly said Everytown would spend to help Mr. Biden
in Florida, but not elsewhere, after consultation with other Democratic
super PACs, like Priorities USA, that would take responsibility for
different states.

“The goal is to win and everybody comes to the table to do that,” Mr.
Kelly said. “Post-2016, people were like, ‘We got to get ourselves
together on that front.’”

Everytown is just one element of Mr. Bloomberg’s political largess. [He
spent nearly $1 billion on his own presidential
campaign](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/politics/bloomberg-campaign-900-million.html),
which ended after he won the Guam caucuses but no states. Mr. Bloomberg
had pledged to pay his staff members through November, [but later
abandoned those
plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-dnc.html)
and donated the $18 million remaining in his campaign account to the
Democratic National Committee.

Field staff members for his campaign [subsequently filed class-action
lawsuits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/us/politics/bloomberg-employee-lawsuit.html)
arguing they had been tricked into accepting jobs.

Mr. Bloomberg’s personal super PAC, Independence USA, spent about $60
million on 2018 races but has yet to engage in 2020 contests.

Everytown’s success has come as the National Rifle Association’s
financial muscle has atrophied. [The 2018 midterm elections were the
first time gun control
organizations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-plan-to-pursue-most-aggressive-gun-control-legislation-in-decades-1541791440)
— Mr. Bloomberg’s Everytown and a group founded by former Representative
Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona — had outspent the N.R.A. in federal
elections.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“No question about it, the N.R.A. has never been weaker,” Mr. Feinblatt
said. “It’s fair to say they are going to be spending more money on
legal fees than they are digital or TV ads this cycle.”

Everytown’s $60 million commitment for 2020 is twice what it spent on
the 2018 midterms.

The N.R.A., [which spent $54 million on the 2016
elections](https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/detail.php?cycle=2016&cmte=National+Rifle+Assn)
but just $20 million in 2018, has yet to make a public commitment for
the 2020 elections.

Amy Hunter, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, declined to reveal what the
gun-rights organization would spend this year but predicted voters would
reject gun control proposals put forth by Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Biden and
former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who as a presidential
candidate last year called for the government to [seize assault
rifles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/15/us/politics/beto-guns.html)
from people who own them.

“2020 has been a bad year for the Bloomberg team,” Ms. Hunter said.
“First, after spending billions, Mike crashed and burned early out of
the presidential primaries and, then, millions of voters join the ranks
as gun owners. N.R.A. members and gun owners know what is at stake and
they will vote for freedom — not for the Biden-Beto gun confiscation
scheme.”
