in
Nigeria}\label{video-surfaces-of-execution-of-aid-workers-and-others-abducted-in-nigeria}}

Five men --- three aid workers, a government employee and a security
worker --- were abducted in June. A group aligned with the Islamic State
is believed to be behind the killings.

DAKAR, Senegal --- A Nigerian terrorist group has executed five men ---
three of them aid workers --- who disappeared while providing assistance
in the northeastern state of Borno last month. A video surfaced on
Wednesday showing the men kneeling and blindfolded. They were then shot.

The West African country of Nigeria has endured more than 10 years of
abductions, killings and other abuses by armed Islamist groups, but
regional governments have recently cracked down on insurgents, claiming
to have killed thousands.

A group allied with the Islamic State, Islamic State West Africa
Province, or I.S.W.A.P., is thought to be behind the executions of the
five men, all Nigerians.

The men had been traveling between Maiduguri, the capital of Borno
State, the Nigerian region hardest hit by terrorist attacks, and the
town of Monguno when they were kidnapped. Local news outlets reported
that they were aid workers with Action Against Hunger and the
International Rescue Committee. One worked for Nigeria's State Emergency
Management Agency.

Terrorist groups in northeastern Nigeria are often known by the catchall
name Boko Haram, the nickname of the original group that took up arms in
2009, of which I.S.W.A.P. is a splinter group. Unlike the original Boko
Haram, I.S.W.A.P. at first targeted mostly Christians, people affiliated
with the state, and employees of international aid organizations. More
recently, it has begun killing other Muslims too, some analysts
\href{https://www.cfr.org/blog/iswas-recent-attacks-could-signal-new-deadlier-approach-nigeria?utm_medium=social_share\&utm_source=tw}{have
said}. The group frequently abducts and executes aid workers after
attempting to elicit ransoms.

Over the past decade, northeastern Nigeria has been destabilized by
armed men preaching radicalism who gained traction by airing grievances
against the state. They pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015,
before splintering into several groups. Tens of thousands of civilians
have since been killed, raped, abducted and tortured.

President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to crush the terrorists and return
peace to the northeast, but attacks have continued, and national forces
have been accused of abuses that perpetuate the crisis.

The insurgency was subdued somewhat in Mr. Buhari's first term,
\href{https://twitter.com/bulamabukarti/status/1271344075170611201}{analysts
say}, but has recently been bouncing back.

The day before the execution video surfaced, Nigerian lawmakers,
concerned about soldiers leaving the army in large numbers, asked the
country's security chiefs to step down, according to
\href{https://dailypost.ng/2020/07/21/breaking-senate-asks-service-chiefs-to-step-down/?utm_source=dlvr.it\&utm_medium=facebook}{local
media}.

The aid workers killed were Ishaku Yakubu, an employee of Action Against
Hunger, Abdulrahman Dungus, who worked for an affiliate of France's
Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, and Luka Filibus, a
child protection officer with the aid group International Rescue
Committee. Joseph Prince, a security worker, and Abdulrahman Bulama, a
displaced persons' camp coordinator working for the Nigerian state, were
also shot.

In a video released in June, Mr. Filibus appealed to his employer to
save him. He was a former displaced person himself.

``Luka and his family were forced to flee their home, and he was still
compelled to alleviate the suffering of
children,''\href{https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-grieves-over-loss-colleague-nigeria}{the
aid group said in a statement}after the execution video came out. ``He
dedicated his life to protecting children and to help lessen their
trauma in the face of crisis. His colleagues in Nigeria remember him
always with a smile on his face.''

Ismail Alfa contributed reporting from Maiduguri, Nigeria.
