# Spain’s Reopening Stumbles as Virus Cases Rise Among Young People

Covid-19 outbreaks are putting Spain back under pressure, but this time
the focus is on younger people and the risk that they are unwittingly

MADRID — After already enjoying a long night of graduation celebrations,
a throng of young people poured into the Babylon discothèque at 5 a.m.
to continue partying in the southern Spanish city of Córdoba.

Two weeks later, 91 people linked to the Babylon’s 400 identified
partygoers have tested positive for the coronavirus and the regional
authorities are still struggling to trace all those who entered the club
that night, or who later came into contact with them.

Spain lifted a nationwide state of emergency on June 21 as it emerged
from a strict three-month lockdown imposed to gain control over [one of
Europe’s
worst](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/world/europe/spain-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=150)
outbreaks. The rapid spread of the virus in Spain left some 28,400
people dead by the official count — almost surely
[understated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/world/europe/coronoavirus-spain-death-toll.html?searchResultPosition=136)
— with most of them over the age of 70.

Since then, new coronavirus cases [have
quadrupled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-cases.html)
— now concentrated among young people — as the left-wing coalition
government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez returned responsibility for a
safe reopening to Spain’s regions. That has made Spain a mosaic of new
rules — some less stringent or more loosely enforced than others — and
an uneven patchwork of successes mixed with alarming failures.

The country is now grappling with 224 local outbreaks, Spain’s health
minister, Salvador Illa, told Parliament on Wednesday.

Several other European countries, from Portugal to
[Germany](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-reopening.html),
have faced significant local outbreaks after coming out of lockdown, but
most of those were more limited in scale and snuffed out relatively
quickly. Authorities isolated pockets of new cases and traced those who
may have been exposed.

The resurgence in Spain has underscored not only the need for vigilance
as societies reopen, but also for supporting measures like additional
testing and contact tracing — steps that Spain remains ill equipped to
carry
out.

The result is that hundreds of thousands of people in various parts of
the country have been forced to return to temporary lockdowns, notably
in the northeastern region of Catalonia, an area especially hard-hit
before.

But public tolerance for new lockdowns may prove lower than in March and
April, when the nationwide quarantines were largely obeyed but only
grudgingly accepted.

Young people in particular are chafing at the restrictions, especially
because they are less likely to become gravely ill as a result of
infection. While the demographic shift toward young people has reduced
the risk that Spain’s health care sector will once more get saturated
with Covid-19 patients, as happened in late March, it has raised a new
concern about asymptomatic transmissions, which make the need for
testing all the more pressing.

Yet health experts are warning that Spain continues to fall short in
terms of testing for Covid-19.

“Spain should now design a specific strategy to identify asymptomatic
patients,” Helena Legido-Quigley, an associate professor of public
health at the University of Singapore. Overall, she added, “testing
capacity and contact tracing could be much improved” in Spain.

Mr. Illa, Spain’s health minister, warned recently that his
Socialist-led coalition government was ready to reactivate Spain’s state
of emergency if it became clear that regions were not able to control
the latest outbreaks.

But Mr. Illa forms parts of a fragile minority government that has faced
fierce criticism from opposition parties over the government’s response
to the pandemic.

This week, María Jesús Montero, the minister who is the government’s
spokeswoman, sent a special message of caution to “people who are
younger, because some of the outbreaks are linked to the behavior in
nightlife venues or places where a large number of people gather.”

In the case of Catalonia, which has had one of the worst resurgences of
the virus, the situation has been complicated by disagreement between
politicians and local judges over who has the authority to put people
back under lockdown.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Many people ignored Mr. Torra’s recommendation, however, and the local
police were even forced to close some of Barcelona’s [packed
beaches](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20200719/482405928973/barcelona-cierre-playas-covid19-coronavirus.html)
over the weekend because of the risk of infection.

While the most serious outbreaks have recently occurred in northeastern
Spain, only two of Spain’s 17 regions — Madrid and the Canary Islands —
have not reimposed requirements to wear face masks at all times
outdoors.

Enforcement has proved to be complicated, not only at outdoor gatherings
but also in places like nightclubs that have been allowed to reopen
under occupancy limits.

In Córdoba, there are conflicting accounts of what happened in the
Babylon club, which was restricted to 40 percent of its 500-person
capacity to allow social distancing. Regional officials say they have
identified about 400 people who went to the club that night, though its
management has insisted that no more than
[140](https://www.eldiadecordoba.es/cordoba/Babylonia-defiende-cumplio-fiestas-covid-19_0_1483652062.html)were
inside at any one moment. The club is now closed while an investigation
continues.

Some regions of Spain are reporting a particularly strong uptick in the
number of cases among adolescents. In the northern region of Aragón,
where authorities said this week that they could contain the outbreaks
without a return to lockdown, the rate of infection rose sevenfold in
one month among people tested between
[ages 10](https://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/noticias/aragon/incidencia-virus-jovenes-10-19-anos-multiplica-siete_1428795.html)
and 19.

Some recent outbreaks have been linked to vulnerable sectors of society,
notably seasonal fruit pickers in northeastern Spain, who are often
migrant workers.

In recent days, Spanish hoteliers and travel operators have reported
more [booking
cancellations](https://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20200723/482471747725/rebrotes-gestion-frenan-seco-remontada-turistica.html)
since the new outbreaks and lockdowns were announced. The latest
outbreaks could threaten cross-border travel in Europe, at a time when
some [tourism
destinations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/19/world/europe/tourism-virus-europe.html)
are already suffering because airlines have only reopened some of their
routes.

Last week, Jean Castex, the new French prime minister, said his
government was monitoring the situation in neighboring Catalonia to
decide whether France’s border with Spain should [be kept
open.](https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/07/18/breaking-france-in-crisis-talks-with-spain)

On Wednesday, Reyes Maroto, the Spanish tourism minister, urged France
not to
[close](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/07/22/world/europe/22reuters-health-coronavirus-spain.html)
the border. “We are cohabiting with the virus, but this does not mean
that we cannot travel and recover some kind of normalcy,” Ms. Maroto
told a conference in Madrid.
