\textbf{Kathy Ryan, director of photography:} ``This week's cover story
focuses on the disruptive scale of migration that may be approaching
because of climate change. The photojournalist Meridith Kohut
photographed an Indigenous agricultural worker, Martín Yat Chen, who is
squatting on farmland in rural Guatemala that has dried up from higher
temperatures and a lack of rain. We felt that this stark image conveyed
the anxiety felt by many farmworkers who face an uncertain future, which
may lead them to become part of a mass migration that has already
begun.''
