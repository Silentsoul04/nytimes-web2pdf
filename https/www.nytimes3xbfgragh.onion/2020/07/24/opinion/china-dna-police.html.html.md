<div class="css-53u6y8">

For several years now, the police and other authorities in China have
been collecting across the country DNA samples from millions of men and
boys who aren’t suspected of having committed any crime.

In [a report published by the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/genomic-surveillance) last
month, we exposed the extent of the Chinese government’s program of
genetic surveillance: It no longer is limited to Xinjiang, Tibet and
other areas mostly populated by ethnic minorities the government
represses; DNA collection — serving no apparent immediate need — has
spread across the entire country. We estimate that the authorities’ goal
is to gather the DNA samples of 35 million to 70 million Chinese males.

Matched against official family records, [surveillance
footage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/twelve-days-in-xinjiang-how-chinas-surveillance-state-overwhelms-daily-life-1513700355)
or witness statements in police reports, these samples will become a
powerful tool for the Chinese authorities to track down a man or boy —
or, failing that, a relative of his — for whatever reason they deem fit.

The Chinese government
[denies](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1193942.shtml) the existence
of any such program, but since our study’s publication, we have
continued to uncover online scattered evidence revealing the program’s
enormous scale, including government reports and official procurement
orders for DNA kits and testing services.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

DNA is being harvested across the country: in the southwestern provinces
of [Yunnan](https://archive.is/9JEPP) and
[Guizhou](http://archive.vn/uUHW8); in central-southern
[Hunan](https://archive.is/0I3zd); in
[Shandong](http://archive.vn/zGN8C) and
[Jiangsu](http://archive.vn/p8BLE), in the east; and up north, in the
autonomous region of [Inner Mongolia](https://archive.is/idqI0).

We have continued to find photographic evidence that the police [are
collecting blood from children](https://archive.is/E7xQ9), pinpricking
their fingers at school — a clear violation of China’s responsibilities
under [the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
Child](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1990/09/19900902%2003-14%20AM/Ch_IV_11p.pdf).

And we have found fresh proof, including official documents, showing
that DNA samples are also being gathered in major urban centers. (For a
time, the focus seemed to be largely on rural communities.)

An official report dated June 16, [available on a website of the
government of Sichuan
Province](http://www.ccgp-sichuan.gov.cn/cms/newscontent/contentupload/file/2020-07/c59d5ba5_0b21_4bc2_a0aa_3226885510ef.pdf),
details the creation of a DNA database by the Public Security Bureau of
the city of Chengdu, the province’s capital, and seeks expert opinion on
the creation of a “male ancestry investigation system.”

It documents how 17 public security offices have collected DNA samples
from nearly 600,000 male residents across the city — that’s about 7
percent of Chengdu’s male population (assuming that roughly half of the
city’s total population of about 16.6 million is male).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Chengdu procurement report states that building a massive genetic
database about local residents will help the police “maintain public
order and stability as well as meet the needs of daily case work.” This
is of no comfort.

In China, securing the public order essentially means maintaining the
uncontested rule of the Communist Party. Dissent is a crime, and police
operations are a key part of the state’s apparatus of repression.

The Chinese police are not doing this work alone. Evidence continues to
accumulate that private companies, both Chinese and foreign, are
complicit in this extraordinarily vast, and ominous, assault on the
privacy of Chinese citizens.

In Hunan Province, Huangrui Scientific Instruments Ltd. — a company
based in the provincial capital that produces a range of medical,
chemical and scientific products — has sold to the ** Public Security
Bureau of the city of Liuyang some 140,000 DNA testing kits produced by
[Thermo Fisher
Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/hk/en/home.html), a U.S.-based
[Fortune 500
company](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/thermo-fisher-scientific/).
That’s enough equipment to test roughly one in five men in the
community.

In Fujian Province, [Forensic Genomics
International](http://fgidna.com/lxwm/index_29.aspx), a subsidiary of
[BGI Group](https://en.genomics.cn/)— a Chinese gene-sequencing and
biomedical company that [describes
itself](https://en.genomics.cn/en-about.html) as “one of the world’s
leading life science and genomics organizations” — won a contract to
analyze 16,000 blood samples collected by one district in the province’s
capital as part of the authorities’ effort to build a “male ancestry
investigation system.” The estimated total male population of the
district is 43,500.

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has contacted Thermo Fisher
and Forensic Genomics International asking for comments on our report;
neither company replied.

In a statement issued to The New York Times for [a news
story](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html)
last month related to the report, a representative of Thermo Fisher said
that the company was “proud to be a part of the many positive ways in
which DNA identification has been applied, from tracking down criminals
to stopping human trafficking and freeing the unjustly accused.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The note, titled “Statement on Xinjiang,” did not address the concerns
we raised about the potential for widespread abuse of genomic data by
the Chinese police throughout the country.

Thermo Fisher had previously been criticized — by [human rights
organizations](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/13/china-minority-region-collects-dna-millions)and
[scholars](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03687-x) — for
supplying DNA collection and analysis equipment to the Chinese
authorities in support of their campaign of repression against ethnic
minorities in Xinjiang. Already in February 2019, the company had [vowed
to cease any such sales](https://www.thermofisher.com/hk/en/home.html)
in the region.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Commerce Department [added to its list of
sanctioned
companies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/business/china-us-trade-banned.html)
two other subsidiaries of BGI Group — the Chinese parent company of
Forensic Genomics International — for “[conducting genetic analyses used
to further the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim
minorities](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/07/commerce-department-adds-eleven-chinese-entities-implicated-human)”
in Xinjiang.

BGI Group [has rejected the
accusations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/business/china-us-trade-banned.html).
Yet the company is also reported to have agreed to build “[a gene
bank](https://www.axios.com/chinese-coronavirus-test-maker-agreed-to-build-a-xinjiang-gene-bank-f82b6918-d6c5-45f9-90b8-dad3341d6a6e.html)”
in the region.

BGI Group has also been producing [tens of millions of Covid-19 test
kits](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bgi-group-helping-over-80-countries-for-timely-covid-19-detection-and-intervention-301043895.html)
for distribution to more than 80 countries — raising concerns in places
like
[Australia](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/09/australian-experts-raise-security-concerns-about-chinese-maker-of-andrew-forrest-covid-19-tests)
and
[California](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/02/china-bgi-california-testing/)
that any DNA data collected in the process might then be misused.

For now, China appears to be the only country in the world where police
are harvesting en masse DNA samples outside the scope of criminal
investigations. But how much longer before others follow suit?

In other countries, including the United States, law enforcement
authorities are also pushing the ethical boundaries of genetic data
collection.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The police in New York routinely collect DNA samples from people they
arrest or simply question — [sometimes without
saying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/15/nyregion/nypd-dna-database.html).
Across the United States, police officers search private ancestry sites
like [GEDmatch](https://www.gedmatch.com/) scouring genetic data looking
for potential leads in cold cases — also [without the knowledge or the
consent](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/11/judge-said-police-can-search-dna-millions-americans-without-their-consent-what-s-next)
of the people who uploaded their personal information.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration put in place a program
requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to [collect with
mouth swabs DNA samples from people in their
custody](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-dhs080-detaineedna-january2020.pdf)
and add that information to the FBI’s DNA database.

Global norms around how to handle genomic data are unsettled, and
against that shifting background, the actions of superpowers like China
and the United States are likely to set dangerous precedents for other
states.

The high courts of some countries, like
[Kuwait](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/17/kuwait-court-strikes-down-draconian-dna-law)
and
[Kenya](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-rights/court-orders-safeguards-for-kenyan-digital-ids-bans-dna-collecting-idUSKBN1ZU23D),
have either banned as unconstitutional or restricted the mass collection
of DNA by state authorities.

Other states are trying to forge ahead.

In India, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced [a
bill](https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1577738) last year
aimed at “expanding the application of DNA-based forensic technologies
to support and strengthen the justice delivery system of the country.”
But advocacy groups have identified [the risk of potential
misuses](http://www.genewatch.org/uploads/f03c6d66a9b354535738483c1c3d49e4/comments-on-india-dna-bill-2019.pdf).

A senior judge had previously
[warned](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/can-dna-be-taken-for-aadhaar-asks-judge/article23447019.ece)
that legislation covering India’s vast system of biometric
identification, Aadhaar, might be interpreted in the future to justify
the collection, not only of people’s fingerprints and iris scans, but of
DNA samples as well.

Last month, civil rights groups in
[Thailand](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2020/06/01/coronavirus-returnees-ordered-to-give-up-dna-samples/)
[raised
concerns](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2020/06/01/coronavirus-returnees-ordered-to-give-up-dna-samples/)
that Thai border authorities, including soldiers, had, without
explanation, forcibly taken DNA samples from [minority Muslim Thai
citizens](https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/surveillance-muslims-thailand/)
returning from Malaysia.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Malaysia, for its part, is mulling plans to create a national
registration system that would link biometric and DNA data to existing
ID documents — this
[purportedly](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/09/23/pbs-nrd-must-fast-track-setting-up-of-dna-database)
to keep ineligible foreigners from fraudulently being added to the
country’s citizenship rolls.

The battle over biometric privacy will be one of the defining civil
liberty issues of the 21st century. And grimly, on this front, too,
China seems to be leading the way.
