President Trump believes he represents the “silent majority” of the
country against a dangerous, radical minority. He says as much on
Twitter, frequently yelling “[SILENT
MAJORITY](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1277219673315119106?s=21)”
at his followers. Accordingly, his campaign for re-election has tried to
appeal to this “majority” with displays tailored to its perceived
interests.

Because Trump believes that this silent majority is protective of
Confederate statues and other monuments, he marked Independence Day with
[a
speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-south-dakotas-2020-mount-rushmore-fireworks-celebration-keystone-south-dakota/)
on July 3 denouncing “angry mobs” for “defacing our most sacred
memorials” and “unleashing a wave of violent crime in our cities.”
Because he also believes that this silent majority fears integration and
diversity, he has issued constant warnings to the “[suburban housewives
of
America](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1286372175117791236?s=21)”
that Joe Biden, the former vice president who is his opponent in the
election, will destroy their neighborhoods with affordable housing.
“People have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now
they’re going to watch it go to hell,” [he
said](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/22/893899254/down-in-the-polls-trump-pitches-fear-they-want-to-destroy-our-suburbs)
last week. And because he believes that this silent majority is hostile
to protests against police brutality, he has deployed federal law
enforcement officers to Portland and other cities to suppress
“[anarchists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/portland-protests.html)”
and generate “law-and-order” images for his campaign.

Unfortunately for Trump, there’s quite a bit of distance between his
perception and our reality. Most Americans

less diverse; and most Americans are supportive of the Black Lives
Matter movement and protests against police brutality — 67 percent,

Center](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/06/12/amid-protests-majorities-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups-express-support-for-the-black-lives-matter-movement/).

There is a silent majority in this country, and it is arrayed against a
radical, extremist minority. But it stands against Trump, not the other
away around. He and his allies are and always have been in the minority,
acting in ways that frighten and disturb the broad middle of the
electorate. And as long as Trump cannot see this — as long as he holds
to his belief in a secret, silent pro-Trump majority — he and his
campaign will continue to act in ways that diminish his chance of any
legitimate victory in the 2020 presidential election.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s worth unpacking the phrase “silent majority.” It dates back to [a
speech](http://chnm.gmu.edu/hardhats/silent.html) given in late 1969 by
Richard Nixon defending the Vietnam War at a moment when antiwar
sentiment was on the rise. “As president of the United States,” Nixon
said, “I would be untrue to my oath of office if I allowed the policy of
this nation to be dictated by the minority who holds that point of view
and who try to impose it on the nation by mounting demonstrations on the
street.” He continued: “And so tonight, to you, the great silent
majority, my fellow Americans, I ask for your support.”

Nixon’s basic view of American politics was that the country was divided
between a disruptive, countercultural left (enabled by feckless, liberal
elites) and a broad middle of Americans who craved order and stability.
Less than a month before that speech, he convened a secret group he
called the “[Middle America
Committee](https://www.google.com/books/edition/President_Nixon/ajLBlZwwB0IC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%E2%80%9Cmiddle%20america%20committee%E2%80%9D),”
tasked with reaching a “large and politically powerful white middle
class” that is “deeply troubled, primarily over the erosion of what they
consider to be their values.” These Americans, in the view of the
committee, felt that they had “lost control of a complicated and
impersonal society which oppresses them with high taxes, spiraling
inflation and enforced integration.”

Nixon identified with that middle — he spoke directly to its fears and
anxieties about race, crime and rapid cultural change, as well as its
resentments toward those groups (like the Black Power or women’s
liberation movement) that might try to overturn the existing social
order.

And he could do this, in part, because the “the great silent majority”
within Middle America shared a similar position in the social and
economic landscape of the country. They were nearly all white (of
varying ethnic origins); some were college-educated but the vast
majority were not; they had left the cities for the suburbs, part of the
“white flight” that transformed the built environment of the country.

The silent majority of 1969 was a singular grouping of Americans. The
silent majority of 2020 is not. It is diverse, made up of many millions
of Black, Hispanic and Asian-Americans as well as whites. It is still
largely working and middle-class, and it still lives in the suburbs, but
those suburbs are [also more diverse and
heterogeneous](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/05/22/demographic-and-economic-trends-in-urban-suburban-and-rural-communities/).
This “silent majority” isn’t as worried about crime and disorder —
violent crime is still near a 30-year-low — but it is concerned with
economic security and the rising cost of housing, health care and
education. Faced with protests against police brutality, this “silent
majority” wants reform and [sees racism as a serious problem for the
country](https://t.co/usUGEAif8U). And in the midst of a deadly
pandemic, it wants the federal government to take control and manage the
crisis as best as it can, rather than try [to wish it
away](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/01/with-new-coronavirus-cases-hitting-new-high-trump-revisits-his-fantasy-virus-will-just-go-away/).

What the silent majority doesn’t want are spectacles like the crackdown
in Lafayette Square or the current operation in Portland. What it
doesn’t want are endless displays of
[cruelty](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/)
for its own sake. Although this silent majority has no uniform view of
how to handle issues like immigration, it stands against the hostile
rhetoric and draconian policies of the present administration.

To Trump and his allies, the country is filled with “shy” supporters
just waiting for the right time to reveal themselves; they think they
can rally this public to their side with a violent demonstration of “law
and order.” They think they can run the Nixon playbook again, not
realizing that to the broad middle of the country, they are the ones who
represent the politics of division, disruption and disorder.

Or maybe they do realize it. [Earlier this
week](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/21/21328714/trump-executive-order-immigration-census-2020-redistricting),
Trump issued a memorandum directing Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary,
who oversees the Census Bureau, to exclude unauthorized immigrants from
the final report for the purposes of apportionment in the House of
Representatives. Like [last year’s blocked
attempt](https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/07/trump-administration-ends-effort-to-include-citizenship-question-on-2020-census/)
to add a citizenship question to the census, this would [reduce
representation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/06/where-citizenship-question-could-cause-census-miss-millions-hispanics-why-thats-big-deal/?arc404=true)
for states and localities with heavy immigrant populations — legal or
otherwise — shifting power to more rural, more white, more Republican
areas of the country.

This is not the move of a president who believes his party holds a
majority of the country. It is the move of a president who knows he is
in the minority, who knows his coalition cannot win a fair fight for
future political power.

The silent majority of the country is against Trump, his allies and his
would-be successors. He is trying to build a world where that doesn’t
actually matter.
