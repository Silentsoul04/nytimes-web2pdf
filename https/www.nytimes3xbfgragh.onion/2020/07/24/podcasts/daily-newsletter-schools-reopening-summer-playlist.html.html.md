*On* [*Wednesday’s
show*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/podcasts/the-daily/school-reopenings-coronavirus.html?)*,
we spoke to Pam Belluck about the safety behind reopening schools in the
U.S. As we enter the last month of the summer, the question of reopening
schools continues to be front-of-mind for people around the world. So we
asked Pam a couple of follow-up questions based on those we got from
you.*

**In the episode, while explaining a line of thinking about why it may
be safer to reopen elementary schools before middle and high schools,
you mentioned the growing evidence that children under 10 are less
likely to spread the virus than older children. Why is that?**

Covid-19 seems to affect little kids differently than most other
respiratory viruses, like the flu or cytomegalovirus, which are commonly
spread by young children. Scientists are exploring whether young
children are less likely to become infected with this new virus or
simply less likely to get sick when they are infected. One theory is
that younger children have fewer of the proteins that allow Covid-19 to
enter lung cells and replicate. Another is that children are protected
from developing serious symptoms because of differences in their
maturing immune systems or in the cells that line the blood vessels.

Milder symptoms may help explain why young children don’t spread the
virus as much. If they aren’t coughing or breathing hard, they might not
be propelling viral droplets far enough to reach another person.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Schools bring together a lot of adults besides teachers. How are
communities in the U.S. thinking about adult-to-adult interaction and
transmission if schools reopen?**

Over half of the employees of public school systems are not full-time
teachers — they are bus drivers, custodians, cafeteria workers, aides,
substitute teachers and others who fill roles that are vital to making
school reopening possible. They serve in jobs that often pay lower wages
and provide fewer employee benefits than teachers receive. And some will
be asked to take on additional responsibilities when schools open.
Custodians will be implementing procedures for extra cleaning and
sanitizing; drivers in some districts may be asked to assess the health
of children before allowing them to board the bus.

Many school districts are trying to develop plans to protect these
workers. Some intend to install plexiglass dividers to protect bus
drivers, give them medical-grade face masks and limit the number of
children on buses so the children are separated by six feet (steps that
serve to protect children as well). Lunchtime will look different in
many schools: Some will have individualized box lunches and children
eating in their classrooms, so cafeteria workers are exposed to fewer
people.

Many of these precautions will take additional resources. And, since
these are jobs that can’t be done online, districts will need
contingency plans or substitute workers for staff members who get sick
or are uncomfortable coming to work.

**You mentioned Israel as a country that’s had less success in reopening
its schools. Why did it relax its class size restrictions? Did it see a
parallel outbreak in its communities when it relaxed class sizes?**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Israel’s Covid-19 case counts have gone up in recent weeks, and it is
experiencing a second wave of the pandemic after having largely gotten
the first wave under control. It relaxed other pandemic restrictions
around the same time as it reopened schools, so it’s not clear exactly
what role the schools played and how much of the surge in cases was
driven by social gatherings at weddings, parties and bars.

It’s important to note that, while the U.S. can learn from other
countries, none of them exactly mirror American circumstances. In
Israel, for example, classes are typically large, so when they were
divided into small-group capsules, each class still had about 18
students. Also, for a few days in May, the temperature was so hot that
the Israeli government waived the mask requirement, and it’s unclear if
that spurred disease transmission.

Still, some public health experts in Israel say they recommended against
relaxing the restrictions on class size, and they believe that the
guidelines were eased because of political pressure and eagerness for
the economy to fully reopen. Israeli citizens may also have felt that
there wasn’t a great risk to lifting the restrictions, given that the
country had successfully tamped down its infection rate in April and
May. That’s a cautionary message for communities in the U.S. and
elsewhere not to become complacent once they’ve managed to keep the
virus in check.

It’s been a strange summer, to say the least. This week, when we asked
each member of our team to share a song from their pandemic summer
soundtrack, our producer Hans Buetow wrote back: “I am devoid of music
or even joy in my life. SUCH IS THE WORLD RIGHT NOW, I CAN ONLY LISTEN
TO THE WHISTLING WINDS THAT BLOW THROUGH THE EMPTY CHASM OF WHAT ONCE
HELD MY SOUL … Oh, but also I do listen to a lot of Whitney Houston.”

Hans went on to add 25 songs to our team’s summer playlist (we only
asked for one).

You can listen to the playlist below, or [follow the full version on
Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0GvVwghTzyY4lR722dCeM0?si=SLnkYCqgRLaF-nUDcTHCFA),
which includes Hans’s 25 favorites, as well as a [dubstep
version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE0uc92JlCc) of the “Jurassic
Park” theme song, plus a few Taylor Swift bangers in honor of
her[surprise
album](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/07/23/us/ap-us-music-taylor-swift.html).
