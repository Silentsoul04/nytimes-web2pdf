Digital success can be as flimsy as tissue paper. [Remember
Groupon](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0830/entrepreneurs-groupon-facebook-twitter-next-web-phenom.html#568f5cee4c2e)?
BlackBerry went from the king of our pockets to nada in a hot minute.
Heck, it seemed like [we got bored of those internet cake
videos](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/internet-went-crazy-over-cake-going-mainstream-can-end-trend-n1234588)
in a week.

Even in technology, though, some habits can prove tenacious.

No one has been able to get large numbers of Americans to use something
other than Google for all our burning questions. The world has settled
into only two flavors of smartphones: iPhones and Androids. And in the
United States, it’s tough to crack Amazon’s lock on online shopping.

It’s not necessarily because these products or services are better than
the alternatives. They might be, but there are also strategic arts that
explain why some companies endure. And there’s the power of inertia.
Sometimes we do what we do because that’s what we do.

There’s nothing necessarily wrong with these habits. But we have long
thought of technology as more dynamic and open to newcomers. And yet, is
it?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Let’s focus on online shopping. In the United States, Amazon has at
least seven times the online business of Walmart, Target, eBay or anyone
else.

Amazon is really good at what it does. It sells just about every product
imaginable — for good or [for
ill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/technology/facebook-crisis.html),
buying is easy and stuff typically arrives reliably and fast. Prices
often aren’t the cheapest, and Amazon’s website feels like it was made
by 1990s robots rather than by humans with souls … but no matter.

And also there’s the power of habit that Amazon cleverly reinforces.
We’re on Amazon because we’re used to it, and [it just
works](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/technology/no-the-best-doesnt-win.html).
Merchants focus their attention on Amazon because we’re all shopping
there. And the Prime shopping club is essentially an incentive to never
shop anywhere else.

My colleague Dai Wakabayashi chronicled this week Google’s [repeated,
mostly failed
efforts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/technology/google-ecommerce-amazon.html)
to make it as easy as possible for merchants to sell us stuff through
Google instead. Dai told me that Google is now letting merchants list
many products without paying sales commissions, and it’s making it easy
for them to port over information directly from their Amazon product
listings. Google is trying so hard\!

Google can be a scatterbrained mess, but it’s also rich and attracts
billions of eyeballs every day. If it can’t persuade Americans to shop
somewhere other than Amazon, that shows us something both about Amazon’s
strengths and about how tough it can be to persuade us to try something
different. (Worth noting: Amazon rules online but a vast majority of our
consumer spending happens in stores.)

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Everyone in Silicon Valley knows the history of technology winners
becoming losers in a flash, so many successful tech companies live in
fear of losing it all.

One question for those of us who use technology, and for governments
concerned about keeping competition healthy, is whether there’s
something different that makes today’s tech powers more immovable than
yesterday’s. This is at the heart of the upcoming congressional
[antitrust
hearings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/technology/amazon-apple-alphabet-facebook-congress-antitrust.html)
involving four of America’s digital superpowers.

The bottom line is internet users like us benefit if lots of companies
are afraid for their future and fighting hard for our attention and
dollars. But in some corners of technology, that’s not really happening.

## Every fight is about data

I’m constantly struck that lots of problems about our digital lives boil
down to data: who has it, who doesn’t and how it’s interpreted and kept
secret.

Let me give you one example: [The Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-creates-teams-to-study-racial-bias-on-its-platforms-11595362939)
and [NBC
News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-management-ignored-internal-research-showing-racial-bias-current-former-n1234746)
had details this week about Facebook previously shelving internal
studies of possible racial bias on its site — including research that
dug into why Black people appeared far more likely to have their
accounts disabled for perceived violations of hate speech rules.

Facebook said in part that it worried these research projects relied on
faulty data. Facebook doesn’t know if you’re Black, but it makes
inferences about race from the information you engage with. Those
inferences can be wrong, and Facebook said it didn’t want to rely on bad
data.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mind you, Facebook uses this same data to target advertising for
companies who want to sell to Black people. The data was good enough for
Facebook’s paying customers. (And, a former Facebook researcher
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1286519635748114432) that
those probing possible bias didn’t rely only on Facebook’s inferences on
race.)

The reason we know about this fight inside Facebook is that the
company’s employees see data that we never will, and some of them were
uncomfortable with how their bosses used or suppressed the information.
There are similar tales [at
YouTube](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/youtube-algorithm-election-clinton-trump-guillaume-chaslot)
and at just about every internet superpower.

There are two crucial lessons here: First, we often think data is
somehow pure and untainted by human bias, but that’s wrong. Information
is gathered and interpreted by humans — or by computers programmed by
humans — and is therefore subject to our whims and bias.

And second, we are hopelessly incapable of understanding the inner
workings of the world’s biggest information machines because they see
every morsel of information happening inside their walls and we see only
what they choose to tell us. Data is power, and we have little of both.

## Before we go …

  - **Trying to influence the influential:** George Mason University’s
    Global Antitrust Institute has pushed a message of restraint in
    antitrust enforcement to hundreds of overseas regulators and judges
    at lavish all-expense paid conferences in Hawaii, Tokyo and
    Portugal. My colleague Dai found that Google, Amazon, Qualcomm and
    other big tech companies helped pay for these events, which critics
    said [presented a one-sided view of corporate
    regulation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/technology/global-antitrust-institute-google-amazon-qualcomm.html)
    intended to benefit the big companies.

  - **Everything is data, part deux:** Another way tech companies
    consolidate and keep power is by harnessing data to learn about
    competitors and countermove against them. The Wall Street Journal
    wrote about Amazon appearing to use its interactions with business
    partners or potential ones to [help develop competing
    products](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1).
    And the tech news publication the Information wrote about Google
    using data from Android phones to [learn about how people use rival
    apps](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/internal-google-program-taps-data-on-rival-android-apps).

  - **My new favorite couple:** I loved [this New York Times
    article](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/world/asia/taiwan-octogenarian-couple-instagram-laundry.html)
    about the owners of a laundry shop in Taiwan who have become
    Instagram stars for posing in garments that people abandoned. “I can
    tell they’re elated,” said the unofficial stylist and grandson of
    the couple, who are in their 80s. (Check out [their account for
    yourself](https://www.instagram.com/wantshowasyoung/). These two
    have got style.)

### Hugs to this

May we all have the calm and grace of [this bear sitting on patio
furniture](https://twitter.com/k_thompson212/status/1285240819608424448).
(Thanks to my colleague Charlie Warzel for spotting this gem.)
