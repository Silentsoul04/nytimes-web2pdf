Statues of Christopher Columbus were taken down in two Chicago parks
early on Friday, making the city the latest to remove a monument to the
Italian explorer blamed for the genocide and exploitation of Indigenous
people.

In Grant Park, a crew using a large crane lifted the statue from its
pedestal, removing a symbol that had been the scene of violent clashes
between protesters and the police last week. A crowd cheered and passing
cars honked as the statue came down at about 3 a.m., The Associated
Press reported, and the removal was shown live on local television.

A Columbus statue was also removed in Arrigo Park in Little Italy, the
mayor’s office said in a statement.

“This statue coming down is because of the effort of Black and
Indigenous activists who know the true history of Columbus and what he
represents,” one resident, Stefan Cuevas-Caizaguano, [told The Chicago
Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2020/7/23/21336740/lightfoot-removal-statue-christopher-columbus-grant-park)
while watching the removal in Grant Park.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement that the statues were removed,
temporarily, “in response to demonstrations that became unsafe for both
protesters and police, as well as efforts by individuals to
independently pull the Grant Park statue down in an extremely dangerous
manner.”

“In addition, our public safety resources must be concentrated where
they are most needed throughout the city, and particularly in our South
and West Side communities,” the statement said.

In the coming days, it said, the mayor and city officials would announce
a process to assess other monuments, memorials and murals across Chicago
and “develop a framework for creating a public dialogue to determine how
we elevate our city’s history and diversity. “

The mayor’s decision was criticized by some in the
city.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>The [Fraternal Order of
Police
said](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/FOP7Chicago/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARDGaMwhgZ1D-b82rynp7mzpxmD8mSlx632MprHtYFtl9O5hRx2De7OGcVC3Ys-yKJC2mmrLBGRQ0y8c&hc_ref=ARQE0TO5AI8QvAXBmYKeYwi_DK8vnjLd01rLAwyR1b--Yt4bPX15cKeqJgEBCpd9qw8&fref=nf&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCtJYtOOquzHvhALdZJKGfUs1E4Tab4e2MDtIXZNSTTQFKprhrC7QleYnckvgcwPixHhwjsRp0qjSQdMERA9lzMAslYkqOGXWNeKjdbVh0KpNIpntgGp8MTLGt1Id5YWi-OzQ6DRJygl8nMj7R7OyUtEfSmRQKVqg8uhQNdcwTx8rOeSEPEIHtzD-x4M9jBvdlbLWPToF4IVSKAnPNN32RSqvl8UeyPOexoVtKVz28heF7xuuNDvmrVKOMJNJEWngNzR5jxYbA-cRhdGOBblQfxeGa49ceQY61H2aRfeZD6UjryDqkXj82rWHVwdxOf9bNSCUvmBVS-ZavLeHJm7w)that
the mayor was “bowing down to the lawlessness of these anarchists.” Its
president, John Catanzara, Jr., [wrote a letter last
week](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/FOP7Chicago/photos/a.963693107007404/3311469208896437/?type=3&theater)
asking President Donald Trump for federal help to deal with the city’s
crime.

Last Friday, a group of [protesters clashed with police officers at the
Christopher Columbus statue](https://cbsloc.al/32qXo6d) in Grant Park,
and some tried to tear down the statue. Some officers were hurt during
the clashes and treated at the scene or transported to the hospital,
[CBS
reported.](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/07/18/chicago-grant-park-columbus-statue-protest-cpd/)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Four protesters were also hurt in the confrontation, and the police said
14 people were arrested, it reported.

[Statues of Columbus have also been taken down in other American
cities,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/christopher-columbus-statue-boston-richmond.html)
including Boston, Richmond, Va., and St. Paul, Minn., where a group of
protesters tied ropes around the statue’s neck and yanked it from its
pedestal outside of the State Capitol last month, about 10 miles from
where a Minneapolis police officer pinned his knee on George Floyd’s
neck. Mr. Floyd’s death in May set off weeks of worldwide protests about
racial injustice and violent policing, as well as a reckoning over
statues and symbols.

Native Americans and others have long called for statues of Columbus to
be removed, and [also to replace Columbus
Day,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/28/us/columbus-day-indigenous-peoples.html?searchResultPosition=7)which
is marked on the second Monday in October, with [Indigenous Peoples’
Day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/nyregion/indigenous-day.html).
Protesters have said that Columbus’s arrival in the New World led to the
genocide and exploitation of Indigenous populations in the Americas.

In [dozens of cities, statues or monuments portraying Confederates and
other historic
figures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/confederate-statues-photos.html?searchResultPosition=6)
have been marked with graffiti and challenged with petitions and
protests. In some cities, officials have made plans to remove contested
statues. In others, protesters have toppled them. In Roanoke, Va., this
week The A.P. reported that a monument to Robert E. Lee that the city
had planned to remove was found toppled and broken on the ground.

At Virginia’s Capitol in Richmond, [The Washington Post
reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/confederate-memorials-quietly-removed-from-virginia-capitol-overnight/2020/07/24/8d2a0dee-cced-11ea-bc6a-6841b28d9093_story.html),
around the same time the Columbus statues were being removed in Chicago,
workers overnight carted away a statue of Lee and busts of seven other
Confederates.
