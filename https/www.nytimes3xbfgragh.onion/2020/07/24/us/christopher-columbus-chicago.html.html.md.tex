Statues of Christopher Columbus were taken down in two Chicago parks
early on Friday, making the city the latest to remove a monument to the
Italian explorer blamed for the genocide and exploitation of Indigenous
people.

In Grant Park, a crew using a large crane lifted the statue from its
pedestal, removing a symbol that had been the scene of violent clashes
between protesters and the police last week. A crowd cheered and passing
cars honked as the statue came down at about 3 a.m., The Associated
Press reported, and the removal was shown live on local television.

A Columbus statue was also removed in Arrigo Park in Little Italy, the
mayor's office said in a statement.

``This statue coming down is because of the effort of Black and
Indigenous activists who know the true history of Columbus and what he
represents,'' one resident, Stefan Cuevas-Caizaguano,
\href{https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2020/7/23/21336740/lightfoot-removal-statue-christopher-columbus-grant-park}{told
The Chicago Sun-Times} while watching the removal in Grant Park.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement that the statues were removed,
temporarily, ``in response to demonstrations that became unsafe for both
protesters and police, as well as efforts by individuals to
independently pull the Grant Park statue down in an extremely dangerous
manner.''

``In addition, our public safety resources must be concentrated where
they are most needed throughout the city, and particularly in our South
and West Side communities,'' the statement said.

In the coming days, it said, the mayor and city officials would announce
a process to assess other monuments, memorials and murals across Chicago
and ``develop a framework for creating a public dialogue to determine
how we elevate our city's history and diversity. ``

The mayor's decision was criticized by some in the city. The

Order of Police said}that the mayor was ``bowing down to the lawlessness
of these anarchists.'' Its president, John Catanzara, Jr.,
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/FOP7Chicago/photos/a.963693107007404/3311469208896437/?type=3\&theater}{wrote
a letter last week} asking President Donald Trump for federal help to
deal with the city's crime.

Last Friday, a group of \href{https://cbsloc.al/32qXo6d}{protesters
clashed with police officers at the Christopher Columbus statue} in
Grant Park, and some tried to tear down the statue. Some officers were
hurt during the clashes and treated at the scene or transported to the
hospital,
\href{https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/07/18/chicago-grant-park-columbus-statue-protest-cpd/}{CBS
reported.}

Four protesters were also hurt in the confrontation, and the police said
14 people were arrested, it reported.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/christopher-columbus-statue-boston-richmond.html}{Statues
of Columbus have also been taken down in other American cities,}
including Boston, Richmond, Va., and St. Paul, Minn., where a group of
protesters tied ropes around the statue's neck and yanked it from its
pedestal outside of the State Capitol last month, about 10 miles from
where a Minneapolis police officer pinned his knee on George Floyd's
neck. Mr. Floyd's death in May set off weeks of worldwide protests about
racial injustice and violent policing, as well as a reckoning over
statues and symbols.

Native Americans and others have long called for statues of Columbus to
be removed, and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/28/us/columbus-day-indigenous-peoples.html?searchResultPosition=7}{also
to replace Columbus Day,}which is marked on the second Monday in
October, with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/nyregion/indigenous-day.html}{Indigenous
Peoples' Day}. Protesters have said that Columbus's arrival in the New
World led to the genocide and exploitation of Indigenous populations in
the Americas.

In
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/confederate-statues-photos.html?searchResultPosition=6}{dozens
of cities, statues or monuments portraying Confederates and other
historic figures} have been marked with graffiti and challenged with
petitions and protests. In some cities, officials have made plans to
remove contested statues. In others, protesters have toppled them. In
Roanoke, Va., this week The A.P. reported that a monument to Robert E.
Lee that the city had planned to remove was found toppled and broken on
the ground.

At Virginia's Capitol in Richmond,
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/confederate-memorials-quietly-removed-from-virginia-capitol-overnight/2020/07/24/8d2a0dee-cced-11ea-bc6a-6841b28d9093_story.html}{The
Washington Post reported}, around the same time the Columbus statues
were being removed in Chicago, workers overnight carted away a statue of
Lee and busts of seven other Confederates.

With camouflage-clad federal agents already
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/portland-protests.html}{sweeping
through the streets of Portland}, President Trump has said he plans to
deploy federal law enforcement to Chicago and other major cities --- all
controlled by Democrats. Mayor Lightfoot's office said on Wednesday,
after a ``brief and straightforward'' conversation with the president,
that those forces will be ``investigatory'' and coordinated through the
United States Attorney's office.

``The mayor has made clear that if there is any deviation from what has
been announced, we will pursue all available legal options to protect
Chicagoans,''
