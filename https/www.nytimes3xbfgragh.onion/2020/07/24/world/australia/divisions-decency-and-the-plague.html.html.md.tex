What should we do about the uneven distribution of pandemic

There's a point early on in ``The Plague'' when a journalist stuck in
the sickened city of Oran tries desperately to get out --- beyond the
walls, to the rest of healthy, happy French Algeria.

It's meant to be for love. Raymond Rambert, the would-be escapee in
Albert Camus's 1947 novel, is eager to reach the woman he intends to
marry.

But I found myself recalling the scene last week because it reminded me
of the divide that pandemics create between places and people, and the
enormous difference between life inside with the contagion and life
beyond, in someplace that feels almost normal.

At the time, I was catching up on news of the surging coronavirus
outbreak in Victoria while enjoying a gourmet lunch in northern New
South Wales after stopping at a busy local bookstore. It felt odd and,
if I'm honest, exhilarating, to be enjoying such luxuries. The tables in
the restaurant,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/16/dining/restaurants-northern-rivers-byron-bay.html}{Shelter
in Lennox Head}, were far enough apart to feel safe but not so distant
to feel abnormal. The food was great. The bookstore, too, felt almost
pre-pandemic.

Our family of four felt as though we had escaped to the other side, and
in many ways we had, especially compared to our loved ones in the United
States. I recently talked to a friend in South Carolina who told me he
had been in isolation for 110 days and spoken to only five people in
that time who were not members of his family.

And yet, even for the lucky ones, it all feels so fragile. The
difference between the imaginary world of Camus and our very real world
today is that the virus is not --- and may never be --- truly contained.
Our societies are porous. Our lives are networked and global.

So in the bookstore, the clerk, when she heard our American accents,
told us that she had Australian friends who were forced to leave the
U.S. because the Trump administration --- its anti-immigration urges
empowered by the pandemic --- had canceled their visas.

At the restaurant, one of the owners told me that while they were doing
well there, he had to close another restaurant he had opened only
recently. ``The places that are not well established, they're not going
to make it,'' he said.

Another divide, another wall: between the businesses that survive and
those that do not; between those with work and those without.

What should we do and how should we feel about the uneven distribution
of pandemic consequences?

This, it seems to me, is a question that we'll be grappling with for a
while. The Australian government's
\href{https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-21/jobkeeper-jobseeker-extended-rates-cut-coronavirus-morrison/12475716}{adjustments
to the JobKeeper program} this week, extending wage subsidies into next
year but curtailing the amounts, signals that officials have begun to
recognize what it took the residents of Oran a long time to accept ---
that pestilence requires endurance.

Here's Prime Minister Scott Morrison: ``The virus will plot its own
course.''

Here's Camus: ``The preceding months, though they had increased the
desire for liberation, had also taught them to count less and less on a
rapid end to the epidemic.''

In this middle moment between initial infection and final eradication
--- the very lengthy moment ``The Plague'' focused on --- Camus's
characters prioritized perseverance and small acts of kindness. Flipping
back through the book as I wrote this, the power of consistency
re-emerged. Dr. Bernard Rieux, ``struggling against the world as it
was,'' provided both treatment for the sick and an ear for the struggles
of the anxious.

He was a hero of small things, a hero of careful carrying on. Perhaps
that's what we all need to aim for as well.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
