# Cracking Open a Bottle of Calgary’s Past

One man’s social media post of archived 19th-century newspaper ads has

For part of each week, I help put together The Times’s [live briefing on
the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus),
which continues to [ravage the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/23/us/coronavirus-hotspots-countries.html)
and cause [worrying
outbreaks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tam-young-people-covid19-virus-fatigue-1.5662206)
in Canada, where things are otherwise significantly better.

But the pandemic isn’t all grim destruction. It’s inspiring new
interests and resurrecting some too. That’s currently the case in
Calgary, where one man’s fascination with a remnant of the city’s past
has captured its imagination.

It began late last month when Paul Fairie’s plans for a walk were
thwarted by rain. Stuck inside, Mr. Fairie, a researcher and political
science instructor at the University of Calgary, revisited one of his
hobbies: reading old newspapers online.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The front page of the Calgary Weekly Herald from
[September 28, 1883](http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/newspapers/CWH/1883/09/28/1/Ar00103.html)
started off its local news section with a cryptic entry of one simple
word:
“Cronk.”

of Alberta Libraries</span></span>

</div>

</div>

The mystery didn’t stop there. Sprinkled throughout the front page —
like the repetitive ads that clutter 21st-century web pages — there were
several more entries, including “Dr. Cronk,” “Cronk is Good,” “Buy
Cronk,” “Cronk is the drink” and “Cronk is made at the Star Bakery.”

Dr. Fairie had come across very brief ads inserted into articles many
times before. But these one-word ads intrigued him.

“What really drew my eye was the one that was just ‘Cronk’,” he told me.
“I was like, This really isn’t enough detail at all.”

Dr. Fairie doesn’t just read old newspapers, he also frequently [posts
oddities from them on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/paulisci) They have
included a [salad recipe that uses four
doughnuts](https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/918220378685759488?s=20)
as its principal ingredient.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So [onto Twitter went
Cronk](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1282802428652466180?s=20).

“I thought people would like it and that would be the end of it in an
hour,” Dr. Fairie said. He had badly underestimated the power of Cronk.

First, Dr. Fairie started receiving bits of Cronk lore from antique
bottle collectors, an avid group that was well-versed in Cronk packaging
if not the beverage itself.

Someone sent Dr. Fairie a recipe for [“Dr. Cronk’s Sarsaparilla
Beer”](https://twitter.com/JNerissa/status/1275321511646126080?s=20)through
Twitter. He didn’t make it. Requiring 100 gallons of water, the recipe
was for Cronk on an industrial scale rather than for anyone’s kitchen.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But as the Cronk discussion grew this month, Dr. Fairie made it his
pandemic project as he began piecing together all he could find out
about the long-forgotten drink.

He put all of that into [a 16 minute
video](https://youtu.be/4anHiXHyPVo) that some have praised as the
finest YouTube offering by a Canadian about a forgotten 19th-century
beverage.

Here’s the brief version: Cronk appears to have been created in 1839 by
Warren Cronk, a soda water maker from Albany, N.Y. Within nine years, he
had franchised his creation across much of North America. By the time
the enigmatic ads appeared in the Calgary Weekly Herald, Dr. Fairie said
that the company was most likely headed by another Warren Cronk,
probably the founder’s son. The second Warren Cronk was also in the soda
water trade and lived mainly in my hometown, Windsor, Ontario, although
he sometimes bounced across the river to Detroit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s unclear if either of them had even the slightest claim to the title
of doctor.

You’ll have to watch Dr. Fairie’s video to learn about Cronk’s role in
the [Hippodrome War
of 1853.](https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/septemberoctober/statement/the-circus-you-never-knew)There’s
not enough space here.

Calgary did indeed have a Star Bakery for about a decade and it marked
its loaves with stars. From what Dr. Fairie can gather, Frank Claxton,
the owner, was also an unsuccessful municipal political candidate who
eventually left town.

The original age of Cronk appears to have ended around 1910, more than a
century before the new one dawned.

Dr. Fairie’s digital news clippings have led to the creation of a
[Cronk](https://thebigsteak.com/products/cronk-is-good-t-shirt?variant=31874543878259)T-shirt,
which is being sold to raise money for a charity. Perhaps more
important, the drink is being resurrected. A microbrewery in Calgary’s
Inglewood neighborhood is brewing 800 liters of it, using the somewhat
vague recipe Dr. Fairie received.

Blake Belding, the head brewer at [Cold Garden
Brewery,](https://www.coldgarden.ca)told me that in his quest to revive
the drink he will have to use a substitute for sassafras and
sarsaparilla. After buying several pounds of the items, he found that
[food safety laws now
ban](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/did-you-know/root-root-beer-sassafras)
them as possible carcinogens. A neighborhood spice shop helped him
concoct alternatives.

It will take another two to three weeks for the Cronk to fully ferment
to eliminate any danger that its bottles will explode, Mr. Belding said.

His preliminary taste test results are not wholly encouraging.

“It’s not bad," he said. “I don’t know if it’s something I would crush a
12-pack of on the weekend.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And what does Dr. Fairie hope to find when he cracks open his first
bottle of Cronk next month?

“I’m hoping it’s either a 10 out of 10 or a zero out of 10,” he said.
“The worst case scenario would be that it would be kind of
boring.”
