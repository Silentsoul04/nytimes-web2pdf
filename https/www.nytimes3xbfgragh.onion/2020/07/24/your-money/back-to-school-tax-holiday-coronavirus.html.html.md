# 16 States Go Ahead With ‘Back to School’ Sales Tax Holidays

Schools may not reopen, and the “holiday” cuts into government revenue.
But during a pandemic, states may be thinking, why not offer a bit of
relief?

Even though the coronavirus may make “back to school” a misnomer, many
states are going ahead with summer sales tax “holidays” that give
shoppers a break on back-to-school items.

This year, 16 states are temporarily exempting clothing, shoes,
notebooks and other school supplies, sometimes including computers, from
state, and often local, sales taxes.

Shoppers can save up to 9 percent during the promotions, which typically
last for a weekend but can be longer in some states. A handful of states
also waive taxes on items with other themes, like disaster preparedness,
during the summer promotions or at other times of the year.

At least one state, Tennessee, added an extra tax holiday weekend in
August, focused on restaurant spending. “This year, we noted that
consumers who have been cooped up at home might enjoy a sales tax
holiday for purchases in restaurants, either dine in or take out,” State
Representative Susan Lynn, chair of the Tennessee House Finance, Ways
and Means Committee, said in an email.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In many states, details around returning to school are still up in the
air. But a survey by the National Retail Federation, a trade group,
found that families are expecting to spend a record $790, on average, on
back-to-school items this year, particularly on technology. Nearly
two-thirds of families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade
said they expected to buy computers and other electronics, up from about
half last year, because of the potential for digital at-home classes.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty around the school year,” said Katherine
Cullen, the senior director of industry and consumer insights at the
retail federation. “Customers are budgeting for all possible scenarios.”

As details become clearer, she said, families may adjust their spending.
Children need new clothes as they grow regardless of whether they learn
at home or in school, but items like backpacks or lunchboxes may not be
necessary for remote
lessons.

Fewer than half the states with tax holidays include computers on their
tax-exempt menus, and all set limits on the exempt amount, according to
a list compiled by the Federation of Tax Administrators. (The ones that
include computers are Alabama, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, New
Mexico, South Carolina and Tennessee.)

While popular with both politicians and shoppers, sales tax holidays are
generally frowned upon by tax policy experts, who say they offer modest
benefits to most consumers while starving states of revenue for needed
services. Some
[research](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/effect-of-sales-tax-holidays-on-consumer-spending-20170324.htm)
suggests that the holidays shift the timing of purchases rather than
spur new spending.

This year, state sales tax
[revenues](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/covid-19-effect-state-sales-tax-receipts-shrank-6-billion-may)
appear to be in free fall, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy
Center, a joint initiative of two nonprofit think tanks, the Urban
Institute and the Brookings Institution. Because of stay-at-home orders
and business closings in the pandemic, along with tax payment
extensions, state sales tax revenue in May fell $6 billion over all, or
21 percent, from a year earlier, the center calculated. In some states,
the decline was more than 30 percent.

The declines are “unprecedented,” the report noted, and because of the
pandemic, sales tax revenues are unlikely to rebound to normal anytime
soon.

“At a time of public health and revenue crisis,” Lucy Dadayan, senior
research associate at the Tax Policy Center, said in an email, “sales
tax holidays will help some consumers to save very little but at a cost
to governments.”

Recent state financial reports indicate, for instance, that Alabama’s
back-to-school holiday cost the state $8 million, while Oklahoma gave up
$7.4 million, said Janelle Cammenga, a policy analyst with the nonprofit
Tax Foundation. Iowa’s 2015 holiday cost the state $3.6 million.

While those figures are relatively small, Ms. Cammenga said, “sales tax
holiday expenditures represent revenue that is lost without gaining its
intended effect of economic stimulation or job growth.”

Representative Lynn said Tennessee’s two holidays would cost the state
about $25 million in lost revenue. (She noted that the holiday had been
factored into the state budget passed in June, and that local
governments would be made “whole” for local sales taxes lost during the
tax-exempt
periods.)

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Because lost revenue from the tax holidays is typically a small
proportion of state budgets, elected officials may see the promotions as
an easy way to gain public favor without doing too much fiscal damage,
said David Brunori, a specialist in state and local taxation at tax and
auditing consultant RSM and a research professor at George Washington
University Law School.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This year, he said, the thinking among state legislators may be that
people have been suffering with virus-related shutdowns, civil unrest
and now heat waves, so why not offer a bit of relief. “They’re ‘feel
good’ measures,” he said.

Still, the drain on state revenue, combined with the incentive to crowd
into stores looking for bargains when coronavirus cases are surging,
suggests that 2020 may have been a good year for states to skip the tax
holidays, said Dylan Grundman, senior state policy analyst at the
Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. “They should have called them
off this year,” he said.

Here are questions and answers about sales tax holidays:

**How much can I save during a sales tax holiday?**

State sales taxes range from about 4 to 7 percent but can be as high as
9 percent when additional local option sales taxes are included. Most
sales tax holidays include state and local taxes, but some exclude local
taxes or make them optional, reducing the savings.

Your savings may also be limited by a dollar cap on purchases, whether
it is based on the cost of an individual item or on the total receipt.

**I’m not comfortable shopping in stores because of the pandemic. Can I
get the tax break by shopping online?**

Generally, online purchases are eligible for the tax break, tax experts
say. But that option may not help lower-income workers, who may lack
internet access or the flexibility to be home from work to receive
deliveries, Mr. Grundman said.

**What states are holding sales tax holidays this year?**

States holding sales tax promotions in 2020, according to the
[Federation of Tax
Administrators](https://www.taxadmin.org/2020-sales-tax-holiday), are
Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.

Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon don’t charge
statewide sales taxes in the first place. And other states may exempt
clothing and food from sales tax, at least up to certain limits, year
round.
