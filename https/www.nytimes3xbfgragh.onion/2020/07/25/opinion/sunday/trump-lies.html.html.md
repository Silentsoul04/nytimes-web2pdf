It’s no longer interesting, or particularly newsworthy, to point out
that Donald Trump lies. It stopped being interesting a long time ago. He
lied en route to the presidency. He lied about the crowd at his
inauguration. His speech itself was one big lie. And the falsehoods only
metastasized from there.

Why? We’ve covered that, too, most recently in all the chatter about
“Too Much and Never Enough,” by Mary Trump, who is not only his niece
but also a clinical psychologist. He lies because he grew up among
liars. He lies because hyperbole and hooey buoy his fragile ego. He lies
because he is practiced at it, is habituated to it and never seems to
pay much of a price for it.

What intrigues me is that last part: the impunity. I want to understand
how he has gotten away with all of the lying, because I’m desperate to
know whether he’ll continue to.

That’s the question at the heart of his re-election bid, because his
strategy isn’t really “law and order” or racism or a demonization of
liberals as monument-phobic wackadoodles or a [diminution of Joe
Biden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/opinion/trump-biden-age.html)
as a doddering wreck. All of those gambits are there, but they spring
from and burble back to a larger, overarching scheme. His strategy is
fiction. His strategy is lies.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Can he sell enough Americans on the make-believe that he really cares
about the quality of life in cities and is dispatching federal officers
as a constructive measure rather than a provocative one, in a flash of
empathy versus a fit of vanity? He gave himself away a few days ago when
[he punctuated a
mention](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-legend-combatting-violent-crime-american-cities/)
of “the wonderful people of Chicago” with the needless notation that
it’s “a city I know very well.” Everything Trump says is
self-referential, and everything he does is self-reverential.

Can he feed voters the fantasy that his actions in the infancy of this
pandemic saved lives and that our country’s world-leading death toll and
un-flattened curve are more figment than fact or at least more fluke
than indictment? Can he convincingly [don the
mask](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-mask-timeline-avoid-patriotic-1519300)
of a longtime evangelist for masks?

His recent [interview with Chris
Wallace](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/trump-interview-chris-wallace-cognitive-dementia-fox-news.html)
of Fox News was a trial run of this and … wow. Up was down. Black was
white. A superficial check of [his cognitive
coherence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-bragging-cognitive-test-dementia/2020/07/22/6578e826-cb65-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html)
was a profound spelunking of his cerebral glory.

He claimed that Joe Biden had pledged to defund — no, *abolish* — the
police, when Biden had [done nothing of the
kind](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/trumps-false-recurring-claim-about-bidens-stance-on-police/).
He boasted that America’s management of this pandemic made us “the envy
of the world,” when in fact we’re so densely diseased that we’re [barred
from entering most of
Europe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/eu-travel-ban-explained-usa.html).
Oh, and he’s cruising toward four more years: All of those pollsters who
predict otherwise are incompetent fabulists. (Talk about projection.)

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then there are the Trump campaign’s ads, which are “Veep”-grade
caricatures of the usual fakery, not to mention paragons of incompetence
in their own regard. One that appeared on Facebook in early July said,
“WE WILL PROTECT THIS” — just like that, in URGENT CAPITAL LETTERS —
beneath a picture of a statue of Jesus. But Trump won’t be protecting
that statue, because, as eagle-eyed observers noticed, [it was the
Christ the Redeemer
monument](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-camp-vows-to-protect-brazils-most-iconic-statue-from-left-wing-mobs)
that looms over Rio de Janeiro.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another Facebook ad a few weeks later comprised two side-by-side
pictures. Under an image of Trump were the words “Public Safety.” Under
a separate image, of a police officer crumpled on the ground amid
protesters, were “Chaos & Violence.”

Scary\! But, again, foreign. The scene wasn’t Portland or Minneapolis or
Washington or Chicago circa 2020, although that was the obvious
suggestion. The picture, it turns out, was taken in Ukraine. *Six years
ago*. For a more complete and very funny deconstruction of its
infelicity, [read Jonathan Last’s riff in The
Bulwark](https://thebulwark.com/trumps-new-ad-is-amazing/).

The Trump campaign’s television commercials, meanwhile, have [painted a
dystopia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-portland-federal-agents.html)
of rampant criminality in Democratic-controlled metropolises where the
police no longer function or exist. One [shows an elderly woman being
attacked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-portland-federal-agents.html)
by a burglar as she listens to a 911 recording that tells her to “leave
a message.”

If this is Trump’s tenor in July, just imagine October. By the time he’s
done, [Willie
Horton](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/01/politics/willie-horton-ad-1988-explainer-trnd/index.html)
will look like Peter Pan.

It’s beyond ludicrous. But is it too much? I once would have answered an
emphatic yes. Now I just don’t know.

Every president’s election illuminates the moment in which it occurs,
and Trump’s told us something important — and terrifying — about our
relationship with the truth. He relied like no candidate before him on a
new infrastructure of misinformation and disinformation, tweeting toward
Bethlehem while his allies made Mark Zuckerberg their stooge. If you’re
peddling fiction, Twitter and Facebook are the right bazaars.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But they’re hardly the only ones. The web (how aptly named) has fostered
the proliferation of “news” sites with partisan and micro-partisan
agendas. They amount to [flourishing ecosystems for alternate
realities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/30/opinion/internet-violence-hate-prejudice.html).
Many Americans believe that Trump is an underappreciated martyr because
they marinate in selective, manipulated and outright fraudulent
factoids. And Trump and his minions have really figured out how to
slather on the marinade.

When Robert Mueller released the conclusions of his investigation into
the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, everyone focused on its second
section, about Trump, when the first was at least as important. It
documented the [extent and ingenuity of Russia’s attempts to pervert the
election](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/inside-the-mueller-report-a-sophisticated-russian-interference-campaign).
But even many of the people who paid it heed missed the point, which
wasn’t Russia’s nefariousness. It was the process’s corruptibility. It
was the power of lies in a world gone digital.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As for the power of a liar, well, that’s what Trump is testing. He got
away with [lies in his business
career](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/17/us/politics/donald-trump-business.html)
because he chose professional avenues paved with deception and crowded
with con men. Plus he had — and still has — a special talent for
treating drivel as gospel, as long as it’s tumbling from his lips.
That’s the great advantage of the truly amoral: They’re liberated from
any tug of conscience, so there’s no suspicious hesitancy in their
words, no revelatory panic in their eyes. Damn the verities and full
steam ahead.

He got away with lies in 2016 because of social media, because show
business and politics had finally fused to the point where one was
indistinguishable from the other, and because many Americans had grown
so skeptical of traditional candidates that an utterly untraditional one
seemed more trustworthy on some level. Trump was the diet that hadn’t
yet failed them. They were ready to believe.

But to believe now is to ignore the receipts. About 150,000 Americans
have died from Covid-19. Tens of millions have tumbled into financial
ruin or are on the precipice of it. Racial tensions are at a palpable
boil. And Trump keeps having to double back to correct his predictions
and retrace his missteps. Charlotte, Jacksonville, Charlotte: I’ve lost
track of [where the Republicans are convening next
month](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/politics/rnc-jacksonville/index.html)
and of who’s on board, though I remain primed for Trump’s remarks. He
alone can fictionalize it.

From now until Nov. 3, Trump will take the grand inventions that attend
any presidential candidate’s campaign to a newly grandiose level,
signaled by [his insistence a few days
ago](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-072220/)
that he’d “done more for Black Americans than anybody with the possible
exception of Abraham Lincoln.” I love that “possible.” Trump, Lincoln:
It’s a jump ball, really.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So while this election is indeed a contest between two men with two
visions, it’s also something else. It’s the tallest tale Trump has ever
scaled, the greatest story ever told. It’s a referendum on the reaches
of his persuasion. It’s a judgment of the depths of Americans’
gullibility.

Have we cut the cord to reality? Then Trump has a chance. And America
hasn’t a prayer.
