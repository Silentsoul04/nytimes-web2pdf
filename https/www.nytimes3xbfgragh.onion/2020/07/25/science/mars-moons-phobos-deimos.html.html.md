Mars is the darling of many planetary scientists, who continue to visit
it through increasingly advanced robotic explorers. But don’t forget
that our planetary neighbor is adorned with two moons: puny
[Phobos](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/mars-moons/phobos/in-depth/),
a lumpy mass 17 miles across; and diminutive
[Deimos](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/mars-moons/deimos/in-depth/),
just 9 miles long. Their names in ancient Greek may mean “fear” and
“dread’, but the aesthetics of these Lilliputian space potatoes
inspire anything but.

They don’t look anywhere near as interesting as the
[volcanic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/26/science/io-volcanic-moon.html)
or [icy-ocean
moons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/09/science/enceladus-stripes-moon.html)
of Jupiter and Saturn, nor is their
[desolation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/12/science/nasa-moon-apollo-artemis.html)
as extreme or diverse as Earth’s moon. But that hasn’t stopped
generations of planetary scientists from being eager to get a closer
look at the ramshackle duo.

The Soviet Union and, later, Russia have tried three times to reach
Phobos, but [software
errors](https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/space-missions/missions-to-mars.html#phobos2)
and [launch
disasters](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/phobos-grunt/in-depth/)
have doomed every attempt. Scientists in the U.S. have tried and, so
far, failed to convince the powers-that-be at NASA that a
[mission](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC99/pdf/1155.pdf) to the
two moons will be worthwhile. The next great hope is Japan, which is
aiming to launch a heist mission to Phobos in 2024 that will try to
steal some of its rocks.

What’s all the fuss about? For many, the desire to visit Phobos and
Deimos was galvanized by their deeply mysterious nature. “They’re super
weird, confusing and interesting,” said [Abigail
Fraeman](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Fraeman/), a planetary
scientist studying Mars, Phobos and Deimos at NASA’s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We don’t know where the moons came from because they look like asteroids
foreign to the red planet but behave like byproducts of Mars’ early,
impact-laden history. And if that Japanese mission manages to grab some
samples and decode the chemistry of the mangled moons, we might be able
to discover their origins. In doing so, we won’t just gain [a better
understanding of Mars’ ancient
past](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/science/mars-life-water.html).
We will also be able to peer back in time to the chaos that shaped the
early solar system.

Much of what we know about Phobos and Deimos comes from serendipitous
observations. Rovers on the surface as well as mechanical eyes orbiting
Mars are sometimes in the right place to angle their cameras and
[snap](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7674)
[shots](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22392/curiosity-observes-phobos-eclipse-sol-2359/)
of the two moons. Phobos, being larger and closer to Mars, can be seen
in greater detail: a misshapen mess scarred by a large crater and
multiple grooves that look like they were made by a cosmic cat’s claws.

Remote observations of their surfaces haven’t revealed any standout
mineral features or textures that could definitively detail the moons’
overall compositions and, ultimately, their origins, said [Laura
Kerber](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Kerber/), the Mars Odyssey
spacecraft’s deputy project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.

“They check all of the boxes that are consistent with them being these
captured asteroids,” said Dr. Fraeman — rubbly patchworks that drifted
too close to Mars long ago and became trapped in the planet’s orbit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But both moons orbit the equator in a neat-and-tidy circular fashion,
which suggests they coalesced from a disk of debris that danced around a
young Mars. It’s difficult to capture an asteroid and have it “wind up
in this beautiful, symmetric, circular orbit,” said [Jeffrey
Plaut](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Plaut/), the project
scientist for the Mars Odyssey mission.

Mars, having a tenth of Earth’s mass, has a relatively weak
gravitational pull, so it seems improbable that it would be able to
capture asteroids zipping by, said [Tomohiro
Usui](https://planetb.sci.isas.jaxa.jp/aqua/pages/people.html), a
robotic planetary exploration expert at the Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency. But if they formed from a debris disk launched up from Mars
after a colossal impact, Deimos should be orbiting closer to Mars than
it is today.

Reconciling their appearances with their orbits is difficult.

“They just shouldn’t exist,” said Dr. Fraeman. “They don’t make any
sense.”

Cast as siblings, both moons may not even have the same origin story.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In fewer than [100 million
years](https://sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/31031-phobos), said
[Matija Ćuk](https://www.seti.org/our-scientists/matija-cuk), a research
scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., Phobos will
get so close to Mars that its gravity will tear the moon apart,
transforming into a beautiful system of rings.

It won’t be the first time, some scientists say.
[Recent](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2916)
[calculations](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab974f)
suggest that Phobos was once 20 times more massive. But, as one
hypothesis goes, it drifted toward Mars and shattered into ring
material, much of it raining onto Mars. The remaining ring material
clumped together into a new, smaller Phobos. This cycle has repeated
several times over billions of years, with Phobos shrinking with every
completed cycle.

Although made of ancient matter, the Phobos we see today may have been
assembled just 200 million years ago. If it were confirmed that Phobos
is a haphazardly clumped-together mass, it would be a revelation,
suggesting planets with rings [are the
norm](https://webbtelescope.org/resource-gallery/articles/pagecontent/filter-articles/why-do-planets-have-rings?filterUUID=a776e097-0c60-421c-baec-1d8ad049bfb0)
for our solar system.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Tiny Deimos, on the other hand, may have remained intact for 3.5 billion
years. It is on track to eventually escape Mars entirely, Dr. Usui says,
to wander elsewhere in the void.

NASA’s Perseverance rover, launching
[July 30](https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/06/24/launch-of-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover-delayed-to-july-22/),
is the first stage of a protracted series of missions to [bring pristine
samples of Mars back to
Earth](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rocks-rockets-and-robots-the-plan-to-bring-mars-down-to-earth/)
for study. Mars’s atmosphere, ancient volcanism and flowing water has
eroded away many of the planet’s earliest rocks. But if Phobos is made
of Martian flotsam from a massive impact shortly after the planet’s
birth, then the moon has retained the earliest memories of
Mars.

“Many theories suggest the terrestrial planets, including the Earth,
formed dry, and water was delivered by icy meteorites that were
scattered inward,” said Dr. Usui. “If the moons are captured asteroids,
they are evidence of this process in action and their composition shows
what materials were delivered to the early Earth.”

Meteors crashing into Mars could have coated Phobos in a fine layer of
Martian dust sourced from all over the planet. This matter may be both
very young and extremely old, and grabbing some of it will help
scientists unpack “how Mars may have progressed from a habitable world
to an uninhabitable one,” said Dr. Usui.

With one successful (albeit
[problem-riddled](https://gizmodo.com/everything-that-could-go-wrong-for-hayabusa-did-and-ye-1730940605))
asteroid sample-return mission under its belt and
[another](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/science/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-ryugu.html)
speeding back to Earth with more asteroid matter, the Japanese space
agency has a “fairly good track record” at snatching up space rocks,
said Dr. Fraeman. Hopes are understandably high for Japan’s Martian
Moons eXploration, or MMX
[mission](http://mmx.isas.jaxa.jp/en/mission/), which will arrive at
Mars in 2025.

Should it be successful, these huge planetary science questions may
finally have clear answers. We will come to see not just Mars, but also
Earth, in a new light.

“To me, that’s really cool,” said Dr. Fraeman.
