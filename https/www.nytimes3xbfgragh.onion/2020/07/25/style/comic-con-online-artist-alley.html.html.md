# Comic-Con Is Online, and So Is the Artist Alley

Like most large events, fan conventions including San Diego Comic-Con,
WonderCon and Dragon Con, have shifted gears this year as a result of
the coronavirus pandemic. Some have been postponed or canceled; others
have moved their programming online.

While the panels and screenings that take place at these conventions can
easily be streamed from one’s home, the meet-and-greets and spontaneous
connections made at the events have been harder to translate to a
virtual environment. That includes interactions between attendees and
retailers.

The artist alley is a hallmark of fan conventions, populated by people
selling illustrations, paintings, patches, pins, figurines, comics and
other goods that reference popular franchises. Most of those indie
artists make the majority of their yearly sales at these events. And
this year, all of them are feeling the crunch.

“It’s been tough\! From a business perspective, conventions represent a
significant portion of our income stream, so it has made me feel less
secure generally,” [Karen Hallion](https://www.karenhallion.com/), 47,
wrote in an email this week. She is a freelance illustrator and has
produced work for entertainment clients including Marvel and Disney. She
started a Patreon in 2015 to support her personal work, which includes
character mash-ups ([“Doctor Who” meets “Finding
Nemo,”](https://www.karenhallion.com/copy-of-illustrations?pgid=k8nmuqlx1-204a94a8-4e98-4167-9196-eea59aeb58d4)
for example) and a forthcoming children’s book.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now that these artists no longer have a captive audience of convention
attendees, promoting and selling their work online is a must. [Faina
Lorah](http://www.artbyfaina.com/), a painter and illustrator who lives
in Cincinnati, said that a few months ago, as it became clear that the
conventions would not be taking place as usual, she began “overhauling
my storefront and Etsy shop and redesigning my approach with print
on-demand services,” such as Merch by
Amazon.

Ms. Lorah, 30, began her career as a fine artist but shifted to
folklore- and fairytale-inspired work after a few successful convention
runs. She also makes fan art, some of it inspired by characters from the
Super Mario franchise and Hayao Miyazaki’s “Spirited Away.” In a normal
year, Ms. Lorah estimated that 70 percent of her income comes from
convention sales.

Her husband, [Simon Tam](https://www.simontam.org/), 39, a musician who
is a frequent presenter and panelist at conventions including San Diego
Comic-Con, Dragon Con, South by Southwest and Sakura-Con, has been
hosting virtual events during the pandemic. He has also shifted some of
his focus to philanthropy. Through the Slants Foundation, a nonprofit he
formed with his bandmates in 2018, he is “providing grants to artists
who are using their work to counter hate during the pandemic.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In recent years, fan artists have faced challenges from entertainment
companies about intellectual property violations, as many of them use
well-known, copyrighted and trademarked characters and iconography in
their work. The artist alley is an area where their use of protected
imagery can be especially visible, as artists booths appear near
corporate vendors hawking their wares. But many of the artists who rent
tables at conventions also make original art, using characters and
images of their own invention.

Some artists have also made use of social media hashtags like
\#virtualartistalley and convention-specific tags such as \#ECCCOnline
(standing for “Emerald City Comic Con online”) to make their work more
discoverable online.

In addition to the lost revenue, Ms. Hallion, who lives in Swampscott,
Mass., said that she missed the feeling of gathering with other artists.

“I have a little ‘con family’ of fellow artist friends scattered all
over the country, and these shows are the only time we get to see each
other in real life and spend time together,” she said. “It can feel
isolating working in my studio all the time, so conventions always were
a welcome break from all of the alone time.”
