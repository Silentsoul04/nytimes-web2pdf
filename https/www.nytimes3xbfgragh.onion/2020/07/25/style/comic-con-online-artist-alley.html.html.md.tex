Indie artists who make a significant portion of their income at fan
conventions are hoping virtual attendees will be willing to spend.

Like most large events, fan conventions including San Diego Comic-Con,
WonderCon and Dragon Con, have shifted gears this year as a result of
the coronavirus pandemic. Some have been postponed or canceled; others
have moved their programming online.

While the panels and screenings that take place at these conventions can
easily be streamed from one's home, the meet-and-greets and spontaneous
connections made at the events have been harder to translate to a
virtual environment. That includes interactions between attendees and
retailers.

The artist alley is a hallmark of fan conventions, populated by people
selling illustrations, paintings, patches, pins, figurines, comics and
other goods that reference popular franchises. Most of those indie
artists make the majority of their yearly sales at these events. And
this year, all of them are feeling the crunch.

``It's been tough! From a business perspective, conventions represent a
significant portion of our income stream, so it has made me feel less
secure generally,'' \href{https://www.karenhallion.com/}{Karen Hallion},
47, wrote in an email this week. She is a freelance illustrator and has
produced work for entertainment clients including Marvel and Disney. She
started a Patreon in 2015 to support her personal work, which includes
character mash-ups
(\href{https://www.karenhallion.com/copy-of-illustrations?pgid=k8nmuqlx1-204a94a8-4e98-4167-9196-eea59aeb58d4}{``Doctor
Who'' meets ``Finding Nemo,''} for example) and a forthcoming children's
book.

Now that these artists no longer have a captive audience of convention
attendees, promoting and selling their work online is a must.
\href{http://www.artbyfaina.com/}{Faina Lorah}, a painter and
illustrator who lives in Cincinnati, said that a few months ago, as it
became clear that the conventions would not be taking place as usual,
she began ``overhauling my storefront and Etsy shop and redesigning my
approach with print on-demand services,'' such as Merch by Amazon.

Ms. Lorah, 30, began her career as a fine artist but shifted to
folklore- and fairytale-inspired work after a few successful convention
runs. She also makes fan art, some of it inspired by characters from the
Super Mario franchise and Hayao Miyazaki's ``Spirited Away.'' In a
normal year, Ms. Lorah estimated that 70 percent of her income comes
from convention sales.

Her husband, \href{https://www.simontam.org/}{Simon Tam}, 39, a musician
who is a frequent presenter and panelist at conventions including San
Diego Comic-Con, Dragon Con, South by Southwest and Sakura-Con, has been
hosting virtual events during the pandemic. He has also shifted some of
his focus to philanthropy. Through the Slants Foundation, a nonprofit he
formed with his bandmates in 2018, he is ``providing grants to artists
who are using their work to counter hate during the pandemic.''

\href{https://asunnydisposish.wixsite.com/portfolio}{Jenny Park}, an
illustrator in Cypress, Calif., whose work references video games like
Overwatch and Fire Emblem, has been hosting virtual mini-conventions
from her living room alongside other creators. She said she has seen her
fellow indie artists band together during this time.

``I think there's this greater sense of community and wanting to help
each other succeed, because Covid has affected everyone across the
board,'' Ms. Park, 29, said.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In recent years, fan artists have faced challenges from entertainment
companies about intellectual property violations, as many of them use
well-known, copyrighted and trademarked characters and iconography in
their work. The artist alley is an area where their use of protected
imagery can be especially visible, as artists booths appear near
corporate vendors hawking their wares. But many of the artists who rent
tables at conventions also make original art, using characters and
images of their own invention.

Some artists have also made use of social media hashtags like
\#virtualartistalley and convention-specific tags such as \#ECCCOnline
(standing for ``Emerald City Comic Con online'') to make their work more
discoverable online.

In addition to the lost revenue, Ms. Hallion, who lives in Swampscott,
Mass., said that she missed the feeling of gathering with other artists.

``I have a little `con family' of fellow artist friends scattered all
over the country, and these shows are the only time we get to see each
other in real life and spend time together,'' she said. ``It can feel
isolating working in my studio all the time, so conventions always were
a welcome break from all of the alone time.''
