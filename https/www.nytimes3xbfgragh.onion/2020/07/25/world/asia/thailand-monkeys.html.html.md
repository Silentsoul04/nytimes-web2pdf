# These Monkeys Were Once Revered. Now They Are Taking Over.

</div>

The monkeys of Lopburi, Thailand, were once a draw for tourists and
pilgrims who would feed them. But with few recent visitors, the monkeys
are getting hungry — and aggressive.

LOPBURI, Thailand — The customers waiting outside a bank in Lopburi,
Thailand, left their jewelry at home and kept other treasures out of
sight. But danger lurked anyway.

In broad daylight, they watched a thief steal an iced tea and a vandal
brazenly attack a motorcycle seat. One woman quit her place in the line,
when a stalker crept up and threatened to bite her.

With a sigh, a police officer brandished a slingshot, and the monkeys
scattered. Less than a minute later, they were back.

Lopburi, a onetime capital of a Siamese kingdom and a repository of
ancient architecture, is a city under siege. Crab-eating macaques, a
Southeast Asian species with piercing eyes and curious natures, have
spilled out of the temples where they were once revered and taken over
the heart of the old town.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Their growing population, at least 8,400 in the area with most
concentrated in a few city blocks, has decimated parts of the local
economy. With territorial troupes of macaques roaming the neighborhood,
dozens of businesses — including a music school, gold shop, barber,
cellphone store and movie theater — have been forced to close in recent
years.

The coronavirus pandemic has added to the chaos. The frolicking monkeys
drew droves of tourists as well as Buddhist faithful, who believe
feeding the animals is a meritorious deed. Their favorite offerings
included coconut yogurt, strawberry soda and brightly colored snack
packs. Now the macaques don’t understand where that source of sustenance
has gone. And they are hungry.

Over the years, the monkeys moved into abandoned buildings, trashing

off parked cars.

Dangling earrings, sunglasses and plastic bags that look like they may

the city most densely packed with the animals, many residents live in
fear of the next sneak
attack.

But in a Buddhist-majority culture in which culling monkeys would
disturb spiritual sensibilities, local officials and residents have few
options to fend off the gangs of macaques. Besides, in the past, the
monkeys drew tourists to Lopburi. Without them, the economy might suffer
even more.

At a hardware store across the street from the ruins of a 13th-century
Hindu temple, oversized stuffed animals in the shape of crocodiles and
tigers peer out at the street where the monkey traffic outpaces that of
pedestrians. The plush toys were meant to scare away the monkeys and it
worked for a couple months. But the macaques soon figured out that they
weren’t real, said Yupa Srisanguan, the shop owner.

“It has never been this bad,” Ms. Yupa said, as a young male macaque
wandered into her store, intent on chewing the loops of rubber hose
hanging from the ceiling. “We’re not against the monkeys, but it’s
difficult when people are afraid of being bitten when they come to our
store.”

When she was a little girl, Ms. Yupa, 70, said, the monkeys were fewer,
bigger and healthier, their fur shiny and thick. They kept to the
temples, as well as the ruins of the ancient Khmer civilization that
once held sway over this part of central Thailand.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But with an influx of monkey-enchanted visitors, some foreign, came an
easy and often unhealthy font of food. Along with bananas and citrus,
the macaques feasted on junk. Their fur thinned. Some went bald. Without
having to worry about their next meal, the monkeys, which can give birth
twice a year, had more time for other pursuits. The population exploded.

Compared with the monkeys of the forest, their urban counterparts have
less muscle and are more susceptible to hypertension and blood disease,
said Narongporn Doodduem, the director of a regional office of the
Wildlife Conservation Department.

“The monkeys are never hungry,” he said, “just like children who eat too
much KFC.”

As traffic recently piled up at a light in old town Lopburi, Nirad
Pholngeun, a police officer, kept his slingshot at the ready. He has
been stationed at this street corner for five years and has watched the
growing monkey population with alarm.

A truck, presumably from out of town, idled at the light, its flatbed
filled with crates of fruit for the market. A monkey spotted the
produce, wove through the traffic, leapt onto the truck and held aloft a
juicy dragon fruit. The one expeditionary macaque drew dozens more. By
the time the light turned green, the crates were cleared and the gorging
began.

Throughout the mayhem, Mr. Nirad raised his slingshot but there was

tactic was a charade anyway. The slingshot held no projectiles.

“It’s hopeless,” he said. “Within a blink of an eye there are more
monkeys. So many babies.”

Local wildlife officials have begun sterilizing the monkeys en masse to
control their numbers. More than 300 animals underwent surgery last
month, and 200 more will be sterilized in August.

Capturing the monkeys for the operations is a major undertaking, said
Mr. Narongporn, the wildlife official. On the first day of the June
campaign, the monkey catchers wore camouflage-printed uniforms and lured
the animals into cages with food. But by the second day, the monkeys
knew to avoid them. The monkey catchers had to switch to wearing shorts
and floral shirts, pretending they were
holidaymakers.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“The monkeys are smart,” Mr. Narongporn said. “They remember.”

With the coronavirus dissuading many tourists and Buddhist pilgrims from
visiting Lopburi, local residents have taken to feeding the monkeys
themselves.

“We can’t let them starve,” said Itiphat Tansitikulphati, the owner of
the Muang Thong
Hotel.

Every day, an old female monkey calls on his hotel, waiting politely for
her meal to be served. Banana cake is her favorite, but plain fruit will
do, too.

“A long time ago, a lot of Lopburi was forest so we are taking the land
from the monkeys,” Mr. Itiphat said.

A third generation hotelier, he has relinquished the top floor to the
monkeys, who have wrecked it with the zeal of drunken partygoers,
ripping up wooden planks and shredding corrugated metal.

An electric fence protects the ground floor of the hotel. But even
before the coronavirus hit, visitors, many of whom were traveling
businesspeople, were scared off by the marauding monkeys, Mr. Itiphat
said. His hotel barely survives.

“The balance between humans and monkeys is off,” he said. “It hurts
business.”

Nearby, Patiphan Tantiwong runs a general store on the main street of
Lopburi. He has given in to the macaques. A plump male sat on bags of
dog food, sipping a yogurt drink. A clutch of youngsters swarmed a
counter waiting for handouts of cookies. There were monkeys among the
piles of batteries and monkeys among the light bulbs.

The babies squeaked and played a form of macaque peekaboo.

“The monkeys were here before us,” Mr. Patiphan said, as a juvenile
tugged on the hem of his trousers demanding a treat. “We have to adapt
to them, not the other way
around.”
