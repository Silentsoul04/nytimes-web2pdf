WASHINGTON — Step by step, blow by blow, the [United States and
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/podcasts/the-daily/china-trump-foreign-policy.html)
are dismantling decades of political, economic and social engagement,
setting the stage for [a new era of
confrontation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/26/world/asia/united-states-china-conflict.html)
shaped by the views of [the most hawkish
voices](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/world/asia/cold-war-china-us.html)
on both sides.

With President Trump [trailing badly in the
polls](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/upshot/biden-polls-demographics.html)
as the election nears, his national security officials have intensified
[their attack on
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-us-china.html)
in recent weeks, targeting its officials, diplomats and executives.
While the strategy has reinforced a key campaign message, some American
officials, worried Mr. Trump will lose, are also trying to engineer
irreversible changes, according to people familiar with the thinking.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has inflamed the fight, brushing aside
international concern about the country’s rising authoritarianism to
consolidate his own political power and to crack down on basic freedoms,
from
[Xinjiang](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html)
to [Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html).
By doing so, he has hardened attitudes in Washington, fueling a clash
that at least some in China believe could be dangerous to the country’s
interests.

The combined effect could prove to be Mr. Trump’s most consequential
foreign policy legacy, [even if it’s not one he has consistently
pursued](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/politics/trump-china-bolton.html):
the entrenchment of a fundamental strategic and ideological
confrontation between the world’s two largest economies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A state of broad and intense competition is the end goal of the
president’s hawkish advisers. In their view, confrontation and coercion,
aggression and antagonism should be the status quo with the Chinese
Communist Party, no matter who is leading the United States next year.
They call it “reciprocity.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [declared in a
speech](https://www.state.gov/communist-china-and-the-free-worlds-future/)
on Thursday that the relationship should be based on the principle of
“distrust and verify,” saying that the [diplomatic
opening](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1972/02/24/archives/nixon-talks-further-with-chou-and-drives-to-view-great-wall-wider.html)
orchestrated by President Richard M. Nixon nearly half a century ago had
ultimately undermined American interests.

“We must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and
decades to come: that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not
the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of
blind engagement with China simply won’t get it done,” Mr. Pompeo said.
“We must not continue it and we must not return to it.”

The events of the last week brought relations to yet another low,
[accelerating the downward
spiral](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/world/asia/cold-war-china-us.html).

On Tuesday, the State Department ordered China to [shut down its Houston
consulate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html),
prompting diplomats there to burn documents in a courtyard. On Friday,
in retaliation, China ordered the United States to close its consulate
in the southwestern city of Chengdu. The Chinese Foreign Ministry the
next day denounced what it called “forced entry” into the Houston
consulate by U.S. law enforcement officers on Friday afternoon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In between, the Department of Justice announced [criminal
charges](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/researchers-charged-visa-fraud-after-lying-about-their-work-china-s-people-s-liberation-army)
against four members of the People’s Liberation Army for lying about
their status in order to operate as undercover intelligence operatives
in the United States. All four have been arrested. One, Tang Juan, who
was studying at the University of California, Davis, ignited a
diplomatic standoff when she sought refuge in the Chinese consulate in
San Francisco, but was taken into custody on Thursday night.

This comes on top of a month in which the administration [announced
sanctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/world/asia/trump-china-sanctions-uighurs.html)
on senior Chinese officials, including a member of the ruling Politburo,

The administration has also [imposed a travel
ban](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/us/politics/china-hong-kong-trump-student-visas.html)
on Chinese students at graduate level or higher with ties to military
institutions in China. Officials are discussing whether to [do the same
to members of the Communist
Party](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/politics/china-travel-ban.html)
and their families, a sweeping move that could put 270 million people on
a blacklist.

“Below the president, Secretary Pompeo and other members of the
administration appear to have broader goals,” said Ryan Hass, a China
director on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council who is
now at the Brookings Institution.

“They want to reorient the U.S.-China relationship toward an
all-encompassing systemic rivalry that cannot be reversed by the outcome
of the upcoming U.S. election,” he said. “They believe this
reorientation is needed to put the United States on a competitive
footing against its 21st-century geostrategic rival.”

From the start, Mr. Trump has vowed to change the relationship with
China, but mainly when it comes to trade. Early this year, the
[negotiated
truce](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html)
in the countries’ trade war was hailed by some aides as a signature
accomplishment. That deal is still in effect, though hanging by a
thread, overshadowed by the broader fight.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Beyond China, few of the administration’s foreign policy goals have been
fully achieved. Mr. Trump’s personal diplomacy with Kim Jong-un, the
North Korean leader, has [done nothing to end the country’s nuclear
weapons
program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/world/asia/korea-nuclear-trump-kim.html?searchResultPosition=5).

His [withdrawal from the Iran nuclear
deal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-speech-iran-deal.html?searchResultPosition=40)
has further alienated allies and made that country’s leaders even more
belligerent. His effort to change the government [in
Venezuela](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/world/americas/coronavirus-venezuela-maduro-guaido.html?searchResultPosition=2)
failed. His promised withdrawal of all American troops f[rom
Afghanistan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/world/asia/afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-election-day.html?searchResultPosition=2)
has yet to occur.

In Beijing, some officials and analysts have publicly dismissed many of
the Trump administration’s moves as campaign politics, accusing Mr.
Pompeo and others of promoting a Cold War mentality to score points for
an uphill re-election fight. There is a growing recognition, though,
that the conflict’s roots run deeper.

The breadth of the administration’s campaign has vindicated those in
China — and possibly Mr. Xi himself — who have long suspected that the
United States will never accept the country’s growing economic and
military might, or its authoritarian political system.

“It’s not just electoral considerations,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an
associate professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin
University in Beijing. “It is also a natural escalation and a result of
the inherent contradictions between China and the United States.”

Already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, some Chinese officials
have sought to avoid open conflict with the United States. They have
urged the Trump administration to reconsider each of its actions and
called for cooperation, not confrontation, albeit without offering
significant concessions of their
own.

Given the size of each nation’s economy and their entwinement, there are
limits to the unwinding of relations, or what some Trump officials call
“decoupling.” In the United States, tycoons and business executives,
who exercise enormous sway among politicians of both parties, will
continue to push for a more moderate approach, as members of Mr. Trump’s
cabinet who represent Wall Street interests [have
done](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/02/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-china.html).
China is making leaps in science, technology and education that
Americans and citizens of other Western nations will want to share in.
In his Thursday speech, even Mr. Pompeo acknowledged, “China is deeply
integrated into the global economy.”

Only two weeks ago, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, called on the United
States to step back from confrontation and work with China. In reality,
officials in Beijing appear resigned to the likelihood that nothing will
change for the better before next year.

“There is very little China can do to take the initiative,” said Wu
Qiang, an independent analyst in Beijing. “It has very few proactive
options.”

Mr. Trump whipsaws in his language on China. He has called Mr. Xi “a
very, very good ****** friend” and even privately encouraged him to keep
building mass internment camps for Muslims and handle the Hong Kong
pro-democracy protesters his way, according to a new book by John R.
Bolton, the former national security adviser. When he last spoke with
Mr. Xi, he expressed [“much
respect\!”](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1243407157321560071?lang=en)
on Twitter.

With the election looming, Mr. Trump’s tone has changed. He has returned
to bashing China, as he did in 2016, blaming Beijing for the pandemic
and even referring to the coronavirus with a racist phrase, “Kung Flu.”
His campaign aides have made aggressive rhetoric on China a pillar of
their strategy, believing it could help energize voters.

The heated language, combined with the administration’s policy actions,
could actually be having a galvanizing effect on Chinese citizens, some
analysts and political figures in Beijing say.

“I strongly urge American people to re-elect Trump because his team has
many crazy members like Pompeo,” Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalist
newspaper Global Times, [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/huxijin_gt/status/1286362851527950336) on
Friday. “They help China strengthen solidarity and cohesion in a special
way.”

The relationship might not change course even if former Vice President
Joseph R. Biden Jr. defeats Mr. Trump in November. The idea of orienting
American policy toward competition with China has had robust bipartisan
support over the last three-and-a-half years.

The Chinese government’s initial mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak
and its actions in Hong Kong, which is widely seen as a beacon of
liberal values within China, have been signal moments this year,
contributing to the tectonic shift in views across the political
spectrum.

The China hawks in the administration have seized on them to publicly
push their perspective: that the Chinese Communist Party seeks to expand
its ideology and authoritarian vision worldwide, and that citizens of
liberal nations must wake up to the dangers and gird themselves for a
conflict that could last for decades.

Since late June, the administration has rolled out four top officials to
make that case.

Attorney General William P. Barr accused American companies of
“[corporate
appeasement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-remarks-china-policy-gerald-r-ford-presidential),”
while Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director, said his agency was opening

Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, warned that the
Chinese Communist Party [aimed to remake the
world](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/chinese-communist-partys-ideology-global-ambitions/)
in its image. “The effort to control thought beyond the borders of China
is well underway,” he said.

Mr. Pompeo’s speech on Thursday was meant as the punctuation mark. He
chose the presidential library of the man credited with opening up
U.S.-China relations [to declare the policy a
failure](https://www.state.gov/communist-china-and-the-free-worlds-future/).

“President Nixon once said he feared he had created a ‘Frankenstein’ by
opening the world to the C.C.P.,” Mr. Pompeo said, referring to the
Chinese Communist Party, “and here we
are.”

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: A cooperative relationship with China has been a pillar of
    the United States’ foreign policy for more than half a century.
    Edward Wong on why the Trump administration believes it’s time for a
    change.
    
    It’s Wednesday, July 29.
    
    Edward, can you tell me what happened in Houston last week?

  - edward wong  
    Sure. We first got a tip that something was up with the Chinese
    consulate in Houston around Tuesday afternoon or so — that the
    Chinese ambassador to the U.S. had been told by American officials
    that he had three days to shut down the consulate, and that the
    employees here had 30 days to then leave the country. And a
    colleague and I started chasing this tip, but we couldn’t quite nail
    it down to publish a story.

  - archived recording  
    Right now at 10, breaking news —

edward wong

And then —

  - archived recording 1  
    Houston firefighters and police responding to the Chinese consulate
    in Montrose after reports of a fire.

  - archived recording 2  
    Crews were called to the building off Montrose and Herald about 8:20
    tonight.

edward wong

In the evening, I started seeing these videos of people burning things
in metal barrels, in open metal barrels. And there was video of fire
trucks and police cars surrounding the consulate with their lights on,
so it’s quite a dramatic scene.

  - archived recording  
    And local media were reporting that documents appeared to be being
    burned in the courtyard of that building.

edward wong

You know, for people in the national security world and the foreign
policy world, when you see people burning lots of documents or papers at
a diplomatic mission, the assumption is that they’re about to clear out
of the mission. So when I saw those videos, I realized that the tip we
had gotten that the Chinese ambassador had been told to shut down the
Houston consulate within three days was indeed true.

  - archived recording (wang wenbin)  
    On July the 21st, the U.S. abruptly asked China to close its
    consulate in Houston.

edward wong

And within hours, the Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that in
Beijing.

  - archived recording (wang wenbin)  
    We urge the U.S. to reverse this incorrect decision immediately.
    Otherwise, China will definitely take necessary legitimate actions.

michael barbaro

And why would the U.S. take this pretty significant move of kicking
these Chinese diplomats out of this consulate in Texas?

edward wong

Officially, people in American government told us that they targeted the
Houston consulate because it was a hub of economic espionage and trade
secrets espionage in the U.S. But American officials haven’t given us
detailed evidence on the activities undertaken by the Chinese diplomats.
And it’s not clear to us how much farther these activities go beyond the
types of covert or espionage activities that take place at missions
around the world, including ones run by Americans. But in the bigger
picture, a main goal of some American officials in the Trump
administration is to unwind a range of diplomatic and economic ties that
have built up between the U.S. and China over the decades ever since
President Nixon started the opening of China back in 1971.

michael barbaro

So there’s a version of this where the U.S. was looking for a reason to
unwind this relationship, and espionage — real or not — was that reason.

edward wong

Right.

michael barbaro

And why would the Trump administration want to unwind its relationship
with China? I mean, it’s our single biggest trading partner. It’s a
global superpower. It’s a nuclear power, so that’s a pretty significant
decision.

edward wong

It is significant, and there are some senior officials in the
administration who are against this. Throughout the last three and a
half years, we’ve seen, broadly speaking, two factions of advisers on
China competing against each other for Trump’s ear. And that helps
explain some of the contradictory impulses and policies that we’ve seen
coming out of the administration on China during this period.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

edward wong

On one side, you had the ones wanting to confront China, in part over
trade, and also in part over national security matters. You had Peter
Navarro, who’s a White House trade adviser.

  - archived recording (peter navarro)  
    How do you work with a country that lies through its teeth?

edward wong

Who wrote a book called “Death by China,” and then you also had
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

  - archived recording (mike pompeo)  
    They very much want to undermine our Western values, all the things
    that we hold most dear.

edward wong

And those people saw China as a threat to America. And then on the more
cooperative side, you have, for example, Treasury Secretary Steve
Mnuchin.

  - archived recording (steve mnuchin)  
    We need to work together to maximize the benefit for both sides.

edward wong

People who still clung to the classic notions of free trade and thought
that the traditional relationship with China was a stabilizing force in
the world. And that this had helped American companies get wealthy over
the years, as well as had benefited American consumers.

michael barbaro

And Edward, when comes to those who want to confront China, when it
comes to the Peter Navarros and the Mike Pompeos, what is their case for
why China is such a threat to the U.S. and should be reined in?

edward wong

Well, they argue that China presents a range of strategic threats to the
U.S. For example, they say that China’s attempts to export its 5G
technology, its next generation communications technology, around the
world presents a security threat. They say that China’s recent military
expansionism in the South China Sea, and its vast maritime claims in
that sea, are also a security threat, and they would impede American
military dominance in the Asia-Pacific. They point to attempts at
economic espionage by China and a vast range of cyber attacks that have
targeted the American government and other important institutions around
the world.

michael barbaro

Am I right to think that, from the start of his presidency, the
confrontation camp more or less prevailed?

edward wong

Well, it’s complicated. The first big blow to the U.S.-China
relationship under the Trump administration was in mid-2018.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    We’re going to have some incredible things. We’re just announcing
    very big tariffs today on China, because China has been —

edward wong

When President Trump started putting tariffs on billions of dollars of
goods made in China, China retaliated by doing the same on American
goods.

  - archived recording  
    So here’s what they would do. They target farm products such as
    soybean cars, seafood —

edward wong

And then just spiral downward from there.

  - archived recording 1  
    Medical equipment, energy products, that would start a little bit —

  - archived recording 2  
    As the U.S.-China trade war escalates, business leaders have been
    speaking up. FedEx C.E.O. —

edward wong

So the trade war had this huge impact on companies, both in the U.S. and
outside of the U.S. And it created a lot of instability in their
thinking about how to do business.

  - archived recording  
    The escalating trade battle between the U.S. and China is rocking
    investors around the world.

edward wong

It created a lot of instability in the stock markets, which Trump
watches closely. And —

  - archived recording  
    Some farmers in the U.S.A., the disruption of normal trade with
    China has forced many of them to go bankrupt.

edward wong

Important groups of voters who had supported Trump, for example, farmers
in the Midwest, were starting to suffer.

  - archived recording  
    I was a Trump voter. I voted for the president, certainly. But he
    certainly hasn’t come through. He’s lost on trade. He’s lost on
    trade, and certainly —

edward wong

They saw agricultural products like corn and soybeans piling up in the
Midwest, because China had imposed tariffs on their end to strike back
at Trump.

  - archived recording  
    So I won’t be voting for the president again.

edward wong

So Trump and some of his economic advisers, especially those who were
preaching more cooperation with China, started to get nervous about
these economic signs that they were seeing, as well as about the
anxieties of these midwestern farmers and potential Trump voters there.

michael barbaro

And so what do they do, these cooperation camp folks who are not happy
with this trade war?

edward wong

Well, as they go through negotiations for a potential truce to the trade
war, President Trump talks with President Xi of China several times. And
they have these, like, sort of one-on-one conversations that Trump likes
to do with leaders. And in each of these, Trump sort of cozies up to Xi,
and it’s clear he’s willing to sort of brush aside a lot of sort of the
most egregious behaviors of China in the pursuit of this trade deal.

michael barbaro

Like what?

edward wong

In one conversation, according to John Bolton — the former national
security adviser — Trump encouraged Xi to actually continue building
internment camps for Muslims in the northwest of China and sort of
signaled that this wasn’t a big issue for him.

michael barbaro

These are the Uighurs?

edward wong

Right, these are the Uighurs, exactly. The ones a million or more held
over recent years in internment camps. And, for example, we’ve seen
these, during this period, these pro-democracy protests arise in Hong
Kong. And while Trump’s national security aides are supportive of them,
Trump himself tells Xi privately in a phone call that Xi should just
handle those in whatever way he wants to deal with those, and that Trump
himself will not say anything about those, and he’ll tell his aides not
to say anything vocally among those protests either.

michael barbaro

So in this trade war that’s supposed to represent confrontation with
China, there’s actually a fair amount of cooperation going on, most of
it behind the scenes.

edward wong

Right, exactly. And ultimately, in December, they reach a tentative
agreement, and then they signed that in January of this year. And I
think that brought a big sense of relief to the people in the
cooperation camp. I think they were relieved to see a sense of stability
returned to this key economic relationship. Now, the confrontation
people in the White House and in other agencies were generally
disappointed, I think, by the outcome of the deal. They felt that Trump
had sidelined a lot of the hardline policies they had pushed for in the
first half of the administration for the sake of just trying to get a
marginal increase in agricultural purchases. And also, there is a sense
of outrage among some of them.

And this was in John Bolton’s recent book, that Trump was also aiming
for this negotiated truce purely for re-election purposes. That he
pleaded with Xi in a conversation that Xi should get help him get
re-elected, should help him win, and that the best way to do this was to
reach some sort of truce or deal in the trade war that he could then
bring back to his constituents. And so certain national security people
were outraged by this, saying that Trump was focused purely on personal
politics and was not looking after the national security interests of
the United States.

michael barbaro

Edward, what you’re describing so far, especially this trade deal, does
not seem like a relationship that is about to be fundamentally unwound
and blown up. So what happens to get us from that truce to now, into the
shutdown of this consulate in Houston?

edward wong

Well, what changes things is this pandemic that starts in central China
and spreads across the globe.

That sets the two powers on a much more confrontational course.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    I spoke with President Xi. We had a great talk. He’s working very
    hard. I have to say he’s working very, very hard.

edward wong

So in the first weeks after the virus started spreading around the
globe, Trump was still praising Xi publicly.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    If you know anything about him, I think he’ll be in pretty good
    shape. They’ve had a rough patch, and I think right now, they have
    it — it looks like they’re getting it under control more and more.

edward wong

This was in January and February right after they had signed the trade
agreement, so Trump was still in this mode where he wanted intensely to
preserve that negotiated truce. But by the spring —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    We got hit by the virus that came from China.

edward wong

Trump was laying into China publicly for what had happened. You know,
the pandemic had spread into all corners of the U.S. The economy was in
shambles. Trump was seeing his re-election chances starting to go down
the drain.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    And we continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus.

  - archived recording  
    Why do you keep using this? A lot of people say it’s racist.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    Because it comes from China. It’s not racist at all, no. Not at all.
    It comes from China. That’s why. It comes from China. I want to be
    accurate.

edward wong

And so his campaign strategists came up with this idea that they can try
and shift the conversation to China, rather than having people focused
on Trump’s failures on the pandemic. And that by blaming China for all
of this, they could win back some of the votes that Trump’s starting to
lose. Some of his top advisers. started speculating whether the virus
might have started from a lab accident —

  - archived recording  
    I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that
    this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

edward wong

— even though there was no evidence for that.

  - archived recording  
    Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of
    confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of
    this virus?

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    Yes, I have. Yes, I have.

edward wong

So you have this very concerted effort by Trump to really cast China as
the person or the entity to blame for all of this.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    China’s cover-up of the Wuhan virus allowed the disease to spread
    all over the world, instigating a global pandemic.

michael barbaro

And where does the pandemic fit into the kind of now familiar outlines
that you have described of the confrontation camp versus the cooperation
camp? I have to imagine it kind of challenges both.

edward wong

The pandemic really empowers the hawks in the administration to say, we
really have to go after China. Look at how their misgovernance, how
their political system led us to this point — led America into an
economic crisis that’s been the worst since the Great Depression. And
even the people in the cooperation camp are starting to change their
minds a bit. It’s hard to tell the world that we should prioritize this
trade agreement that just rests on some agriculture purchases when
you’ve got this global crisis enveloping everything, and when American
citizens are anxious about their future.

michael barbaro

And how does China respond to these attacks from Trump and from his
advisers?

edward wong

So what we’re hearing this spring is Chinese officials denouncing the
U.S. for all of these attacks. And they also point out that the Chinese
system actually has handled the virus a lot better than the American
system. They say even though there might have been this outbreak in
central China, look at how we controlled it through the measures we
took, and look at how the virus is running rampant in the U.S. And China
also then starts to try and send out aid to other countries. It starts
sending shipments of, for example, medical supplies, medical equipment,
facemasks, to other countries around the world, and even to parts of the
U.S., to try and sort of mask over its own responsibility for how the
outbreak began in its country. So the relationship between the two
powers was bad, and then it got worse.

  - archived recording  
    And we have some breaking news coming in. China’s annual
    parliamentary meeting has been officially opened in Beijing, and
    it’s expected that national security legislation for Hong Kong
    will be discussed during the seven-day session.

edward wong

In the late spring, Chinese officials start talking about this new
national security law that they want to impose on Hong Kong.

  - archived recording 1  
    Well, the specifics of the news has sent shockwaves across the city.

  - archived recording 2  
    It says Beijing will set up a new National Security Bureau in Hong
    Kong, supervised by the central government to crack down on dissent
    in the city.

  - archived recording  
    The legislation has faced sharp criticism from governments all
    around the world and sparked new protests in Hong Kong.

edward wong

And so this continues the downward spiral that U.S.-China relations have
been on.

michael barbaro

Right, and I’m imagining that that security law was especially upsetting
to those who want confrontation with China. That seems to be exactly the
kind of thing that they find so objectionable.

edward wong

That’s right. As you recall, they were very upset at Trump for putting
the Hong Kong issue on the backburner in his aim to try and reach some
sort of trade truce with China. And now they were intent on pushing
forward on policies and actions that would make the Communist Party pay
a price, not only for what they would do in Hong Kong, but for their
actions in other parts of the world and for their role in the pandemic.
So they started announcing a series of actions against China that really
brought the relationship to a new low. They said that Hong Kong was no
longer an autonomous entity, and that the U.S. would break off its
special relationship with Hong Kong.

michael barbaro

Wow.

edward wong

They imposed visa restrictions on a category of students who were
associated with military institutions in China. They said that these
students can no longer come to the U.S. to do research or study because
of suspicions of potential economic espionage. They’ve even floated a
proposal internally to block all 92 million members of the Communist
Party from traveling to the U.S., as well as their family members, which
could encompass hundreds of millions of people. It’s really felt like a
moment where the gloves have been taken off in this relationship, and
where the people in the administration who want to fundamentally
reorient the relationship with China have the upper hand right now.

michael barbaro

Edward, is it possible that, at the end of the day, what you’re
describing here and the events of the past couple of weeks, it’s the
right strategy for the U.S.? Because China is behaving in ways that
fundamentally violate American values, especially in Hong Kong,
especially with the Uighurs. And so no matter what motivates Donald
Trump to begin confronting China, is that potentially a good thing for
the United States?

edward wong

Well, the people who are supportive of the more confrontational approach
say that this type of strategy on China is long overdue. Now it’s time
to really push back against China on all these fronts, especially at a
time when China hasn’t overtaken the U.S. yet as the world’s largest
economy and it’s still a rising power. And this is a moment when we have
this opening to really reframe the conversation on China, not only U.S.,
but globally, and sort of rally countries to really confront China on a
whole range of issues.

michael barbaro

Right. So basically, this is our last chance?

edward wong

Right. They see it as time running out. Then you’ve got people on the
other camp who say, we don’t know where this will end. This starts this
downward spiral in relations that starts to erode all the diplomatic
ties, economic ties, the people-to-people ties that have kept the
relationship firm over the decades, a relationship that’s an unlikely
one. You’ve got this close relationship between a Western democracy and
an authoritarian state. And somehow, they’ve managed to avoid open
conflict. They’ve managed to avoid war. And where could we end up, where
could the world end up if we start breaking off those ties now?

michael barbaro

Right. It could end up in a pretty dangerous place.

edward wong

Right.

michael barbaro

So I want to return to where we started this conversation, Edward, which
is with the U.S. kicking China out of this consulate in Houston, because
it very much seems like this is the capstone to this approach. And I
wonder what the response has been from China, and what that tells us
about what this dynamic of confrontation is going to start to look like
over the next coming months and maybe even years.

edward wong

Well last Friday, we saw China announce that it was going to force the
U.S. to shut down its consulate in Chengdu, which is the only diplomatic
mission that the U.S. has in Western China. It’s a very critical mission
for the U.S., because it allows American officials to observe what’s
going on in the vast reaches of that part of the country, including in
Tibet, which is a very important issue for the U.S.

The people in Beijing couch this as a reciprocal action. And some people
still say that they could have taken a more escalatory step, but that
they appear to be willing to hold back and see whether there might be
some reset of the relationship if Trump loses the election in November.
But even if that were the case, I’m not sure that their orientation of
the relationship would change. There might be a temporary halt to the
tit-for-tat cycle that we’re seeing. But it feels like because of where
the U.S. and China are now in the world, and the entrenched ideological
systems in both countries, we might be on course for a long-term
confrontation.

  - archived recording (mike pompeo)  
    Thank you. Thank you all.

edward wong

And you could hear that a few days ago in this very dark speech that
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave at the Nixon Library.

  - archived recording (mike pompeo)  
    We, the freedom-loving nations of the world, must induce China to
    change in more creative and assertive ways, because Beijing’s
    actions threaten our people and our prosperity.

edward wong

He laid out a vision of a potential cold war with China, and said that
China was the most challenging foe to the United States.

  - archived recording (mike pompeo)  
    Now, people of good faith can debate why free agents allowed these
    bad things to happen for all these years. Perhaps we were naive
    about China’s virulent strain of communism, or triumphalist after
    our victory in the Cold War. Or cravenly capitalist, or hoodwinked
    by Beijing’s talk of a peaceful rise. Whatever the reason, whatever
    the reason, today, China is increasingly authoritarian at home and
    more aggressive in its hostility to freedom everywhere else. And
    President Trump has said enough.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

Edward, thank you very much.

edward wong

Thanks a lot, Michael. It’s been great being on the show.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording  
    Mr. Barr, you may begin.

  - archived recording (william barr)  
    Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Jordan. I’m pleased to be
    here this morning. On behalf of the Department of Justice, I want to
    pay my respects —

michael barbaro

During his first appearance before the House since Democrats took
control in 2018, Attorney General Bill Barr was repeatedly challenged
over his response to everything from the Russia investigation to
nationwide protests over policing.

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    Is it ever appropriate, sir, for the president to solicit or accept
    foreign assistance in an election?

  - archived recording (william barr)  
    It depends what kind of assistance.

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    Is it ever appropriate for the president or presidential candidate
    to accept or solicit foreign assistance of any kind in his or her
    election?

  - archived recording (william barr)  
    No, it’s not appropriate.

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    OK. Sorry you had to struggle with that one, Mr. Attorney General.
    Now let’s turn to —

michael barbaro

Several Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Pramila Jayapal
of Washington State, demanded to know why Barr had deployed federal
agents to Oregon to monitor Black Lives Matter protests, but not to
Michigan, where conservatives protested a coronavirus lockdown order.

  - archived recording (pramila jayapal)  
    There is a real discrepancy in how you react as the attorney
    general, the top cop in this country. When white men with swastikas
    storm a government building with guns, there is no need for the
    president to quote, “activate you,” because they’re getting the
    president’s personal agenda done. But when black people and people
    of color protest police brutality, systemic racism and the
    president’s very own lack of response to those critical issues,
    then you forcibly remove them with armed federal officers, pepper
    bombs, because they are considered terrorists by the president. Did
    I get it right, Mr. Barr?

  - archived recording (william barr)  
    I have responsibility for the federal government, and the White
    House is the seat of the —

  - archived recording (pramila jayapal)  
    Mr. Barr, let me just make it clear —

michael barbaro

And on Tuesday, the nation’s second-largest teachers’ unit, the American
Federation of Teachers, announced that it would support members if they
choose to go on strike over unsafe school reopenings. The union said
that strikes should be a last resort, but the announcement gives local
teachers greater leverage in negotiations over the kinds of protections
that teachers should have in reopened schools.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.
