## Eighteen states set daily case records in the past week, and 40 have had 14-day increases in cases per capita.

California. South Carolina. North Dakota. Kentucky. Hawaii. Those are
among the 18 states that set single-day case records in the last week,
putting the country on track to breaking a national single-day record
for new coronavirus cases set less than two weeks ago.

More than 73,500 cases were reported on Friday, [according to a New York
Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
approaching the country’s record of 75,697 cases, set on July 16. Since
June 24, the seven-day average has more than doubled, to more than
66,100 on Friday from 31,402.

The other states with rapidly growing caseloads are Alabama, Alaska,
Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia. A 19th state,
Louisiana, also set a record, but because it reported a backlog of cases
on Monday.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>A total of 40 states
have seen 14-day increases in cases per
capita.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

As the number of cases has continued to climb, so has the number of
hospitalizations, which dipped briefly below 28,000 in mid-June but is
now skirting its own April record. Deaths are also rising: Friday was
the fourth consecutive day with more than 1,100 reported U.S. deaths,
which are trending upward in 30 states. On Saturday, South Carolina
announced 80 new deaths, a single-day record.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Friday, the number of people known to be hospitalized with the
coronavirus in the country was 59,670, according to [the Covid Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily), a few hundred short
of the record of 59,940 reported by the database on April 15.

A surge in Starr County, a rural, impoverished area in South Texas, near
the border with Mexico, offers a grim example of the type of hospital
crisis looming. The county’s infection rate of about 2,350 per 100,000
people is far higher than in more populous parts of Texas, including
Houston. The county’s single hospital cannot handle the crush of Covid
patients, and ethics committees have been formed to help determine which
patients should be treated and which should be sent home to die.

Pentagon officials have dispatched Army and Navy personnel to the Starr
County hospital and other medical centers in border cities to provide
support, and state and federal officials have sent morgue trailers,
ventilators, testing teams and surgical masks to the Rio Grande
Valley.

North Korea said on Sunday that it had [locked down a
city](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus-kim-jong-un.html)
near its border with South Korea and declared a “maximum” national
emergency after finding what its leader, Kim Jong-un, said could be the
country’s first case of Covid-19 there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It issued the high alert after a North Korean who had defected to South
Korea three years ago but secretly crossed back into the North’s Kaesong
City last Sunday was “suspected to have been infected with the vicious
virus,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said on Sunday.

Until now North Korea, one of the world’s most isolated countries, has
repeatedly said that it had [no
case](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html)
of Covid-19, although outside experts questioned the claim.

North Korea has taken some of the most drastic actions of any country
against the virus, and it did so sooner than most other nations.

It sealed its borders in late January, shutting off business with
neighboring China, which accounts for nine-tenths of its external trade.
It clamped down on the smugglers who keep its thriving [unofficial
markets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/30/world/asia/north-korea-economy-marketplace.html)
functioning. It quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month.

​The government’s ability to control the movement of people​ also
bolsters its disease-control efforts.

A Covid-19 outbreak could seriously test North Korea’s underequipped
public health system and its economy,[already struggling under
international
sanctions.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/world/asia/north-korea-sanctions-coronavirus.html)
International relief agencies have been providing test kits and other
assistance to help the country fight any potential spread of Covid-19.

Even as the virus continues to surge across the United States, pockets
of resistance to public health measures continue to appear in parts of
the country.

On Saturday, about 150 demonstrators marched outside the state capitol

In Texas on Saturday, some bar owners planned to open in defiance of
Gov. Greg Abbott’s
[order](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-takes-executive-action-to-contain-spread-of-covid-19)on
June 26 that required bars to close. More than 1,000 bars have signed up
to participate in the protest, called Freedom Fest, according to Chris
Polone, an owner of the Rail Club, a music venue in Fort Worth, and an
organizer of the event.

Mr. Polone said he was asking bars that participate to operate at 25
percent capacity, take temperatures at the door, mandate masks and seat
people at tables of four. He said it was unfair that Texas had closed
bars while allowing restaurants to remain open for dine-in service, at
reduced capacity.

“We don’t want to represent a bunch of idiots in this,” he said. “We’re

A spokesman for Mr. Abbott did not immediately respond to an email.

The protests on Saturday were a faint echo of the far larger
demonstrations held in several states in the spring, when thousands of
protesters [urged

A preliminary report on four Covid-19 patients [published in the medical
journal JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768926)
offers intriguing clues about why some healthy young men become severely
ill from the infection, and why men in general are more prone than women
to serious effects of the disease.

Very rare genetic defects that weaken the immune system may have played
havoc in the four patients — two sets of brothers ages 21 to 32 from
unrelated families in the Netherlands. All, previously in good health,
were admitted to intensive care units between March 23 and April 25.
One, age 29, died.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Genetic analyses of the patients and their families identified flaws in
a gene that enables cells to make molecules called interferons, which
stir the immune system to fight off viruses. Without this line of
defense, the researchers speculated, the patients struggled to fight the
infection.

These genetic defects they were found to have are too rare to account
for many other inexplicably severe cases of Covid-19, the researchers
said, but the findings point to the possibility that other genetic
variations may also influence susceptibility.

The findings also offer hints about why men in general may be more
vulnerable than women to severe cases of Covid-19.

The gene that was flawed in the four young men in the study is located
on the X chromosome. Men have one copy of that chromosome, while women
have two — and if one X in a woman carries the gene defect, her other X
may have a normal form of the gene, enabling the creation of enough
interferons to stay healthy.

Having two copies of the normal gene — as most women do — may also give
them an advantage over men.

[An editorial accompanying the
report](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768925) said
additional studies like this one could help explain how the disease
develops, and enable researchers to find better
treatments.

The Amazon River is South America’s essential life source, the central
artery in a vast network of tributaries that sustains some 30 million
people across eight countries, moving supplies, people and industry deep
into forested regions often untouched by road.

But once again, in a painful echo of history, it is also bringing
disease.

The pandemic has overwhelmed Brazil, with more than two million
infections and more than 84,000 deaths, an outbreak second only to the
United States in severity.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>The
six Brazilian cities with the highest coronavirus exposure are [all on
the Amazon
River,](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117531v1)
according to an expansive new study from Brazilian researchers that
measured antibodies in the population.

A Times photographer traveled the river for weeks, documenting how the
virus has spread so quickly and thoroughly along the river that in
remote fishing and farming communities like Tefé, people have been as
likely to get the virus as in New York City, home to one of the world’s
worst outbreaks.

“It was all very fast,” said Isabel Delgado, 34, whose father,
Felicindo, died of the virus shortly after falling ill in the small city
of Coari.

In the past four months, as the epidemic traveled from the biggest city
in the Brazilian Amazon, Manaus, with its high-rises and factories, to
tiny, seemingly isolated villages deep in the interior, the fragile
health care system has buckled under the onslaught.

Cities and towns along the river have some of the highest deaths per
capita in the country — often several times the national average.

The virus is exacting an [especially high
toll](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/19/world/americas/coronavirus-brazil-indigenous.html?smid=tw-share)
on Indigenous people, in a parallel to the past. Since the 1500s, waves
of explorers have traveled the river, seeking gold, land and converts —
and later, rubber, a resource that helped fuel the Industrial
Revolution. But with them, these outsiders brought violence and diseases
like smallpox and measles, killing millions and wiping out entire
communities.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said Friday that a robust testing
regimen would begin for state nursing home surveyors, after a [Los
Angeles Times
investigation](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-24/california-failure-covid-19-test-nursing-home-inspectors)
revealed that they were not required to be tested for the coronavirus
before inspecting facilities — meaning they could have been introducing
infections into settings that house some of the most vulnerable
populations.

More than 40 percent of U.S. deaths have been connected to such
facilities, according to a New York Times
[database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html).
In California, the percentage is even higher, accounting for at least 45
percent of deaths.

California will now require nursing home inspectors to meet the same
state criteria required of nursing home employees, Mr. Newsom said at a
news conference. “We’re raising our standards,” he said. Nursing homes
in California [are
required](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/LCP/Pages/AFL-20-53.aspx)
to test 25 percent of their staff every seven days.

Dr. Michael Wasserman, the medical director of the Eisenberg Village
nursing home in Reseda and president of the California Association of
Long Term Care Medicine, said that he had not known that inspectors
weren’t required to be tested until he learned of the Los Angeles Times
investigation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“When I heard that state surveyors were not being tested, I was
shocked,” Dr. Wasserman said.

He contacted the California Department of Public Health to inquire why
the requirement had not already been in place, and said an official
responded that while most staff members did get tested, the department
could not legally mandate it without legislation.

“How in the world can you be telling nursing homes that they need to be
testing all of their staff and you’re not testing your inspectors?” Dr.
Wasserman said in an interview.

He said that he also believes that the number of deaths related to care
facilities could be far higher than the current known level of 59,000.
In conversations with nursing homes around the country, he said, he had
learned of many more nursing home deaths — especially in March and April
— from what was most likely the virus, though those patients were never
tested or formally
diagnosed.

    fishing vessel docked for repair.

  - Also in **South Korea**, the office of President Moon Jae-in said on
    Sunday that he had received a letter from Bill Gates, the Microsoft
    co-founder turned philanthropist, expressing hope for greater
    cooperation between South Korea and his foundation in efforts to
    fight the virus. In the July 20 letter, Mr. Gates praised the
    country’s pandemic response and said that if the South Korean
    company SK Bioscience succeeded in developing a vaccine, it would be
    able to produce 200 million doses a year starting next June. The
    company has received $3.6 million in research funding from the Bill

    Sydney on Tuesday, citing the risk of virus transmission. Organizers
    say they plan to appeal.

  - **Afghanistan**’s minister of public health has urged Afghans to

    biggest holidays of the Islamic calendar, to avoid risking a
    resurgence of the virus. Celebrations for a previous holiday — Eid
    al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan and its month of fasting — had
    spread the virus, the minister warned.

  - Indoor gyms and leisure centers in **England** were permitted to
    reopen on Saturday as the British government continued a planned
    gradual exit from lockdown. Britain has recorded more than 45,000
    coronavirus deaths, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has
    previously strongly defended his government’s approach, told a BBC

anywhere since the emergence of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19,
including [China’s permanent ban on wildlife trade and
consumption](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/science/coronavirus-pangolin-wildlife-ban-china.html).

“Vietnam is to be congratulated for recognizing that Covid-19 and other
pandemics are linked to the wildlife trade, and that this trade must be
banned as a matter of international and public health security,” said
Steven Galster, Freeland’s international chairman.

The illegal wildlife trade is a thriving business in Southeast Asia and
it was unclear how committed Vietnam would be in enforcing the new ban.

The coronavirus is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, most
likely in bats before jumping to an intermediate species — possibly
civets, rats or pangolins — and then to humans. Many of the first
reported cases in Wuhan were tied to a [seafood
market](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
that has since been permanently closed.

The SARS epidemic, which killed nearly 800, started with the[consumption
of
wildlife](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/19/health/coronavirus-animals-markets.html)
in China in 2002.

Health experts and animal advocates have long urged countries to ban the
wildlife trade to protect both humans and threatened species. Some noted
that China’s recent ban on wildlife trade and consumption includes
loopholes for trade in wild animals for medicinal uses.

So-called traditional medicine using wild animal parts is popular in
Vietnam and China, which share a border. Wild animals are also an
important source of food in some parts of Southeast Asia, [including
Indonesia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/world/asia/coronavirus-bats-market-Indonesia.html).

Separately, Vietnam, which has recorded zero deaths from the coronavirus
and [had gone 100 days without a single
case](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/asia/coronavirus-vietnam.html)
of local transmission, reported two positive cases over the weekend in
the central city of Danang, a 57-year-old man and a 61-year-old man. In
both cases the source of the infection remains unclear. Officials said
the second man’s condition was deteriorating rapidly and that he had
been hospitalized and placed on a
ventilator.

A small California company called Vaxart made a surprise announcement
last month: A coronavirus vaccine it was working on had been selected by
the U.S. government to be part of Operation Warp Speed, the flagship
federal initiative to quickly develop drugs to combat Covid-19.

Vaxart’s shares soared. Company insiders, who weeks earlier had received
stock options worth a few million dollars, saw the value of those awards
increase sixfold. And a hedge fund that partly controlled the company
walked away with more than $200 million in instant profits.

In the race to develop a vaccine, [some companies and investors are
betting that the winners stand to earn vast
profits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/business/coronavirus-vaccine-profits-vaxart.html)
from selling hundreds of millions — or even billions — of doses to a
desperate public.

Across the pharmaceutical and medical industries, senior executives and
board members are capitalizing on that dynamic.

They are making millions of dollars after announcing positive
developments, including support from the government, in their efforts to
fight Covid-19. After such announcements, insiders from at least 11
companies — most of them smaller firms whose fortunes often hinge on the
success or failure of a single drug — have sold shares worth well over
$1 billion since March, according to figures compiled for The New York
Times by Equilar, a data provider.

In some cases, company insiders are profiting from regularly scheduled
compensation or automatic stock trades. But in other situations, senior
officials appear to be pouncing on opportunities to cash out while
prices are sky high. And some companies have awarded stock options to
executives shortly before announcements about vaccine progress.

The sudden windfalls highlight the powerful financial incentives for
company officials to generate positive headlines in [the race for
coronavirus vaccines and
treatments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html),
even if the drugs might never pan

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 23, 2020

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### What’s the best material for a mask?
    
      - Scientists around the country [have tried to identify everyday
        materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic
        particles.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        In recent tests, HEPA [furnace
        filters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html?action=click&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)
        scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to
        flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other
        materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and
        bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small
        percentage of particles.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The study noted 51 incidents of piracy, referring to attacks in
international waters, or armed robbery, meaning attacks in national
waters, between January and June, compared with 28 in the same period in
2019. Of those, 16 occurred in the Singapore Strait, a busy traffic hub
where vessels appeared to be especially vulnerable.

The findings, from the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating
Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia, document the latest
challenge for some countries in Asia already struggling to combat the
pandemic at home. India, Bangladesh and the Philippines, where the
number of incidents increased this year, have faced recent hurdles in
their coronavirus response as cases continue to pile up across the
continent.

The report also adds to emerging questions about how crime rates have
shifted in general as countries deal with the fallout from the pandemic
and the resulting economic downturn.

While some crime fell as lockdowns around the world kept people indoors,
some criminal activity has increased. Many of the largest cities in the
United States have recorded [staggering
increases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/upshot/murders-rising-crime-coronavirus.html)
in murders during the first half of this year, even as other violent
crimes have fallen. Murder rates have spiked in cities like Chicago, New
York and Philadelphia, and the White House has [sent federal
agents](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/trump-federal-agents-cities.html)
to some of them to work with local authorities to confront the rise in
shootings and other violence.

Cybercrime appears to be more common. For instance, [scammers have
siphoned off billions of dollars in unemployment
claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/your-money/coronavirus-unemployment-fraud.html)
in the United States. And [reports of domestic
abuse](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/world/coronavirus-domestic-violence.html)
have risen around the world, including in Britain, Spain, France, Mexico
and China.

Already battered by the coronavirus pandemic, southeast Texas faced a
new but no less frightening foe on Saturday, as Hurricane Hanna slammed
the coast with heavy rains and winds predicted to reach up to 110 miles
per hour.

Hanna strengthened from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane on
Saturday morning, and forecasters issued the first hurricane warning for
the southern coastal region since Hurricane Harvey struck the area in
August 2017 and caused the worst rainstorm in United States history.
Hanna’s eye made landfall on Padre Island, about 60 miles north of the
U.S.-Mexico border, at about 5 p.m. on Saturday, with winds of 90 m.p.h.

The National Weather Service
[warned](https://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=TXZ242&warncounty=TXC273&firewxzone=TXZ242&local_place1=3%20Miles%20NNE%20Kingsville,%20Naval%20Air%20Station%20TX&product1=Hurricane+Warning#.XxxWW55KjIV)

  - Gov. Eric Holcomb of **Indiana** signed an executive order this past
    week requiring residents to wear face coverings beginning Monday
    after the state recorded a new high of more than 1,000 new
    coronavirus cases on Friday. Indianapolis in particular is seeing an
    upward trend in infection, its mayor, Joe Hogsett, said, with
    transmission occurring mostly indoors at places like gyms and bars.

The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joining the

Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley in Dayton, Nev., argued that the state
treated houses of worship less favorably than it did casinos,
restaurants and amusement parks. Those businesses have been limited to
50 percent of their fire-code capacities, while houses of worship have
been subject to a flat 50-person limit.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., in a dissent joined by Justices Clarence
Thomas and Brett M. Kavanaugh, wrote that the distinction made no sense.

“The Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion,” Justice
Alito wrote. “It says nothing about the freedom to play craps or
blackjack, to feed tokens into a slot machine or to engage in any other
game of chance. But the governor of Nevada apparently has different
priorities.”

“A public health emergency does not give governors and other public
officials carte blanche to disregard the Constitution for as long as the
medical problem persists,” Justice Alito wrote.

The court considered a similar objection from a California church in
May, rejecting it by a 5-to-4

Top Trump administration officials returned to Capitol Hill on Saturday
trying to iron out the details of the Republicans’ $1 trillion proposal
for coronavirus relief, after a week largely consumed with [intraparty
disagreements over what should be in the
package](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/politics/republicans-stimulus-coronavirus.html).

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mark Meadows, the White House
chief of staff, huddled with aides to Senator Mitch McConnell, the
majority leader, who plans to introduce his party’s proposal on Monday.
Mr. McConnell was in his home state of Kentucky, where he is running for
re-election.

“We have a fundamental understanding, and we just want to make sure all
the paperwork is ready and finished so it can be introduced on Monday,”
Mr. Mnuchin told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The rare Saturday visit from top administration officials underscored
Republicans’ predicament. They had hoped to unveil a unified proposal
this week to serve as their bargaining position in negotiations with
Democrats.

But they were stymied by disagreements on a range of issues, like a
[payroll tax
cut](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/payroll-tax-cut-trump-recession.html)
— which the White House ultimately agreed to abandon for this relief
package — and changes to a federal program providing enhanced
unemployment benefits. That program, established as part of the $2.2
trillion stimulus law in March, expires next week and is now almost
certain to lapse, throwing millions of Americans relying on the checks
into limbo.

Senate Republicans and the White House are still haggling over how to
scale back the current $600-a-week expanded benefit, which most
Republicans view as too generous.

The alternatives under consideration include lowering the weekly payment
for two months, and then setting the size of payments after that to a
percentage of a worker’s previous income.

“We’re not going to use taxpayer money to pay people more to stay home,”
Mr. Mnuchin said. “So we’re going to transition to a U.I. system that is
based on wage replacement.”

But the National Association of State Workforce Agencies warned Capitol
Hill this past week that such a significant change to the current
program was likely to take months for states to enact, according to a
memo obtained by The New York
Times.

Alister Martin, a 31-year-old emergency room doctor at Massachusetts
General Hospital, established a project last year called
[VotER](https://vot-er.org/), setting up kiosks in the hospital that
included iPads loaded with TurboVote software and posters with QR codes
that patients can scan with cellphones, automatically bringing up a
website where they can register.

His project is spreading across the country as traditional in-person
voter-registration efforts have been curbed because of the spread of the
virus. Since May, more than 3,000 health care providers **** have
requested kits to register their patients to vote, including at flagship
hospitals across the country.

“There will be a time where, above the din of suffering, we ask, ‘How
can we use this to make something better of our situation?’” said Dr.
Martin, who always wears a “Ready to Vote?” badge around his neck.

After months of watching the mismanagement of the response, and fearing
for their own lives as well as their patients’, many doctors and nurses
now see the connection between their work and politics more clearly.

“Previously, physicians taking a political stance was seen as possibly
unprofessional,” said Kelly Wong, a medical student who is part of
[Patient Voting](https://www.patientvoting.com/), a Rhode Island-based
effort to provide hospitalized patients with information that can help
them navigate the gantlet of voting from a hospital bed. “Civic
engagement of our patients and our communities is really important to
changing health
outcomes.”

## Tailors know New Yorkers’ pandemic secret: ‘Everybody got fat\!’

In New York City, where gyms are still closed and Netflix is the safest
evening entertainment, the phenomenon of stay-at-home weight gain —
playfully called the [Quarantine 15 by
some](https://www.yalemedicine.org/stories/quarantine-15-weight-gain-pandemic/)
— has brought an unexpected windfall for some tailors. Some say they
have seen business rise by as much as 80 percent, with customers asking
for buttons to be moved, waistbands lengthened and jackets made more
roomy.

Business was bleak at Woodside Tailor Shop in Queens during the long
months of pandemic lockdown. There was no need for party dress
alterations, or any pressure for slacks to be hemmed.

But things started picking back up in June, with one particular service
in sudden demand: People needed a bit more breathing room in their
clothing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Everybody got fat\!” said Porfirio Arias, 66, a tailor at the Woodside
shop. “It’s not only in New York. It’s all over the world that people
got fat.”

The boost in business has been welcome for many tailors, who often
operate in storefronts shared with dry cleaners, which have suffered
mightily during the pandemic. Dry cleaning businesses at the peak of the
pandemic lost an estimated 80 to 90 percent in sales compared to
previous years, and are still down about 40 to 50 percent, according to
data collected by the North East Fabricare Association.

Many tailors fear that the industry may not bounce back even as more
people return to work, if the traditional workplace culture shifts to
the new work-from-home ethos — meaning more sweatpants and fewer bespoke
suits that need to be cleaned, pressed or altered.

Of course, not all New Yorkers have been able to work from home, and the
ability to sequester has largely fallen along socioeconomic lines:
Putting on pandemic pounds is a small downside of what is in essence a
tremendous privilege.

Eight outdoor pools across New York City’s five boroughs opened on
Friday, despite the pandemic and budget cuts. In nearly 80 years, the
pools had never missed a season. But this year, it was a close call.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In April, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that outdoor public pools
[would stay closed for the
summer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/nyregion/nyc-pools-schools-closed-summer.html)
in an effort to save money. But in June, [he reversed that
decision,](https://www.6sqft.com/nyc-public-pools-reopening-summer-2020/)
providing nearly $10 million to the Department of Parks and Recreation
to [reinstate 15](https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/outdoor-pools)
of the city’s 53 outdoor pools.

Eight outdoor pools across New York City’s five boroughs opened on
Friday, and seven more are set to open next Saturday.

The pools are operating at 70 percent capacity, and attendees must wear
face coverings at all times, except in the water. Social-distancing
ambassadors are stationed at locker rooms and poolside to watch for
overcrowding, as they also do at beaches. Swimmers are expected to keep
six feet away from others in the pool.

Here are other developments from the New York area:

  - At least two dozen lifeguards from **Long Beach Island, N.J.**,
    tested positive for the coronavirus after attending social events
    together, according to [a report from
    NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/07/20-lbi-lifeguards-test-positive-for-coronavirus-after-attending-parties-together.html).

  - Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday that the number of people
    hospitalized with the virus in **New York** had dropped to the
    lowest levels since the pandemic began. According to Mr. Cuomo’s
    [statement](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-hospitalizations-drop-below-1000-first-time-march-18-0),
    996 people in the state were hospitalized on Friday, the first time
    that figure had fallen below 1,000 since March 18.
