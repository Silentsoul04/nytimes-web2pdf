# Hurricane’s Choice for Texans: Shelter From the Virus or the Storm

</div>

Hurricane Hanna prompted officials and residents alike to rethink how
and where to ride out a dangerous storm during a pandemic.

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Bartt Howe’s boat was his refuge from the
pandemic. Battling diabetes and H.I.V., he knew that catching the
coronavirus as well could kill him, so he had been living alone on the
docked boat for three months.

Then Hurricane Hanna began to slam the Texas coast on Saturday, forcing
Mr. Howe to trade one deadly menace for another: To avoid injury or
death in the hurricane, he had to risk infection ashore.

“I had managed to stay safe all this time, but the storm kicked me out
of my boat,” he said with a hint of resignation. “Now here I am, back on
land, on borrowed time.”

Corpus Christi, about 160 miles north of the Texas-Mexico border, was
already wrestling with a worsening virus outbreak when Hanna, a Category
1 hurricane, made landfall at about 5 p.m. Saturday. Residents like Mr.
Howe and area officials have had to figure out — quickly — how to cope
with two dueling crises, each complicating the response to the other.

Much of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the region [has been attributed
to visitors from bigger cities like
Houston](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/us/coronavirus-texas-corpus-christi.html)
who flocked to the area’s beaches when case counts were still low,
officials said. More than 10,000 people in Nueces County, which includes
Corpus Christi, have now [been infected with the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html),
and at least 140 people have died.

“When I saw that the hurricane was headed our way, I thought, we have
enough problems,” said the mayor of Corpus Christi, Joe
McComb.

In ordinary times, city officials would ask people in seaside and
flood-prone areas to evacuate and seek shelter with relatives or in
emergency shelters — places where people share bathrooms and tight
quarters, health officials said. But fear of contagion has thrown old
protocols out the window.

So how do you keep people safe through a hurricane when the coronavirus
shows no signs of abating? “Very carefully,” said Annette Rodriguez, the
county public health director.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hanna has not displaced many people, as hurricanes go. Only about 10
people sought shelter in the county Saturday night, Ms. Rodriguez said.
The relatively low-stakes storm allowed area officials to assess how to
help people evacuate safely while diminishing the spread of the virus.

“Having two events tied together, it is just a huge challenge,” Ms.
Rodriguez said. “It was definitely a good trial run.”

When the next hurricane comes, officials plan to start evacuation
procedures five days in advance, instead of the standard three, Ms.
Rodriguez said. Officials also plan to seal off alternate seats on buses
transporting evacuees to safer areas, and increase the number of trips
the buses make to compensate.

Once evacuees reach a shelter — usually a high school gymnasium —
officials would ensure that they wear masks and keep their distance from
one another, Ms. Rodriguez said, adding that shelters “would have a
separate section for anyone sick.”

“We don’t want to leave anybody behind,” she said. “But we also want to
stop the virus from spreading.”

Officials acknowledged that the guidance they gave the public could be
confusing and at times conflicting.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Our message was, take care of yourself, but if you need to seek
shelter, bring a mask or three,” Mr. McComb said. “You have to protect
yourself from a storm, but at the same time, we don’t need more cases of
the coronavirus.”

Residents woke on Sunday to a battered region. The Red Cross reported
some severe flooding in coastal areas, widespread power outages and
property damage, including roofs blown off houses, but no severe
injuries.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Mr. Howe, 49, was one of the handful of people who sought shelter
Saturday night at a high school in Kingsville, a rural town about 45
miles from Corpus Christi. He returned to Harbor El Sol Marina in Corpus
Christi Bay Sunday afternoon to check on his beloved 27-foot boat, Sera
Sera, a name he found ironic now.

“What will be, will be,” he said. “And that’s how it is.”

As the storm bore down on Saturday, he initially intended to ride it out
on board, he said, even as his marina neighbors fled the aggressive sea
surges. By 11:30 p.m., though, the waves were hammering the boat hard.

“I couldn’t even see the sea wall — that’s how bad it got,” he said on
Sunday, a green mask covering his mouth and nose.

“I knew that if I got it, I would die,” he said of the virus. “But I had
no choice. I knew it was time to
go.”

A fellow boater who managed to reach him by phone alerted emergency
responders to his situation, and they threw a rope his way and got him
to safety, Mr. Howe recalled.

Johnny Heath, 42, joined Mr. Howe at the marina Sunday afternoon and
spotted his own boat, the Classified Cat, floating behind some dock
debris and mangled vessels. It was missing a few walls, and water had
damaged most of its furnishings, he could tell from where he stood.

“Everything is ruined,” Mr. Heath said. “I was working on that boat, was
trying to make it electric. I was planning on living there for the rest
of my life. Now look at it.

“But at least I’m still alive,” he said with a shrug.

John Nolan, 55, who owns two boats in the marina, said he’d had a brush
with the virus months ago, and had recovered quickly from a mild fever.
His economic losses from the storm will take a lot longer, he said.

“They are in bad shape, but still floating, better than others,” Mr.
Nolan said of his boats. Not far away, a few more worried residents
picked personal belongings from a pile of debris. A woman found a pair
of tennis shoes and a man grabbed a helmet.

A woman who Mr. Howe knows only as Sheila called to him, “Hey, Bartt\!
You made it out alive\!”

“I did — I survived,” he said, smiling behind his mask. “At least, this
time.”
