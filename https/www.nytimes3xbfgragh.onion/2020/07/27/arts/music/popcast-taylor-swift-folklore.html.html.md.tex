Taylor Swift released her eighth album, ``Folklore,'' last week; created
wholly during the quarantine, it marks a new musical direction for the
singer-songwriter. Working primarily with Aaron Dessner of the National,
Swift moved away from the pop explosions of her last few albums and
toward an album laden with indie rock and art-folk gestures.

Swift is 30 now, and likely entering a new career phase, one less
subject to pop's whims. ``Folklore'' is her warmest-sounding album in
years, and also emphasizes the detailed songwriting that's become her
signature.

On this week's Popcast, a conversation about what ``Folklore'' portends
for Swift's musical evolution. Is it a signifier of musical
authenticity, or a locked-in-the-house lark? An embrace of a genre that
had once kept her at arm's length, or a logical evolution of styles
she's been chipping away at for years?

\item
  Jon Pareles, The New York Times's chief pop music critic
\item
  Caryn Ganz, The New York Times's pop music editor
\item
  Joe Coscarelli, The New York Times's pop music reporter
