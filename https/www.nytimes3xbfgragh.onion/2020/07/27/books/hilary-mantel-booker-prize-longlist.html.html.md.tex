LONDON --- Hilary Mantel's
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/03/books/review-mirror-light-hilary-mantel.html}{The
Mirror and the Light}'' --- the conclusion to her Thomas Cromwell
trilogy --- was announced here on Tuesday as one of 13 novels competing
for this year's Booker Prize, the British literary award.

Anne Tyler's
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/books/review/redhead-by-the-side-of-the-road-anne-tyler.html}{Redhead
by the Side of the Road}'' is also on the list. But most of the other
nominated books are less high-profile, with eight by debut novelists,
including
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/04/books/c-pam-zhang-how-much-of-these-hills-is-gold.html}{C
Pam Zhang}'s
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/books/review/how-much-of-these-hills-is-gold-c-pam-zhang.html}{How
Much of These Hills Is Gold},'' about a Chinese-American family during
the Gold Rush.

Nine of the longlisted authors are women.

``The Mirror and the Light'' is focused on the final years of Thomas
Cromwell's life, as the chief adviser to King Henry VIII. The book was a
sensation in Britain when it was published in March, despite its length:
It is 875 pages long.

``Like Henry VIII, bloat has set in,'' wrote Robbie Millen,
\href{https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-mirror-and-the-light-by-hilary-mantel-review-5d73zvlpv}{in
a review for the Times of London}. ``It's true that passages of
noun-bloat swell the volume to gargantuan heft,'' wrote Simon Schama
\href{https://www.ft.com/content/e52e9200-57bb-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc?accessToken=zwAAAXOQsTOYkdPlLpIAV7sR6tOlKN0Plx_rvA.MEQCIHEpEfi4JW9qMeSu48FLNSBGC9GMiUE00t5wnOiIlZutAiB3x-V2IiTLZddRbMg_NE2IUOU4ExHG0C1bv0HNsAPQBw\&sharetype=gift?token=92f7106d-6113-49a3-b937-400e0280d1e8}{in
a review for The Financial Times}, ``but this reader wouldn't want a
word less.''

Parul Sehgal, in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/03/books/review-mirror-light-hilary-mantel.html}{a
review for The New York Times}, said the length was appropriate. ``This
is not a young man's book, not a book of striving,'' she wrote. ``It is
a novel of late middle age, a novel of preserving what one has seized.''

If ``The Mirror and the Light'' wins, Mantel would become the first
author to take the prize three times. She
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/10/07/books/07booker.html}{won
in 2009 for ``Wolf Hall''} and
\href{https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/16/hilary-mantel-wins-a-second-booker-prize/}{again
in 2012 for ``Bring Up the Bodies},'' the two other Cromwell novels.

Several novels in the running focus on race, including
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/09/books/review/inside-the-list-kiley-reid.html}{Kiley
Reid}'s
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/31/books/review/such-a-fun-age-kiley-reid.html}{Such
a Fun Age},'' about two white people who compete for a Black woman's
attention to signal their progressive credentials. ``There are voices
from minorities often unheard, stories that are fresh, bold and
absorbing,'' said Margaret Busby, the chair of the judges, in a
statement.

The other judges, who chose the 13 titles from 162 submitted books,
include
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/23/books/jack-reacher-lee-child-wyoming.html}{Lee
Child}, the thriller writer, and the poet Lemn Sissay. A shortlist will
be announced in September, and the winning title will be unveiled in
November. The author of that book will receive £50,000, or about
\$64,000.

Last year's prize was shared by Margaret Atwood for
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/03/books/review/testaments-margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale.html}{The
Testaments}'' and Bernardine Evaristo for
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/04/books/review-girl-woman-other-bernardine-evaristo.html}{Girl,
Woman, Other},'' after the judges decided to rebel against their own
rules
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/books/booker-prize-winner-atwood-evaristo.html}{and
split the prize}, a decision that
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/15/bernardine-evaristo-margaret-atwood-share-booker-prize-award}{was
met with widespread derision}.

This year's longlist seems unlikely to cause similar controversy,
although it does include six authors born in the United States, as well
as three others who claim American citizenship. There have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/23/books/booker-longlist-margaret-atwood.html}{been
regular complaints} about Americans' eligibility for the prize,
something only allowed in 2014.

Before then, it was limited to books by writers from Britain, Ireland
and Commonwealth countries (plus South Africa and, later, Zimbabwe).
