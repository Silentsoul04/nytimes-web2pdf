<div class="css-53u6y8">

Researchers have long known that masks can [prevent people from
spreading airway
germs](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003205)
to others — findings that have driven much of the conversation around
these crucial accessories during the coronavirus pandemic.

But now, as cases continue to rise across the country, experts are
pointing to an array of evidence suggesting that masks [also protect the
people wearing
them](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23498357/), lessening the
severity of symptoms, or in some instances, staving off infection
entirely.

Different kinds of masks “block virus to a different degree, but they
all block the virus from getting in,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an
infectious disease physician at the University of California, San
Francisco. If any virus particles do breach these barriers, she said,
the disease might still be milder.

Dr. Gandhi and her colleagues make this argument in a [new
paper](https://ucsf.app.box.com/s/blvolkp5z0mydzd82rjks4wyleagt036)
slated to be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.
Drawing from animal experiments and observations of various events
during the pandemic, they contend that people wearing face coverings
will take in fewer coronavirus particles, making it easier for their
immune systems to bring any interlopers to heel.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Tsion Firew, an emergency physician at Columbia University who
wasn’t involved in the work, cautioned that the links between masking
and milder disease haven’t yet been proved as cause and effect. Even so,
the new paper “reiterates what we say about masks,” she said. “It’s not
just a selfless act.”

Ideas about the importance of viral dose in the development of disease
have cropped up in the medical literature since [at least
the 1930s](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/27/3/493/99616),
when two researchers formally noted that mice exposed to larger
quantities of germs were more likely to die. More recently, scientists
have gone as far as to [puff different amounts of a flu
virus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25416753/) up the noses of human
volunteers. The more virus in this nasal plume, they found, the likelier
the participants were to get infected and experience symptoms.

That sort of experiment can’t be done ethically for the new coronavirus,
given how dangerous it is. But earlier this year, a team of researchers
in China tried something similar in hamsters: They housed
coronavirus-infected and healthy animals in adjoining cages, some of
which were separated by buffers made of surgical masks. Many of the
healthy hamsters behind the partitions never got infected. And the
unlucky animals who did [got less
sick](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa644/5848814)
than their “maskless”
neighbors.

Some indirect data has been accumulating from people as well.
Researchers have tentatively estimated that about 40 percent of
coronavirus infections [do not produce any
symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html).
But when some people [wear
masks](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/06/big-coronavirus-outbreak-at-newport-seafood-plants-is-contained-health-authorities-say.html),
the proportion of asymptomatic cases [seems to
skyrocket](https://apnews.com/4b9d38f206db9ce5267a5898ac24f238),
reportedly surpassing 90 percent during one outbreak at a seafood plant
in Oregon. Wearing a face covering doesn’t make people impervious to
infection, but these trends of asymptomatic cases could suggest that
masks lead to milder disease, potentially reducing hospitalizations and
deaths.

Particularly compelling, Dr. Gandhi said, is the data from cruise ships,
which pack big groups of people into close quarters. [More than 80
percent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7078829/) of those
infected aboard Japan’s Diamond Princess in February — before masking
had become common practice — came down with symptoms, she noted. But on
another vessel that left Argentina in March, and on which all passengers
were issued surgical masks after someone onboard came down with a fever,
the level of symptomatic cases was [below 20
percent](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/75/8/693).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some independent experts say the paper is a welcome update, given the
pervasive idea that wearing a mask is a mostly altruistic act.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“It’s been a real deficiency in the messaging about masking to say that
it only protects the other,” said Charles Haas, an environmental
engineer and expert in risk assessment at Drexel University. “From the
get go, that never made sense scientifically.”

In other settings, too, from
[hospitals](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768533)
to [hair
salons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/health/coronavirus-hair-salon-masks.html),
face coverings may have driven down rates of overall infection, perhaps
preventing disastrous outbreaks. And countries like Japan, Taiwan and
South Korea, where outbreaks quickly sparked a wave of widespread
masking, managed to rein in the number of coronavirus-related
hospitalizations and deaths early on.

Even in the United States, the slow upward tick in mask-wearing has
coincided with what appears to be a [more modest death
rate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/health/coronavirus-mortality-testing.html),
compared to the [surge that
occurred](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
after the virus first made landfall in North America. These trends have
also likely been influenced by increased testing, a downward shift in
the average age of people contracting the virus and improvements in
coronavirus treatments. Still, masks probably aren’t hurting things, Dr.
Gandhi said.

The idea that face coverings can curb disease severity, although not yet
proven, “makes complete sense,” said Linsey Marr, an expert in virus
transmission at Virginia Tech. “It’s another good argument for wearing
masks.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Dr. Marr and other researchers are still sussing out exactly how much
inbound or outbound virus different types of masks block. But based on a
[wealth](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002618)
of [past evidence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2)
and [recent
observations](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31142-9/fulltext#%20),
the amount that’s filtered out is probably high — perhaps 50 percent or
more of the larger aerosols being sent in both directions, Dr. Marr
said. Certain coverings, like N95 respirators, will do better than
others, but even looser-fitting cloths can waylay some viral particles.

Still, some experts are not ready to embrace all ideas about two-way
protection.

What’s outlined in Dr. Gandhi’s paper “is still just a theory, and needs
more research,” said Nancy Leung, an epidemiologist at the University of
Hong Kong. While there’s good evidence that masks reduce the spread of
viruses within a population, it’s much harder to nail down how face
coverings influence symptoms, Dr. Leung said, in part “because of the
difficulty in conducting those studies.”

Dr. Gandhi acknowledged these limitations. But with no end to the
pandemic in sight, the need for masks is only growing, she said,
especially as researchers continue to document the virus’s ability to
spread silently. Even people who don’t have symptoms can spray the virus
into their environment when they sneeze, cough, sing, speak or even
breathe. And those who fall ill may be at their [most
contagious](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5) in the
days before the first signs of sickness appear.

To tame this pandemic, people should act as if they’ve been infected,
“even if you feel right as rain,” Dr. Gandhi said.

Masks alone aren’t a substitute for other public health measures like
physical distancing and good hygiene. But unlike sustained lockdowns
that keep people apart, shielding our faces is easier and more
sustainable, Dr. Gandhi said.

Safeguarding yourself and others from this deadly disease, she added,
“is as simple as covering up the two holes in your face that shed the
virus.”
