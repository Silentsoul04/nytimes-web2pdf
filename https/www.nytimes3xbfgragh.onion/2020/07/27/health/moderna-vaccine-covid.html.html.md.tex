The studies each aim to enroll 30,000 people and determine whether the
vaccines are safe and effective.

The first large study of the safety and effectiveness of a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/health/covid-19-vaccine-monkeys.html}{coronavirus
vaccine} in the United States began on Monday morning, according to the
National Institutes of Health and the biotech company
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html}{Moderna},
which collaborated to develop the vaccine.

A volunteer in Savannah, Ga., received the first shot at 6:45 a.m., Dr.
Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, said at a news briefing.

The study, a Phase 3 clinical trial, will enroll 30,000 healthy people
at about 89 sites around the country this summer. Half will receive two
shots of the vaccine, 28 days apart, and half will receive two shots of
a saltwater placebo. Neither the volunteers nor the medical staff giving
the injections will know who will get the real vaccine.

Researchers will then monitor the subjects, looking for side effects.
And their main goal will be to see if significantly fewer vaccinated
people contract Covid-19, to determine whether the vaccine can prevent
the illness. The study will also try to find out if the vaccine can
avert severe cases of Covid and death; if it can block the infection
entirely, based on lab tests; and if just one shot can prevent the
illness.

A second company, Pfizer, announced late Monday afternoon that it had
also begun a late-stage study of a coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer has been
working with a German company, BioNTech. Their study will also include
30,000 people, from 39 states in the United States, and from Brazil,
Argentina and Germany.

The first subjects received injections at the University of Rochester on
Monday.

The government announced last week that it had reached
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{a
\$1.95 billion deal to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine} by the
year's end, but only if the trial proves it safe and effective.

Dr. Fauci estimated that the full enrollment of 30,000 people in the
Moderna trial would be completed by the end of the summer, and that
results might be available by November. Findings might emerge even
earlier, he said, but added that he doubted it. He said that the high
rates of transmission in some parts of the country, though unfortunate,
would help speed up the process of determining whether the vaccine
works.

Dr. Mark Mulligan, the director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center in New
York, which will begin giving injections of the Pfizer vaccine on
Tuesday, said he thought that full enrollment would take two months, and
that it would take four to six months to determine whether the vaccine
worked.

Over all, a total of 150 to 160 coronavirus infections in the study will
be enough to determine whether the Moderna vaccine is acceptably
effective --- that is, if it protects 60 percent of those who receive
it, Dr. Fauci said.

Ideally, he would like the figure to be higher, but he said 60 percent
``would be a major, huge step at controlling this outbreak; we'll take
that amount.''

A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans.

Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health,
said the U.S. government was reaching out to groups hit hardest by Covid
---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-elderly-protection.html}{older
people},
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html}{those
with chronic diseases},
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html}{Blacks,
Latinx and Native Americans} --- to encourage them to participate in the
study. He said that the pandemic had put health disparities into ``sharp
relief'' and that extra efforts were needed to gain the trust of people
in those groups who might be reluctant to sign up for a medical
experiment.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/27/us/27VIRUS-MODERNA2/27virus-briefing-lede-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/health/cornavirus-vaccine-moderna.html?searchResultPosition=5}{Earlier
tests of Moderna's vaccine} showed that it stimulated a strong immune
response, with minor and transient side effects like sore arms, fatigue,
achiness and fever. But exactly what type of immune response is needed
to prevent the illness is not known, so Phase 3 studies are essential to
determine whether a vaccine really works.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In a statement, Dr. Collins said, ``Having a safe and effective vaccine
distributed by the end of 2020 is a stretch goal, but it's the right
goal for the American people.'' He said that despite the unprecedented
speed in bringing this experimental vaccine to human testing, ``the most
stringent safety measures'' were being maintained.

Moderna said in a statement that it would be able to deliver about 500
million doses a year, and possibly up to a billion doses per year,
starting in 2021. The Massachusetts-based company, which has received
nearly \$1 billion from the federal government to develop a coronavirus
vaccine,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/health/covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-moderna-pfizer.html}{has
said it will not sell the vaccine at cost, but for profit.}

Moderna has not said what it will charge. ``We will price it responsibly
during the pandemic, to make sure it is broadly accessible,'' a
spokesman, Ray Jordan, said in an email. The company may change the
price later, when the virus becomes endemic, ``but that is not something
we have settled at this time,'' Mr. Jordan said.

Moderna shares were up more than 9 percent on Monday.

Pfizer has also said it would sell its product at a profit; the contract
with the government works out to about \$20 a shot, and people will need
two.

Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines use a synthetic version of
genetic material from part of the coronavirus, encased in tiny particles
made of fat that help it get into human cells. The genetic material,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html}{called
messenger RNA or mRNA}, then prompts the cells to churn out a tiny piece
of the virus, which the immune system sees as foreign and learns to
recognize. If the person is later exposed to the real virus, the immune
system will attack it.

Messenger RNA has not yet produced any approved vaccines, but other
companies have also invested in the approach, because of its potential
to produce vaccine quickly. CureVac and Sanofi are also working on mRNA
vaccines.

At the news briefing, Dr. Collins said that three more Phase 3 trials
would be starting soon, each needing 30,000 patients. Those trials will
involve vaccines made by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html}{Novavax},
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/health/coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-janssen.html}{Johnson
\& Johnson} and a collaboration of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/world/covid-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{University
of Oxford and AstraZeneca}. All three companies are part of the Trump
administration's Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer is not.
