\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Darius Settles once went to a conference of young leaders in Atlanta,
his first time at such a networking event. In the middle of the hallway,
he stopped and yelled, ``I'm so excited to be here!''

That was Mr. Settles, his friend Stephen Thompson said: sometimes too
energized to contain himself and a lot of fun to be around.

Mr. Settles died of the novel coronavirus on July 4 in Antioch, Tenn.,
outside Nashville, his father, David Settles, said. He had just turned
30. At the time, he was the youngest person in Nashville to die of the
virus.

Mr. Settles was a son and grandson of Pentecostal ministers; an organist
at two churches, in Tennessee and Alabama; a
\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/darius-settles-022196ba/}{designer of
custom men's suits}; the de facto campaign manager in his father's
successful run for the school board in Murfreesboro, Tenn.; a husband;
and a father.

In his last weeks he was organizing a group trip to Washington for a
National Action Network
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/as-dc-protests-continue-preparations-begin-for-100000-person-march-on-washington-in-august/2020/06/10/bcafc584-ab2f-11ea-a9d9-a81c1a491c52_story.html}{march}on
Aug. 28, insisting to friends that they wear suits, whatever the
weather.

``He said, `We got to do it like Martin Luther King,''' Mr. Thompson
said.

Darius Jamal Settles was born on June 19, 1990, in Donelson, Tenn., just
east of Nashville, the second of four children of David and Deirdra
Camille Orsborn-Settles. His father is pastor of
\href{https://tlwwc.wordpress.com/about/}{The Living Word Worship
Center} in Murfreesboro, an Apostolic Pentecostal church; his mother
handles the church's finances.

The family moved to Jackson, Miss., when Darius was 4 or 5 so that his
father could pursue his education, then several hundred miles up to
Murfreesboro, to a small house with an old piano in the garage. ``Darius
taught himself to play, basically,'' Mr. Settles said. He played
football up until freshman year of high school, and occasionally
preached in the youth ministry of his father's church.

He spoke in tongues in church, seen as a gift of the Holy Spirit, for
the first time when he was 8 or 9, his father said.

``Darius liked excitement, so it followed that that experience would be
very attractive to him,'' Mr. Settles said.

He attended Nashville State Community College, got a job at a local
clothing store and discovered he had a passion for clothes, his friend
and fellow church musician Weston Jordan said. Clothes and church. At
Greater Original Christ Temple in the Old Hickory neighborhood, he met
Angela Washington, a Chicago native who had moved to Nashville for
college. They married in 2013.

In addition to his wife and father, Mr. Settles is survived by a son,
Samari; his mother; and three siblings, Donavon, Danielle and Deja.

Always he had plans --- to go to law school, to enter the ministry, to
start a podcast, to create an app to help musicians find gigs. ``But the
suit thing really took off,'' Mr. Jordan said. ``That was his dream.''
Running his own business in Nashville, he built a clientele largely of
ministers, including his father.

Mr. Settles was the guy who made people laugh, but he was trying to
become more serious, and be seen as such, Mr. Thompson said. ``He really
put an effort into it,'' he added. ``The last time we were together, he
called afterward and said: `Did you see me? I'm more chill.'''

Mr. Thompson said he was sure that Darius had said it with a big, joyful
smile.
