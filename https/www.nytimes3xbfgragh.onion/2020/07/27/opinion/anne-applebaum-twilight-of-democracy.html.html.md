Anne Applebaum’s new book, “Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of
Authoritarianism,” begins cinematically, with a party she threw at a
Polish manor house to mark the dawn of the new millennium.

Applebaum’s husband was then the deputy foreign minister in Poland’s
center-right government; she was a right-leaning journalist who would go
on to write a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the Soviet gulag. Many
of the guests came from the cosmopolitan anti-Communist intelligentsia.
About half of them, she writes, no longer speak to the other half.

In “Twilight of Democracy,” Applebaum tries to understand why so many of
her old friends — conservatives who once fancied themselves champions of
democracy and classical liberalism — have become paranoid right-wing
populists. “Were some of our friends always closet authoritarians?” she
asks. “Or have the people with whom we clinked glasses in the first
minutes of the new millennium somehow changed over the subsequent two
decades?”

To Applebaum, today’s right, in both America and Europe, “has little in
common with most of the political movements that have been so described
since the Second World War.” Until recently, she writes, the right was
“dedicated not just to representative democracy, but to religious
tolerance, independent judiciaries, free press and speech, economic
integration, international institutions, the trans-Atlantic alliance and
a political idea of ‘the West.’” What happened?

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like Applebaum, I’m astonished to see erstwhile Cold Warriors abase
themselves before Vladimir Putin. But I think she’s working from a
mistaken premise about what once constituted conservatism. Liberal
democracy per se was never the animating passion of the trans-Atlantic
right — anti-Communism was. When the threat of Communist expansion
disappeared, so did most of the right’s commitment to a set of values
that, it’s now evident, were purely instrumental.

Reading Applebaum’s book, I kept thinking of an [infamous 1981
interview](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/)
given by the Republican campaign consultant Lee Atwater. In the 1950s,
Atwater said, Southern conservatives would just repeat a vile racial
slur. By 1968, “that hurts you, backfires,” he said. “So you say stuff
like forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff.” From there,
right-wing politics grew even more abstract, so “now you’re talking
about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are
totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt
worse than whites,” he said.

There were always some American conservatives who really were in it for
laissez-faire economics. But it’s now clear that those conservatives
were wrong about their movement’s animating passion. So too with those
on the center-right who thought their comrades were opposed to
authoritarianism on principle.

Back when the idea of a President Trump still seemed an absurdist
impossibility, the political theorist Corey Robin wrote, in his 2011
book “The Reactionary Mind,” about the recurring argument that
conservatism had slipped its sober mooring to become populist and
radical.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He saw this as a misunderstanding of the right. In his view, reaction
has always had a revolutionary edge. Conservatism, he wrote, seeks to
“make privilege popular, to transform a tottering old regime into a
dynamic, ideologically coherent movement of the masses.” Seen this way,
corrupt autocratic populists like Trump and Viktor Orban of Hungary fit
quite neatly into the tradition Applebaum was once part of.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In her book, Applebaum explores the purported ideological evolution of
the Fox News host and Trump sycophant Laura Ingraham, an anti-immigrant
demagogue who has three adopted immigrant children. In the 1990s,
Applebaum associated Ingraham with a “kind of post-Cold War optimism,”
an American conservatism that was “energetic, reformist and generous.”

But it’s hard to see what was ever reformist, never mind generous, about
Ingraham. She first came to [public
notice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1984/07/16/us/dartmouth-group-privacy-battle-concord-nh-july-15-ap-student-reporter-s-taping.html)
as the editor of a conservative college newspaper who sent an undercover
reporter to a meeting of a gay student group and published attendees’
intimate revelations.

Many adults, of course, transcend their college selves, but Ingraham
never seemed to. It was 2003, not 2016, that Ingraham complained about
“police departments, hospitals, courts, schools and government
agencies” that “now prefer hiring multilingual employees owing to the
number of illegal and non-English-speaking immigrants in the community.”
Her conversion to Trumpism doesn’t require much explanation.

I’m genuinely [grateful for the moral
courage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/28/opinion/trump-human-scum-tweet.html)
and concrete political work of anti-Trump conservatives. It can’t be
easy to break with the politics and the people that have defined one’s
life. I’m aware, too, that the left has its own ingrained pathologies;
Applebaum’s center-right views were shaped by the lived reality of
Soviet Communism.

“Twilight of Democracy” is certainly worth reading. Applebaum has a keen
understanding of how conspiracism and corruption intertwine to suffocate
democracy. Her description of Poland’s Law and Justice government, which
has “put a fantasy at the heart of government policy,” helps illuminate
the role Trump’s obsession with the “deep state” has played in our own
rolling catastrophe.

But there’s no mystery in the right’s surrender to authoritarianism,
because for many of the people Applebaum describes, it wasn’t a
surrender at all. It was a liberation.
