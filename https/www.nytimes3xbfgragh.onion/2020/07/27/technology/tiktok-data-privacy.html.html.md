# What to Do About TikTok

Instead of banning the app, U.S. officials could force it to be more
transparent.

*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up

receive it weekdays.*

Don’t ban TikTok. Restrain it. And then apply those same restraints to
the American internet powers, too.

That’s what Kevin Roose, a New York Times technology columnist, [wrote
in his latest
column](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/technology/tiktok-china-ban-model.html)
about
[TikTok](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html),
the app owned by an internet giant based in Beijing. Some [U.S.
officials
worry](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/technology/tiktok-washington-lobbyist.html)
that the app could let China’s government spy on Americans or spread
propaganda.

I talked with Kevin about his proposed fix to make TikTok — and American
internet companies, too — more open and less data-hogging, and how to
sniff out the valid concerns about the video app from the less
legitimate ones.

**Shira: Let’s start with TikTok. What are the reasonable concerns about
it?**

**Kevin:** Because TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance, it
could be compelled to give the data it collects on people watching
videos to the Chinese government and abide by its censorship laws.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And let’s be real, TikTok has done things in the past that contributed
to the sense of suspicion — [temporarily removing a viral
video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-28/tiktok-restores-account-of-user-who-criticized-china-on-uighurs)
that criticized the Chinese government’s treatment of Uighur Muslims,
for example.

**Well, if TikTok is potentially dangerous because it’s Chinese, then
isn’t the solution to ban it or** **[sell it to non-Chinese
owners](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/dealbook/tiktok-bytedance-investors-trump.html)?**

An American-owned TikTok could still legally sell user data to a
third-party data broker, who could then sell it to the Chinese
government.

What you really need is a federal privacy law that applies to all
internet platforms operating in the United States, no matter whether
they’re Chinese or American. If a big worry is data security, then this
is a useful moment to impose more rules for TikTok and other companies
on how they’re collecting and using information about us.

TikTok also plays an important role in American technology. It’s
Facebook’s only real competitor, and the [creative
culture](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/19/style/high-school-tiktok-clubs.html)
on the app [would be a shame to
lose](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Yes to** **[more data
regulation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/technology/just-collect-less-data-period.html)\!
What else?**

Another thing that makes TikTok powerful — and potentially dangerous —
is that the videos served to us are based on opaque algorithms that we
can’t see or inspect. The U.S. government could demand more transparency
as a condition of allowing TikTok to continue operating.

Ideally, this should also apply to Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.
These algorithms [shape our culture, politics and personal
beliefs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/technology/rabbit-hole-podcast-kevin-roose.html),
and we know basically nothing about how they work.

**Why doesn’t the United States already have national laws about
algorithm transparency and data privacy?**

Great question\! Many of our elected officials are — how to put this
delicately — *undereducated* about technology. Tech companies have also
been lobbying against some of these issues when they’ve arisen.

**Why all this talk about TikTok now? What changed?**

Right, we’ve been getting technology hardware from China for many years
with few complaints from regulators. I think what’s new here is the
Trump administration’s desire to appear tough on China.

**Isn’t TikTok useful for American internet powers? At a congressional
antitrust**
**[hearing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/technology/amazon-apple-alphabet-facebook-congress-antitrust.html)**
**this week, I bet Facebook will cite TikTok as** **[evidence of healthy
competition](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-27/zuckerberg-to-tell-congress-facebook-s-success-is-patriotic).
And Facebook can say,** **[LOOK OVER
THERE](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/technology/us-china-technology.html)**
**— SCARY\!**

Yes, it’s a great foil. And Facebook’s new TikTok competitor, Instagram
Reels, is [about to
launch](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/07/19/facebook-tiktok-competitor-instagram-reels-launch/5467934002/),
which makes all of this much more interesting.

### Tip of the Week

## The nerd gadget I wish everyone owned

[*Brian X. Chen*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/brian-x-chen)*,
a personal technology writer for The Times, wants us all to consider an
alternative to cloud computing services like iCloud and Dropbox.*

Let me tell you why it’s worth considering the odd sounding N.A.S.

It stands for network-attached storage — awful jargon for what is
essentially a mini computer data center in your home. Setting one up
isn’t easy, but it gives us a more private, potentially less expensive
way to save and access our digital files, photos and videos from
anywhere.

A N.A.S. is a device containing one or more hard drives that you plug
into your home internet service. It creates something like a personal
cloud service — similar to Google Drive or Dropbox, but you don’t have
to pay a subscription fee to those companies. And because all the data
is stored on your own equipment, no company can see the information
you’ve saved there.

I have a Synology N.A.S. with a pair of one-terabyte hard drives that I
use instead of Apple’s iCloud to back up the data on my Mac. When my
smartphone and tablets begin running out of storage space, I move large
video files and photos to the N.A.S. and delete the files from my
devices.

If I’ve lost you by now, I get it. N.A.S. servers are designed for
people with above-average levels of tech proficiency. And they’re not
cheap to set up. A decent N.A.S. server, including hard drives, will
cost upward of $500.

But it’s worth considering if you have the interest and time to study
up. [Read Techradar’s guide on picking a
N.A.S](https://www.techradar.com/news/the-10-best-nas-devices-reviewed).
Then check out tutorials from Synology on using a N.A.S. to back up your
[Windows](https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Backup/How_to_back_up_data_from_Windows_computer_to_Synology_NAS_using_Windows_or_3rd_party_applications)
or[Mac
computer](https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Backup/How_to_back_up_files_from_Mac_to_Synology_NAS_with_Time_Machine).
You can also research other things you might want to do with a personal
cloud, like [streaming
movies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/technology/personaltech/streaming-media-home-server.html)
or [creating a virtual private
network](https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/help/VPNCenter/vpn_setup)
to protect your information when using a hotel’s insecure Wi-Fi
connection, for example.

Setting up a N.A.S. can be difficult and frustrating, but the potential
payoff is huge.

## Before we go …

  - **It’s hard to be above the fray in the nation’s capital:** The
    Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos wanted to make a splash in
    Washington as a statesman tackling big policy topics like climate
    change and as the steward of The Washington Post. But Bezos has been
    [dragged into mucky political
    realities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/business/jeff-bezos-amazon-congress.html),
    including testifying later this week at the congressional hearing
    investigating the power of big tech companies, my colleagues David
    McCabe and Karen Weise write. (In Tuesday’s newsletter, I’ll have a
    conversation with Karen about Bezos.)

  - **The information war is playing out in Facebook fact-checking:** My
    colleague Anton Troianovski digs into a small group that Facebook
    hired to slow Russian propaganda and other online misinformation in
    Ukraine. Critics say the [fact checkers’ work veers into political
    activism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/world/europe/ukraine-facebook-fake-news.html),
    showing how finding unbiased fact checkers can be tough in a country
    at war.

  - **Creative uses of TikTok carry on:** The Los Angeles Times
    [writes](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-26/papas-on-el-tiktok-how-latino-dads-are-using-the-app-to-connect-with-their-children?_amp=true&__twitter_impression=true&s=09)
    about middle-aged Latino dads who make TikTok videos of themselves
    playing around with their kids in ways that sometimes explode
    cultural stereotypes of hypermasculine Latino fathers.

### Hugs to this

This 20-year-old college student made a [stunning TikTok
video](https://www.tiktok.com/@thejulianbass/video/6844906456471457030?lang=en)
that shows him transforming into superheros using special effects he
created himself. And he’s [getting attention for it from
Hollywood](https://www.kqed.org/arts/13882973/a-student-gets-supersized-attention-after-superhero-video-goes-viral?utm_medium=Email&utm_source=ExactTarget&utm_campaign=summerlearning20&mc_key=003i000001Xhtw9AAB).
