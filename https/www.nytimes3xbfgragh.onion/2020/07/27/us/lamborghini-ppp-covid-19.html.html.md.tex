prosecutors said.

A man in Florida who received nearly \$4 million in federal loans
intended to help struggling businesses --- and spent the money on a new
Lamborghini Huracán sports car and other fraudulent purchases ---~was
arrested and charged with three felonies, officials said on Monday.

David T. Hines, 29, of Miami, was charged with bank fraud, making a
false statement to a lending institution and engaging in transactions in
unlawful proceeds, according to prosecutors in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of Florida. If convicted on all charges, he
could face up to 70 years in prison, an official in the prosecutor's
office said.

In April, Mr. Hines joined scores of other business owners who are
seeking financial help from the federal Paycheck Protection Program, a
loan program created to help businesses keep their employees during the
coronavirus pandemic.

On his applications, Mr. Hines said he operated four businesses with 70
employees and had \$4 million in monthly expenses.

By the next month, Mr. Hines started receiving money from the loan
program. He received three payments totaling \$3,984,557, according to
the authorities. As that money came in, Mr. Hines continued submitting
requests for more funds. Eventually, his requests totaled \$13,542,741,
officials said.

What came next, based on a review of Mr. Hines's financial records, was
a spending spree that included luxury jewelry, expensive clothes, visits
to resorts in Miami Beach and expenses on dating websites, officials
said.

``There does not appear to be any business purpose for most, if not all,
of these expenses,'' Bryan Masmela, a U.S. postal inspector, wrote in an
affidavit outlining more than a dozen of Mr. Hines's payments from May
to June.

Mr. Hines's lawyer, Chad Piotrowski, said in a statement that his client
was ``a legitimate business owner who, like millions of Americans,
suffered financially during the pandemic'' and ``is anxious to tell his
side of the story when the time comes.''

Telephone messages left for Mr. Hines were not immediately returned as
of Monday night.

Mr. Hines made two payments in May totaling \$30,000 to a person listed
as ``Mom,'' officials said. The same month, he paid more than \$4,000 to
Saks Fifth Avenue. In June, Mr. Hines paid more than \$7,000 to the
Setai Hotel in Miami Beach, and \$8,500 to the jewelry company Graff.

The biggest purchase appears to have been made on May 18, when Mr. Hines
bought a blue Lamborghini for \$318,497 in North Miami Beach, officials
said. He registered the vehicle under his name and that of one of his
businesses.

Monthly expenses for Mr. Hines's companies averaged around \$200,000,
far below what he claimed on his federal loan applications, the postal
inspector said.

In fact, there was no record of Mr. Hines's businesses --- Unified
Relocation Solutions LLC, Promaster Movers Inc., Cash In Holdings LLC
and We-Pack Moving LLC --- having ``any operating websites,'' according
to the affidavit from the postal inspector.

Two of his businesses did have a history of complaints.

On the Better Business Bureau website, customers complained that two of
Mr. Hines's businesses conducted ``bait-and-switch practices and other
deceitful activities,'' according to the affidavit. ``Both businesses
are F-rated businesses on the site.''
