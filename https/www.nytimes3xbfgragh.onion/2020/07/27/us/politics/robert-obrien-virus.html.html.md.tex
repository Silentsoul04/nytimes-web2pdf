Mr. O'Brien is the most senior Trump official to test positive for the
coronavirus.

President Trump's national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, has
tested positive for the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html}{coronavirus},
the administration said on Monday.

Mr. O'Brien, 54, ``has mild symptoms'' and is working remotely from ``a
secure location off site,'' the administration said in a statement.

``There is no risk of exposure to the president or the vice president,''
it said. ``The work of the National Security Council continues
uninterrupted.''

Mr. O'Brien is the most senior White House official known to have
contracted the virus. He typically works from a West Wing office steps
away from the Oval Office and, under normal circumstances, may see the
president several times a day.

It is unclear when he was last in physical contact with Mr. Trump,
although he joined the president on a July 10 trip to Florida.

Speaking to reporters before departing the White House on Monday
afternoon, Mr. Trump said he had heard about Mr. O'Brien but did not
know when he had tested positive. ``I haven't seen him lately,'' the
president added.

Mr. O'Brien also traveled to Paris in mid-July, where he met with
several European security officials, visited an American war cemetery
and attended a Bastille Day celebration. It was unclear whether he had
become infected before or after that trip. The White House statement did
not provide further details.

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Larry Kudlow, Mr.
Trump's top economic adviser, said that Mr. O'Brien believed he had
contracted the virus from his daughter. ``Apparently it's a light
case,'' Mr. Kudlow said.

Senior White House aides are tested regularly for the virus, as is Mr.
Trump.

The development comes as Mr. Trump has begun to more frankly

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

Mr. O'Brien assumed his job in September, succeeding

R. Bolton, who resigned} after mounting conflicts with the president
over foreign policy.

He is the latest of several White House staff members and others in the
president's orbit who have tested positive for the coronavirus. They
include a military officer who works as a presidential valet at the
White House, as well as Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary,
Katie Miller, both of whom tested positive in early May. Last week, the
White House
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/white-house-employee-covid-19.html}{closed

positive.

Mr. Pence postponed a planned trip to Arizona this month after members
of his Secret Service detail tested positive or showed symptoms of the
virus.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/politics/kimberly-guilfoyle-trump-campaign-coronavirus.html}{Kimberly
Guilfoyle}, a former Fox News commentator who is dating Donald Trump
Jr., also contracted the virus,

did} several Trump campaign advance staffers who helped to arrange his
June rally in Tulsa, Okla.

Mr. O'Brien's deputy on the National Security Council, Matthew
Pottinger, was among the first White House officials to wear a mask. He
accompanied Mr. O'Brien on his trip to Paris this month.

The news of Mr. O'Brien's infection resonated quickly across the world.

Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalist Beijing newspaper Global Times,
\href{https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1287752860021604352}{tweeted}
that the news about Mr. O'Brien, a leading China hawk in the
administration, ``shows the pandemic has been completely out of control
in the US. No American is absolutely safe.''

``Novel coronavirus is truly US' top enemy now,'' he added.
