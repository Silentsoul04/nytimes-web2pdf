Appearances, as I’m sure you know, can be deceiving. In one
all-too-common example, adolescents and young adults with disordered
eating habits or outright eating disorders often go unrecognized by both
parents and physicians because their appearance defies common beliefs:
they don’t look like they have an eating problem.

One such belief is that people with anorexia always look scrawny and
malnourished when in fact they may be of normal weight or even
overweight, according to recent research at the University of
California, San Francisco.

The researchers, led by Dr. Jason M. Nagata, a specialist in adolescent
medicine at the university’s Benioff Children’s Hospital, [found in a
national
survey](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eat.23094) that
distorted eating behaviors occur in young people irrespective of their
weight, gender, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation. And it’s not just
about losing weight.

The survey revealed that among young adults aged 18 to 24, 22 percent of
males and 5 percent of females were striving to gain weight or build
muscle by relying on eating habits that may appear to be healthy but
that the researchers categorized as risky. These practices include
overconsuming protein and avoiding fats and carbohydrates. The use of
poorly tested dietary supplements and anabolic steroids was also common
among those surveyed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Covid-19 pandemic has likely exacerbated the problem for many
teenagers whose daily routines have been disrupted and who now find
themselves at home all day with lots of food being hoarded in kitchens
and pantries, Dr. Nagata said in an interview. “We’re seeing more
patients and referrals for eating disorders and their complications,” he
said.

Without a proper diagnosis and intervention, young people with distorted
eating behaviors can jeopardize their growth and long-term health and
may even create a substance abuse problem. The findings suggest that
abnormal behavior with regard to food and exercise is often overlooked,
misunderstood, ignored or perhaps viewed as a passing phase of
adolescence.

This is especially true among teenage boys. One-third of the high school
boys surveyed said they were trying to gain weight and bulk up, and many
were using risky methods to achieve their goals, Dr. Nagata told me.
Sixty percent of the girls surveyed said they were trying to lose
weight. Some consumed unbalanced diets that can jeopardize their growth
and long-term health; others resorted to induced vomiting or abused
laxatives, diuretics, diet pills or engaged in other hazardous behaviors
like fasting or excessive
exercise.

Over all, distorted eating was more than twice as common among females
than males. It was also reported more often among those who described
themselves as Asian/Pacific Islanders, gay, lesbian or bisexual.

The survey was conducted among a national sample of 14,891 young adults
who were followed for seven years, starting at an average age of 15. The
goal was to see if the youngsters’ perceptions and habits surrounding
food and exercise could serve as warning signs of behaviors that could
injure them physically and emotionally.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Among the boys in the study, those most at risk worried that their
bodies were puny — too small, too skinny or insufficiently muscular,
prompting them to consume unbalanced diets, exercise obsessively and
take supplements or steroids that are a hazard to their health. When
overly fixated on building their bodies, they can become socially
withdrawn and depressed and develop a disorder called muscle dysmorphia
that can lead to heart failure, resulting from insufficient calories and
overexertion.

A missed diagnosis is likely when a young person’s relatives or doctors
have preconceived notions about how someone with an eating disorder
looks or behaves. For example, Dr. Nagata said, a teenage girl or young
woman who is anorexic can fall under the medical radar because her
weight is normal or even overweight.

Although diagnosis of an eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia was
twice as common among the young adults whose weight was normal or
underweight, the fact that these disorders also exist in heavier young
adults is often overlooked, Dr. Nagata said.

“Almost half of those with anorexia nervosa are at or above normal
weight,” he said. “Young people with atypical anorexia have the same
body image distortions and severe psychological distress as those with
regular anorexia. They’re at high medical risk and just as likely to be
hospitalized for complications caused by their distorted eating
behaviors.”

Dr. Nagata’s colleague and co-author of the study, Dr. Kirsten
Bibbins-Domingo, an internist at the university, said in an interview,
“Physicians who care for young adults should think about patterns of
eating that are harmful, and not just among very thin women. Young
adults with abnormal eating habits too often fall between the cracks
because physicians think of them as healthy. However, abnormal eating
patterns are not uncommon in adolescence and young adulthood, and that’s
when patterns of behavior related to later health and disease are
established and
solidified.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The problem of disordered eating behaviors among teens and young adults
is often encouraged or compounded by participation in certain
competitive sports and other activities that overemphasize a particular
body weight and physique. Among these are gymnastics, wrestling, dance,
figure skating, weight lifting and bodybuilding.

Social media, with its heavy focus on appearance, has fostered the
problem as well, Dr. Nagata said. Even toys, like Barbie dolls and
action figures, have made a contribution. “A study of male action
figures found that they have become bigger, more muscular and more
extreme in their appearance over a 30-year period,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If youngsters are obsessed with an idealized body image, their thinking
and behavior become disordered and can take over their lives,” he said.
“The detrimental effects can be subtle. Prior to the pandemic, they
may have rejected going out with friends so they could spend more time
in the gym. It’s a warning sign when they withdraw from normal
activities and become preoccupied with their appearance.”

Unhealthy weight control methods can predispose people to eating
disorders and actually lead to weight gain, not loss. I struggled with
weight gain in my early 20s and, having failed to control my weight any
other way, I eventually resorted to fasting all day until supper. But
once I started eating, I couldn’t stop and ended up gaining even more
weight. I had developed a binge-eating disorder that resolved only when
I stopped trying to diet and returned to [eating three wholesome meals a
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/05/well/jane-brodys-personal-secrets-to-lasting-weight-loss.html),
including one small snack so I didn’t feel deprived.

Dr. Bibbins-Domingo wants doctors to be proactive in asking about eating
and exercise habits when treating adolescents and young adults. “They
should have a conversation about what these young people are eating,
when they’re eating and how they’re eating, and be able to give advice
about healthy eating patterns.

“Without making a value judgment about body size, they can open the door
to a discussion about eating and exercise habits,” Dr. Bibbins-Domingo
suggested. “The physician might ask, ‘What did you eat yesterday, and
where, and what do you think about the choices you made?’ or ‘Do you
want to address weight issues?’”

The pandemic may offer one silver lining, Dr. Nagata said. “With more
families eating meals together, it’s easier for parents to monitor what
their kids are eating.” Having family meals together is one of the basic
tenets of therapy for eating disorders, he said.
