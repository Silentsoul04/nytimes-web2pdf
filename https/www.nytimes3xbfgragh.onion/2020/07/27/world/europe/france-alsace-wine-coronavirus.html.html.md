# Of Wine, Hand Sanitizer and Heartbreak

</div>

Between the coronavirus and the Trump tariffs, the French wine market
has collapsed. So winemakers are — sadly — sending their excess product
off to another life as hand sanitizer.

HUNAWIHR, France — The tanker-truck pulled up and it was time to let it
go. The decision to send the wine to the distillery had been made weeks
ago. It still hurt. Soon the wine would be sanitizing hand gel.

“We’ve got to load it up now,” said Jérôme Mader, a 38-year-old
winemaker, muttering to himself. “OK, I am not even going to think about
it anymore,” he said quietly. “It’s over.”

Head down, he dragged the hoses out through his shed, affixed them to
the truck’s valves with the help of the driver, walked up to his cool
cellar, and turned on the pumps. The wine — good Alsace white wine,
drinkable wine — coursed through the hoses and into the truck’s belly.
Its fate didn’t bear thinking about.

Across the emerald Alsace wine country, now carpeted in deep-green vines
— and across France’s other wine regions as well — thousands of
winemakers, famous and obscure, are facing similar moments of
heartbreak.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus, combined with the
Trump administration’s 25 percent tax on French wines in the trade war
dispute with Europe, has collapsed the wine market.

Mr. Mader, whose high-quality Rieslings and Gewürztraminers are sent to
fancy restaurants and shops on both sides of the Atlantic, has lost half
his sales since December.

“Covid is a catastrophe for us,” he said.

And so some of the succulent and subtle white wine for which this region
is famous, nurtured on the stony, sunbathed Alsace slopes, will wind up
as hand sanitizer.

Like other winemakers, Mr. Mader has no room in his cellar to stock
unsold wine. “We can’t keep stocking what we haven’t sold,” he said.

The precocious 2020 harvest, blessed by abundant sunshine, is barely a
month away. The wine vats must be emptied for the new production. The
distillery, for modest compensation, is the only
option.

The driver from the distillery had been making the rounds of winemakers
all morning. “Some of them are taking this quite badly, because this
wine has commercial value,” the driver, Lucas Neret, noted dryly.

“We’re producing more than we can sell,” said Thibaut Specht, a
winemaker in nearby Mittelwihr. “We have no
choice.”

Marion Borès’s family business, Domaine Borès, in Reichsfeld, is sending
30 percent of its production — 19,000 liters. “It’s like you are saying
goodbye to somebody who is very dear to you,” she said.

“This is not exactly the destination we had in mind, when we made this
wine,” the 27-year-old winemaker added.

The old wine is ending up in the towering steel silos of the nearby
Romann distillery, where it will be boiled down to alcohol.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Alsace alone, over six million liters of wine, or about 1.5 million
gallons, will end up like this. Mr. Mader is sending 15 percent of his
production, wine he calls “Edelzwicker,” or “noble blend” in Alsatian
dialect. Usually sold wholesale, “it’s still pretty good,” Mr. Mader
said.

At the distillery, the odor of boiled-down wine, like the essence of a
rich beef burgundy sauce, hung heavy over the establishment on a warm
morning this
week.

“We’re continuously distilling,” said Erwin Brouard, the company’s
director. “It’s something that’s very sad for the winemakers. Their
stocks are too big. They’ve got to make space. And the harvest is early
this year.”

The French government, anxious to protect its precious wine heritage, is
subsidizing the operation, compensating the some 5,000 winemakers who
have signed up so far at a fraction of the wine’s value, less than $1
per liter, in what the government calls Crisis Distillation.

“My cellar is bursting, ”said Guillaume Klauss, who owns a nearby
winery. “If I don’t send it off, I don’t eat. Clearly this is tearing me
up. It’s three years of work, and we’re not even paid properly.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Alsace is having to resort to Crisis Distillation for the first time in
its history although it is not unknown in other wine regions. The last
time this happened was in 2009, after the financial
collapse.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is

        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“All the outlets are blocked,” he added. “Export is blocked. Trump,
Covid. There’s very little going on outside France. The American market,
blocked.”

Wholesale wine traders are facing losses of 70 percent, he said.

But the monetary losses are one thing. There is also the psychological
blow.

“Look, these people have a great deal of circumspection, and shame,” Mr.
Backert said. “They just don’t want to talk about it. Obviously, this is
breaking their heart.”

Some winemakers in the region refused to be interviewed on the subject.

The relationship to their vines, and what is produced from them, is
personal as much as financial. Many live in modest houses, carrying on a
family trade that often goes back centuries. The date carved above the
original Borès cellar is 1723.

On the sun-battered schist and sandstone slopes above Reichsfeld, Ms.
Borès patrolled vines she has worked in since the age of 10, plucking
out dead leaves and pulling shriveled grapes. Her touch was
light.

“These are vines that we fuss over the whole year round,” said her
mother, Marie-Claire. “We do everything by hand. And now, this.
Terrible.”

Climbing the steep slope, Marion said, “We played in these vines,”
adding that she takes part in the harvest herself.

“The schist is magical,” she said. “It is what makes the wine dynamic.
There are moments when you are really glad to be alone in these vines.”

In his career, Mr. Mader has won prizes, and has faced the opposite
problem he has today — not having enough wine to satisfy demand.

“To have imagined, a few years ago, that a truck would be passing by one
day … it’s unimaginable,” he said, his voice trailing off.

For days he put off making a decision about the distillery.

“I hesitated,” he said. “I thought we would get over it. I waited until
the last day to decide. I always think the next day will be better.”

But the decision couldn’t be postponed; the government was pressing with
its sign-up deadline.

Afterward, to console himself and colleagues, he said, “I called up a
friend and we drank a couple of bottles.”

“As long as the wine is good, there is always hope,” he added.

Orders have recently picked up, a little. Besides, “the grapes this year
are truly magnificent,” he
said.
