Misconduct}\label{hirshhorn-suspends-jon-rafman-show-after-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct}}

The move follows the suspension of an exhibition of the artist's works
at a Montreal museum earlier this month after several women accused him
of sexual misconduct on Instagram.

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington has put an
exhibition by the Canadian digital media artist Jon Rafman on hold after
several women have accused him of sexual misconduct.

``The Hirshhorn is aware of the allegations and has made the decision
not to move forward with the proposed exhibition at this time,'' a
spokeswoman for the museum said.

The exhibition, ``Jon Rafman: The Ride Never Ends,'' had been scheduled
to open in October. It would have been one of Mr. Rafman's largest solo
shows to date in the United States.

The Musée d'Art Contemporain de Montréal in Canada, Mr. Rafman's home
country, had already suspended an exhibition of his that had opened July
4 and was scheduled to run through September. The City of Montreal
\href{https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-puts-rafman-public-artwork-on-hold-re-sexual-coercion-allegations}{postponed
the unveiling} of a public artwork by Mr. Rafman, and his gallery in
Montreal, \href{http://bradleyertaskiran.com/en/}{Bradley Ertaskiran},
broke off its relationship with him last week.

The allegations, which were first
\href{https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/montreal-art-star-jon-rafman-facing-allegations-of-sexual-coercion}{reported
on} by The Montreal Gazette, were made via an anonymous Instagram
account called
\href{https://www.instagram.com/surviving_the_artworld/}{@surviving\_the\_artworld}
beginning July 16. Posts attributed to at least three women accused the
artist of ``sexual abuse,'' ``emotional abuse" and ``predatory
behavior.''

Mr. Rafman disputes the accusations. In a
\href{https://twitter.com/jonrafman/status/1286445645633449985}{statement}
published on his Twitter account last week, he said the women's
accounts, which he said were five or six years old, came as a shock. ``I
was not aware that these relationships were so upsetting for the women
who came forward,'' he said. He said his interactions with the women
were consensual and that he wanted to ``sincerely apologize for any
emotional pain that I may have caused.''

A post on Monday on the Instagram account that published the women's
allegations states that Mr. Rafman sent a cease and desist letter and
that the page owners intended to seek legal advice. ``We are
disheartened that this is the reaction to opening up a space to publicly
address experiences of abuse,'' the post said.

A spokeswoman for Sprüth Magers, a gallery that represents Mr. Rafman,
said in a statement that it was investigating the allegations and
condemns ``all forms of institutional and individual violence against
women.'' The gallery had recently hosted an online exhibition of Mr.
Rafman's work, which ended as scheduled on Saturday.

Mr. Rafman's work explores the relationship between humans and
technology. His exhibition at the Hirshhorn would have included his
famous ongoing photo project ``Nine Eyes of Google Street View,'' which
he began in 2008. The piece takes its name from the nine lenses mounted
on a Google Street View car, and uses screenshots of strange and
provocative images captured by the Google cameras.

He contributed a science-fiction essay film, ``Legendary Reality,'' to
the
\href{https://thejewishmuseum.org/index.php/exhibitions/leonard-cohen-a-crack-in-everything}{Leonard
Cohen exhibition} that debuted in Montreal in 2017 and made its
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/13/arts/design/leonard-cohen-jewish-museum-new-york.html}{way
to New York} in 2019. The stream-of-consciousness film draws on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/11/obituaries/leonard-cohen-dies.html}{Cohen's
work} and narrates the thoughts of someone imprisoned in his own mind.

Mr. Rafman is currently showing work at the
\href{https://www.centraalmuseum.nl/en/exhibitions/annex-jon-rafman}{Centraal
Museum Utrecht} in the Netherlands. The exhibition, which the museum
describes as a ``surrealist video installation,'' is scheduled to run
through Aug. 16.

A spokesman for that museum said it had only recently learned of the
allegations and was investigating the matter to determine further steps.
