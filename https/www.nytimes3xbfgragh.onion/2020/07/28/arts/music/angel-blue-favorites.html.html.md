# Angel Blue’s Weekend: Watching ‘Porgy and Bess’ and Keeping the Faith

The soprano is taking her version of a breather as she coaches students,
hosts a web talk show and savors time with her family.

Last year, Angel Blue spent only 54 nights at home.

“The first thing that comes into my mind is the Tasmanian devil, being
how fast he goes in the cartoon,” said Ms. Blue, a soprano who played
Bess in [“Porgy and
Bess”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/24/arts/music/porgy-bess-met-opera-review.html)
at the Metropolitan Opera earlier this year, as well as [Mimi in “La
Bohème](https://www.operabase.com/artists/angel-blue-1128/en)” at the
Hamburg State Opera, among other venues. “That’s how I felt — just
constantly going, constantly moving, constantly having to perform.”

In March, when the pandemic shuttered opera houses and stalled careers,
Ms. Blue was allied with her devastated colleagues. But she also
glimpsed a silver lining. “If I’m totally honest, I’m happy to be at
home,” she said. “I’ve been almost desperate for time off.”

Not that she has been idle. Like so many quarantined performers, Ms.
Blue found an audience behind the lens, and fulfilled her dream of
having a talk show. [“Faithful
Friday”](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/angeljoyblue/) streamed on
Facebook from March to June, with the singer [Christine
Goerke](https://www.christinegoerke.com/), the actor [Laverne
Cox](https://lavernecox.com/) and the chef [Cat
Cora](https://catcora.com/), among others, broaching topics like fear,
motivation, encouragement and job loss. Ms. Blue plans to return with a
second season in mid-September, with a lineup including the soprano
[Anna Netrebko](https://annanetrebko.com/), “who’s been really
supportive of me as a younger singer,” said Ms. Blue, 36.

And on Dec. 19, she’ll close out the [Met Stars Live in
Concert](https://metstarslive.brightcove-services.com/) virtual recital
series. Ms. Blue spoke by phone from New Jersey, where she lives with
her husband, Adam Mielke, a computer programmer, and their 9-year-old
son. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

### **Friday Morning**

Usually, I’m up at 6. It is so quiet. I love it when it is like this —
silent, still, no movement, just me, my thoughts, my daily devotional.
And then 20 minutes of meditation that helps me to understand what I
want from myself during that day. I’ll let myself sit there and just be
thankful that I can be still, because it’s really a blessing. I’ve been
running around for a long time.

Most mornings I do a two-mile walk on the treadmill in the basement.
Today I did an exercise video instead. When I did \[beauty\] pageants,
there was this lady named Leslie Sansone who did this video called
**[“Walk Away the
Pounds.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECxnTuzZ614)** **** Now she
has her own **[walking series](https://walkathome.com/)**. She’s
positive and uplifting.

I’m setting up my studio for this evening. Tonight **[“Porgy and
Bess”](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/gp-at-the-met-porgy-and-bess-about-the-opera/11582/)**
is going to be broadcast on PBS. I’m hosting a cast reunion on my
**[Facebook fan
page](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/angeljoyblue/)**. It’s strange
how nervous I am, I guess because I was that kid in school who, when
they invited people to their birthday party, not many people came.
\[Laughs\]

### **Friday Afternoon**

I just opened a one-on-one **[vocal coaching
studio](http://angeljoyblue.com/)**, where I coach young singers who are
interested in learning more about interpretation. My focus is to help
each singer better connect with the characters they are portraying. So
much emotion goes into our art form. Young singers might not realize
that it is times like these that will help to bring out their artistry.

I feel like I’ve done some of my best singing during the lockdown — this
is going to sound terrible, but I’m going to word it like this — because
I don’t have anyone bothering me about how I’m singing. Even the stress
of performing is different because the audiences aren’t there. In a way,
I’m on my own, and if I feel like crying during a certain section of the
music, I can do that.

### **Friday Night**

Honestly, I have no words right now. So many members of the
[\[](https://www.metopera.org/user-information/old-seasons/2019-20/2019-20-season/porgy-and-bess/)**[“Porgy
and
Bess”](https://www.metopera.org/user-information/old-seasons/2019-20/2019-20-season/porgy-and-bess/)**[\]](https://www.metopera.org/user-information/old-seasons/2019-20/2019-20-season/porgy-and-bess/)
cast indulged me and showed up to the reunion. I don’t know that I’ve
ever been in a show where everybody was good, and by good, I’m not
necessarily meaning the talent so much as it is we were in the same head
space. We speak about the show with a lot of affection. We were watching
all together at our homes, and we were texting, and people were sending
video clips and saying, “You better sing, Angel\!” That was really nice.

I’m one of those singers who does not go to sleep after a performance,
so yes, it is 2 a.m., but I’m awake. Wow\! I still cannot believe that I
had the opportunity to sing **[Bess at the
Met](https://www.metopera.org/user-information/old-seasons/2019-20/2019-20-season/porgy-and-bess/)**.
My husband has the biggest smile on his face right now. He said that I’m
acting like a kid who is getting ready to go to Disneyland.

### **Saturday Morning**

I started the day with a 45-minute walk-jog around our beautiful
neighborhood. I’m from California and only recently moved to New Jersey.
This state is so gorgeous. I love all of the trees and the deer in the
morning. Not going to lie: They scare me a little bit, but they are
beautiful.

Today I had a French lesson with **Mickaël Terosier**. He is an amazing
coach. I have not met a language professor who is more patient than him.
I studied French in school but have since forgotten much of it, so
working with Mickaël has definitely helped my confidence. I don’t like
to say that I’m fluent in any language, but I definitely do study quite
a lot of languages. Good grief, I think I’ve sung in something like 12
or 13. It’s wild.

### **Saturday Afternoon**

One of my favorite opera singers is **[Jonas
Kaufmann](https://www.metopera.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwx9_4BRAHEiwApAt0zkpYv_d3Xrthz9UgNlY2F7wlAM2dnARcjeAm4vSDllKiwc7KEg262RoCvYUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)**.
His recital is happening right now on the **[Metropolitan
Opera](https://www.metopera.org/)** website and yes, I’m drinking a
glass of rosé while watching. His singing is stunning and the
presentation is exquisite. I feel like I’m having a voice lesson. The
Met Opera gave me a huge honor in asking me to give a **[Met Stars Live
in Concert](https://metstarslive.brightcove-services.com/)** in
December. And I’m really thankful to be able to watch the other
performances before I give mine. I’m paying special attention to his
embouchure, and the positioning of his mouth. And the fact that he’s
singing these high notes, and he’s able to bring these high notes back
to a very soft piano, is just stunning.

### **Saturday Late Afternoon**

My husband and I both work during the week, and my son is in a virtual
summer camp, so on the weekends we try to spend time together without
any screens. But a couple of weeks ago we watched all of the **[“Back to
the Future”](https://www.backtothefuture.com/)** movies because I had
never seen them.

### **Sunday Afternoon**

Today is my good friend **[Matt
Anchel](https://www.matthewanchel.com/)**[’s](https://www.matthewanchel.com/)
birthday. He is having a socially distanced party in Riverside Park. I
haven’t been to New York since April 18 and when we turned right on
Riverside Drive, I honestly got teary eyed. I didn’t realize how much I
had missed the city. It was nice to be out and to see people enjoying
life. I didn’t take my mask off because I’m scared, but I’m scared of
everything, anyway. My husband took his mask off and I was like, OK,
that’s fine, but I’m going to be watching you for two weeks.

One thing I love about my friends in New York is that we are always
ready to talk about singing. When Matt asked me if I was OK with so many
jobs being canceled, I said, “Is it weird that I’m just so happy to be
able to be with my family?”

I’ve slept in the same bed for the last four months. I don’t remember
the last time that I did that.
