A folk virtuoso will be the artistic director of the cross-cultural
exchange organization founded by Yo-Yo Ma.

Trained as an opera singer, Rhiannon Giddens was a founding member of
the Carolina Chocolate Drops, the acclaimed folk group. With the
Chocolate Drops
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/01/25/arts/music/a-solo-spotlight-for-a-powerful-voice.html}{and
as a solo artist}, a virtuoso fiddler and banjo player with a soulful
voice, she has delved into African-American and old-time traditions. She
won a MacArthur ``genius'' grant in 2017
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/10/arts/music/rhiannon-giddens-opera.html}{and
wrote an opera} based on the autobiography of Omar Ibn Said, a Muslim
man from Africa who was enslaved in South Carolina. (Its planned
premiere has been delayed until next year by the coronavirus pandemic.)

Now she will have a new, global curatorial canvas for her genre-skipping
ideas. On Tuesday, Silkroad, the cross-cultural music organization
created by Yo-Yo Ma in 1998, announced that Ms. Giddens would be its
next artistic director.

``I've never been interested in `Hey, this is me, I'm singing a song,'''
Ms. Giddens, 43, said by phone from her home in Ireland. ``I'm more:
This is the message I'm trying to transmit, if me singing it will get it
out there. So this is a great opportunity to bring together what I've
been doing and what they've been doing.''

Silkroad
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2000/10/25/arts/a-multicultural-project-takes-a-high-road-the-silk-road.html}{began
over 20 years ago} as the Silk Road Project, an effort to bring together
performers, and music new and old, from the cultures centering on the
ancient network of trade routes between East Asia and the Mediterranean.
\href{https://www.silkroad.org/}{It has since expanded} into a
multifaceted performing, education and social justice organization with
a budget of over \$3 million, a broader geographic focus and a
reputation for fielding superb artists --- as well as some blurriness
about its activities, beyond the undeniable good intentions.

``Those are things I've heard, and thought myself: There's so much
talent and beauty, but what exactly do they do?'' Ms. Giddens said.
``What is the overriding mission? We have these resources, these amazing
musicians. Can we be saying more? Can we be putting a sharper focus on
what we're trying to say?''

One challenge will be continuing to guide Silkroad's relationship with
Mr. Ma, its artistic director until 2017 and by far its most prominent
asset, a superstar performer who opened doors to concertizing and
recording worldwide. ``Silkroad has to exist outside of Yo-Yo, but Yo-Yo
is an inalterable part of Silkroad,'' Ms. Giddens said. ``Both of those
things have to exist at the same time, and it has to take some thought
about how to do that in a way that feels good to everyone involved.''

Mr. Ma said in a statement that Ms. Giddens ``is an extraordinary human
being and musician.''

``She lives Silkroad's values," he added, ``at once rooted in history
and its many musics, and is an advocate for the contemporary voices that
can move us to work together for a better world.''

Ms. Giddens will become one of just a handful of women of color in
leadership positions in the music world, though she emphasized that her
talks with Silkroad had begun in February, well before the country
became engrossed
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/arts/music/black-classical-music-opera.html}{in
discussions about racial equity}.

``They saw all of these things before this was a national
conversation,'' she said of Kathy Fletcher, Silkroad's executive
director, and the organization's board. ``True diversity is diversity on
every level, and you have to see who was walking the walk when no one
was paying attention.''

Ms. Giddens added that her role will occasionally showcase her as a
performer, including at a Silkroad concert
\href{https://www.bso.org/Performance/Detail/111125}{available online
starting Wednesday} through Tanglewood. And she made a passionate case
for the kind of explorations in which the group specializes, even at a
time when the aggressive aspects of those cultural exchanges have been
highlighted --- and sometimes criticized --- as appropriation.

``There's a lot of negativity in our history for sure, but the music
that comes along with it is how our beauty is expressed,'' she said. ``I
think context is very important, and being willing to talk about what
things came from is paramount, whether it's from Iran or Tennessee. A
more sophisticated understanding of the music is a more sophisticated
understanding of the history, and that's what we need. And I'm bringing
a deep dive into the cultural mixing that is America.''
