# Emmys: Our Critics on ‘Watchmen,’ ‘Maisel’ and, Yes, ‘Tiger King’

</div>

This year brought bounties for “Watchmen” (hooray) and “The Marvelous
Mrs. Maisel” (again?), but should TV even be celebrating itself as a
pandemic rages on?

*The 2020 Primetime Emmy nominations were announced on Tuesday. James
Poniewozik and Margaret Lyons, two television critics for The New York
Times, conducted a brief conversation about puzzling picks and
oversights, the rise of the limited series and what a virtual Emmy
ceremony would — or should — even look like.*

**JAMES PONIEWOZIK** So it’s still unclear what sort of TV we will have,
or be making, in the fall, but we will at least have Emmys. Which is
where I feel I should kick this off.

I care a lot about TV. I have a harder time caring about TV *awards*
even ** in the best of years. And this, you may have noticed, is not the
best of years\! I’m really dubious about the idea of an awards gala
while the industry is still largely shut down (among other, more
consequential things).

That said, I also care about the people who care about TV, the people
who make it and the people who watch it. If this helps them — and us —
get through all of this a little more happily until we come out the
other side, that’s something.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**MARGARET LYONS** I guess, though I wonder if awards show enthusiasm
should get categorized with pinchy shoes, tedious grooming regimens and
pointless commutes — I get why we did it, but we’re not going back to
that. We have a chance to do things another way\! I love TV, too, but
there’s not a straight line between that and thinking the Emmys are a
worthy pursuit. Anyway, no Rhea Seehorn, what a shame.

**PONIEWOZIK** As for the nominations themselves: I have probably said
before that limited series have taken the cultural spot from TV movies,
a category that’s almost an afterthought now. But looking at the
nominees this year — not to mention what
[wasn’t](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/arts/television/normal-people-review.html)
[nominated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/13/arts/television/review-netflix-unbelievable.html)
— arguably they are also stealing the heat of drama series
too.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

You look, for instance, at “Mrs. America,” a historical drama from a
writer of “Mad Men” that took some of that show’s themes of feminism
(and the reaction to it) forward another decade. “Watchmen,” arguably
the show of the season well before the George Floyd protests underlined
its relevance, a one-off season from Damon Lindelof of “Lost” and “The
Leftovers.” I was also glad to see a nomination for “Unorthodox,” [which
I
loved](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/arts/television/unorthodox-review-netflix.html)
but was afraid was too quiet to get notice. American TV is really
discovering the power of the one-and-done.

omission.)

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**LYONS** Yeah, last year we both thought that the limited series
category was better than the drama category, and this year … that might
be true again, partially because lots of great dramas did not get
nominations. I know we both love [“David Makes
Man,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/arts/television/david-makes-man-hbo-max.html)
and I was surprised that [“The Good
Fight”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/arts/television/the-good-fight-premiere.html)
didn’t get any traction. I don’t understand who thinks this season of
“Handmaid’s Tale” was good. On the variety sketch front, how can
[“Sherman’s
Showcase”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/23/arts/television/south-side-shermans-showcase-review.html)
and “At Home with Amy Sedaris” be shut out? This process is not healing
me during quar\! It is angering me, or at least making me wonder what
people are getting from “Mrs. Maisel” that I am definitely not.

**PONIEWOZIK** There’s always an inertia issue with the Emmys, so for
instance I guess “Handmaid’s” has locked in the “important and relevant”
niche in the minds of voters, however much it turns into an erratic
dystopian roller coaster. Maybe “The Good Fight” suffered from having an
incomplete season? (I only hope the voters were paying that much
attention.) “Pose” deserved the “Handmaid’s” spot for its even stronger
second season. “Sherman’s” deserved to be in a category that weirdly had
a grand total of three nominees — and I would love to see the talk
category add some new blood, like a “Patriot Act” or “Desus and Mero.”

On a positive note, I always like to see credit due for great
performances in less-great shows. I [did not
love](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/30/arts/television/the-morning-show-apple.html)
“The Morning Show,” but Jennifer Aniston’s portrait of a pressured,
morally compromised star was terrific. (Steve Carell’s shouty co-star
turn, less so.) “Black Monday” is just a solid B show for me, but I do
love Don Cheadle’s swaggery energy in it. But man, while I’m turning to
comedies, Pamela Adlon should file an insurance claim for the robbery
that “Better Things”
suffered.

**LYONS** “Better Things” deserves, yep, better. “Lodge 49” getting shut
out is a bummer — I wasn’t expecting it to clean up, but it was entered
as a comedy, and I think there’s room in those categories for, oh, less
“Kominsky Method.” I am delighted to see “What We Do In the Shadows”
do so well, though. I like comedies that make me laugh, not just think
“oh, that’s funny,” or “how clever”
—<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>you know, the surprise and
joy of true laughter\! What a comedy can sometimes elicit\!

If I had one wish, I’d wish that “BoJack Horseman,” which was nominated
for best animated program, gets the “uh oh, it’s your last season, and
even though it was not the best season of the show, how can we let it go
by completely? Oh, what fools we’ve been” win, like Kyle Chandler
finally getting an Emmy for “FNL.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**PONIEWOZIK** Even at that, a “BoJack” win will still be shunted off to
the side, because of its category, when what it has actually been for
six seasons was one of TV’s best *comedies*. The Emmys often feel a
little tangential to the TV conversation of the moment — especially in
terms of the categories that get prime-time attention.

This wasn’t the case with “Watchmen,” of course, but I read an
interesting [L.A. Times
piece](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-07-27/emmys-2020-nominations-tiger-king-the-last-dance-cheer-mcmillions)
noting how the Emmys seems not to know what to do with documentary
series — despite how much bandwidth shows like “The Last Dance” take up.
Even as someone who ultimately didn’t like “Tiger King” (he’s weird, we
get the point), it does feel like one space where the Emmys are
overlooking where TV is in 2020. (While devoting a lot of attention to
“Dead to Me.”)

**LYONS** “Tiger King” got seven nominations. Is that really overlooked?
I will probably be stewing over snubs for a few more days — “Never Have
I Ever,” “High Maintenance,” “My Favorite Shapes,” I honor you in my own
ways — but maybe it’s also time to be curious about what the actual Emmy
ceremony will or should be. Calling in to a Zoom or whatever to lose an
award feels incredibly stupid, but avoiding dumb things is not our
culture’s forte.

**PONIEWOZIK** I get the “The show must go on” spirit. But a lot of
things *aren’t* going on now, with good reason, and maybe the Emmys
should be one of them. I don’t want to deny anyone their awards\! (Send
them FedEx\!) But a virtual Emmys, without the crowd dynamics that the
acceptance speeches thrive on, might just uncomfortably remind us of
everything that’s missing.

But I reserve the right to be surprised by an ingenious production idea.
Maybe they can find a way to hold the whole thing inside “Animal
Crossing.”
