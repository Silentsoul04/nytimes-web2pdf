**EAT THE BUDDHA**  
**Life and Death in a Tibetan Town**  
By Barbara Demick

Tibetans encountered Chinese Communists for the first time during the
Long March of the mid-1930s, when Mao’s Red Army evaded the Nationalist
forces by heading west and north through the Tibetan plateau. The
famished Chinese soldiers picked the fields bare. They stole yaks, sheep
and grain (though some of them, reluctant to jettison the Communist
principle of helping the rural poor, left i.o.u.s). They swept through
monasteries, melting down copper urns for shrapnel, ripping up
floorboards for firewood, sitting on sacred scroll paintings and eating
boiled yak hide torn from temple drums. They were delighted to discover
that *tormas* — votive offerings made of barley flour and butter — were
also edible. Some *tormas* are sculpted in human form, and the soldiers,
assuming they were committing a sacrilege but too hungry to care,
believed they were eating statues of the Buddha.

Hence the title of “Eat the Buddha,” a brilliantly reported and
eye-opening work of narrative nonfiction by Barbara Demick, the former
Beijing bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times, on the history of Tibetan
resistance to Chinese domination. Demick centers the book in and around
the town of Ngaba, on the eastern plateau. I was initially disappointed
to learn that Ngaba isn’t in the Tibet Autonomous Region — the
territory, governed by China, whose capital is Lhasa and which most of
us think of as Tibet — but rather in Sichuan, one of the four Chinese
provinces in which the majority of Tibetans live. I assumed that Demick
hadn’t focused on the TAR because of access problems: Visiting
journalists must obtain permission from the Chinese government, which is
rarely granted, and are usually required to travel with supervised
tours. But it soon became apparent that Ngaba — which has access
challenges of its own, though more surmountable ones — was *exactly* the
right place to write about. Nowhere else, inside or outside the TAR, has
been a more intense hotbed of Tibetan political unrest.

Ngaba currently has steel barricades at the entrances to town and
surveillance cameras that record the license plates of all cars arriving
and leaving, and, by one count, some 50,000 security personnel. (The
town’s population is around 15,000.) Demick guides us through the phases
of oppression and defiance, decade by appalling decade, which have led
the Chinese government to exert such heavy-handed control.

In the 1930s, the Red Army brought famine; the local residents fought
back with spears, flintlocks and muskets. In 1958, at the beginning of
Mao’s Great Leap Forward, the Chinese government deposed a beloved
regional king, forced the local people into collective farms,
confiscated livestock, closed markets, requisitioned or destroyed the
monasteries and beat or shot those who refused to fall in line.
Thousands starved. Demick writes, “Tibetans of this generation refer to
this period simply as *ngabgay* — ’58. Like 9/11, it is shorthand for a
catastrophe so overwhelming that words cannot express it, only the
number.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ten years later, the people of Ngaba rose up in a bloody rebellion that
ended with mass arrests and more than 50 deaths. During the late 1980s,
Ngaba residents who made or posted fliers supporting the Dalai Lama —
their spiritual leader, who had fled Tibet for India in 1959 — were
imprisoned. In 2008, in another Ngaba uprising, at least a dozen people
were killed.

The cycle of resistance, crackdown, resistance, crackdown — with the
crackdowns serving mainly as goads for further resistance — culminated
when locals, most of them current or former monks from Ngaba’s Kirti
Monastery, found a new and uniquely public way to protest Chinese rule
and call for the return of the Dalai Lama. In 2009, they started setting
themselves on fire. Over the next 10 years, nearly a third of Tibet’s
156 self-immolations would take place in or near Ngaba. Many of the
self-immolators have been the grandchildren of men who bore arms in
earlier uprisings. “The older generation produced the fighters,” Demick
writes. “The younger people, educated during the time of the 14th Dalai
Lama, took his teachings about nonviolence to heart. They couldn’t bring
themselves to kill anyone but
themselves.”

The first monk to attempt self-immolation survived, but his successors
upped their chances of success by swallowing gasoline as well as dousing
themselves in it and wrapping themselves in wire-trussed quilts. Ngaba —
“this nothing little town that had just gotten its first traffic light”
— became the self-immolation capital of the world.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Chinese government, angered by the latest threat to stability in a
chronically troublesome region, barricaded the monastery, brought in
paramilitary troops, made hundreds of arrests and cut off Ngaba’s
internet. Nonetheless, the deaths of many self-immolators found their
way to YouTube. “In the videos from Ngaba,” Demick writes, “one streaks
down a dimly lit gray street like a fireball. Another twitches and
crumples like a piece of paper thrown into a fireplace. Those whose
bodies are completely consumed shrivel as small as children, blackened
and twisting.”

The chapters on the self-immolations are the heart of “Eat the Buddha” —
the terrible climax for which Demick has prepared us through her
recounting of more than 60 years of religious repression and human
rights abuses. There’s a good deal of exposition, all of it essential,
but whenever possible, she presents Ngaba’s brutal history through the
stories of individual characters, the technique pioneered by John Hersey
in “Hiroshima.” (Hersey took the idea from the Thornton Wilder novel
“The Bridge of San Luis Rey,” which he read on his ship en route to
Japan.) I occasionally felt I needed an Excel spreadsheet to keep track
of all the players, some of whom vanish for long stretches — in one
case, for more than 100 pages — before re-entering the narrative. But
Demick, who used the same technique to excellent effect in her previous
books (“Logavina Street,” about Sarajevo, and “Nothing to Envy,” about
North Korea), knows what she’s doing.

As “Eat the Buddha” unfolds, we come to understand why she has
introduced this particular cast in sufficient detail to make us care
about them. They aren’t just a representative sampling of Ngaba
residents; they are people who have intersected with history. For
instance, the woman who sold counterfeit Nike sneakers turns out to be a
witness to Ngaba’s first, failed self-immolation; after the would-be
martyr’s robes burned and his face turned black, she saw Chinese
soldiers toss him into the back of a truck, “like an animal.” The young
monk who was given his first bath at age 7 after his mother brought him
to the Kirti Monastery turns out to be a close friend of the second
self-immolator and the half brother of the 21st. We are heartbroken by
that last death, as we couldn’t be if we read about it in a newspaper
headline, because we’ve heard about the summer the brothers spent
herding yaks in the hills, sharing a black felt tent and, when September
came, making snow angels together.

I realized early on — though probably later than some more alert readers
— that the end of the story for all the major characters would be
Dharamsala, India, the community of 100,000 Tibetans that is the home of
their government-in-exile. Of course it would be. They *couldn’t* still
live in Ngaba, since they would not have been safe from retribution if
Demick had interviewed them there. (She visited Ngaba three times, but
almost all her local sources are unnamed.) Because they couldn’t obtain
passports, most of them made their way to Dharamsala via various illegal
trajectories, some of them extortionately expensive, some hair-raising,
some both. They are now able to discuss politics, to worship without
restrictions, to display portraits of their spiritual leader. (And to
see him in person. The Dalai Lama has lived there since 1960.)

But India is no paradise; more exiles are returning to Tibet than
leaving it. Demick writes of Dharamsala, “I met many Tibetans spinning
with indecision. Their families send them photos on WeChat of new cars
and motorcycles, remodeled houses and appliances” — the perks of China’s
economic boom. On the other side of the balance there is the businessman
in Ngaba, the owner of an SUV, an iPhone and an iPad, who tells Demick
in the final chapter of this harrowing but necessary book, “I have
everything I might possibly want in life, but my freedom.”
