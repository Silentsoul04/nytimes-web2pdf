In a typical year, when the thick summer heat descends, you might plot
an escape from everyday life. But this is not a typical year, and
whether you're trapped in your home office or on your couch, the urge to
get away from it all is likely stronger than ever. A road trip --- one
way to take a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/travel/virus-vacation.html?searchResultPosition=4}{cautious
vacation} --- might be the answer to this malaise. But if you'll be
staying put, these books offer the thrills of the open road, of driving
fast into a new reality, far from the safety of your own home.

The title of Mona Simpson's first novel, ``Anywhere But Here,'' might
capture your current mood. But hopefully you have it better than Ann,
the 12-year-old daughter of the charismatic yet impulsive Adele. The
pair flee Wisconsin for California in the hopes of making Ann a child
star, yet their path is littered with Adele's emotional detritus. The
story's rich details,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1987/01/11/books/in-thrall-to-a-lethal-mother.html}{our
reviewer wrote in 1987}, are ``generous irrelevances --- the author
taking time out from her characters and their battling to enjoy the
world that contains them and us.''

Image

For science fiction that hits close to home, turn to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/09/14/books/review/station-eleven-by-emily-st-john-mandel.html}{Emily
St. John Mandel's} ``Station Eleven.'' A flu pandemic wipes out most of
the world's population within weeks. Twenty years later, a troupe of
performers roam North America, performing mostly Shakespeare to the
remaining human enclaves. Like so many of us, they only want ``what was
best about the world.''

While many road trips head west, the family in Jade Chang's ``The Wangs
vs. the World'' drives in the opposite direction. In the wake of the
2008 financial crisis, the devastated Wangs pack up their Bel Air estate
and drive to upstate New York. Chang proves,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/16/books/review/wangs-vs-the-world-jade-chang.html}{our
reviewer wrote in 2016}, that struggling with the immigrant identity
``can at least be funny and strange, especially when you struggle
together with family.''

If the White House is on your mind, consider
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/05/08/books/review/assassination-vacation-dead-presidents.html}{Sarah
Vowell's} ``Assassination Vacation,'' a humorous road trip into
presidential history. The ``This American Life'' regular travels to an
array of historic sites connected to the assassinations of Presidents
Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. Vowell combines gruesome historical
details and prescient political insights, all with a healthy dose of
cheek. And couldn't we all use a laugh?

Image

``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/12/07/books/review/Sutton2-t.html}{Paper
Towns},'' by John Green, is a young-adult novel, but don't let that
deter you. When popular girl Margo Roth Spiegelman drags her nerdy
neighbor Quentin out of his room at midnight, high jinks ensue. But
when, the very next day, Margo disappears, a series of clues lead
Quentin to embark on a cross-country road trip to find her.

When William Least Heat-Moon lost his job teaching English, he set out
to explore the back roads of American life. His book ``Blue Highways''
was the result. Heat-Moon visited small towns like Subtle, Ky., and
Scratch Ankle, Alaska, absorbing local color and wisdom. He traveled the
country's perimeter in this way,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1983/01/13/books/books-of-the-times-159989.html}{our
reviewer wrote in 1983}, ``as if he wanted to try to grasp it in his
arms.''

Not a car person? Consider the motorcycle. Melissa Holbrook Pierson's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1998/03/01/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-672262.html}{``The
Perfect Vehicle''} recounts the joys of biking and its community, while
providing a history of the mode of transport. Pierson writes that bikers
prefer the motorcycle because they ``want a way to feel fully engaged
with and even vulnerable to their surroundings.'' And at this particular
moment, open-air transportation certainly has its appeal.
