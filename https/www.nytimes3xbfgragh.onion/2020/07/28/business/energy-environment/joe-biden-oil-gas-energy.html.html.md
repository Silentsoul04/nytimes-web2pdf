HOUSTON — [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
won over environmentalists and liberals when he announced [a $2 trillion
plan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html)
to promote electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other policies
intended to address climate change.

But the plan released on July 14 has also earned a measure of support
from an unexpected source: the oil and gas industry that is closely
aligned with the Trump administration and is a big source of campaign
contributions to the president.

That might seem odd considering that the plan aims for “net-zero”
greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050, in part by discouraging
the use of fossil fuels. Mr. Biden also wants to spend more on mass
transit, expand solar and wind farms and build thousands of electric
vehicle charging stations.

Yet the industry was relieved by what the plan did not include, chiefly
[a ban on hydraulic
fracturing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/us/politics/biden-sanders-task-force.html),
the approach that has turbocharged domestic production of oil and gas
over the past dozen years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There is a lot of room in there for oil and gas,” said Matt Gallagher,
president of Parsley Energy, a West Texas oil producer, about the Biden
plan.

Some executives were particularly enthusiastic that Mr. Biden wanted the
federal government to invest in [carbon capture and
sequestration](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/climate/carbon-capture-tax-break.html),
which entails preventing emissions of greenhouse gases from reaching the
atmosphere and thus allowing industry to continue burning fossil fuels
for decades. In a sign of his all-inclusive, eclectic approach to
energy, Mr. Biden is also proposing to use [advanced nuclear
reactors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/20/science/advanced-nuclear-reactors-department-of-energy.html)
to produce electricity.

“There is some common ground,” said Mike Sommers, president of the
American Petroleum Institute, which represents the industry in
Washington and is close to the Trump administration. “We appreciate the
fact that they recognize that there is going to be [a role for natural
gas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/business/energy-environment/renewable-energy-natural-gas.html)
and oil in our future. We share the broad goal of reducing emissions and
addressing climate change.”

“At first blush, the plan is a masterpiece because he gives something to
everybody,” said Mr. Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a gas
producer that is planning a major export terminal in Louisiana.
“Investment in infrastructure is great, $400 billion for research and
development is phenomenal and way overdue.”

Like almost all the fossil fuel executives, however, Mr. Souki had some
reservations. He described Mr. Biden’s goal of eliminating carbon
emissions from the electricity sector by 2035 as “unrealistic and
unachievable.” He said Mr. Biden ought to strive for “carbon
neutrality,” in which emissions from power plants would be offset by
planting trees and using [new technologies to suck carbon out of the
air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/07/business/energy-environment/climate-change-carbon-engineering.html).

Of course, most oil and gas executives would prefer President Trump be
re-elected because he has [spent the past three and a half years rolling
back
regulations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/climate/trump-biden-environment.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article).

Fossil fuel interests have donated seven times more to the Trump
campaign than the Biden campaign through June, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group. Those numbers are
skewed in part because Mr. Trump has been raising money since he took
office in 2017.

The president’s most ardent supporters in the energy industry said Mr.
Biden’s plan was craftily intended to appear moderate so he could
compete with Mr. Trump [in states that produce oil and
gas.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/business/energy-environment/pennsylvania-shale-gas-fracking.html)

“He [wants to win
Pennsylvania](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/27/us/politics/pennsylvania-democrats-fracking.html),
so he toned down that rhetoric for obvious reasons,” said Kathleen
Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance in Denver.

Yet energy executives have complaints with the Trump administration,
too. Some natural gas executives privately grouse that [the president’s
trade war has cost them
dearly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/business/energy-environment/china-trade-deal-energy.html)
because China, the world’s biggest gas importer, has bought only three
cargoes of [liquefied natural
gas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/business/energy-environment/natural-gas-exports-coronavirus.html)
from the United States over the past 22 months.

Other executives say Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris
climate accord needlessly hurt the country’s image abroad. And some
think that the administration’s botched handling of [the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus) has
dealt [a big blow to the economy and demand for
energy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/business/economy/texas-economy-oil-coronavirus.html).

“Masks are good for the economy,” Mr. Gallagher of Parsley Energy said.
“Masks need to be an economic thing, not a political thing.”

To shore up his base in oil country, Mr. Trump plans to attend a
fund-raising lunch in Odessa, Texas, on Wednesday and tour an oil rig.

Stef Feldman, the Biden campaign’s policy director, said it was not
surprising that some oil and gas executives were open to some of Mr.
Biden’s ideas. “More and more energy companies are realizing the reality
of climate change, the direction consumers are headed, the direction
other businesses are headed and they are making changes as a result,”
she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When asked about fracking, Ms. Feldman said Mr. Biden would end new
leases for fracking on federal lands but that “he does not support a
complete ban on fracking.”

Some executives said they were comfortable with Mr. Biden in part
because the Obama administration [did not block
fracking](https://archive.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/gwire/2010/12/14/14greenwire-obama-admin-wants-study-but-backs-northeast-sh-25319.html)
and even approved drilling in Arctic waters in Alaska. They say Mr.
Biden understands the importance of limiting reliance on foreign oil,
and using energy exports to help allies like Japan and undercut rivals
like Russia.

“The policy of a Biden administration or a Trump administration might
not be so different in the sense of leveraging exports of gas and oil as
a foreign policy tool,” said Charlie Riedl, executive director of the
Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, an industry group.

There is also growing recognition among some in the oil and gas business
that climate change is a problem that the industry has to help address.

“Everyone I know knows we have more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
than we used to and it’s common sense that it’s probably not a good
thing and we have to do something about it,” said Lawrence B. Dale,
chairman of Dale Operating Company, a Dallas-based company that has
investments in 5,000 oil and gas wells.

Mr. Dale said he was pleased that Mr. Biden had put forward an energy
plan that did not endorse [the Green New
Deal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/21/climate/green-new-deal-questions-answers.html),
a climate proposal embraced by many progressive lawmakers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Support for Mr. Biden’s plan is clearly stronger among other parts of
the energy industry, including electric utilities and renewable energy
companies.

The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned
utilities, said its members were generally aligned with Mr. Biden’s plan
for a clean electricity grid.

Pedro J. Pizarro, president and chief executive officer of Edison
International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, said
the Biden plan’s emphasis on clean energy jobs, energy efficiency and
transportation was smart. If anything, he said, the proposals for more
electric vehicle chargers would most likely need to be increased, as
emissions from cars and trucks remain a major contributor to climate
change.

“While the devil is in the details, we think the plan mostly gets it
right,” Mr. Pizarro said.

The Biden plan would renew the federal government’s efforts to improve
energy efficiency that the Trump administration has whittled away. The
proposal also calls for extending tax credits for solar and wind power,
which have become increasingly competitive against natural gas. Wind and
solar groups also endorse Mr. Biden’s proposals to strengthen the
electricity transmission network to help their technologies.

At least some in the renewable energy business accept that the Biden
plan will keep fossil fuels in the energy mix.

“I don’t want to minimize in the near term that natural gas is an
important partner,” said Tom Kiernan, chief executive of the American
Wind Energy Association. “What we’re seeing is all kinds of
combinations.”

That oil and gas interests are OK with a potential Biden presidency
might scare some liberals, said Robert Shrum, the director of the
