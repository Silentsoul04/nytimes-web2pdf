A smartphone with a strong internet connection is the only tool you
really need to livestream a wedding to your friends and family. But if
you want to heighten your production quality, and pull off a memorable
livestream for your digital guests, you'll need some extra gadgets.

To help livestream their May 16 wedding in Cincinnati, Jennifer Noble,
32, and David Gregory, 34, hired
\href{https://www.chilidogpictures.com/}{ChiliDog Pictures}. The
Cincinnati-based video production company used several cameras, a
microphone and a soundboard to record the couple's vows and first dance.
Ms. Noble and Mr. Gregory, both actors who live in Astoria, Queens, said
the event, which was filmed at a catering hall owned by the bride's
family had exceeded their expectations.

``When you think of a Zoom wedding, you just think of a couple standing
in front of a computer, but ours was a big production,'' Mr. Gregory
said. ``And because we're actors, we got some gentle ribbing from our
friends saying, `Of course your wedding would look like a TV special.'''

Livestreaming weddings gained popularity in March when the coronavirus
pandemic forced millions of Americans to stay inside their homes. And
although some states are now loosening their shelter-in-place
restrictions, many couples are still broadcasting their ceremonies
online.

If you're planning to share your wedding via livestream, here a few
tools to help make it look like it was shot by a professional.

Camcorders}}

If you want to capture multiple angles, you'll need to have several
cameras. Glenn Hartong, the owner of
\href{https://www.chilidogpictures.com/}{ChiliDog Pictures}, recommends
getting camcorders, like this Canon model, that have long zoom lenses
and the capability to livestream footage using an encoder. ``A good
close-up of the bride is key,'' Mr. Hartong said. ``The bride is the
star of the show.''

The caveat: The
\href{https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/camcorders/professional/xf305}{XF305
costs \$5,000}. So you're better off renting them from a professional
camera gear rental company.

This product synchronizes with up to four cameras, allowing footage to
be cut together live. With a built-in livestream encoder, the machine
can stream directly to Facebook, YouTube, or another streaming platform,
so there's no need for a computer. You can also use it to add graphics,
dynamic transitions and other effects. ``It's the only device I know of
that combines all this functionality in one,'' said Paul Selker, the
president of \href{https://sparkstreetdigital.com/}{Spark Street
Digital}, a live webcast production company with offices in Washington,
New York, and San Francisco.

Note: You'll need someone to operate the switcher during your wedding.

Compact Light 51-Inch Tripod}}

Determined to stick to your smartphone's camera? To film steady footage,
Mr. Selker suggests mounting your phone to this reasonably priced,
compact tripod. Just make sure the camera is positioned at eye level, so
that guests can have a clear view of your faces.

To take production up a notch, Mr. Selker recommends this LED lighting
panel. Because it's bicolor, you can adjust the color temperature to
match the lighting in your space. ``Two would be best, and you will need
stands for them,'' he said.

Clip-on Lavalier Lapel Microphone}}

You'll need a microphone to achieve excellent sound quality. A lavalier
microphone, or a mic that attaches to a lapel, works well for weddings,
Mr. Selker said, ``because the couple generally stands close enough
together that even a single lavalier, worn by one person, can capture
sound from both.'' This one connects directly to your computer, so
depending on where your computer will be, you may need a USB extension
cable, he said.

Pro tip: ``It's best to clip the mic on the taller person, because then
the shorter person will be closer to the mic even though they're not
wearing it,'' Mr. Selker said.

Studio Green Screen Kit}}

When Mig Pascual, 44, and Jessica Lopez, 41, livestreamed their wedding
from their apartment in Jackson Heights, Queens, on May 23 the couple
purchased a green screen to create the illusion of different settings
for their nuptials exchange (the New York City skyline), first dance (a
dark room with a spotlight on them), and cake cutting (a banquet hall).
``It made it feel real, as if our guests were at our wedding,'' said Mr.
Pascual, a digital marketing professional.

You can create your own effects by using this green screen, which comes
with lightweight support system for easy hanging.

Mr. Hartong set up a smart TV at the wedding of Ms. Noble and Mr.
Gregory so that the couple could see their family's reactions during
their more intimate moments, like the exchanging of rings. ``That was
the most special part for me, just being able to turn and see my
siblings and my parents on the Zoom,'' said Mr. Gregory, whose family
lives in Alaska and attended the ceremony remotely.

This affordable and lightweight LG TV monitor is easy to transport, and
it measures more than double most standard laptop screens, allowing for
a more immersive experience.
