*I relocated to a new state for a job this past December. In March, my
workplace closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, and I’ve been
working from home since. We’re now preparing to go back to work, and my
employers are requiring every person coming to the office to sign a
daily affidavit affirming that they don’t have any Covid-19 symptoms.
Anyone refusing to sign will be barred from the office and forced to use
paid time off or potentially lose a day’s wages. Requiring me to sign
this statement feels like an invasion of my privacy — they’ve never
required anyone to sign such an affidavit during a flu outbreak. Is it
ethical for a business to ask employees to sign something like this? I
should also note that my state hasn’t met the benchmarks for reopening
set by the White House. Is it ethical for my employer to require us to
come back to work in the first place?* J. T.

**In ethics, there** are many different notions of privacy. Two are
relevant here. First, there’s informational privacy, which concerns what
others don’t have a right to know about. In this respect, your
(consensual) behavior in the bedroom and in the voting booth are
private, though you have a right to reveal them if you choose, at least
to people who are willing to listen. Informational privacy can also
impose restrictions on you: There are things you ought not to reveal,
like personal confidences, professionally privileged communications or
state and business secrets. They are not other people’s business, and
putting extraordinary circumstances aside, you don’t have the right to
make them other people’s business.

Second, there’s an arena that’s private in the sense that authorities —
your boss, the government — have no right to decide them for you. The
issue here isn’t what others can expect to know but what they can
legitimately require you to do. We could call this autonomy privacy: It
has to do with what areas of your life should be under your own control.
It’s an aspect of liberty.

Does requiring people with the symptoms of a potentially fatal
communicable disease to stay away from work violate informational
privacy? It does not. For one thing, given the policy, your presence in
the office is already an implicit assertion that you are symptom-free.
What’s more, the point of the affidavit isn’t to gather information at
all; it’s to get you to take your undertaking seriously and, perhaps, to
have some legal leverage if you don’t.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nor does the policy violate a proper understanding of autonomy privacy.
You are not entitled to go to work when doing so puts others at
significant risk. Indeed, your bosses have not just the right but the
duty to demand that you don’t. And they can do what is reasonably
required to make sure you
comply.

You contrast what’s being asked of you because of the coronavirus with
the lack of similar demands in flu season. There are, of course, many
pertinent differences. We have vaccines for the influenza strains we
face, but we have none for this coronavirus, and many fewer serious
illnesses and deaths occur in a typical flu season. Still, one lesson of
the current pandemic may be that we should consider having clearer
guidelines for employees with flu symptoms and should consider too what
hand-hygiene and mask-wearing policies might continue to make sense
during the regular flu season. Even when Covid-19 is behind us, we may
not want to discard our pandemic practices
entirely.

The real trouble with your office’s policy is that it appears to be
badly designed to achieve its effect. It can penalize people who
responsibly stay home to protect others. A better policy would allow
such employees extra paid time off in addition to the regular allocation
of vacation days and medical leave. The C.D.C. recommends isolation for
those with symptoms, until they’ve had no fever for 24 hours, their
symptoms have improved and at least 10 days have elapsed since the
symptoms appeared. Effectively punishing compliance with such
recommendations by withholding pay gives people a reason to disobey the
strictures they’re trying to enforce, and so endanger their colleagues.

As for whether you can rightly be asked to go back to the office, much
depends on the details. If your state or municipality hasn’t yet met the
benchmarks for reopening, then your employer shouldn’t require you to
change course. Even when those benchmarks are met, it’s important that
your office requires masks and practices social distancing, encourages
regular hand washing, pays to have spaces appropriately cleaned and has
thought about making sure that the airflow through the space is managed
in a way that minimizes your exposure to droplets and aerosols.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bear in mind that people infected with the coronavirus appear to be most
contagious shortly before the onset of symptoms. (Those who never become
symptomatic may also be able to spread infection.) Your company should,
accordingly, remind employees that they ought to follow the recommended
practices all the time, not just at work. No privacy concerns are raised
by an affidavit that requires them to attest to this
too.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

*My friend works at a government agency. A portion of the staff there is
required to go out into the field to do their work, which puts them at
risk of coronavirus exposure. My friend’s job at the agency can be
performed entirely remotely. As the agency plans for reopening, senior
management is contemplating a requirement that all employees work at
least one day in the office (there will be an exception for those who
must care for dependents at home). This requirement, the managers said,
would promote equity among agency workers and across departments. If
front-line staff are risking exposure to the coronavirus in the field,
they say, non-front-line staff should share a similar burden. Is this
requirement ethical? Does it matter if the policy is applied to all
staff, or only to managers and other senior employees? Are there other
ways to address equity issues related to different levels of coronavirus
risk among workers at the agency?* Name Withheld

**The rationale you’ve** described is profoundly misguided. It’s
necessary for the work of the armed forces that certain troops sometimes
be put in harm’s way. What would we think of a policy that required all
service members to play a version of Russian roulette during wartime, in
order to maintain risk equity? Historically speaking, there have been
times, in battle, when commanders exposed themselves to risk in order to
rally the troops. Doing so had a rational purpose. But exposing every
service member to mortal risk out of a desire for fairness would rightly
be regarded as bizarre.

Those who must face health risks should, of course, be protected to the
greatest extent possible, and they should be honored for their work.
There is also a case, in a society like ours, for recognizing their
sacrifice with extra pay. But increasing the overall disease burden of
the staff honors no one.

*I live with my daughter and her two teenage sons. I am very close to
the 15-year-old, who confides in me even more than his mother does. The
other day he told me that he is given rides to various places by a
16-year-old friend who does not have his parents’ permission to have any
friends in his car. He told me this in confidence. I responded that I
would not tell his mother but that I felt uncomfortable with that
information. If I told her, I can’t imagine he would ever trust me
again, but if I don’t tell her, am I being irresponsible? If the
unimaginable happened and a car accident ensued, how could I live with

**Putting Covid-19 issues** aside, your grandson is in danger not
because his friend doesn’t have his parents’ permission but because the
driver is 16. But your grandson is also abetting his friend in deceiving
and disobeying his parents about something serious. I’d tell him that he
shouldn’t be accepting these rides and that you’re keeping his
confidence on the assumption that he’ll stop.
