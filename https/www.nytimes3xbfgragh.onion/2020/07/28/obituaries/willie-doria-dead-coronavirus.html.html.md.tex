\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Willie Doria picked up a baseball bat and came to the plate at a 1989
reunion game for the Spanish American Baseball League in San Antonio.
When the pitcher, who had good speed, sent a fastball down the middle,
Mr. Doria knocked it straight out of Sanchez-Spencer Memorial Park.

He was 65 years old.

``A true home run hitter,'' Joe Sanchez, a longtime friend, said.

Mr. Doria joined the league in 1946. He played for several teams over a
decade and brought home the championship four years in a row. The
amateur circuit, which existed in some form from 1926 to 2005, was a
cornerstone of San Antonio
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/sports/baseball/minor-leagues-coronavirus-fargo.html}{baseball}
and an important home for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/07/sports/baseball/eduardo-nunez-putting-accent-on-spanish-names.html}{Hispanic
ballplayers.}

Mr. Doria died on July 8 in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html}{San
Antonio}, after contracting the novel coronavirus, his granddaughter
Cheyenne Doria said. He was 96.

William Martinez Doria Jr. was born in San Antonio on April 1, 1924, to
William Doria, a laborer, and Susie Martinez Doria, a homemaker. He
enlisted in the Navy in 1942, served as an aircraft mechanic on the
aircraft carrier Saratoga in World War II, and was discharged at the
war's end. While he was playing in the Spanish American League, he
worked at a wholesale produce firm.

In 1957 he enlisted in the Air Force, where he worked for four years on
a secret surveillance aircraft in various parts of the country, his
family said (he rarely talked about the job). He then returned to San
Antonio, where he worked for another 20 years at Kelly Air Force Base,
now called Kelly Field, as a mechanic in flight operations.

``The Air Force, baseball and his family were his passions,'' another
granddaughter, April Martinez, said. ``He would light up even just
watching his great-grandchildren.''

In retirement, Mr. Doria returned to his baseball roots: He worked for
26 years as an usher at Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium, home of the
minor league San Antonio Missions m. He branched out into basketball,
working as an usher for the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/sports/basketball/nba-bubble-practice.html}{San
Antonio Spurs} of the N.B.A., first at the Alamodome and then at the
AT\&T Center.

At Missions games, he was a friendly fixture for the players and
coaches, their families and fans. Until the coronavirus pandemic
shuttered sports, he could be found at his usual perch, a seat by the
entrance to the dugout on the third-base side.

His two grandchildren, Ms. Martinez and Ms. Doria, who grew up in the
house with their grandparents, went with their grandfather to Missions
games, where they could run freely around the stadium and meet the
players and their families.

``He ruled that place, to be honest,'' Ms. Doria said.

Along with Ms. Doria and Ms. Martinez, he is survived by three children,
Andrew, Samuel and Catherine Doria; a brother, Vic; a sister, Consuelo
Doria Rocha; and two great-grandchildren. His wife, Mary, died in 2002.

Mr. Doria always attended the reunion games of the Spanish American
league, as long as his buddy Mr. Sanchez was there.

``He was so magnetic,'' said Mr. Sanchez, the son of Sandy Sanchez, Mr.
Doria's first coach and namesake of Sanchez-Spencer Memorial Park. He
would talk to patrons about anything, Mr. Sanchez said, ``but almost
always baseball. He loved baseball.''
