# Why Trump Canceled the Convention

</div>

Readers react to the change of plan. One says the president’s ego was
the motivation, not safety concerns. Also: Baseball’s mistake; hope and
despair; a tribute to Brooks Brothers.

Re “[Trump Cancels Party Conclave in
Jacksonville](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/politics/jacksonville-rnc.html)”
(front page, July 24):

Even on those infrequent occasions when President Trump actually does
the right thing — in this case, canceling the Republican convention in
Jacksonville, Fla. — he is pathologically incapable of being anything
other than disingenuous about it.

Although he laughably claims to be doing this to keep America safe, it
is painfully obvious that his true agenda is to avoid the humiliation of
sparse attendance at what he had hoped would be his coronation
spectacle.

Michael Silk

**To the Editor:**

If it will not be safe for the Republican faithful to attend the party’s
convention in late August, how can President Trump continue to claim
that it will be safe for parents to send their children back to school?

(front page, July 28):

Many Miami Marlins players and coaches have tested positive for Covid-19
— now up to 17 as of this writing. Allowing the Major League Baseball
season to be played in the middle of a deadly pandemic is the worst
decision the league has made since allowing [Roseanne Barr to sing the

Re “[Feeling Hopeless? Embrace
It](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/opinion/hopeless-covid-climate.html),”
by Eric Utne (Op-Ed, July 25):

Wow\! What a scenario\! Nothing left to do but eat, drink and be merry —
for tomorrow, we die.

Wake up\! Look around you. Read history. This president and his allies
are responsible for the social instability, the mismanaged pandemic, the
very hard economic times, the police brutality, federal forces in
Portland, Ore. — all calculated to divide the Democratic Party as the
election comes closer.

The president has warned that he would use executive powers we have not
yet imagined to invalidate an unfavorable election return and,
effectively, refuse to leave the White House.

I would recommend that Mr. Utne and his baby boomer followers suspend
for a moment their blissful dreams of utopia, register to vote and work
on behalf of the Democratic Party for the next 90 days.

Our united goal must be to defeat Donald Trump in November. A second
term would be worse than we all might imagine. This is not the time for
the baby boomers of America to drop out and turn off. There is too much
at stake.

Robert S. April  
New York

**To the Editor:**

Thank you, Eric Utne, for giving voice to such courageous and useful
thoughts. Your words allowed me to see that hope is by definition
directed toward a different future.

I am more or less your age, and my political trajectory is similar to
yours. So I have recently felt the need to redefine the value of my life
away from reaching a future goal, and basing it instead on making each
day as filled as possible with creative energy.

Re “[A Clothier Woven Into the American Fabric
Frays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/style/brooks-brothers-bankruptcy-lisa-birnbach-preppy-handbook.html),”
by Lisa Birnbach (Styles, July 23), lamenting the Brooks Brothers
bankruptcy:

I remember buying my first [Brooks
Brothers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/business/brooks-brothers-factory-closings.html)suit
when I started working in a corporate law firm while I was in law
school. I remember the wooden floors and the austere atmosphere. I was
always a good dresser, even winning best dressed in high school. The
preppy look was de rigueur when I attended Cornell University, so I
blended in right away with a wardrobe influenced by Brooks Brothers.

It is sad to see an institution in trouble, but thanks to Ralph Lauren
and other designers the all-American clean-cut look will continue. You
can always order from the overseas branches of Brooks Brothers, but the
store at 346 Madison Avenue is a shrine. Now when I wear a rep tie with
a button-down shirt and blue suit, I will do my part to keep the
tradition alive.

The outfit worked when I went to my admission interview for college and
when I was hired at the Salomon Brothers investment bank. It always
makes sense to dress for success. Don’t forget the pocket squares.
