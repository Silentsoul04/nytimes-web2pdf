Three government space agencies around the world are getting ready to
return to Mars this summer. Along with
[China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/science/china-mars-mission.html)
and the [United Arab
Emirates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/science/mars-united-arab-emirates.html),
the United States plans to land [the fifth NASA rover,
Perseverance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/mars-perseverance-tianwen-hope.html),
on the red planet (along with [a small, experimental helicopter,
Ingenuity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/science/mars-helicopter-nasa.html)).
But the rover’s most important job will be [scooping up and caching some
samples](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/science/mars-sample-return-mission.html)
that humans or robots may eventually retrieve.

The planetary science community will cheer these missions. But many
researchers have started asking, more loudly than usual, why we’re going
back to Mars yet again. So we invited Rebecca Boyle and David W. Brown,
two journalists who have devoted a fair share of their careers to
interviewing space researchers at NASA and in academia, to discuss why
Mars, [a planet that lost its atmosphere long
ago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/science/mars-life-water.html),
seems to absorb so much of the oxygen — and budgetary resources — in the
rooms where [explorations of our solar
system](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/exploring-the-solar-system.html)
are decided.

**Rebecca Boyle:** So we’re going back to Mars. Again, with another
rover. Two, perhaps, if both NASA and China’s space agency succeed.

Sigh.

It’s not that this is disappointing. But there’s a certain level of déjà
vu with NASA’s Perseverance mission, modeled so closely after the
successful Curiosity rover in 2011. I have
[written](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lost-opportunity-after-a-15-year-odyssey-nasas-trailblazing-mars-rover-approaches-its-end/)
a lot about the value of [exploring
Mars](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-about-mars-is-the-worst/)
and the particularly Earthlike qualities that [endear it to
us](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/mars-is-the-best-planet/512654/).
But even I can’t help but wonder what’s next in [our quest to explore
the solar
system](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/exploring-the-solar-system.html),
and whether so many journeys to Mars are blocking other important
science.

## Meet the 3 Spacecraft Heading to Mars This Summer

Three missions are headed to Mars this summer. They carry a wide array
of instruments to explore the red planet.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**David W. Brown:** There’s an entire solar system waiting to be
explored. Since 2001, NASA has flown eight consecutive successful
missions to Mars, including five landers. Humanity now has a library of
Mars data sitting on servers that no one has had a chance to study. Data
collected from brief encounters by spacecraft with [the moons of
Jupiter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/14/science/europa-plumes-water.html),
on the other hand, or [the ice giants, Uranus and
Neptune](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/20/science/neptune-moon-hippocamp.html),
have been [squeezed
dry.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/science/uranus-bubble-voyager.html)

**R.B.:** And that has made the story of Mars exploration a
self-fulfilling one. The robots we’ve sent to Mars have been, on
balance, exceptionally successful, and have told us about [vast waters
in Mars’ distant
memory](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/science/mars-life-water.html),
including floodplains where life might have burbled to the surface. They
have told us about Martian ice caps, carbon dioxide snow, inner geology,
tenuous atmosphere and wind-eroded surface.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Every discovery about Mars brings new questions, which cultivates a
healthy ecosystem of Mars researchers. Some of those researchers wind up
at academic institutions, where they have funding for graduate students
and postdoctoral researchers who continue asking more Mars questions.
And so the search continues.

But the past few years have seen an
[increasingly](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01730-5)
[loud](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/venus-can-wait-jilted-scientists-face-years-without-nasa-return-earth-s-neighbor)
[chorus](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/venus-lost-generation/513479/)
calling for NASA to turn its sights elsewhere. [Maybe
Venus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/09/science/venus-volcanoes-active.html),
maybe [Saturn’s moon
Titan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/science/saturn-titan-moon.html),
maybe [the distant, faceless turquoise orb of
Uranus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/science/uranus-bubble-voyager.html)
— just not Mars, anywhere but Mars, where we’ve been [driving wheeled
robots for nearly two
decades](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/13/science/mars-opportunity-rover-dead.html).

**D.W.B.:** For many years, Mars was treated by NASA almost as its own
space program with its own mission lines and priorities. Every two
years, something ** would launch there.

But then in 2010, in part because of budget cuts, the Mars program was
integrated into NASA’s overall planetary exploration portfolio. Suddenly
other worlds were being annihilated by a crimson Death Star.

The Curiosity rover went over budget by almost a billion dollars, eating
into other projects. Perseverance went wildly over budget as well, and
if the pattern holds, the [eventual mission to collect the samples
gathered by the
rover](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/science/mars-sample-return-mission.html)
would do the same.

While much remains uncertain about the particulars of the sample return
sequence — will the next be a joint mission with the Europeans, for
example, or will it be NASA astronauts going it alone, or will we pay
SpaceX to do it — it was deemed by the planetary science community to be
a multi-billion-dollar “flagship” mission of the highest priority.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That decision killed off a spacecraft that would have orbited Europa,
Jupiter’s ocean moon. (A less expensive design, Europa Clipper, is to
launch this decade.) While the shock was still fresh, NASA selected [the
Mars InSight
lander](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/05/01/science/mars-nasa-insight-ar-3d-ul.html)
over a well-regarded mission in its less expensive Discovery class that
would have landed a boat on Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, to sail its
seas of liquid
methane.

## Exploring the Solar System

A guide to the spacecraft beyond Earth’s orbit.

**R.B.**: Rest in peace, Titan Mare Explorer. Meanwhile, as planetary
scientists debated how to pay for their missions, some geologists
salivate for a second look at Venus, the second planet from the sun.

Venus is about the same size as Earth, it’s rocky, it has an atmosphere.
And, it orbits the sun in a zone where temperatures are just right for
liquid water — and maybe life.

“I got my Ph.D. on Mars volcanoes. I am on three Mars proposals. It’s
not like I don’t value Mars — it’s an amazing world,” said Paul Byrne, a
planetary scientist at North Carolina State University. “But it’s not
the only amazing world.”

He told me he is free to study Venus’s clouds and atmosphere because he
has a faculty position that covers most of his salary and commitments.
That’s not the case for many other scientists, who rely on grants and
federally funded planetary exploration programs to gather their data.

Even in other countries, Venus doesn’t get the attention that other
worlds do. Dr. Byrne told me he attended a meeting in Moscow in October
focused on future Venus missions, including a beefed-up, modern version
of the Soviet Venera lander, so far the only spacecraft that has
survived on the Venusian surface (the last one, Venera 12, lasted 110
minutes). Only two Russian geologists turned up to the meeting.

“There isn’t a tradition among young Russian scientists to do Venus,
same as here,” he said. “There hasn’t been much of an effective selling
of Venus. It’s being subsumed by Mars. And people who were funded for
Venus have, with very few exceptions, gone away” to retirement or other
projects, he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We know Mars had water at some point in its past, but it’s long gone. By
contrast, Venus might have had oceans more recently and for longer
periods, and may have been comfortably livable for billions of years.

“Why are we not putting a fleet there?” Mr. Byrne said.

Why, indeed?

**D.W.B.**: Airships sniffing around the upper atmosphere of Venus are
overdue. Certainly since the retirement of the space shuttle, nothing in
the NASA portfolio, save [the recent SpaceX launch to the International
Space
Station](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/30/science/spacex-nasa-astronauts.html),
has generated the excitement of the planetary science program.

The [New Horizons flyby of
Pluto](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/03/17/science/pluto-images-charon-moons-new-horizons-flyby.html),
the [Cassini mission to
Saturn](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/14/science/cassini-saturn-images.html),
[Juno’s stunning images of a Jupiter dipped in
blue](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/07/science/jupiter-photos-hubble-telescope-juno-nasa.html)
— to the extent that people talk about NASA “moments,” they’re likely
talking about planetary science.

The exception is perhaps [the Hubble Space
Telescope](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/science/hubble-telescope-30th-birthday.html),
which delivers so many stunning images that it’s become a kind of
ever-present technicolor cultural static. We don’t even notice it
anymore, which is a testament to its
success.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**R.B.**: I think this also applies to images from Mars, in a certain
sense. We’ve been receiving them in living color since the late 1990s,
and they’ve become a kind of static too. Curiosity has a high-resolution
camera, and people were captivated by its incredible images after it
landed in August 2012, yet barely notice anymore.

I used to check its downloads occasionally, using a program called
[Midnight Planets](http://www.midnightplanets.com/index.html), built by
Michael Howard, an app developer. He would download raw images as they
were transmitted via the Deep Space Network’s antennas. It was great fun
to see what the rovers were seeing, in almost real-time. But Mr. Howard
stopped updating his site almost a year ago, noting that “I have moved
on to other projects in life.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I only found this out because I just checked it for the first time in
more than a year. What a statement, right? We can’t get excited about
nightly image dumps from Mars. FROM MARS.

Curiosity was the first Mars mission to land in the era of social media,
and people around the world watched on Twitter and live on TV in Times
Square. That was electrifying. But the attention has faded.

Is it because Mars looks so familiar? For now, we’ll have to be content
with wondering what the public response would be to something like a
boat on Titan.

**D.W.B.**: At least there’s a [Titan
quadcopter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/science/nasa-titan-dragonfly-caesar.html)
in the works. The problem for the rest of the solar system is that the S
in NASA doesn’t stand for “science.” The agency is first and foremost a
human spaceflight organization. That’s where its real money goes, and
robotic Mars missions are the natural beneficiaries. Astronauts can’t
get to Europa with current technologies, and can’t land on Venus. But
humans in spacesuits can survive on Mars, which means every robotic Mars
mission is more than abstruse geology or aeolian physics. No, every Mars
mission is a human precursor mission. Every dollar spent on Mars rovers
reduces the inherent risk of future astronaut adventures.

Culturally, Mars is deeply important to NASA, and has been since its
infancy. A humans-to-Mars program, conceived before Apollo, was the
lunar program’s natural successor. To become multi-planetary, NASA
identified the need for reusable space shuttles, a space station,
rockets at least as powerful as the Saturn V and other space-based
infrastructure. Though the glory days of Apollo funding died, the
fundamental elements of Mars exploration did not: All of those things
were built, though across a much longer timeline.

**R.B.**: The other reason is private industry. It’s relatively easy to
fling something at Mars; every 26 months, the planet is on the same side
of the sun as Earth is, so the journey only takes half a year.

On roughly the same timeline, SpaceX C.E.O. [Elon Musk makes a bold and
vague announcement about his plans to launch cruise ships to
Mars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/29/science/elon-musk-spacex-starship.html),
carrying people who might live there forever. A few years ago, a Dutch
start-up named Mars One even tried launching a reality-show-based
settlement program, [before going
bankrupt](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220153/mars-one-bankruptcy-bas-lansdorp-human-settlement).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though Mars is horrendous, it’s the least-inhospitable place to go,
except for maybe the moon. It seems attainable. Bootprints on the red
regolith seems feasible. So that’s why, in the generations since Apollo,
we keep seeing rover tracks in the red regolith, time and again.

**D.W.B.**: In some ways, the Perseverance rover confirms the harshest
criticisms of the Mars program. It was sold as a relatively inexpensive
$1.5 billion dollar reflight of the Curiosity rover and lander, built
using spare parts and with a different payload of science instruments.

In the end, Perseverance went over budget by more than $500 million —
[and they added a
helicopter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/science/mars-helicopter-nasa.html)[**](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/science/mars-helicopter-nasa.html)[to
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/science/mars-helicopter-nasa.html)\!

Almost everything got an upgrade. The rover isn’t the same size — the
wheels, chassis, camera — all new. Not even the spare heat shield was
used. This ambitious refit could have paid for an entire Discovery-class
mission, and has caused discomfort to other large missions in the NASA
portfolio.

But Russia’s experience with Venus explains a big part of NASA’s need to
push the envelope of Mars engineering. To cease building Mars landers —
to stop daring mighty things like helicopters — is to lose the
institutional knowledge necessary to do the Red Planet successfully. The
U.S. has been launching humans to space since 1961, but [once we
stopped, it took almost a decade to figure out how to do it
again](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/science/spacex-launch-nasa.html).

**R.B.**: The confusion and frustration surrounding the Mars program is
a manifestation of NASA’s core existential struggle. As you pointed out,
it’s always been an astronaut agency, with human exploration in its DNA.
But when presidential administrations change exploration objectives
every four to eight years, it’s harder to plan for the long term. NASA
needs a place to go, and Mars has been the obvious next step since the
moon.

But the agency and country should probably be asking: What is the actual
future we want? What’s the endgame? Is it a returned chunk of rock that
could tell us more about Mars’ early history? Or maybe we get extremely
lucky and bring back a rock that has evidence of fossil bacteria? Or is
it just about adding layers, like Martian sedimentary rock, of evidence
that Mars is interesting enough for humans to risk walking there one
day?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**D.W.B.**: “Long term” is the strength of Mars exploration overall, and
the great mystery of this mission. No one knows when [the samples
bottled up by Perseverance will be brought back to
Earth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/science/mars-sample-return-mission.html).
They might collect red dust for fifteen years before another robot
snatches them up and rockets them here for study. The possibility of
life on Mars, extant or extinct, has been raised and dashed and rendered
inconclusive going back to the Viking landers in 1976 through
[Curiosity’s methane detection
in 2019](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/20/science/mars-oxygen-methane-curiosity-rover.html).

Maybe the samples will answer that question, or maybe, as Dr. Tim McCoy,
the curator of the meteorite collection at the Smithsonian Institution,
tells me, the samples now being targeted by NASA might ultimately not be
too scientifically useful.

“How do you know that those are going to address the pressing questions
that are going to exist 15 or 20 years from now?” he asked, explaining
that the planetary science community may have moved on to a completely
different set of questions by the time Mars dirt reaches labs on Earth.

**R.B.**: When Perseverance starts exploring Mars, I hope it squirrels
away the most interesting rock in the solar system. But while we wait to
find out, there are so many other places we haven’t even been.

[As a moon partisan, I would like to go back
there](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/10/science/moon-facts.html)
and pick up samples from [one of the solar system’s biggest craters, the
South Pole-Aitken
Basin.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/science/china-moon-far-side.html)
I would love to see airships forming a Venusian cloud city. And I
really, really want that Titan boat.

**D.W.B.**: Venus is overdue for a flagship mission. The Earthlike
conditions above its clouds make the discovery of life there not a
matter of if, but when.

The ice giants also need to be explored, and inventive missions like
[the Trident spacecraft to Triton, Neptune’s
moon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/19/science/triton-neptune-nasa-trident.html),
prove that it can be done on relatively small budgets.

For now, I love that landing a nuclear-powered car on Mars is somehow
boring. In the 1980s, funding woes left the planetary science community
fighting for survival. Today, we live in a golden age of space
exploration.
