WASHINGTON — With the economic and public health toll of the
[coronavirus pandemic continuing to mount across the
country](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
members of Congress are debating another round of federal relief for
individuals and businesses.

But it remains unclear how Democrats and Republicans will reconcile
their vastly different proposals. They are staring down a tight
deadline, with tens of millions of Americans slated to [lose their
enhanced jobless
aid](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html)
this week.

Senate Republicans and administration officials on Monday unveiled a $1
trillion proposal, narrowly tailored to Republican priorities. It
includes slashing by two-thirds the $600-per-week unemployment payments
that workers have received since April and providing tax cuts and
liability protections for businesses.

House Democrats in May approved a [$3 trillion relief
package](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr6800/BILLS-116hr6800ih.pdf)
that amounts to their opening offer: a sweeping measure that contains a
number of Democratic priorities, including an extension of the jobless
aid, nearly $200 billion for rental assistance and mortgage relief, $3.6
billion to bolster election security and additional aid for food
assistance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has said that she plans to fight for
even more funding, particularly for schools, in negotiations with
Republicans. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader,
has warned against letting the price tag rise beyond $1 trillion,
particularly as many Republicans question the merits of approving any
additional
aid.

While administration officials have floated the prospect of speeding
through a short-term, narrow measure to address the looming expiration
of unemployment benefits, liability protections and funding for schools,
Democrats have panned that suggestion in favor of a comprehensive
package.

Here are some of the main points of contrast that are likely to emerge
as sticking
points.

-----

## Democrats want to extend $600 weekly jobless payments, while Republicans want to slash them.

The $2.2 trillion stimulus law added a $600-per-week supplement for
those on unemployment insurance, but conservatives have argued that it
discourages people from returning to work in certain states, because it
exceeds their normal wages. The House bill would extend the full benefit
through January, while the [Senate
measure](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/politics/senate-police-bill.html)
would severely curtail it, scaling it back to $200 per week. The lump
sum would eventually be replaced with a newly calculated benefit that,
when combined with state benefits, would be [capped at 70 percent of a
worker’s prior
income](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits.html).

## Republicans want liability shields for businesses, while Democrats are pressing for protections for workers.

House Democrats are again pushing for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration to establish an enforceable standard, based on guidance
from top federal health agencies, for workplaces to develop
infection-control plans. The House bill would also prevent employers
from retaliating against any employee who reports workplace violations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the Senate, Mr. McConnell has repeatedly said that he views
strengthening liability protections for businesses, schools and
hospitals that remain open during the pandemic as a prerequisite for any
aid bill. The Republican proposal would establish a liability shield for
businesses, schools and hospitals from facing claims over episodes
related to the
coronavirus.

## Democrats would allocate $1 trillion for state and local governments. Republicans left them out entirely.

Funding for state, local and tribal governments is the centerpiece of
the legislation House Democrats approved in May. Democrats argue that
governments will need another major infusion of relief to keep essential
workers on payrolls and make up for the loss of revenue after decreased
tourism and spending during the pandemic.

The bill unveiled by Senate Republicans does not have any aid
specifically set aside for state, local and tribal governments, though
it grants more flexibility for how states spent previously allocated
funds. Several conservative lawmakers note that some of the money
allocated in the March stimulus law has not yet been spent. Others have
warned against states using the coronavirus relief to make up for
pre-existing debt and
expenses.

## Both proposals would provide for another round of direct payments to American families.

Both proposals would again allocate another round of $1,200 direct
payments to American families, duplicating a provision in the stimulus
law enacted in March that would phase out the amount of money for
individual incomes above
$75,000.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

But the Democratic proposal would allow undocumented immigrants to
receive money, undoing language that prohibited payments to anyone who
filed taxes jointly with someone who used an Individual Taxpayer
Identification Number, a common substitute for a Social Security number.
That number is used mostly by immigrants without legal status.

Democrats would also increase the amount of money per child to $1,200
for up to three children per family. The Republican proposal would
maintain the $500 amount set in the first stimulus, but also allow adult
dependents to
qualify.

## The Republican proposal would condition some school funding on reopening, while Democrats would not.

Because the Democratic measure was approved in May, before schools were
contemplating [how to begin another academic year
safely](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/health/coronavirus-schools-reopen.html)
with the virus still surging across the country, Ms. Pelosi has said she

education.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Republican bill would allocate $105 billion for states to put toward
schools. Of that money, $5 billion would be set aside for governors to
use at their discretion, and $30 billion would be set aside for colleges
and universities. The remaining $70 billion would go to elementary and
secondary schools, with two-thirds of the relief designated for schools
