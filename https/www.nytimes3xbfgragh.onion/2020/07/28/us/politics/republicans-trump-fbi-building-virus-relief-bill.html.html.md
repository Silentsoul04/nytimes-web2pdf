WASHINGTON — Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader,
[looked
startled](https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1288150687109599232?s=20)
on Monday when first asked why Republicans had agreed to a White House
demand that $1.75 billion for a new F.B.I. building be tucked into their
emergency coronavirus relief bill.

Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, framed the item as a Trump administration priority, not a
Republican one. Other Republicans were more blunt.

“I don’t know — that makes no sense to me” said Senator Lindsey Graham
of South Carolina, a close ally of President Trump’s. “I’d be fine, OK,
with stripping it out.”

By Tuesday afternoon, another chapter in Mr. Trump’s [long, strange and,
to his critics, ethically
questionable](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/02/us/politics/fbi-building-costs.html)
odyssey to personally shape the future of the J. Edgar Hoover Building
seemed headed to a close as Republicans distanced themselves from key
elements of their own coronavirus relief bill.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Senate leaders went so far as to say they hoped the administration’s bid
to fund the construction of a new F.B.I. building would ultimately be
discarded from a final agreement, with Mr. McConnell backing away from
the idea, calling that provision, along with some others proposed by
Democrats, “non-germane.”

It was the latest evidence of the disarray around attempts by
Republicans to come to a common position as they enter talks with
Democrats on another round of federal aid to deal with the economic
devastation of the pandemic.

And it highlighted how the White House and Republicans have injected
unrelated priorities dear to Mr. Trump into a negotiation that was
already going to be complicated and intense. Republicans are also
pressing to use the package to provide more than $1 billion for the
Pentagon to restore projects that Mr. Trump defunded to help pay for his
wall along the southern border.

Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin continued negotiations with Democrats led by Speaker
Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, seeking agreement on a package that can pass
both the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled
House and win Mr. Trump’s signature. One key component of the earlier
relief package, expanded unemployment benefits, is scheduled to expire
at the end of the week, adding to the urgency of the talks.

With so much at stake, Mr. Trump’s own party seemed to draw a line at
the proposal for the F.B.I. building. Mr. Shelby questioned whether it
was an urgent priority at a time when Americans are struggling to
weather a deadly pandemic and a recession.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s needed,” Mr. Shelby said. “The question is, is it needed now?”

In recent days, Mr. Meadows had pushed the plan to replace the building,
which is crumbling, out of date — and long the subject an unusual
fixation for Mr. Trump, a former real estate
developer.

As far back as 2013, two years before launching his candidacy, Mr. Trump
expressed his interest in the property, located on Pennsylvania Avenue a
block from the location of what would become the Trump International
Hotel. At that time, the F.B.I. building was the subject of a
long-debated plan that would allow the demolition of the existing
structure and clear the way for commercial development of that location,
allowing the chosen developer to construct an F.B.I. facility in the
Washington suburbs.

An executive at his company later expressed concern that the
redevelopment project could create competition for Mr. Trump’s hotel.
After Mr. Trump took office, his administration blocked a plan to move
the building to a suburban campus, then unveiled another that would keep
the building where it is, raising questions about whether he was seeking
to protect his hotel from the possibility of a rival being built on the
site.

His actions triggered an ongoing [inquiry by the Justice Department’s
inspector
general](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/03/us/politics/fbi-headquarters-inspector-general-investigation.html)
and brought scrutiny by Democrats on Capitol Hill.

When asked last week why the provision was holding up negotiations among
Republicans, Mr. Trump told reporters that he wanted to keep the
building close to the Justice Department across the street.

“You can renovate the existing building, but it’s not a good building,”
Mr. Trump said. “Or you could take it down and build a great building
for the F.B.I. for 100 years and have it be incredible.”

A senior administration official familiar with the White House’s
negotiation strategy said on Tuesday that Mr. Meadows and Mr. Mnuchin
were treating the building provision as a potential bargaining chip to
use later in negotiations with Democrats. Senate Republicans want to
hold the package to around $1 trillion, while the Democrats are pushing
a $3 trillion bill that would extend the $600 weekly enhanced jobless
payments through the end of the year, send $1 trillion to struggling
state and local governments, and provide $3.6 billion for election
assistance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is unclear how much leverage such a universally unpopular proposal
would have provided Republicans, who are seeking to counter the
Democratic plan by slashing the extra unemployment payments and have
omitted funding for state and local governments as well as money to help
states carry out the general election amid the pandemic. Both proposals
would send another round of $1,200 direct payments to many Americans.

An official familiar with the negotiations said that Republican
senators, mindful that it had already taken days to reach consensus
among themselves on an opening bid, ultimately stopped resisting the
administration’s insistence on including the F.B.I. provision in order
to move on to what are expected to be much more fraught negotiations
with Democrats, who have been publicly united behind their proposal
since May.

A chorus of Republican lawmakers said they were bemused by the demand
for the F.B.I. building, particularly given the amount of energy that
they had spent hammering Democrats for including items they deemed
unrelated to the coronavirus in their opening offer.

“I just don’t get it — how is it tied to coronavirus?” said Senator Rick
Scott, Republican of Florida. “I never understood why you’re giving
money to the Kennedy Center or National Endowment for the Arts. During a
pandemic, let’s focus on solving the problem.”

Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, was also left bewildered.

“Even if the White House wanted it, I’d be against it because that’s
certainly not necessary,” Mr. Braun told
reporters.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said

For some Republicans, it was just another aspect of a proposal they
regarded as deeply flawed.

“I’m not inclined to support it now — it’s a mess,” said Senator Josh
Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said of his party’s plan. “I can’t
figure out what this bill is about. I don’t know what we’re trying to
accomplish with it.”

Mr. Mnuchin’s negotiation skills [have drawn
skepticism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/us/politics/coronavirus-mnuchin-republicans.html)
from some Republicans, who have fretted privately that he has been too
open to making concessions to Democrats in earlier rounds of pandemic
aid talks. Asked on Tuesday if the money should remain in the
legislation, Mr. Mnuchin told reporters, “We’ll look at everything in
the bill.”

Mr. Meadows, the former congressman from North Carolina and co-founder
of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, is known for just the opposite:
He spent his years in the House opposing large spending deals of the
kind now under discussion, and urging ideological confrontation. In late
2018, he encouraged Mr. Trump to refuse to sign any government spending
bill that didn’t fund the border wall, stoking a stalemate that led to
the most prolonged government shutdown in American history.

“There are a number of things in the last bill that had nothing to do
with the coronavirus,” Mr. Meadows told reporters on Tuesday. “I think
everybody acknowledges that it’s a funding mechanism. And I don’t see it
standing in the way of us getting a deal.”

After meeting with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority
leader, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Mnuchin for a second consecutive day on
Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Pelosi said they were “airing our differences.
There’s discovery of where there might be opportunity or not.”

The White House has again declined to say exactly why the F.B.I.
building is a priority in the middle of coronavirus relief negotiations.

“As President Trump has said, the F.B.I. desperately needs a new
building and this measure provides critical funding for this project
that would keep the building responsibly near the Department of
Justice,” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.

But Democrats have long charged that Mr. Trump intervened to make sure
the site was not redeveloped with a project that would compete with his
company’s luxury hotel across the street.

“It’s outrageous,” said Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. “This
has not been a partisan issue. This is a personal issue for the
president.”

Among the very few people in Washington with nothing public to say on
the matter on Tuesday were officials from the General Services
Administration, which handles real estate for the federal government.
And the F.B.I. shared a statement attributed to an unnamed official, who
said, “the need for a new F.B.I. headquarters facility has not abated.”
