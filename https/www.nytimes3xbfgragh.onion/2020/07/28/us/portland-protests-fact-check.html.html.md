PORTLAND, Ore. — Attorney General [William P.
Barr](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/barr-testimony.html)
forcefully defended the federal response to long-running [protests in
Portland](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/protests-portland-federal-withdrawal.html)
on Tuesday, telling the House Judiciary Committee that the protests had
become violent. The federal intervention has been condemned by state and
city officials, but Mr. Barr argued it was necessary to prevent violence
from spreading to other American cities.

The nightly protests in Portland, which began in late May as a response
to the police killing of George Floyd, have become the backdrop for a
conflict between federal officials and local leaders. Mr. Barr and other
federal officials have drawn attention to vandalism and other reckless
behavior on the part of the protesters, while city officials have said
that federal agents dispatched to the district court in downtown
Portland have exceeded their authority and harmed peaceful protesters.

There are currently 114 federal law enforcement officers in Portland,
according to a legal filing from the U.S. attorney’s office, drawn from
various agencies including Customs and Border Protection and the Federal
Protective Service. Their presence has reinvigorated tensions that had
been subsiding, local officials said. Several peaceful protesters have
been seriously injured, including [a Navy veteran whose
hand](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/us/portland-protests-navy-christopher-david.html)
was smashed by officers and a man who was shot with a projectile that
[fractured his
skull](https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/07/police-shoot-portland-protester-in-head-with-impact-weapon-causing-severe-injuries.html).

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As I’ve said from the beginning, these peaceful protests are being
hijacked by a very hard core of instigators, violent instigators,” Mr.
Barr said. “Police casualties far exceed anything on the civilian side.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Have protesters used violence against federal officers?

The crowds have been [largely
peaceful](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/us/protests-divisions-blm.html)
and have included high school students, military veterans, off-duty
lawyers and lines of mothers who call themselves the “Wall of Moms.”

Mr. Barr acknowledged in response to questions from representatives that
many protesters had remained peaceful. “You have a lot of people who are
out protesting and demonstrating,” he said. “The particular violent
opportunists who are involved here get into these crowds and engage in
very violent activity and hijack it.”

But he emphasized that some protesters have thrown rocks, water bottles
and fireworks at federal officers. Others have shone lasers at federal
agents and at security cameras surrounding the building, in an effort to
block their view of the crowd. Several fires have been set near the
courthouse, which federal officials have said could spread to the
building and harm the agents inside.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This has been amply documented with photographs, videos, and by New York
Times reporters on the ground.

Mr. Barr also claimed that protesters had used Tasers, pellet guns and
slingshots against the federal officers. The Times could not
independently confirm the use of those weapons.

As federal agents moved beyond the courthouse and into the streets of
Portland — which experts have said they may not have [legal
authority](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/portland-federal-legal-jurisdiction-courts.html)
to do — agents have also been involved in scuffles with protesters who
tried to prevent arrests.

## Have any federal officers been injured?

In a July 22 court filing, the U.S. attorney’s office in Oregon said
that 28 federal law enforcement officers had been injured during
protests in Portland.

“The most serious injury to an officer to date occurred when a protester
wielding a two-pound sledgehammer struck an officer in the head and
shoulder when the officer tried to prevent the protester from breaking
down a door to the Hatfield Courthouse,” the filing stated. Other
injuries included “broken bones, hearing damage, eye damage, a
dislocated shoulder, sprains, strains, and contusions.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in daily briefings about the
protests that agents had been burned by fireworks and a “caustic
substance” that were thrown over a fence surrounding the courthouse.

The legal filings and daily reports from the Department of Homeland
Security do not make reference to one of the injuries described by Mr.
Barr: that projectiles fired from pellet guns “have penetrated marshals
to the bone.” On July 23, the White House press secretary Kayleigh
McEnany referenced a similar incident. “Another federal agent was shot
with a pellet gun, leaving a wound deep to the bone,” she said. A
Department of Homeland Security spokesman did not respond to a request
for more information about this injury.

## Has there been violence used against protesters?

Mr. Barr emphasized the injuries sustained by federal officers and said
that they outnumbered those incurred by protesters.

There is not a comprehensive tally of injured protesters, but at least
[five people have filed civil
lawsuits](https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-protesters-lawsuits-police-brutality/)
describing injuries and seeking damages of up to $950,000. Other
injuries, like those sustained by the Navy veteran, have been captured
on video.

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">President Trump’s deployment of
federal agents is fueling the unrest in Portland, where protests have
continued for over 50 consecutive
days.</span>](https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/22/autossell/Portland-Still_01/Portland-Still_01-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v4.jpg)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Groups of nurses and doctors have recently joined the protests, voicing
objections to violence from the federal forces. Jillian Trent, an
emergency room nurse who joined a recent march, said that she had seen
an uptick of patients with injuries caused by rubber bullets and other
police munitions. “People are coming in with their jaws falling off,”
she said.

Under questioning, Mr. Barr said that tear gas and violence were not
appropriate responses to peaceful protesters. In response to a question
about the use of tear gas, he said, “The problem when these things
sometimes occur is, it’s hard to separate people.”

## Were police officers attacked in Seattle?

Outrage over the federal agents’ actions in Portland extended to Seattle
over the weekend, when thousands of protesters took to the streets on
Saturday against police violence and the deployment of federal agents to
Portland.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some protesters lit several construction trailers on fire at a youth
detention center, smashed windows of businesses and, according to the
police, injured Seattle police officers with explosive devices. The
Seattle Police Department [released partial body camera
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-I2OyGD_A) that showed
explosions erupting near officers and [photographs of cuts and
burns](https://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2020/07/26/officer-injuries-precinct-damage-arrest-updates/)
suffered by officers that they said were from explosives set off by the
protesters.

Officers, meanwhile, doused protesters in pepper spray, rushed into
crowds and knocked people to the ground, including some who were trying
to help a woman who had been bloodied by a flash grenade. A [video
posted
online](https://twitter.com/slydesilva/status/1287240894219841536?s=20)
showed officers riding on bicycles into a group of protesters, pushing
them to the ground with their bikes and their hands.

The police said 59 officers had been injured, including one who was
hospitalized. Many of the injured officers were able to return to duty.

Kate Conger reported from Portland, Ore., and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs
from New York.
