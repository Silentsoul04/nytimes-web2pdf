# Minneapolis Police Link ‘Umbrella Man’ to White Supremacy Group

A search warrant affidavit seeks cellphone records for a man the police
believe smashed store windows with a sledgehammer to provoke racial
unrest.

The tall man, dressed head to toe in black, including a black gas mask
and a black umbrella, can be seen in a video wielding a sledgehammer as
he calmly smashed the windows of a Minneapolis auto parts store.

The scene was one of the first widely shared images of wanton
destruction to emerge from the protests in Minneapolis after George
Floyd was killed by the police there. Yet the figure remained
mysterious. He was given the nickname “Umbrella Man” and became the
subject of online conspiracy theories.

The Minneapolis police unsuccessfully tried to identify the man based on
a glimpse of facial features seen in the bystander video. But after
receiving a tip about his identity, they used other photographs,
including a driver’s license, to zero in on a suspect who they say has
ties to the Hells Angels and a prison biker gang.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a search warrant affidavit filed in Hennepin County District Court on
Monday, the police requested cellphone records that would establish the
suspect’s whereabouts on May 27, when the store was vandalized. They
have not charged anyone with a crime.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Erika Christensen, an arson investigator with the Minneapolis police,
wrote in the affidavit that the vandalism “created an atmosphere of
hostility and tension” two days after Mr. Floyd’s death. It unleashed a
chain reaction of arson and looting in the Twin Cities, she wrote, after
protests had been relatively peaceful.

“In a short time after the front windows are broken out in The AutoZone,
looting started,” the affidavit said, noting that the AutoZone store
burned down later that day. “This was the first fire that set off a
string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and the rest of the
city.”

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The affidavit asserted that the suspect, 32, hoped to instigate racial
unrest. In addition to smashing the windows, it said, he spray-painted a
message on the doors that encouraged looting. The store was on the
opposite corner from the city’s Third Precinct building, which
protesters later burned after the police abandoned it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The suspect “wanted to sow discord and racial unrest by breaking out the
windows and writing what he did on the double red doors,” the affidavit
said.

The man’s name and telephone number were listed in the affidavit, but a
man who answered a call to that number said, “You have the wrong
number,” asked to be sent a copy of the affidavit and then hung up. A
lawyer who represented him in a previous case did not respond to a
request for comment.

The suspect is a member of the Hells Angels and an associate of the
Aryan Cowboys, a prison gang in Minnesota and Kentucky, the affidavit
said. Neither group could be immediately reached.

The Trump administration has often sought to blame the vandalism that
took place during nationwide protests on leftist agitators. Attorney
General William P. Barr claimed that “in many places” the protests were
led by “far-left extremists,” but there is [no evidence that
anti-fascists coordinated
demonstrations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/us/antifa-protests-george-floyd.html).

In the aftermath of the unrest in Minneapolis, a cross-section of
officials, activists, business owners and residents have suggested that
some of the destruction resulted from a breakdown in governance. They
say the mayor and other local leaders, many of them relatively new to
their roles, failed to anticipate the intensity of the unrest or put
together an effective plan to manage it.

A previous accusation that the Umbrella Man was a member of the St. Paul
Police Department became so widespread that the department issued a
denial. It released a series of time-stamped surveillance videos showing
that the officer was in St. Paul at the time of the episode.

The St. Paul police chief, Todd Axtell, [issued a
statement](https://www.stpaul.gov/news/surveillance-video-confirms-saint-paul-police-officer-jacob-pederson-not-%E2%80%98umbrella-man%E2%80%99#:~:text=Monday%2C%20May%2027.-,The%20Saint%20Paul%20Police%20Department%20today%20\(Monday%2C%20June%208\),the%20rumor%20on%20May%2028.)
berating people on social media for spreading false information that
could jeopardize an officer’s reputation and undermine trust in the
police.
