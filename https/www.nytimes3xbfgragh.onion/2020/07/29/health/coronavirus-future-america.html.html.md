Once again, the coronavirus is ascendant. As infections mount across the
country, it is dawning on Americans that the epidemic is now
unstoppable, and that no corner of the nation will be left untouched.

As of Wednesday, the pathogen had infected at least 4.3 million
Americans, killing more than 150,000. Many experts fear the virus could
kill
[200,000](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2020/07/07/imhe-model-projects-208255-us-deaths-by-november-but-estimate-falls-sharply-if-mask-use-increases/#3c8ee9616f2e)or
[even 300,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/dr-scott-gottlieb-us-coronavirus-deaths-may-hit-300000-by-year-end.html)
by year’s end. Even President Trump has donned a mask, after resisting
for months, and has [canceled the Republican National
Convention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/politics/jacksonville-rnc.html)
celebrations in Florida.

Each state, each city has its own crisis driven by its own risk factors:
vacation crowds in one, bars reopened too soon in another, a revolt
against masks in a third.

“We are in a worse place than we were in March,” when the virus coursed
through New York, said [Dr. Leana S.
Wen](https://www.gwumc.edu/smhs/facultydirectory/profile.cfm?empName=Leana%20Wen&FacID=2073685428),
a former Baltimore health commissioner. “Back then we had one epicenter.
Now we have lots.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To assess where the country is heading now, The New York Times
interviewed 20 public health experts — not just clinicians and
epidemiologists, but also historians and sociologists, because the
spread of the virus is now influenced as much by human behavior as it is
by the pathogen itself.

Not only are American cities in the South and West facing deadly
outbreaks like those that struck Northeastern cities in the spring, but
[rural
areas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-texas-rio-grande-valley-border.html)
are being hurt, too. In every region, [people of color will continue to
suffer
disproportionately](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html),
experts said.

While there may be no appetite for a national lockdown, local
restrictions must be tightened when required, the researchers said, and
governors and mayors must have identical goals. Testing must become more
targeted.

In most states, contact tracing is now moot — there are simply too many
cases to track. [And while progress has been made on
vaccines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html),
none is expected to arrive this winter in time to stave off what many
fear will be a new wave of deaths.

Overall, the scientists conveyed a pervasive sense of sadness and
exhaustion. Where [once there was
defiance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html),
[and then a growing sense of
dread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html),
now there seems to be sorrow and frustration, a feeling that so many
funerals never had to happen and that nothing is going well. The United
States is a wounded giant, while much of Europe, which was hit first, is
[recovering and
reopening](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/business/europe-consumer-spending.html)
— [although not to
us](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/eu-travel-ban-explained-usa.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re all incredibly depressed and in shock at how out of control the
virus is in the U.S.,” said [Dr. Michele
Barry](https://profiles.stanford.edu/michele-barry), the director of the
Center for Innovation in Global Health at Stanford University.

With so much wealth and medical talent, they asked, how could we have
[done so
poorly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/daily-virus-death-toll-rises-in-some-states.html)?
How did we fare not just worse than autocratic China and isolated New
Zealand, but also worse than tiny, much poorer nations like Vietnam and
Rwanda?

“National hubris and belief in American exceptionalism have served us
badly,” said [Martha L.
Lincoln](https://anthropology.sfsu.edu/people/faculty/martha-lincoln), a
medical anthropologist and historian at San Francisco State University.
“We were not prepared to see the risk of failure.”

Since the coronavirus was first found to be the cause of lethal
pneumonias in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, scientists have gained a
better understanding of the enemy.

It is extremely transmissible, through not just coughed droplets but
also a fine aerosol mist that is expelled when people [talk loudly,
laugh or
sing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/health/coronavirus-infections.html)
and that can [linger in indoor
air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html).
As a result, [masks are far more
effective](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/coronavirus-mask-protection.html)
than scientists once believed.

Virus carriers with mild or no symptoms can be infectious, and there
[may be 10
times](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/number-of-americans-infected-with-virus-could-be-10-times-higher-than-official-count-cdc-chief-warns/)as
many [people spreading the
illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/health/coronavirus-infections-us.html)
as have tested positive for it.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The infection may start in the lungs, but it is very different from
influenza, a respiratory virus. In severely ill patients, the
coronavirus may attach to receptors inside the veins and arteries, and
move on to attack the kidneys, the heart, the gut and even the brain,
choking off these organs with hundreds of tiny blood clots.

Most of the virus’s victims are elderly, but it [has not spared young
adults](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/coronavirus-cases-young-people.html),
especially those with obesity, high blood pressure or diabetes. Adults
aged 18 to 49 now [account for more hospitalized
cases](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html) than people
aged 50 to 64 or those 65 and older.

Children are [usually not
harmed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/health/coronavirus-children-us.html)
by the virus, although clinicians were dismayed to discover a few who
were struck by a [rare but
dangerous](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html)
[inflammatory
version](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/health/coronavirus-children-kawasaki-pmis.html).
[Young
children](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/health/coronavirus-children.html)
appear to transmit the virus [less often than
teenagers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-children-schools.html),
which may affect how schools can be opened.

Among adults, a very different picture has emerged. Growing evidence
suggests that perhaps 10 percent of the infected account for [80 percent
of new
transmissions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/science/how-coronavirus-spreads.html).
Unpredictable superspreading events in nursing homes, meatpacking
plants, churches, prisons and bars are major drivers of the epidemic.

Thus far, none of the medicines for which hopes were once high —
repurposed malaria drugs, AIDS drugs and antivirals — have proved to be
rapid cures. One antiviral, remdesivir, [has been shown to shorten
hospital
stays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/health/gilead-remdesivir-coronavirus.html),
while a common steroid, dexamethasone, has [helped save some severely
ill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html)
patients.

Some experts, like Michael T. Osterholm, the director of the University
of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, argue
that only a nationwide lockdown can completely contain the virus now.
Other researchers think that is politically impossible, but emphasize
that localities must be free to act quickly and enforce strong measures
with support from their state legislators.

[Danielle Allen](https://scholar.harvard.edu/danielleallen/home), the
director of Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics,
which has issued [pandemic response
plans](https://ethics.harvard.edu/news/path-zero-key-metrics), said that
finding less than one case per 100,000 people means a community should
continue testing, contact tracing and isolating cases — with financial
support for those who need it.

Up to 25 cases per 100,000 requires greater restrictions, like closing
bars and limiting gatherings. Above that number, authorities should
issue stay-at-home orders, she said.

Testing must be focused, not just offered at convenient parking lots,
experts said, and it should be most intense in institutions like nursing
homes, prisons, factories or other places at risk of superspreading
events.

Testing must be free in places where people are poor or uninsured, such
as public housing projects, Native American reservations and churches
and grocery stores in impoverished neighborhoods.

None of this will be possible unless the nation’s capacity for testing,
a continuing disaster, is greatly expanded. By the end of summer, the
administration hopes to start using “pooling,” in which [tests are
combined in
batches](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-pooled-testing.html)
to speed up the process.

But the method only works in communities with lower infection rates,
where large numbers of pooled tests turn up relatively few positive
results. It fails where the virus has spread everywhere, because too
many batches turn up positive results that require retesting.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the moment, the United States [tests roughly 800,000 people per
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html),
about 38 percent of the number some experts think is needed.

Above all, researchers said, mask use should be universal indoors —
including airplanes, subway cars and every other enclosed space — and
outdoors anywhere people are less than six feet apart.

Dr. Emily Landon, an infection control specialist at the University of
Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, said it was “sad that something as
simple as a mask got politicized.”

“It’s not a statement, it’s a piece of clothing,” she added. “You get
used to it the way you got used to wearing pants.”

Arguments that masks infringe on personal rights must be countered both
by legal orders and by persuasion. “We need more credible messengers
endorsing masks,” Dr. Wen said — just before the president himself
became a messenger.

“They could include C.E.O.s or celebrities or religious leaders.
Different people are influencers to different demographics.”

Although this feels like a new debate, it is actually an old one. Masks
were [common in some Western
cities](https://www.history.com/news/1918-spanish-flu-mask-wearing-resistance)
during the 1918 flu pandemic and mandatory in San Francisco. There was
[even a
jingle](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/influenza-san-francisco/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20more%20highly,the%20spread%20of%20flu%20germs.&text=A%20Mask%20is%2099%25%20Proof,laws%2C%20and%20wear%20the%20gauze.):
“Obey the laws, wear the gauze. Protect your jaws from septic paws.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“A libertarian movement, the [Anti-Mask
League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Mask_League_of_San_Francisco),
emerged,” Dr. Lincoln of San Francisco State said. “There were
fistfights with police officers over it.” Ultimately, city officials
“waffled” and compliance faded.

“I wonder what this issue would be like today,” she mused, “if that
hadn’t happened.”

Images of Americans disregarding social distancing requirements have
become a daily news staple. But the pictures are deceptive: Americans
are more accepting of social distancing than the media sometimes
portrays, said [Beth Redbird, a Northwestern University
sociologist](https://magazine.northwestern.edu/exclusives/covid-19-impact-research/)
who since March has conducted [regular
surveys](https://coronadata.us/data/) of 8,000 adults about the impact
of the virus.

“About 70 percent of Americans report using all forms of it,” she said.
“And when we give them adjective choices, they describe people who
won’t distance as mean, selfish or unintelligent, not as generous,
open-minded or patriotic.”

The key predictor, she said in early July, was whether or not the poll
respondent trusted Mr. Trump. Those who trusted him were less likely to
practice social distancing. That was true of Republicans and
independents, “and there’s no such thing as a Democrat who trusts Donald
Trump,” she added.

Whether or not people support coercive measures like stay-at-home orders
or bar closures depended on how scared the respondent was.

“When rising case numbers make people more afraid, they have more taste
for liberty-constraining actions,” Dr. Redbird said. And no economic
recovery will occur, she added, “until people aren’t afraid. If they
are, they won’t go out and spend money even if they’re allowed
to.”

As of Wednesday, new infections were rising in 33 states, and in Puerto
Rico and the District of Columbia, according to a database maintained by
The Times.

Weeks ago, experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the
National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, [were
advising](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-fauci-says-the-u-s-can-get-control-of-the-pandemic)states
where the virus was surging to pull back from reopening by closing down
bars, forbidding large gatherings and requiring mask usage.

Many of those states are finally taking that advice, but it is not yet
clear whether this national change of heart has happened in time to stop
the newest wave of deaths from ultimately exceeding the 2,750-a-day peak
of mid-April. Now, the daily average is 1,106 virus deaths nationwide.

Deaths may surge even higher, experts warned, when cold weather, rain
and snow force Americans to meet indoors, eat indoors and crowd into
public transit.

Oddly, states that are now hard-hit might become safer, some experts
suggested. In the South and Southwest, summers are so hot that diners
seek air-conditioning indoors, but eating outdoors in December can be
pleasant.

Several studies have confirmed transmission in air-conditioned rooms. In
one [well-known case
cluster](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/20/health/airflow-coronavirus-restaurants.html)
in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, researchers concluded that
air-conditioners blew around a viral cloud, infecting patrons as far as
10 feet from a sick diner.

Rural areas face another risk. Almost 80 percent of the country’s
counties lack even one infectious disease specialist, according to [a
study](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2684) led by [Dr.
Rochelle
Walensky](https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17245/rochelle-walensky),
the chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the moment, the crisis is most acute in Southern and Southwestern
states. But [websites that track transmission rates](https://rt.live/)
show that hot spots can turn up anywhere. For three weeks, for example,
Alaska’s small outbreak has been one of the country’s fastest-spreading,
while transmission in Texas and Arizona has dramatically slowed.

Deaths now may rise more slowly than they did in spring, because
hospitalized patients are, on average, younger this time. But
overwhelmed hospitals can lead to [excess deaths from many
causes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/06/01/us/coronavirus-deaths-new-york-new-jersey.html)
all over a community, as ambulances are delayed and people having health
crises [avoid hospitals out of
fear](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/opinion/coronavirus-hospitals-deaths.html).

The experts were divided as to what role influenza will play in the
fall. A harsh flu season could flood hospitals with pneumonia patients
needing ventilators. But some said the flu season could be mild or
almost nonexistent this year.

Normally, the flu virus migrates from the Northern Hemisphere to the
Southern Hemisphere in the spring — presumably in air travelers — and
then returns in the fall, with new mutations that may make it a poor
match for the annual vaccine.

But this year, the national lockdown abruptly ended flu transmission in
late April, according to [weekly Fluview
reports](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm) from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. International air travel has been
sharply curtailed, and there has been [almost no flu
activity](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-13/flu-cases-drop-amid-coronavirus-restrictions-statistics-show/12332204)
in [the whole southern
hemisphere](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-measures-have-all-but-wiped-out-the-flu-in-the-southern-hemisphere-11595440682)
this year.

Assuming there is still little air travel to the United States this
fall, there may be little “reseeding” of the flu virus here. But in case
that prediction turns out be wrong, all the researchers advised getting
flu shots anyway.

“There’s no reason to be caught unprepared for two respiratory viruses,”
said [Tara C.
Smith](https://www.kent.edu/publichealth/profile/tara-c-smith-phd), an
epidemiologist at Kent State University’s School of Public
Health.

Experts familiar with vaccine and drug manufacturing were disappointed
that, thus far, only dexamethasone and remdesivir have proved to be
effective treatments, and then only partially.

Most felt that monoclonal antibodies — cloned human proteins that can be
grown in cell culture — represented the best hope until vaccines arrive.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“They’re promising both for treatment and for prophylaxis, and there are
companies with track records and manufacturing platforms,” said [Dr.
Luciana Borio](http://leighbureau.com/speakers/lborio), a former
director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security
Council. “But manufacturing capacity is limited.”

According to a database compiled by The Times, [researchers worldwide
are developing more than 165 vaccine
candidates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html),
and 27 are in human trials.

New announcements are pouring in, and the pressure to hurry is intense:
The Trump administration [just awarded nearly $2 billion to a Pfizer-led
consortium](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
that promised 100 million doses by December, assuming trials succeed.

Because the virus is still spreading rapidly, most experts said
“challenge trials,” in which a small number of volunteers are
vaccinated and then deliberately infected, would probably not be needed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Absent a known cure, “challenges” can be ethically fraught, and some
doctors [oppose doing them
for](https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/23/challenge-trials-live-coronavirus-speedy-covid-19-vaccine/)this
virus. “They don’t tell you anything about safety,” Dr. Borio said.

And when a virus is circulating unchecked, a typical placebo-controlled
trial with up to 30,000 participants can be done efficiently, she added.
Moderna and Pfizer have already begun such trials.

The Food and Drug Administration has said a vaccine will pass muster
even [if it is only 50 percent
effective](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/06/30/coronavirus-vaccine-approval-fda/).
Experts said they could accept that, at least initially, because the
first vaccine approved could save lives while testing continued on
better alternatives.

“A vaccine doesn’t have to work perfectly to be useful,” Dr. Walensky
said. “Even with measles vaccine, you can sometimes still get measles —
but it’s mild, and you aren’t infectious.”

“We don’t know if a vaccine will work in older folks. We don’t know
exactly what level of herd immunity we’ll need to stop the epidemic. But
anything safe and fairly effective should help.”

Still, haste is risky, experts warned, especially [when opponents of
vaccines are spreading
fear](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-anti-vaccine.html).
If a vaccine is rushed [to
market](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/opinion/trump-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
without thorough safety testing and recipients are hurt by it, all
vaccines could be set back for
years.

No matter what state the virus reaches, one risk remains constant. Even
in states with few Black and Hispanic residents, they[are usually hit
hardest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html),
experts said.

People of color are more likely to have jobs that require physical
presence and sometimes close contact, such as construction work, store
clerking and nursing. They are more likely to rely on public transit and
to live in neighborhoods where grocery stores are scarce and crowded.

[They
are](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html)
[more likely to live in crowded housing and multigenerational
homes](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/05/a-record-64-million-americans-live-in-multigenerational-households/),
some with only one bathroom, making safe home isolation impossible when
sickness strikes. They have higher rates of obesity, high blood
pressure, diabetes and asthma.

[Federal
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html)
gathered through May 28 shows that Black and Hispanic Americans were
three times as likely to get infected as their white neighbors, and
twice as likely to die, even if they lived in remote rural counties with
few Black or Hispanic residents.

“By the time that minority patient sets foot in a hospital, he is
already on an unequal footing,” said [Elaine
Hernandez](https://www.newswise.com/coronavirus/iu-professor-available-to-discuss-social-bias-and-inequality-in-covid-crisis/?article_id=729760),
a sociologist at Indiana University.

The differences persist even though Black and Hispanic adults
drastically altered their behavior. One study found that through the
beginning of May, the average Black American [practiced more social
distancing](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20119131v1)
than the average white American.

Officials in
[Chicago](https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/04/07/black-people-are-not-immune-to-coronavirus-debunking-deadly-social-media-myths/),
[Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-baltimore-coronavirus-black-messaging-testing-20200414-cgqbwz6cmffabel364ixfktlje-story.html)
and other communities faced another threat: rumors flying about social
media that Black people were somehow immune.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The top factor making people adopt self-protective behavior is
personally knowing someone who fell ill, said Dr. Redbird. By the end of
spring, Black and Hispanic Americans were 50 percent more likely than
white Americans to know someone who had been sickened by the virus, her
surveys found.

Dr. Hernandez, whose parents live in Arizona, said their neighbors who
had not been scared in June had since changed their attitudes.

Her father, a physician, had set an example. Early on, he wore a mask
with a silly mustache when he and his wife took walks, and they would
decline friends’ invitations, saying, “No, we’re staying in our bubble.”

Now, she said, their neighbors are wearing masks, “and people are
telling my father, ‘You were right,’” Dr. Hernandez
said.

There was no widespread agreement among experts about what is likely to
happen in the years after the pandemic. Some scientists expected a quick
economic recovery; others thought the damage could persist for years.

Working at home will become more common, some predicted, while crowded,
open-plan offices may be changed. The just-in-time supply chains on
which many businesses depend will need fixing because the processes
failed to deliver adequate protective gear, ventilators and test
materials.

A disease-modeling system like that used by the [National Weather
Service](https://www.weather.gov/) to predict storms is needed, said
[Caitlin
Rivers](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-people/rivers/), an
epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Right
now, the country has surveillance for seasonal flu but no national map
tracking all disease outbreaks. As Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former
C.D.C. director, recently pointed out, states are [not even required to
track](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/health/coronavirus-data-states-cdc.html)
the same data.

Several experts said they assumed that millions of Americans who have
been left without health insurance or forced to line up at food banks
would vote for politicians favoring universal health care, paid sick
leave, greater income equality and other changes.

But given the country’s deep political divisions, no researcher was
certain what the outcome of the coming election would be.

Dr. Redbird said her polling of Americans showed “little faith in
institutions across the board — we’re not seeing an increase in trust in
science or an appetite for universal health care or workers equity.”

The Trump administration did little to earn trust. More than six months
into the worst health crisis in a century, Mr. Trump only last week
urged Americans to wear masks and canceled the Republican convention in
Florida, the kind of high-risk indoor event that states have been
banning since mid-March.

“It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,” Mr.
Trump said at the first of the resurrected coronavirus task force
briefings earlier this month, which included no scientists or health
officials. The briefings were discontinued in April amid his rosy
predications that the epidemic would soon be over.

Mr. Trump has
[ignored](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-fauci.html),
[contradicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYhriqvJMSw) or
[disparaged](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/19/politics/trump-fauci-alarmist-coronavirus/index.html)
his scientific advisers, repeatedly saying that the virus simply would
go away, touting unproven drugs like hydroxychloroquine even after they
were shown to be ineffective and sometimes dangerous, and suggesting
that disinfectants or lethal ultraviolet light might be used inside the
body.

jobs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/23/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#roughly-one-in-five-workers-are-collecting-unemployment-benefits)
and [their health
insurance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/politics/coronavirus-health-insurance-trump.html),
and are in danger of [losing their
homes,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/opinion/coronavirus-evictions-rent.html)even
as they find themselves in the path of a lethal disease. The Trump
presidency “is the symptom of the denigration of science and the gutting
of the public contract about what we owe each other as citizens,” said
[Dr. Joia S.
Mukherjee](https://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/joia-stapleton-mukherjee),
the chief medical officer of Partners in Health in Boston.

better prepared for microbial assaults, said Dr. Julie Gerberding, a
former director of the C.D.C.

“This is not a once-in-a-century event. It’s a harbinger of things to
come.”
