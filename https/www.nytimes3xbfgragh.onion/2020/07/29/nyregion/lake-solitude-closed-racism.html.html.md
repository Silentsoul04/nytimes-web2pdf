# ‘Hidden Gem’ Made Popular by TikTok Is Shut to Keep Out-of-Towners Away

A lake in New Jersey was closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus,
but some complaints about recent crowding there focused on the ethnicity
of visitors.

HIGH BRIDGE, N.J. — Lake Solitude it was not.

For years, the 35-acre picturesque lake, waterfall and century-old dam
had been an unspoiled treasure for local residents, but through the
power of social media, the secret got out.

People began pouring in, bringing portable speakers, children and food,
and leaving behind trash. Borough officials installed extra garbage cans
and portable toilets, and brought in police officers to direct traffic —
many vehicles with New York license plates. On a recent Sunday, some
visitors had to be turned away.

Residents had seen enough. They swarmed a virtual town-hall-style
meeting this month, demanding that Lake Solitude be shut. Last week, the
Borough of High Bridge complied, closing the area to all visitors.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some of the complaints stemmed from fears that visitors might bring the
coronavirus from New York City, about 50 miles east of the borough. But
some of them focused bluntly on ethnicity.

High Bridge is nearly 95 percent white, but the lake attracts a much
more diverse group.

On the last weekend that Lake Solitude was open, mothers and fathers
were paddling with toddlers underneath the waterfall’s spray,
grandmothers were basking with their feet in the bucolic river and
20-somethings were taking drone photos with the imposing dam.

“We have droves of out-of-state Spanish people and they leave their crap
lying on the ground,” said Lester Tomson, 58, who regularly fished the
stream.

Mr. Tomson, a registered Democrat, is one of a number of people who, on
social media and in conversation, have suggested that Immigration and
Customs Enforcement should have been called to the park.

“It’s not a racist thing,” he said in an interview. “It’s a thing where
you observe things, and your observations are based in facts and not in
racism.”

said they had to [shut their popular Big Deep and Little
Deep](https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2020/07/08/woodstock-cracks-down-use-of-closed-swimming-holes/)

Elsewhere in the Catskills, more than 300 people attended a

traffic and trash brought by outsiders at Kaaterskill Falls, especially
at its popular swimming holes, Fawns Leap and Dog
Hole.

Greene County, home to Kaaterskill Falls, is over 96 percent white. But
Daryl Legg, the town supervisor of Hunter, where the falls are, rejected
the idea that race had any part to play in the complaints.

“People come here for the scenery and beauty of the place,” he said,
“but leave red Solo cups at the bottom of the swim hole, and people
defecate and pee in the woods and it smells like a latrine after
Woodstock.”

But the tensions have been especially sharp in New Jersey, where state
officials in April gave municipalities broad discretion to close public
parks as a way of curbing the coronavirus.

In Ocean County, borough officials in Lakehurst cited overcrowding in
their decision to [shut Lake
Horicon](https://nj1015.com/lake-in-nj-closes-after-one-day-over-crowds-not-social-distancing/)
to visitors in May, a day after the state had reopened county and state
parks. In Long Branch, in Monmouth County, the police temporarily
blocked beach access this month after a deluge of beachgoers made social
distancing impossible.

In High Bridge, the decision last week to close Lake Solitude was made
for health precautions and because the parking lots were at capacity,
according to the borough’s mayor, Michele Lee.

But three days earlier, during the virtual meeting, some public comments
cited other reasons: One man expressed that he felt unsafe after a male
visitor to the lake said, “Hola, señorita,” to his
wife.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is

        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

Ms. Lee said that the borough’s decision had nothing to do with any
overt or subtle xenophobia or racism — like the discussions about the
cleanliness of “those people” that could recently be overheard over
pints of Keepin’ Local beer on the patio of a local brewery and taproom.

“I find those kinds of comments more disgusting than any of the garbage
I saw left behind at the lake,” Mayor Lee said.

At Lake Solitude the day before it was shut, the ground was pristine,
and few people enjoying the park felt there was a problem.

“People are just looking for an excuse not to have colored people
around, to get us out of their town,” said Alej Rodriguez, 26, a truck
driver who drove in from Upper Manhattan with his family, to visit the
lake and the sights on the rolling grounds, like the remains of the
Union Iron Works forge, which smelted cannonballs for the Revolutionary
War.

“You’ve always got a target on your back as a colored person,” he said.
“You’ve always got to watch your back, even at a beautiful lake where
we come to have fun.”

Not far from Mr. Rodriguez, a man, who identified himself as a High
Bridge resident but would give only his first name, Mike, was taking
photos of people swimming with a long range lens.

“I’m documenting the problem,” said the man, who was white, explaining
he was angry that the bathers were not wearing masks as they swam, and
worried that the people playing in the water were contaminating
it.

Edward Bielcik, 74, had heard talk of the overcrowding and wanted to see
for himself, he said. He was one of several residents strolling the park
with cameras to document the claims. “They said the Latin Kings tagged
the area,” Mr. Bielcik said.

For several weeks, Mayor Lee, a financial adviser who does not take a
salary for her borough position, had pushed to keep the park open, under
her belief the newcomers could help make High Bridge a tourist
destination. “If we get this right, it’s a great situation for the
town,” she said.

Plans are underway to figure out how to reopen and accommodate any
crowds, the mayor said, but there is no timeline yet to do so.

Some of the borough’s residents say they can’t help but feel that uglier
impulses are behind the desire to close the lake.

At Scout’s Coffee Bar & Mercantile on Main Street, the owner’s eyes
filled with tears when she recounted the words used about the visitors
that she had overheard at her barista’s counter. Just a month before, a
Black Lives Matter rally had taken place down the street.

“We just went through all the protests, and we are all learning about
how we can be better allies to people of color, and this is our
opportunity. It’s disheartening,” said the owner, Nicole Poko, 38, who
is white. “It just feels like there is a lot of work to be done.”
