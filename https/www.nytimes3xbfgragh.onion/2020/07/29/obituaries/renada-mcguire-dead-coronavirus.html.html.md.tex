\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in

The challenges kept coming at Renada McGuire, and she kept rising to the
occasion.

Whether raising six children as a single mother, fighting through kidney
and heart problems or learning how to fish, Ms. McGuire, family and
friends said, was determined to triumph.

While raising her first son, who was born prematurely and developed a
mental disability, Ms. McGuire decided to become a home health aide
specializing in mentally challenged adults.

``There was just a spunk she had in her,'' her sister-in-law Natasha
Guerrero said.

Ms. McGuire
\href{https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/st-augustine-mother-of-6-dies-from-covid-19/77-1572d6fb-5c26-472b-8264-8ba23cbcbcfa}{died
on July 4} at
\href{https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south}{Baptist
Medical Center South} in Jacksonville, Fla. The cause was complications
of the novel coronavirus, her family said. She was 39 and lived nearby
in Palm Coast.

The illness came days after Ms. McGuire and her boyfriend, Brooks
Greene, had dined out at a Jacksonville restaurant as the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/12/us/florida-coronavirus-covid-cases.html}{pandemic
was surging in Florida.}

Renada McGuire was born on Nov. 28, 1980, in St. Augustine, Fla., to
Jorge Guerrero Sr., a farmworker, and Patricia McGuire, a home health
care worker. She adopted her mother's surname.

When she was young, her father was deported to Guatemala, his home
country, and never heard from by the family again. His departure made
her older brother, Jorge Jr., the family patriarch and turned Ms.
McGuire, her family said, into a lifelong fighter.

``She didn't back down from anything,'' Natasha Guerrero said.

When Ms. McGuire was a child, she stuck up for her brother whenever she
thought he was being threatened. ``She was the little sister, but she
was tough,'' Ms. Guerrero said with a laugh. ``There were times, Jorge
told me, she'd be tougher than Jorge.''

A lover of R\&B music, Ms. McGuire committed herself to ``anything
involving music'' while she was a student at
\href{https://www-nhs.stjohns.k12.fl.us/}{Allen D. Nease High School} in
Ponte Vedra, becoming a member of the flag team, the winter guard and
the school band, in which she learned to play the flute and clarinet.

She became an avid fisherwoman after being introduced to fishing
recently by Mr. Greene. With him by her side, she would seek out ``any
little watering hole she could find, often fishing several times a
week,'' Ms. Guerrero said. ``It brought her peace.''

``The strength she had as a mom, though --- that was the greatest thing
about her,'' Ms. Guerrero said.

Ms. McGuire is survived by her brother and her children: Elijah, 19,
Victerius, 17, Tyvicrean, 16, Alexius, 12, Kourtney, 10, and Davian, 6.

To lighten her load, Jorge and Ms. Guerrero, who have four children of
their own, would watch Ms. McGuire's children on weekends.

That weekend role has become full time now: They have taken the children
in.

``They need us right now,'' Ms. Guerrero said. ``And, at the same time,
I think my husband needs them as well. She was all he had left.''
