*This month’s conversation in our series exploring religion and death is
with Pankaj Jain (@ProfPankajJain), an associate professor in the
department of philosophy and religion at the University of North Texas.
He is the author of “*[*Dharma in America: A Short History of Hindu-Jain
Diaspora*](https://www.routledge.com/Dharma-in-America-A-Short-History-of-Hindu-Jain-Diaspora/Jain/p/book/9781138565456)*,”
“*[*Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and
Sustainability*](http://www.amazon.com/Dharma-Ecology-Hindu-Communities-Sustainability/dp/1409405915/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1302198725&sr=8-1)*”
and other works. He is currently translating “Jain Darshan,” a text on
the philosophy of Jainism. In 2019, he appeared in the TV series “*[*The
Story of God*](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80178897?source=35)*” with
the actor Morgan Freeman.*

**George Yancy:** Most Westerners know the central figures of certain
religions like the Buddha and Jesus. But less is known about Mahavira,
who is a central figure in Jainism. What should we know about him and
his role in the religion?

**Pankaj Jain:** Mahavira was a contemporary of the Buddha but was not
the founder of Jainism \[which originated in India around the seventh
century B.C.E.\]. He was the 24th great teacher of the tradition and
continues to be the most influential role model for millions of Jains in
India and those in other countries throughout the rest of the world. He
taught the principles of truth, nonviolence, minimalism and celibacy
that influenced global leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther
King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, and demonstrated the ultimate penance in
his life with long fasts and meditations.

**Yancy:** How did he reach enlightenment?

**Jain:** Mahavira was born into a royal family but renounced all his
wealth, family and belongings when he turned 30 and became a monk.
During his wandering ascetic life, he used to be so engrossed in his
meditation that he could easily ignore all his bodily needs and even
injuries. It is mentioned in the Jain texts that he ate only rice, dates
or pulses during that time and that he accepted food only on 349 days
out of 4,380 days (almost 12 years) of his severe penance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Because he remained silently engrossed in his contemplation and
meditation in that period, sometimes people misunderstood him and tried
to harm him in different ways. Still, nothing could disturb the
steadfast concentration that finally led him to achieve his
enlightenment around the age of 43. He obtained his liberation when he
died at the age of 72.

**Yancy:** Is Jainism theistic or nontheistic?

**Jain:** Jainism, like Buddhism, is nontheistic. In Jainism, there is
no God that created the universe and all the souls. The universe and all
its souls have existed without any beginning and will always exist
without any end. For millions of Jains, their great teachers and gurus
remain their role models. Jain temples enshrine their 24 greatest
teachers, Tirthankaras, and most of the Jains regularly visit these
temples and perform elaborate rituals, especially on their holy days and
festivals, such as the annual day of forgiveness, and many
others.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Yancy:** Is there a sacred text within Jainism? What does it teach
about good and evil, and how we ought to live?

**Jain:** Jainism has two prominent sects, and each has its own set of
dozens of sacred texts. The emphasis of these texts is on nonviolence,
minimalism and pluralism. We ought to live with minimal violence toward
other living beings in our thoughts, words and actions. For Jainism,
living beings include air, water, fire, earth, in addition to humans,
animals, plants and insects.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Yancy:** This is fascinating, but how might we avoid, say, stepping on
an ant or killing microbes? Are there certain practices that might
prevent such deaths?

**Jain:** Jainism recognizes that some violence is inevitable,
especially toward microbes, as we live in the world, and therefore, lay
Jains have relaxed vows. However, for Jain ascetics, the vows and rules
are stringent, which prohibits them from riding on any vehicle. They
must only walk for any travel, and when they do, carefully clearing
their way to avoid stepping on any small insect, for instance. Some Jain
ascetics keep their mouths covered with a mask as they speak or breathe
to prevent ingesting any microbes. Devout Jains consume water only after
carefully filtering and boiling for the same reason. They also perform
forgiveness rituals periodically to repent for any unconscious violence
committed even after these precautionary practices.

**Yancy:** It is my understanding that Jainism has a rich set of beliefs
about the movement of the soul — transmigration. What kind of insight
does this give us into how Jains conceive of death or the afterlife?

**Jain:** In Jainism, as in some other religions, only the body dies,
but the soul continues its journey through transmigration. The soul is
distinct from the body in Jainism. The body is a tool used to purify the
soul across different lives to reach the ultimate destination of Moksha,
or liberation. The soul reincarnates in any of the millions of species
on the earth, the heavens or the hells. This infinite process depends on
how nonviolent its journey has been through different lives.

**Yancy:** How might we use our bodies to purify our souls? I ask
because often, the body is seen as “impure” within various religious
traditions.

**Jain:** The body is an instrument for practicing penance, including
meditation and fasting. The body is not to be indulged in pleasures and
luxuries, but rather, by courageously tolerating various bodily
inconveniences and sufferings, the soul succeeds in purifying itself
from past karmas. This purification process helps one progress toward
liberation.

**Yancy:** Why might a soul reincarnate within a particular species —
cat, cow, bird and so on? You suggested that being nonviolent makes a
difference in the next life.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Jain:** In the Jain system of reincarnation, the more nonviolent and
purer a soul is, the more favorable the next birth will be. The human
species is the most privileged, but other species can also renounce
violence. For example, in one of his previous births, Mahavira was born
as a lion, and that lion became vegetarian and nonviolent.

**Yancy:** The Jainist universe contains higher and lower realms, which
we might understand as heaven or hell. Is hell conceived of as a bad
place and heaven a good place?

**Jain:** Hell is a bad place where a soul is punished for its past
negative karma. Heaven is a good place where a soul is rewarded for its
positive karma. But the earth is better than both extremes because only
here a human being can strive to attain liberation, transcending all the
three realms of earth, heavens and
hells.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Yancy:** You and I are human beings. What does this say about our
previous reincarnations?

**Jain:** All humans are privileged as they have enough positive karma
from their past lives, allowing them in this life to strive toward their
liberation.

**Yancy:** So, because I am a philosopher, does this mean that I was
reincarnated from something “higher” or less violent?

**Jain:** Yes, being a philosopher would be like being a practitioner of
spirituality, which is a privilege to be able to progress toward
liberation. The opportunity to be a practitioner of philosophy is an
excellent reward for your past karma. In your previous lives, you may
have been progressively more and more nonviolent, compassionate and
minimalist.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Yancy:** So, if one is born a dog or a fish, what sort of prior life
would they have lived?

**Jain:** For any species, the key is how nonviolently they have lived.
Even a dog or a lion can avoid hurting others unnecessarily as Jain and
Buddhist tales demonstrate.

**Yancy:** Does Jainism have a story about why there is reincarnation at
all, or is reincarnation taken as the given structure of reality?

**Jain:** Until a soul is completely purified, it must keep
reincarnating itself through various species as there is no way out of
this infinite cycle. The body dies at the end of life, but the soul can
never die. Even after liberation, the soul lives forever in its
omniscience and omnipotence at the highest abode in the universe.

**Yancy:** What should we do now so that we can best determine the next
reincarnation of our souls? Can you provide some key precepts that we
might follow or embody?

**Jain:** We must adhere to truth, nonviolence, nonstealing,
nonpossession (minimalism) and celibacy, to the best of our competence
and capability. Renouncing meat and animal products would be the first
step toward that. Eating meat is avoided by Jain ascetics and
householders. Ascetics go to the ultimate by avoiding several kinds of
vegetarian food also to minimize all kinds of violence even toward
seeds, roots and stems of a plant.

**Yancy:** What impact does the performance of such specific rituals
have on the soul and its future reincarnations?

**Jain:** Jain rituals help practitioners celebrate the lives and
teachings of their great teachers. Many rituals involve verses and songs
based on them. Many Jains daily perform a ritual to ask for forgiveness
from millions of species that they might have unintentionally hurt on
that day. In the same spirit, they also ask for forgiveness from their
family and friends on the annual forgiveness day. These rituals help
reduce egoistic tendencies and foster a sense of interdependence and
friendliness among each other.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Yancy:** What, according to Jainism, is living the “good life” or the
observant life? And how does doing so or not doing so impact the soul
after death?

**Jain:** Jain teachers teach and demonstrate that one should live with
minimal violence. To that end, most of the Jains avoid meat and other
animal products to keep their souls free of negative karmas. The Jains
have demonstrated their compassion by supporting thousands of animal
sanctuaries across India and now in America.

**Yancy:** What would you say Jainism offers in the way of wisdom
regarding death, given that death is inevitable?

**Jain:** Death of the body is merely a milestone in the journey of the
soul. This journey completes when the soul achieves liberation and
arrives at the abode of the liberated beings, located at the final
frontier of the universe. Before death catches one off-guard, it is
one’s duty to keep purifying the soul. The purer the soul is at the
time of death, the better the chances are to get a more favorable next
birth to continue the journey of purification. Only with 100 percent
purity based on 100 percent nonviolence a soul can achieve liberation.

**Yancy:** It seems to me that most people fear death. How does Jainism
account for this fear?

**Jain:** Like in other communities, death is not a preferred topic of
everyday discussion for Jains. This fear, however, is due to the sudden
disruption of one’s life and uncertainty arising from it.

**Yancy:** But if we live our lives attempting to eliminate violence and
being successful at it, I assume that this might decrease our fear of
death. I say this because it seems we would have a better chance of
being reincarnated in a higher form.

**Jain:** Yes, you are correct. One who is steadfast in one’s practice
of nonviolence would have less and less fear of death. The
death-welcoming Jain ritual of Sallekhana also underscores this
fearlessness.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Yancy:** Are there certain ritualistic practices that Jains adopt as
they are about to die?

**Jain:** Many Jain monks and nuns in their late lives welcome death
with Sallekhana, ** the ** ritual for death. This practice includes the
ultimate renunciation of food and water, as their final demonstration of
zeroing down consumption, and related subtle violence, of all kinds.

**Yancy:** What would you say is the most philosophically rich takeaway
from Jainism in terms of its conceptualization of death?

**Jain:** One should not fear death but celebrate it as the ultimate
demonstration of minimizing consumption and violence. Fear of death
should encourage a life that is compassionate toward other living
beings.
