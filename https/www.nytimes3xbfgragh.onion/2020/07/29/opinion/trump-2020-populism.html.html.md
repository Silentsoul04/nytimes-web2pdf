Disruption, disorder and disease are gripping the United States as the
2020 election draws near, leading to an unusual degree of
unpredictability about our political future. Despite current state and
national [polling that
favors](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/) Democrats, we still
can’t say for sure whether the nation will tip left or right.

“Modern democracies are currently experiencing destabilizing events,”
three Danish political scientists, [Michael Bang
Petersen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/michael-bang-petersen\(7998cc16-75d5-4065-8b6e-395d73e22151\).html),
[Mathias
Osmundsen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/mathias-osmundsen\(a453964f-daa7-4f40-94d0-fde773a485d4\).html)
and [Alexander
Bor](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/alexander-bor\(df35f529-baf4-4bbf-916e-9dac13baf052\).html),
write, “including the emergence of demagogic leaders, the onset of
street riots, circulation of misinformation and extremely hostile
political engagements on social media.”

Driving this destabilization, according their new paper, “[Beyond
Populism](https://psyarxiv.com/puqzs),” is the feeling millions of
voters continue to have of being left behind, of “‘losing out’ in a
world marked by, on the one hand, traditional gender-and race-based
hierarchies, which limits the mobility of minority groups, and, on the
other hand, globalized competition, which puts a premium on human
capital” — especially on “learning capacity,” roughly measured by the
presence or absence of a college degree.

The crucial role of human capital is illustrated in a 2011 study
published in the American Economic Review, “Sources of Lifetime
Inequality,” by [Mark
Huggett](https://sites.google.com/georgetown.edu/mark-huggett/home),
[Gustavo Ventura](http://www.gustavoventura.com/index.html) and [Amir
Yaron](https://fnce.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/yarona/), economists at
Georgetown, Arizona State and the University of Pennsylvania.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The authors found that human capital, including learning skills,
accounted for “61.2, 62.4, and 66.0 percent of the variation in lifetime
earnings, lifetime wealth, and [lifetime
utility](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/26552/concepts/measuring-utility/)”
— a measure of life satisfaction.

Petersen and his colleagues found that those experiencing rising levels
of frustration are motivated to turn to the relative extremes of the
political spectrum reflecting “discontent with one’s own personal
standing.”

This phenomenon, they continue, is concentrated

> among individuals for whom prestige-based pathways to status are, at
> least in their own perception, unlikely to be successful. Despite
> their political differences, this perception may be the psychological
> commonality of, on the one hand, race- or gender-based grievance
> movements and, on the other hand, white lower-middle class right-wing
> voters.

The traditional avenue to standing in society — “tangible benefits
including income and job access” and “[intangible
benefits](https://books.google.com/books?id=GL80BQR6pk0C&q=taggible#v=snippet&q=intangible&f=false)
including cultural hegemony, prestige, authority and social space” —
requires the “human capital” I mentioned above, which what Petersen
described in an email as “the stock of skills and competencies that
allow people to produce economic value” that “involve the cultivation of
talents and skills that are valuable for others and, hence, based on a
reciprocal relationship wherein status is granted in exchange for
service.”

When inequality increases, the issue of status becomes sharper, and
“people will simultaneously feel that (a) it is important to get
status and (b) that it is very difficult to do so.” In such a situation,
at the extremes, “some people will feel that the use of fear and
intimidation is an attractive shortcut to getting recognition,” Petersen
wrote by email.

“It would be wrong to exclusively think of this as a right-wing
phenomenon. People on the extremes of both the left-wing and the
right-wing are likely to be high in dominance motivations,” Petersen
continued, adding that

> we should expect dominance to be a key motivational factor among
> people supporting or advocating the use of violence for political
> purposes. While such supporters may appeal to a number of higher-order
> ideological principles, a personal craving for status seems to be a
> key motivational factor according to our research.

The difficulty of rising up the economic ladder is reflected in the
decline in mobility in the United States. Research by [Raj
Chetty](http://www.rajchetty.com/) and colleagues has demonstrated that
the percentage of children who make more than their parents [has
fallen](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22910) from just over 90 percent
for those born in 1940 to 50 percent for those born in 1984. The
declines have been sharpest in the South and Midwest, as shown in the
accompanying map — in many of the areas that provided key support to
Donald Trump in 2016.

## Upward Mobility in the United States

One measure of a society’s success is the ability of its low-income
children to climb the economic ladder. This tends to happen less in
Southern states like Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama. This map
measures where children who grew up with low-income parents fall in the

In a 2019 paper, “[The College Wealth Divide: Education and Inequality
in
America, 1956-2016](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3421153),”
three German economists, [Alina
Bartscher](https://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/en/people/student-directory/2017/alina-bartscher),
[Moritz
Kuhn](https://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/en/people/faculty-directory/moritz-kuhn)
and Moritz Schularick, all of the University of Bonn, determined that in
the United States since the since the 1970s “the real income of
non-college households stagnated, while the real income of college
households has risen by around 50 percent.” The income data is, however,
dwarfed by the findings on wealth:

> While non-college households were treading water in terms of wealth,
> college households have increased their net worth by a factor of three
> compared to 1971.

The case made by Petersen and his collaborators that more Americans are
becoming marginalized gets strong support from [Noam
Gidron](https://en.politics.huji.ac.il/people/noam-gidron) and [Peter A.
Hall](https://scholar.harvard.edu/hall/home), political scientists at
Hebrew University and Harvard, in their paper, “[Populism as a Problem
of Social
Integration](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hall/files/gidronhallmay2018.pdf).”
They write:

> Our key contention is that populist politics reflects problems of
> social integration. That is to say, support for radical parties is
> likely to be especially high among people who feel they have been
> socially marginalized, i.e. deprived of the roles and respect normally
> accorded members of mainstream society. From this perspective, the
> sources of social marginalization may lie in economic or cultural
> developments and in how they combine.

Large segments of the population, they continue, have been

> “left behind” — relegated to vulnerable economic and social positions,
> increasingly alienated from the values prominent in elite discourse,
> and sensing that they are no longer recognized as valued members of
> society.

As a result, the authors argue, “subjective social status” — that is,
“people’s own beliefs about where they stand relative to others within
this status hierarchy” — has become a crucial factor in shaping
political commitments:

> There is a consistent association between levels of subjective social
> status and voting for parties of the populist right and radical left.
> The more socially marginalized people feel, the more likely they are
> to gravitate toward the fringes of the political spectrum.

Voters who feel a loss of standing, who experience themselves as
marginalized, often turn left or right — whites in this category may
turn to the right; African-American, Latino and other minority voters
can find that the left has more to offer.

“Changes in cultural frameworks,” the authors write, are

> leading people who hold traditional social attitudes to feel socially
> marginalized as a result of incongruence between their values and the
> discourse of mainstream elites. The growing prominence of cultural
> frameworks promoting gender equality, multiculturalism, secular values
> and LGBTQ rights is the most notable of such changes.

They go on:

> Steps toward inclusion are double-sided: they can lead people who hold
> more traditional values to feel marginalized vis-à-vis the
> main-currents of society.

Gidron and Hall observe that extensive research has shown

> that support for the far right is often strongest, not among people
> suffering the greatest economic distress, but among people who are
> somewhat better-off if still facing economic difficulties.

This constituency of voters “a few rungs up the socioeconomic ladder”
is, in turn,

> susceptible to “[last place
> aversion](https://www.nber.org/papers/w17234),” namely, a fear of
> falling even farther down it; and they often erect social boundaries
> separating ‘respectable’ people like themselves from others seen as
> lower down on that social ladder. Thus, the anti-immigrant and
> anti-ethnic appeals of populist right parties may be especially
> attractive to them, because they emphasize such boundaries.

Those drawn to the progressive left, in Gidron and Hall’s view, are
“voters with status concerns but universalistic values that incline
them against ethnonationalist appeals.” These voters “are more often
found among sociocultural professionals and people with higher levels of
education” and, because they have universalistic values, they are likely
to support “left parties” that “promise redistribution.”

Another major difference between voters who back left or right parties
is the kind of work they do. According to Gidron and Hall,

> There are stark differences in the occupational bases of support for
> the radical left and right. Left parties seem to have particular
> appeal for people in professional occupations who may nonetheless feel
> that they are not receiving the social respect they deserve. By
> contrast, radical right parties appeal most strongly to people in
> low-status occupations: manual workers and low-skill service
> employees.

What about socially marginalized voters who are conflicted — holding,
for example, conservative values on cultural, moral and racial issues,
but more liberal and pro-redistribution economic views? In these
circumstances, the right has the advantage.

In his 2016 dissertation at Harvard, “[Many Ways to be Right: The
Unbundling of European Mass Attitudes and Partisan Asymmetries across
the Ideological
Divide](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33493265/GIDRON-DISSERTATION-2016.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=4),”
Gidron reported that:

> Cross-pressured voters (those who are conservative on some issues but
> progressive on other issues) are more likely to support the right;
> while support for the left requires progressive attitudes on all
> issues, it is enough to be conservative on one issue to support the
> right.

Gidron continued:

> Put differently, the right is likely to attract all those who are
> conservative on some issues — and not only those who are conservative
> on all issues. Those who oppose state intervention in the economy,
> those who oppose progressive reforms on cultural questions such as
> gender norms, and those who oppose greater openness toward immigration

How many voters can be described as cross-pressured by conservative
cultural views and liberal economic views?

A [Voter Study Group
analysis](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/political-divisions-in-2016-and-beyond)
of the 2016 election by [Lee
Drutman](https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/lee-drutman/) found that
just under 30 percent of voters feel this way. In addition, Drutman’s
study provided support for Gidron’s view that these culturally
conservative and economically liberal voters lean decisively to the
right. Among the 24.3 percent of voters who fit this category and voted
for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, 75.2 percent cast ballots
for Trump and 24.8 percent for Clinton, a 3 to 1 split.

Reinforcing the work of Petersen, Gidron and their colleagues are the
findings of four political scientists, [Ariel
Malka](https://www.yu.edu/faculty/pages/malka-ariel), [Yphtach
Lelkes](https://www.ylelkes.com/), [Bert N.
Bakker](http://www.bertbakker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bakker_CV_Aug2015.pdf)
in [a
paper](https://malkaresearch.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/malka-lelkes-bakker-spivack-inpress-pop-2020-withfigures.pdf)
published in May.

The four argue that the focus on Democratic and Republican
identification masks another key divide between voters whose prime
concern is protection from adverse cultural and economic forces and
voters whose agenda is personal autonomy and economic freedom. They call
these two constituencies the “protection-based” and the “freedom based.”

The authors describe those with “a ‘protection-based’ attitude package”
as voters who combine “cultural conservatism with left economic
attitudes.” These voters prioritize “social order and economic
stability, which, in the minds of citizens, may be satisfied by
leadership and policy action that are unconstrained by democratic
rules.”

Malka and his co-authors elaborate:

> Citizens who combine a culturally conservative worldview with an
> economically redistributive and interventionist set of preferences
> often place high priority on security, certainty, and stability. These
> citizens seem to apply a mind-set to the political domain that
> attracts them to policies that maintain cultural tradition and
> uniformity (social conservatism) and that also entail top-down
> provision of material security (left-wing economic views). This type
> of worldview has been referred to as a ‘protection-based’ attitude
> package, because it involves strong government intervention to provide
> protection against cultural and economic sources of insecurity.

The protection-based constituency is, thus, made up of those who feel
under assault by liberal cultural trends and their challenges to
traditional morality and by economic forces that are shifting rewards to
those with higher levels of education and “[learning
skills](http://www.act.org/content/act/en/research/reports/act-publications/beyond-academics/core-academic-skills/core-academic-skills-framework.html).”

On the other side is “a freedom-based” attitude package that “combines
left-wing cultural with right-wing economic views, reflecting acceptance
of cultural and economic risk rooted in the value of freedom.” Malka and
his colleagues suggest that “Anglophone democracies are more likely to
associate free market economics with political freedom and democratic
liberalism” and note that

> citizens of English-speaking countries tend to score higher than
> citizens of other countries in self-report measures of individualism,
> which tap a focus on personal as opposed to collective goals,
> individual autonomy, self-differentiation, and competition.

In addition, the authors suggest that in these democracies,

> consistent support for procedural democratic rules is linked with a
> classically liberal mind-set focused on individual autonomy to pursue
> economic interests and cultural preferences without government
> interference.

Four years ago, Trump won by decisively carrying what Malka and his
colleagues call the protection-based constituency — voters whose
privileged status as white Americans Trump has promised to protect,
despite the implausibility of that promise in a world of increasing
racial and ethnic diversity.

These cultural conservatives are now “Trump’s to lose,” Malka said,
noting that “he cannot afford to lose many of these whose economic
attitudes are well to the left of the Republican Party’s.” During the
current crisis, Trump has addressed core economic anxieties of these
voters with legislation funneling an extra
[$600-a-week](https://fortune.com/2020/07/27/unemployment-600-extra-benefits-extension-cut-republican-plan-stimulus-package-bill-200-per-week-how-much-update/)
to the unemployed, a [$1,200
grant](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/03/19/white-house-may-send-out-1000-checks-to-adults-500-to-children/)

[moratorium](https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums) on evictions from
federally supported housing and [$350 billion for loans to small
businesses](https://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/cares_flow_chart_edit.pdf).
In this context, Malka wrote me, Trump’s “efforts to stoke cultural
conflict with authoritarian actions make sense from the standpoint of
keeping this group on his side, but it comes with other electoral
costs.”

Who Trump doesn’t have on his side are the millions of Black and Latino
voters frustrated by even greater economic hurdles than their white
counterparts, compounded by a history of segregation and discrimination.
These voters, an ever-growing share of the electorate, loom even larger
now than they did four years ago, and they are squarely in the
Democratic camp.

“It’s already clear that the 2020 electorate will be unique in several
ways. Nonwhites will account for a third of eligible voters — their
largest share ever — driven by long-term increases among certain groups,
especially Hispanics,” according to a [Pew Research
report](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/).
Trump, who is exceptionally dependent on white support, faces the
prospect of trying to win over an electorate in which the share of white
voters has fallen, over the past 20 years, from 76.4 percent to 66.6
percent.

Trump’s approval level, always low among Black and Hispanic voters, has
plummeted as he has sharpened his ever-present appeals to bigotry. In
the first months of 2020, 16 percent of African-Americans approved of
Trump, [according to
Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/313454/trump-job-approval-rating-steady-lower-level.aspx).
In the period from late May to June, that fell to 10 percent. Among
Hispanics, Trump’s approval over the same period fell from 34 to 26
percent.

For Trump, this is his 2020 dilemma: As of July 28, Covid-19 cases
reached 16.3 million worldwide, with 4.3 million in the United States
Total deaths have reached 650,805, 147,672 of them in this country,
according to the [World Health
Organization](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200727-covid-19-sitrep-189.pdf?sfvrsn=b93a6913_2)
and the [Centers for Disease
Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html)
and Prevention. According to Politico, a mere third of Americans (32
percent) say they support Trump’s handling of the pandemic.

Trump [pointedly
declined](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/27/trump-says-he-wont-pay-respects-john-lewis-he-lies-state/5520694002/)

on Monday. He

the number of [federal

in Portland as he attempted to confront Black Lives Matter protests he
described as “anarchy.”

Trump is trapped between pressures: to keep feeding red meat to the
white working and middle class voters who continue to support him while
struggling to slow the defection of white, well-educated suburbanites
who delivered 42 House seats to the Democrats in 2018 and who now
threaten to restore Democratic rule across the board.

Facing these cross-pressures, Trump has clearly staked out where his
allegiance lies: with conservative white America.

At a time when even the state of Mississippi is removing Confederate
emblems from its state flag, Trump told Chris Wallace ten days ago on
[Fox News
Sunday](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/transcript-fox-news-sunday-interview-with-president-trump):

> When people proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking
> about racism. They love their flag, it represents the South, they like
> the South. People right now like the South. I’d say it’s freedom of,
> of, of many things, but it’s freedom of speech.

Asked about changing the names of military installations currently
honoring Confederate generals — a proposal that has support from the
Armed Forces and some Republicans in Congress — Trump replied:

> Excuse me, excuse me. I don’t care what the military says. I’m
> supposed to make the decision …. We’re going to name it after the
> Reverend Al Sharpton?

Trump knows where he is going. The question is whether enough of the
electorate will follow.
