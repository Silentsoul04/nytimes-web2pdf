A national campaign to encourage mask wearing, including the
distribution of free masks, would help to check the pandemic.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont introduced
\href{https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-leads-14-senators-in-introducing-masks-for-all-act-to-curb-deadly-coronavirus-surge}{legislation}
this week that directs the Trump administration to send three
``high-quality, reusable'' masks to every person in the United States,
and would provide \$5 billion to increase mask production. This is a
good idea.

Wearing masks saves lives, and not just other people's lives. There's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/coronavirus-mask-protection.html?searchResultPosition=4}{evidence}
that it limits the chances of catching the coronavirus. Wearing a mask
might save your life, too.

Sending masks to every American won't convince them all to wear a mask.
It is not a corrective for the behavior of Representative Louie Gohmert,
Republican of Texas, who has
\href{https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/07/29/texas-louie-gohmert-positive-covid-19-raju-nr-vpx.cnn}{flaunted}
his refusal to wear a mask, and who said Wednesday that he had tested
positive for the coronavirus. But distributing high-quality masks would
provide Americans inclined to behave responsibly with masks that
maximize health benefits.

And it would make it easier for those with doubts about masks to slip
one on.

The legislation also directs the Trump administration to ensure that
medical workers have a sufficient supply of the most effective
protective masks, known as N95 masks.

It's unfortunate that the Trump administration requires this kind of
prodding. Ramping up of the domestic production of protective gear
should have been an urgent national priority months ago. Instead,
Americans have endured a familiar mix of bluster, denials and half
measures.

The virus continues to spread freely here, even as other nations have
brought it under control.

A national campaign to encourage people to wear masks, including the
distribution of free masks, is not sufficient to confront the pandemic.
The United States needs to remedy a parallel failure to construct
adequate testing infrastructure, and rules need to be followed.

But masks would help. Right now, Americans need all the help they can
get.
