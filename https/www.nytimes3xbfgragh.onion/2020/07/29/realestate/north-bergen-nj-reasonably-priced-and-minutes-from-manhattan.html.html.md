In 1975, Calvin Trillin wrote in The New Yorker magazine about “the
half-dozen cities in northern Hudson County that are, except for some
arbitrary and invisible lines drawn every mile or so, one mass of
blue-collar sprawl running along the Hudson, just across from midtown
Manhattan.”

North Bergen, N.J., sits at the top of that urban cluster, but times
have changed. Today, Mr. Trillin’s “sprawl” is better known as the New
Jersey Gold Coast: the riverfront communities that extend from Bayonne
north to the George Washington Bridge, sprouting expensive luxury
buildings that eat the Manhattan views with a
spoon.

North Bergen could be accused of lacking definition. The
five-square-mile township with about 62,000 residents has irregular
boundaries that bend around neighbors; it is sometimes hard to know
exactly when you are there. But its supporters single it out as a
reasonably priced community minutes from Manhattan, with an increasingly
young, culturally diverse population.

Lakshay Bhatia, 38, a technology consultant, discovered North Bergen
eight years ago when he and his wife, Neetika, set off from their
Englewood, N.J., rental on the Fourth of July to see the fireworks in
Hoboken. The roads were blocked, and the couple found themselves on John
F. Kennedy Boulevard East, known locally as Boulevard East, with
startling views of the New York skyline.

“Oh, wow,” Mr. Bhatia recalled thinking.

The Bhatias, who are from India, decided that Boulevard East was their
future. They eventually paid $470,000 for a two-family house three
blocks away and live with their 3-year-old daughter on the lower floor,
renting the upstairs duplex.

Commuting to Manhattan before the pandemic, Ms. Bhatia, 38, a textile
designer, boarded the buses that streamed down Boulevard East each
morning. Now the Bhatias work from home and de-stress in their backyard,
or in James J. Braddock Park, a 167-acre sward three blocks away with a
16-acre lake and 45 athletic facilities (tracks, courts, swings, et
cetera).

“Affordability is a key for North Bergen,” said Frances Rosado, a real
estate agent with Keller Williams, who grew up in Hudson County. Born in
Cuba, she was part of the diaspora that turned the area into what was
once described as “Havana on the Hudson.” The Hispanic population, which
makes up 71 percent of North Bergen, has since diversified.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If you’re priced out of Jersey City, Hoboken or Weehawken, you can still
buy something in the township, Ms. Rosado said. Single-family houses
start in the low $300,000s.

There are luxury options, too, like the Duchess, a three-year-old
apartment complex near the Hudson with 320 units in a trio of
interconnected 12-story towers. The amenities include a heated outdoor
pool that was recently reopened, a fitness area and a dog park.

Narcis Versteeg, 30, an Afghani-born lactation nurse, and her husband,
Erik Versteeg, 33, a Dutch-born investment banker, moved to the Duchess
in September. They chose it, Ms. Versteeg said, because the units are
much bigger than their previous residence in Long Island City (before
that, they lived in Amsterdam), “and there is more nature around.”

Their rental costs $4,500 a month for two bedrooms, two and a half
bathrooms, two walk-in closets and Manhattan views. Outdoor parking for
the couple’s new car is $125 a month, and the pet fee for their
bernedoodle puppy, Ola, is $50 a month. Michael Pestronk, the Duchess’s
developer, said the building stakes out a middle ground between urban
convenience and suburban expansiveness, and is close to 90 percent
occupied. The website currently offers two free months’ rent for new
leases on select
apartments.

## What You’ll Find

North Bergen is the northernmost municipality in Hudson County. Shaped
like a letter “L” that has been turned upside down, it has a
proportionally short section of riverfront, much of it taken up by the
Hackensack Meridian Health Palisades medical complex. (It also shares a
1.5-acre waterfront park with neighboring Guttenberg.) The stem of the
“L” is sandwiched between Guttenberg, West New York and Union City to
the east, and the Meadowlands, Secaucus and Kearny to the west. Bergen
County is north and Jersey City south.

What North Bergen lacks in shoreline it makes up for in dramatic
topography. Built on the Palisades clifftops, it has many east-west
streets with precarious slopes and single-family houses tightly packed
along the sides.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

North-south arteries — principally Tonnelle Avenue, John F. Kennedy
Boulevard, Bergenline Avenue and River Road — bind North Bergen to its
neighbors and broadcast the region’s ethnic character.

Bergenline Avenue, the main commercial stretch, is dominated by
businesses run by Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Ecuadoreans,
Salvadorans, Colombians, Peruvians, Hondurans, Cubans and their progeny.
Recent reconfigurations have provided more room on the avenue for
parking.

But pizzerias, a vestige of the decades when North Bergen was largely
Italian, give taquerias a run for their money here. Popular examples
include Roma on John F. Kennedy Boulevard and Gandolfo on Bergenline.

Neighborhoods are as diverse as the landscape. In addition to the high-
and low-rise condos and apartment buildings near the waterfront, there
is the Racetrack district, between Bergenline Avenue and John F. Kennedy
Boulevard, named for a notorious 19th-century gambling attraction that
evolved into an amusement park. This area borders the west side of
Braddock Park and takes in the high school, the public library and the
vintage White Castle on Kennedy Boulevard.

Woodcliff, on the south side of the park, between Boulevard East and
Bergenline, is prized for its access to recreation and public
transportation.

Bergenwood lies between John F. Kennedy Boulevard and Tonnelle Avenue
and has especially steep
grades.

## What You’ll Pay

Real estate agents say the housing supply is tight for home buyers but
abundant for renters, who compose about 60 percent of the market.
Ricardo Garcia, an agent with Re/Max Villa in North Bergen, said that
many commuters who rent but have no certain timeline for returning to
their offices are moving to less dense regions to work from home. (As of
July 27, [Hudson
County](https://hudson-county-coronavirus-resources-hudsoncogis.hub.arcgis.com/)
had 19,928 reported Covid-19 cases and 1,380 deaths.) According to
Zillow, the median rent in North Bergen is $1,990.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Data from the real estate brokerage Redfin shows that the average home
sale price in June declined 15.3 percent over the previous year, to
$360,000. The average time on the market was 94 days.

As of July 28, 159 residential properties were listed for sale, ranging
from a 435-square-foot studio co-op on Boulevard East for $115,000, with
a monthly homeowner’s fee of $694, including taxes, to a four-family
building on Grand Avenue for $1.2 million, with taxes of
$14,286.

## The Vibe

Steven Barrera, 40, a chauffeur-relations manager at EmpireCLS, has been
living in North Bergen since he was 7. What makes the township special,
he said, is its diversity and sense of community.

Oh yes, and the setting. “We’re on Boulevard East, facing New York
City,” he said of his two-bedroom apartment, for which he pays $2,200
a month. “The view that I have, I wish I could show
you.”

## The Schools

The North Bergen School District has six elementary schools that extend
from prekindergarten, kindergarten or first grade through eighth grade,
and one high school. Together, they enroll about 7,660 students.

On 2019 state tests, 24 percent of the students met standards in math,
versus 41 percent statewide; 44 percent met standards in English
language arts, versus 53 percent statewide.

The average 2019 SAT scores at North Bergen High School, which serves
about 2,260 students, were 482 in math and 495 in reading and writing.

In 2018, High Tech High School, a magnet school in North Bergen, moved
to Secaucus, N.J. There are plans to develop the old campus into a
middle school for seventh through ninth grades and to renovate North
Bergen High School’s overcrowded building for grades 10 through 12. As
of February, the $65 million project was scheduled to be completed in
September
2022.

## The History

In 1949, a 760-foot steel transmission tower was erected in the
residential neighborhood of Woodcliff for WWOR-TV, channel 9 — at the
time,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>It was one of the tallest
man-made structures in the world. Residents were not happy, particularly
when it began to shed ice “that hurtled to the street for blocks in the
area,” according to The Jersey Journal. After a twin-engine plane hit
the tower in 1956, resulting in six deaths, it was dismantled.
