# Bahrain Buys Into Paris F.C., With Plans to Use It as a Billboard

</div>

The kingdom‚Äôs investment has made it the latest Gulf country to try to
improve its nation‚Äôs image by attaching it to a European soccer club.

For years, soccer in Paris has been the hub of Qatar‚Äôs global ambitions.
Through its ownership of the city‚Äôs biggest team, Paris St.-Germain,
Qatar has dreamed big, spent big and won big. In doing so, the country
has also used the sport‚Äôs popularity to enhance its profile on the world
stage.

It may soon have some competition.

On Monday, a second Gulf dynasty entered the city‚Äôs soccer scene. Paris
F.C., a team that plays in France‚Äôs second tier, announced that the
Kingdom of Bahrain had bought a minority stake in the club.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The purchase price and the investors‚Äô ambitions appear, for now, to be
more modest than Qatar‚Äôs cash-soaked efforts, which have turned P.S.G.
into a perennial French champion and one of Europe‚Äôs most formidable
teams. But Paris F.C.‚Äôs immediate goal is clear: to reach France‚Äôs top
division, Ligue 1, in the next three years and to lift its women‚Äôs side
‚Äúas high as possible‚Äù in the top tier.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Team officials also left little doubt about Bahrain‚Äôs goal: As at
P.S.G., the owners hope the soccer team [will act as a billboard for the
Gulf
state](https://parisfc.fr/a-la-une-paris-fc/communique-officiel-6/), and
attract tourists to a nation that is still reeling from the reputational
damage it sustained when the country‚Äôs monarchy put down pro-democracy
uprisings [during the height of the Arab
Spring](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/03/18/world/middleeast/18youth.html).

‚ÄúI think they saw a fantastic opportunity for investment, and Paris F.C.
is a good tool of communication to promote the country,‚Äù Fabrice
Herrault, the director general of the team, said in an interview. As
part of the agreement in which Bahrain‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund took a 20
percent stake in the club, Paris F.C. will, starting next season, have
the words ‚ÄúExplore Bahrain‚Äù emblazoned on its uniforms.

The National Communication Centre in Bahrain did not respond to requests
for comment, sent through its embassy in the United Kingdom, about the
kingdom‚Äôs investment in Paris F.C. or about claims by multiple groups
and even its citizens that it has engaged in human rights abuses in
crushing antigovernment protests.

By investing in soccer, Bahrain is following its Gulf neighbors down a
well-trodden path. Qatar has owned P.S.G. since 2011, and the
billionaire brother of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates has spent
lavishly to assemble one of the best teams in the world at Manchester
City in England. [A Saudi Arabian prince
owns](https://www.sufc.co.uk/news/2019/october/key-personnel/) another
Premier League club, Sheffield United, and that kingdom‚Äôs [sovereign
wealth fund has bid to buy a
third](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/sports/premier-league-saudi-arabia.html),
Newcastle United. Gulf owners also control teams in
[Spain](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-saudi-power-broker-of-spanish-soccers-second-division-11595851200)
and
[Belgium](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/07/16/sports/worldcup/a-qatari-soccer-program-looking-to-rise-buys-a-foothold-in-europe.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Those direct investments, and related ones over [the pirating of
television rights controlled by Qatar‚Äôs beIN Media
Group](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/09/sports/bein-sports-qatar-beoutq.html),
have at times made European soccer a battleground in the diplomatic war
between Qatar and several of its neighbors, [including Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/sports/soccer/saudi-arabia-qatar-beIN-premier-league.html).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

‚ÄúThey join us for many objectives ‚Äî mainly to help them to spread the
image of Bahrain in France and Europe,‚Äù Herrault said.

That image has yet to recover since the 2011 uprisings by members of the
country‚Äôs Shiite Muslim majority against the Sunni Muslim ruling family.
To put it down, the authorities were accused of torturing hundreds of
people taken into custody during the crackdown, among them protest
leaders but also professionals, like doctors and athletes, who had
sympathized with the demonstrators. The country‚Äôs action even became an
issue for FIFA, world soccer‚Äôs governing body, when a powerful official
from Bahrain [ran for the organization‚Äôs
presidency](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/25/sports/soccer/sheikhs-candidacy-opens-new-door-to-criticism-of-fifa-human-rights.html)
in 2016.

In 2019, the fate of the former national team player [Hakeem
al-Araibi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/11/world/asia/thailand-soccer-hakeem-al-araibi.html)
drew global headlines when Bahrain attempted to have him extradited from
Thailand, where he had been detained [while on his
honeymoon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/06/world/asia/bahrain-thailand-asylum-fifa.html).
Araibi had fled to Australia after the Arab Spring protests but was
jailed, at Bahrain‚Äôs urging, when he arrived in Thailand; he was
eventually released and returned to Australia only [after an
international
outcry](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/06/world/asia/bahrain-thailand-asylum-fifa.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bahrain, a key ally of the United States in the Persian Gulf, had
pledged to carry out reforms in the wake of the violence, but since
then, most of the country‚Äôs leading dissidents have been forced into
exile or sent to prisons where, [human rights groups
say](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/11/23/world/middleeast/abuse-by-bahrain-forces-continues-despite-kings-pledge-rights-group-says.html),
torture and other abuse are common.

‚ÄúMy first thought was this is another attempt by Bahrain to whitewash
its horrific rights record and another way of buying influence in
Europe,‚Äù said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of advocacy for the
Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Alwadaei was jailed after taking part in pro-democracy protests and fled
to the United Kingdom after his release. Bahraini authorities revoked
his citizenship in 2015.

Herrault, the Paris F.C. executive, declined to discuss the allegations
of human rights abuses.

The soccer investment is not Bahrain‚Äôs first foray into international
sports. The country has hosted 15 Formula One Grand Prix races, the
first in 2004, and has a professional cycling team that competes in the
Tour de France. It has also naturalized some elite foreign athletes,
notably middle-distance runners from Africa, to compete in its colors at
Olympic Games and world championships. Campaign groups like Amnesty
International have long argued that these actions were designed to
change public opinion of Bahrain.

In Paris F.C., Bahrain has invested in a team with a curious history.
The club was born in 1969 before splitting in two three years later,
with the other half becoming Paris St.-Germain. Paris F.C. languished in
the amateur ranks for years until the owner Pierre Ferracci, a
businessman with close links to President Emmanuel Macron of France,
oversaw its most recent rise through the professional
ranks.

Ferracci‚Äôs plan, now buttressed by Bahrain‚Äôs millions, is to establish
the team as one of the best proving grounds in France and beyond. Half
of all domestic players in France‚Äôs top two divisions come from the
Paris region, as did [a third of France‚Äôs 2018 World Cup-winning
team](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/07/sports/soccer/france-world-cup-kylian-mbappe.html#:~:text=Of%20the%2023%20players%20whom,Presnel%20Kimpembe%20and%20Steven%20Nzonzi.).
But until two years ago, when Paris F.C. received a coveted license to
run an academy, P.S.G. had the only accredited youth development program
in the region.

‚ÄúThis region is like a gold mine,‚Äù Herrault said, though he added that
the club was not looking to rival P.S.G., which he described as ‚Äúan
ocean away.‚Äù

While P. S.G. has spent heavily on established stars like [the Brazilian
Neymar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/26/sports/soccer/at-psg-price-for-neymar-and-elusive-success-might-be-worth-it.html),
the Paris-born Kylian Mbapp√© and others, Paris F.C.‚Äôs means mean it will
have to temper its aspirations, even as it announced that the new
investment would allow it to increase its budget by 30 percent.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

‚ÄúOur objective is not to win the Champions League,‚Äù Herrault said. ‚ÄúIt
is to be promoted to Ligue 1 and stay there for many, many years and to
