# A Food Writer’s Sicilian Pasta Dish — and Tips for Sharing It

</div>

Skye McAlpine has made a name for herself serving bountiful meals to
large groups of friends. During lockdown, she’s discovered the joy of
cooking for just one or two.

*In “*[*One Good
Meal*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/one-good-meal)*,” we
ask cooking-inclined creative people to share the story behind a
favorite dish they actually make and eat at home on a regular basis —
and not just when they’re trying to impress.*

Over the last few years, the British food writer and chef [Skye
McAlpine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/02/dining/table-in-venice-book-skye-mcalpine.html)
has built a loyal following with her unfussy dishes, inspired by her
upbringing in both England and Italy, which she serves in big,
mismatched platters at lively gatherings of friends. Or, as she puts it
in her new book, “A Table for Friends,” “The kind of food you can plonk
down in the center of the table for everyone to tuck into, towering
platefuls of it.”

But then the pandemic hit and McAlpine found herself in quarantine in
London with **** far fewer people to cook for. While she wasn’t
entertaining, though, making and presenting food remained a reliable
source of solace. “Feeding people is such a great way of showing love
and care and putting happy energy out in the world,” says McAlpine, who
still had her husband and two young sons for company. “And it’s
obviously great to be able to do that for 20, but it’s equally great to
do that for supper for two. And, particularly in this period of
lockdown, it’s even more important to show love and care for yourself.”
With more time to prepare meals, she tried to give each one a sense of
occasion, setting out “proper napkins” (as she describes any made from
cloth) and pulling out the eccentric china that she has collected over
the years from vintage stores, flea markets and eBay.

Among the dishes she’s cooked most often is pasta chi vruocculi
arriminati, which a Sicilian friend had claimed for years was the “best
pasta dish” — but which she had never tried herself until she and her
husband made it last year. “We haven’t turned back,” she says with a
laugh. “The trick is to use the same pan to cook both your cauliflower
and your pasta,” McAlpine says, “which imbues the pasta with extra
flavor and also saves on time washing up.” And while you can make it
with romanesco instead of cauliflower or use a different pasta in place
of linguine, “My one insistence,” she says, “is that you not skip the
bread crumbs at the end — deliciously crisp, salty and golden, they’re
just what the almost-sweet sauce needs.” Below is McAlpine’s version of
the recipe, as well as her tips for styling and presenting your food —
even if you’re sharing it with friends on Instagram, rather than in real
life.

### **Skye McAlpine’s** Pasta chi Vruocculi Arriminati

*Serves 4*

  - 1 whole cauliflower (roughly chopped into florets)

<!-- end list -->

  - 2 ½ ounces pine nuts

<!-- end list -->

  - 3 ounces stale bread

<!-- end list -->

  - 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra to serve

<!-- end list -->

  - 1 onion, chopped

<!-- end list -->

  - 8 anchovy fillets

<!-- end list -->

  - 2 ½ ounces raisins

<!-- end list -->

  - 1 teaspoon saffron strands

<!-- end list -->

  - 14 ounces linguine

1\. Bring a large saucepan of generously salted water to boil. Add the
cauliflower florets to the water and turn the heat down to a gentle
simmer. Cook for 15-20 minutes, until the cauliflower can easily be cut
through with a butter knife.

2\. While the cauliflower is cooking, toast the pine nuts in a
medium-size frying pan for 2-3 minutes over medium heat, giving the pan
an occasional shake, until they are golden brown. Set aside.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

3\. Tear the bread into chunks and blend in a food processor to make
coarse crumbs. Using the same pan you cooked the pine nuts in, heat 1
tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat and add the bread crumbs. Fry
gently, shaking the pan occasionally, for 4-5 minutes until they turn
crisp and golden, then take off the heat and set aside.

4\. In a second, large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over
medium heat, add the onion and a generous pinch of salt. Cook for 3-5
minutes, until the onion becomes soft and translucent. Add the anchovies
to the pan, and fry gently until they melt into the onions. Then add the
raisins and the toasted pine nuts. Stir and turn the heat to a simmer.

5\. Use a pestle and mortar to grind the saffron and a pinch of salt
into a fine red powder. Scoop out a splash (roughly 1-2 tablespoons) of
the cooking water into a small cup; add the powdered saffron and set to
one side to infuse for a few minutes.

6\. When the cauliflower is cooked, use a slotted spoon to scoop the
florets out of the water and toss them into the pan with the onion mix.
Save the cooking water. Pour the saffron-infused liquid over the
cauliflower, and stir, breaking up any large pieces of cauliflower with
a wooden spoon. Season with salt to taste.

7\. Cook the pasta in the same water as the cauliflower (top it up with
fresh water if needed) until al dente*,* as per the instructions on the
packet.

8\. When the pasta is cooked, scoop out half a cup of the cooking water
and set aside. Drain the pasta and toss it into the pan with the sauce
and the reserved cooking water, and stir together so the pasta is coated
in sauce.

9\. Spoon the pasta chi vruocculi arriminati onto a large serving dish,

### **Styling Tips**

*The pandemic has inspired even the most reluctant among us to become
home cooks — and document our efforts on Instagram. McAlpine, who
photographed all the images in her new book, offers tips to make your
food look camera-ready.*

**Don’t Be Afraid of Portrait Mode**

To take a strong food photograph, McAlpine suggests either a colorful
tablecloth (like the [checked linen canvas style shown
above](https://theedition94.com/collections/just-in/products/canvas-mimi-vichy-table-cloth-large-145-x-350))
or a clean wooden or stone surface as a backdrop. “I love to use
portrait mode on my iPhone (and ignore it when it says I’m too far or
too close to the subject),” she says, which creates a sharper, more
professional look. She also advises that you take the photo with your
phone **** held parallel or at a 45-degree angle to the table. And she’s
not afraid to stand on a chair to capture a bird’s-eye view.

**Go Wild With Plates**

“A pretty plate goes a long way toward making even the plainest food
look beautiful,” McAlpine says. “Painted, colored, plain, vintage … what
works best on the table is really only a matter of taste.” (As if to
prove the point, she recently released a [collection of
tableware](https://www.anthropologie.com/brands/skye-mcalpine) with
Anthropologie that looks like the kind of well-loved stuff you
grandmother might have passed down to you.) Try using platters and
serving bowls in mismatched colors and patterns and, if you have one, a
cake stand can be surprisingly versatile (use it for sweets but also
quiches and tarts). The key, she says, is to “mix heights, shapes and
textures wherever you can to create a bustling and abundant table — and
have fun with
it.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Think of Your Plate as a Canvas**

When considering what to serve or photograph, McAlpine always takes the
palette of her food **** into account. “Color and texture, along with
taste, *create* flavor,” she writes in “A Table for Friends.” “However
comforting and brown a meal might be — and brown food tends to be the
most comforting of all — it will always taste (and look) best when
paired with a pop of something fresh.” She recommends offsetting the
warm yellows of pasta chi vruocculi arriminati, for example, with a
crisp green salad in the summer or a side of striking purple radicchio
in the fall. And she tries to avoid serving similarly colored dishes
together. Roast pork with a red tomato salad, she warns, “feels a bit
clashy.”

**Find a Window**

“Take photos in natural light,” McAlpine advises. “Food just looks
better that way. Otherwise it can take on a slightly yellow tinge.” Once
you’re near a window or other natural light source, the most important
thing is not to overthink it. “Keep things relaxed, simple and genuine,”
says McAlpine. “If it’s a beautiful moment in real life, that will shine
through on camera, too.”
