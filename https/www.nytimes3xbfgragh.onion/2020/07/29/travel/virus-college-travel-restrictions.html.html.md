# The New College Drop-Off

A bittersweet family tradition has become an exercise in risk

Maureen Rayhill of Seattle sounds like a public health official as she
describes the current process for coronavirus testing, rattling off
research she’s done on in-person testing centers versus mail-order
companies and how their turnaround times for results compare. But she’s
not. She’s a mother, just trying to get her oldest child to college.

The poignant annual tradition of college drop-off — parents driving the
new, nervous college student to school, bringing along brothers and
sisters to see their sibling’s new home, setting up the tiny dorm room
together, sharing one last meal with the entire family, then waving
goodbye as the almost-adult runs off with a big pack of possible new
best friends — has become the latest family milestone rendered almost
unrecognizable by the coronavirus pandemic.

Ms. Rayhill, 49, has already canceled the family vacation in Maine that
she had dreamed of taking before bringing Corrigan to Colby College in
Waterville next month. Instead, the retired nurse and homemaker is
frantically caught up with how to get a virus test done within 72 hours
of departure to meet the Maine state requirements, when current test
results are taking up to five days to be returned.

“It’s nothing like what we thought it would be,” she says.

The drop-off has always been a momentous trip, fraught with strong
emotions felt by parents and children alike. Now pile on the additional
stress of Covid-19. Families need to navigate how to best get to campus
while minimizing their exposure to the virus, all while trying to adhere
to changing and often confusing school and state health, safety and
travel rules.

“When we dropped off my son three years ago, the whole family went and
it was this bittersweet fun event for us all,” said Mark Lorence of
Needham, Mass., as he recalled the first trip to leave his oldest son,
Matthew, at New York University. This fall will likely see Mr. Lorence,
58, driving down to New York, with masks and food from home, and back
again in one day. “Now we have Plan A, B and C, depending on what’s
going on.”

Randy Dunbar, a father trying to coordinate the cross-country trip for
his daughter, Alex, from Colorado to North Carolina, echoed the
sentiment.

“It’s supposed to be a time to contemplate this great goodbye,” he said.
“But I’m thinking, ‘Where am I allowed to
park?’”

## Logistics at the state, college and personal level

Complications and confusion come way before those campus gates. Nearly
half of the country’s states currently have [statewide travel
restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/travel/state-travel-restrictions.html),
with various degrees of self-quarantines orders — encouraged, strongly
encouraged, mandatory — not to mention suggested or required testing.
Some counties, metro areas or municipalities have issued their own rules
for travelers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New York is one of many states with extremely strict travel policies,
requiring anyone traveling from Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., and [34
other
states](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory) —
those with high infection rates — to self-quarantine for 14
days.

Jennifer Overholt of Menlo Park, Calif., 56, said she paged through
screen after screen of quarantine-related comments and questions on a
Facebook page for parents of students attending Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in Troy, N.Y., where her son, Cole Mediratta, will go for his
sophomore year.

“There’s worry and concern,” said Ms. Overholt, a nonprofit executive.
First-year parents, who already had questions, like whether rice cookers
are allowed in dorm rooms, are now wondering where their child will be
quarantined if they test positive for the virus.

Two questions about travel bubbled up again and again. Does a 14-day
quarantine mean that if you arrive in New York, you have to stay for 14
days? (No, [you can leave anytime, but must quarantine the whole time
you are in the
state](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/06/interimguidance_traveladvisory.pdf).)
Do you have to quarantine if your home state is not on the restricted
list, but you drive through a hot zone state on the way to New York?
([Not](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/06/interimguidance_traveladvisory.pdf)
[as long as you spent fewer than 24 hours in hot zone
states](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/06/interimguidance_traveladvisory.pdf).)

“It was kind of overwhelming, so I stopped looking,” she said.

Parents are discovering that, regardless of what guidelines are posted,
policies are changing with new data and little notice almost daily.
Washington, D.C., home to around 20 colleges and universities, announced
last Friday that beginning this Monday, travelers coming into the city
from a high-risk area need to self-quarantine for 14 days. This group
includes students. The only silver lining: [Travel that brings people
into the area for less than 24 hours is
allowed](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/mayor%E2%80%99s-order-2020-081-requirement-self-quarantine-after-non-essential-travel-during-covid-19),
so parents can drop-off students. No lingering.

The area’s schools are now determining how to comply. The order is so
new and has such broad implications that colleges did not immediately
specify how they would respond. A spokeswoman at Georgetown University,
Ruth McBain, wrote in an email that officials were reviewing the new
order and would ensure that the schools reopening plan would comply with
the district’s guidance.

But families across the country are waiting for details to be finalized.

Mr. Dunbar, a management consultant who will be taking his daughter from
their home in Boulder, Colo., to the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill, said he’s already had to change their flights three times
as Alex’s move-in dates shifted. His wife, Shawna, he said, spends about
an hour a day scanning the school’s website for new information and
comparing plans with friends who are also sending offspring to college.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They are laser-focused on the latest updates from other schools, Mr.
Dunbar, 57, said, “because it seems like when one rolls out a new
policy, others follow it.”

Other parents may have their offspring around the house a bit longer.

Mr. Lorence, the management consultant from Needham, Mass., expected to
drop off Matthew at New York University in August. But just last week
Matthew decided to stay home until October. His classes are all online,
and his musical performance was canceled. He thinks a later move-in
would perhaps help him snag an apartment with reduced rent.

Meanwhile, the Lorences’ oldest daughter, Audrey, will be a first-year
student at University of Pittsburgh. For her drop-off in mid-August, the
entire family (Mark, his wife, Jean, and younger siblings Meredith and
Luke) wanted to go along for the ride. Now it will only be the parents,
and they struggled on whether to stay with family in town — grandparents
or an uncle’s family usually host them. This year, they decided to stay
in a hotel.

“Uncertainty is the word to describe it,” Mr. Lorence said.

## To fly or drive

Other families are deciding to fly or drive. Sure, air circulation on
planes is excellent, and the journey should be shorter, but it’s hard to
know [how full the flight will
be](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/travel/crowded-flights-coronavirus.html)
or if flight attendants will be enforcing mask-wearing. There are also
[fewer nonstop flights between smaller
cities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/travel/coronavirus-regional-airports-cancellations.html),
fewer flights period, and airlines have been frequently changing times
and dates of flights to optimize revenues. All these headaches from the
air need to be weighed against a drive that might require hours in the
car, food stops and a hotel stay.

The Feder-Johnson family of Madison, Wis., typically flies to New
Orleans each school year, to drop off their daughter, Nora, at Tulane
University. This year, mother, father and daughter are driving the 14
hours each way. At restroom and fuel stops, Nora’s mother, Elizabeth
Feder, a public health researcher, will be looking to see if the people
around her are taking the necessary precautions.

“If we pull into a gas station and the people there aren’t wearing
masks, we’ll go on by to the next one,” Dr. Feder, 62, said.

Louisiana has had more than [100,000 Covid
cases](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2Finteractive%2F2020%2Fus%2Flouisiana-coronavirus-cases.html&data=02%7C01%7C%7Cf98faf91db4c457cd27e08d82cdc651d%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637308672381698693&sdata=VRikgzNv7F%2B0pyPzti%2FBaZGxDJK0RPTBOb7Ya7c7ssM%3D&reserved=0)
(including a significant increase in July), so when they arrive in New
Orleans, instead of exploring the sights, hearing live music and eating
at favorite restaurants as they did in years past, the family plans to
eat takeout and make “essential trips only” to help Nora set up her
home. Household items will be ordered online and picked up curbside.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Finding a hotel for their short stay has been a worry. “The websites of
the national chains make the cleaning sound so thorough you could do
surgery in their rooms,” Ms. Feder said, but it’s hard to know what a
particular property is doing.

Even packing for the college student is different this year. With
concerns that the virus may flare on campus and cause the school to shut
down, Gina Anstey, 48, is sending her daughter Elise from Seattle to her
first year at Fordham University in New York City with just two large
suitcases, eschewing everything but the
essentials.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“They might decide on a dime, ‘you gotta go’ and she’ll have to take it
all home again,” said Ms. Anstey, a philanthropic consultant.

For some students, that heartbreaking scenario became real before they
even arrived. On July 20, Spelman College in Atlanta made the decision
to [move instruction
online](https://www.spelman.edu/academics/path-forward-2020-21). Just
three weeks earlier the school had announced a plan to welcome students
back to campus, but in that short period, the health crisis worsened.
Other schools, from Occidental College in California to Lafayette
College in Pennsylvania, are following suit to help ensure the safety of
their students and faculty.

## Get in, get settled, get out

Once on campus, forget the once-common niceties like parent orientations
and let’s-get-to-know-you coffees. No more chitchat with your child’s
new roommate and their family, or meanderings around campus to check out
the new science lab.

The 19-page move-in guide issued by the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill this year asks families to “leave as soon as is possible
once all student belongings have been brought to their rooms.” Like many
other schools, it also has limits on how many helpers can enter the dorm
and asks families to [share the elevator with their own move-in
group](https://housing.unc.edu/sites/housing.unc.edu/files/Move-In%20Guide%2020-21.pdf)
only.

Stores and restaurants, used to welcoming the influx of back-to-school
families, are under new rules as well. North Carolina restaurants are
under [orders to separate tables of diners by six feet and to operate at
no more than 50 percent
capacity](https://files.nc.gov/covid/documents/guidance/NCDHHS-Interim-Guidance-for-Restaurants-Phase-2.pdf).
Mr. Dunbar and Alex have decided not to dine anywhere indoors, and were
relieved to learn that their favorite fried chicken on biscuits from
Time Out in Chapel Hill was available for takeout.

The two are avoiding going inside stores as well by ordering dorm
essentials to be shipped to a friend’s house in town where they will
pick them up. “There’s an overwhelming focus on logistics,” Mr. Dunbar
said.

## Get tested

Students who arrive on campus should expect a heightened focus on
health. The University of Idaho will [test all students returning to the
Moscow
campus](https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/health-clinic/covid-19/memos/memo-200716-green.pdf)
in August. Colby College will test students a number of times during the
first few weeks of school, and they [will not be allowed to
leave](https://covid19.colby.edu/fall-2020-planning/) the state until
the end of the academic term.

Cornell University, in upstate New York, is asking all students to
quarantine at home for two weeks before departure and all will be
[tested when they arrive in
Ithaca](https://covid.cornell.edu/students/move-in/). In addition,
students arriving from the many [states under Governor Cuomo’s executive
travel
order](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory) will
need to quarantine in New York State, or another state that is not on
the New York list before stepping onto campus. Students scheduled to
live in dorms had been told they would be asked to quarantine in a
Cornell-provided location, but now they are expected to quarantine
themselves before arriving on campus, or take classes online until their
state comes off the list. [Parents are not allowed into the
dorms](https://covid.cornell.edu/students/move-in/) during move-in or at
any time during the fall semester.

Some parents ultimately are deciding to send their offspring to school
by themselves, particularly if they are returning students. Ms.
Overholt’s son, Cole, will travel alone from California to begin his
second year at Rensselaer. Ms. Overholt was planning to accompany him,
but then the virus hit.

“I don’t see any reason I should get on a plane right now,” she said,
assured that Cole is capable of moving himself in. “I don’t need to add
to the problem.”

Indeed, college students are much less likely than their parents to get
very sick from the coronavirus. You could say that part of growing up is
learning to be safe. At least that hasn’t changed.
