<div class="css-53u6y8">

Attorney General William P. Barr, in [a contentious congressional
hearing on
Tuesday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/barr-testimony.html),
defended President Trump and the Justice Department on a variety of
matters. Here is a fact-check.

What Mr. Barr SAID

*“The president has not attempted to interfere in these decisions. On
the contrary, he has told me from the start that he expects me to
exercise my independent judgment to make whatever call I think is right,
and that is precisely what I’ve done.”*

**This is misleading.** In posts on Twitter and in other public
statements, Mr. Trump has repeatedly disparaged the Justice Department’s
[investigations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-attacks-obstruction-investigation.html)
and
[employees](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/us/politics/trump-attacks-justice-system.html)
and made his feelings clear in high-profile cases, including those of
allies like Roger J. Stone Jr. and Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Barr has
expressed frustration with Mr. Trump’s attacks, [saying in
February](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/13/us/politics/william-barr-trump.html)
that the president’s attacks “make it impossible for me to do my job and
to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we’re
doing our work with integrity.”

What Mr. Barr SAID

*“According to statistics compiled by The Washington Post, the number of
unarmed Black men killed by police so far this year is eight. The number
of unarmed white men killed by police over the same time period is 11.
And the overall numbers of police shootings has been decreasing.”*

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**This is misleading.** Mr. Barr accurately cited a [database of police
shootings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/)
compiled by The Washington Post. But the raw numbers obscure the
pronounced racial disparity in such shootings. (The statement was also
an echo of Mr. Trump’s technically accurate, but misleading
[claim](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-fact-check-biden-police-coronavirus-china.html)
that “more white” Americans are killed by the police than Black
Americans.)

When factoring in population size, Black Americans are killed by the
police at more than twice the rate as white Americans, according to the
database.
[Research](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854)
has also shown that in the United States, on average, the probability of
being shot by a police officer for someone who is Black and unarmed is
higher than for someone who is white and armed.

Nationwide, the number of police shootings has remained steady since
[independent researchers](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) began
tracking them — declining in major cities, but increasing in suburbs and
rural areas.

When Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana, took
issue with Mr. Barr’s presentation of the data, Mr. Barr responded, “You
have to adjust it by, you know, the race of the criminal.” But some
[research](https://policingequity.org/images/pdfs-doc/CPE_SoJ_Race-Arrests-UoF_2016-07-08-1130.pdf)
has shown that even when controlling for the demographics of those
arrested, there are still racial disparities in the use of police force.

What Mr. Barr SAID

*“The vast majority of them, around 90 percent, are killed by other
Blacks, mainly by gunfire.”*

**This is misleading.** Mr. Barr cited this statistic to argue that “the
threat to Black lives posed by crime on the streets is massively greater
than any threat posed by police misconduct.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He is correct that about [88.9
percent](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls)
of Black murder victims were killed by Black perpetrators in 2018. But
left unsaid was the fact that murder victims and their perpetrators are
overwhelmingly of the same race or ethnicity: 80.7 percent of white
murder victims were killed by white perpetrators, and 68.4 percent of
Latino murder victims by other Latinos.

The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, [in a 2018 report on police
shootings](https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2018/11-15-Police-Force.pdf),
identified claims like Mr. Barr’s about intraracial crime among Black
Americans as part of an “inevitability argument.”

“The ‘Black on Black’ crime narrative as an explanation for police
excessive use of force disregards the structural and historical issues
that formed these neighborhoods, as well as the social and economic
factors that currently sustain them,” the commission wrote.

Mr. Trump cited several inaccurate statistics to make [a similar
version](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/)of
this argument on Twitter during his 2016 presidential campaign.

What Mr. Barr SAID

*“In the wake of George Floyd’s death, violent rioters and anarchists
have hijacked legitimate protest to wreak senseless havoc and
destruction on innocent victims. The current situation in Portland is a
telling example. Every night for the past two months, hundreds of
rioters have laid siege to the federal courthouse and other nearby
federal property.”*

**This is exaggerated.** While some protesters in Portland have been
violent, [many
others](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/19/us/portland-protests.html)
[have been
peaceful](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/us/protests-divisions-blm.html)
and have included high school students, military veterans, off-duty
lawyers and lines of women who call themselves the “Wall of Moms.”

Videos show that federal agents, who arrived in the city on July 4, have
[responded
aggressively](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/portland-protests.html)
and sometimes with disproportionate force through the use of tear gas,
flash bangs and pepper balls. In some cases, they attacked protesters
when there was [no apparent
threat](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/us/100000007243995/portland-protests-federal-government.html?action=click&gtype=vhs&version=vhs-heading&module=vhs&region=title-area&cview=true&t=4),
including the case of [a Navy veteran whose
hands](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/us/portland-protests-navy-christopher-david.html)
were smashed by officers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Barr’s timeline of two months of nonstop riots in Portland is also
hyperbolic. Protests [have
ranged](https://pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/474579-383427-a-timeline-of-the-portland-protests-and-police-clashes)
in size and violence levels, and the police have not [declared the
situation a
riot](https://twitter.com/search?q=riot%20from%3A%40PortlandPolice&src=typed_query&f=live)
every night. The Oregonian also
[reported](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2020/07/fact-checking-barrs-testimony-before-congress-on-portland-protests.html)
that the courthouse was not a target of protests until July, when
federal agents were dispatched to the city.

What Mr. Barr SAID

*“The problem with the testing system was a function of President
Obama’s mishandling of the C.D.C. and his efforts to centralize
everything in the C.D.C.”*

**False.** Mr. Barr, [like Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus.html),
was most likely referring to a “draft guidance” issued in 2014 by the
Obama administration to regulate laboratory-developed tests necessary to
track a pandemic. But the policy was never made final or enforced,
undermining the argument that it was to blame for the scattered and
insufficient delivery of coronavirus tests this year. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention [botched the development of its own
tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html),
leaving the United States initially blind to the virus’s spread and
behind other nations. (The Justice Department plays no role in procuring
or distributing coronavirus tests.)

What Mr. Barr SAID

*“The historical building on Lafayette Park was burned down. St. John’s
was set on fire.”*

**This is exaggerated.** When protesters gathered on June 1 in Lafayette
Square, near the White House, as part of demonstrations in response to
the killing of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, [the
authorities used tear gas and rubber
bullets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html)
to clear the area of peaceful protesters. Mr. Trump then walked across
the park for a photo opportunity in front of St. John’s Church. A day
earlier, a small fire had been set in the basement of the church, but it
was contained.

A spokesman for Washington’s Fire and Emergency Medical Services
Department said that damage from the fires was largely negligible
throughout the protests and that no buildings were permanently destroyed
as many had sprinkler systems installed.

Mr. Barr may have been referring to a utility and bathroom facility in
Lafayette Square that was badly damaged, but not “burned down.” But
other than its location in the park, the spokesman said, it had no
historical significance.

What Mr. Barr Said

*“Well, first, it is my understanding that no tear gas was used on
Monday, June 1.”*

**This is misleading.** The United States Park Police has said it [did
not
use](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/the-semantics-of-tear-gas-versus-pepper-spray/)chloroacetophenone,
or CN, gas, one of the most common types of tear gas. But it did use
“[smoke canisters and pepper
balls](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/uspp/6_2_20_statement_from_acting_chief_monahan.htm)”
— and specifically products made by the PepperBall company — on
protesters in Lafayette Square that day.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.D.C.
[defines](https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/riotcontrol/factsheet.asp) the
term “tear gas” as riot control agents made of chemical compounds that
“temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to
the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs and skin” — symptoms that protesters and
reporters described experiencing in Lafayette Square.

Mr. Barr’s denial was also disputed by an Army National Guard officer
who was present during the protests and who also testified to Congress
on Tuesday.

“I could feel irritation in my eyes and nose, and based on my previous
exposure to tear gas in my training at West Point and later in my Army
training, I recognized that irritation as effects consistent with CS or
tear gas,” Maj. Adam DeMarco wrote in [his opening
statement](https://naturalresources.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Mr.%20Adam%20DeMarco%20-%20Written%20Testimony_.pdf?ftag=MSF0951a18).
“And later that evening, I found spent tear gas canisters on the street
nearby.”

A [2009 Justice Department
review](https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/lesslethal.pdf#page=7) on its
use of less-lethal weapons classified the PepperBall system as a
chemical agent and noted that it contains a “highly irritating pepper
powder.”

A 2014 Justice Department
[assessment](https://cops.usdoj.gov/RIC/Publications/cops-p317-pub.pdf)
of the police response to the protests in Ferguson, Mo., similarly
observed that PepperBalls “would likely cause a burning sensation” if
the content touches the skin. Last year, Mr. Trump signed [a
law](https://www.congress.gov/116/plaws/publ77/PLAW-116publ77.pdf)
banning the export of certain munitions to Hong Kong police. That list
included both tear gas and pepper balls.

What Mr. Barr Said

*Representative Mary Scanlon, Democrat of Pennsylvania: “OK. But in
fact, you have no evidence that foreign countries can successfully sway
our elections with counterfeit ballots, do you?”*

*Mr. Barr: “No, I don’t, but I have common sense.”*

**This lacks evidence.** Election officials and experts have [widely
rejected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-vote-fraud-ballot.html)
this idea as nearly impossible, noting that ballots are printed on very
specific stock and often have specific tracking systems like bar codes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s so much more difficult than a cyberattack,” said Lawrence Norden,
the director of the election reform program at the Brennan Center.
“You’d not only have to attack the printer, you’d have to get
information from the jurisdiction and get voter registration
information. You’d have to have some way of mailing the ballots from an
address and get the signature of the voter. It would be an exceptionally
difficult attack.”
