Two women were arrested and accused of beating a state senator who had
been recording video of protesters last month, during a night of
intensifying violence in Madison, Wis., the authorities said.

The senator, Tim Carpenter, a Democrat who represents areas in
Milwaukee, said on June 24 that he was punched and kicked in the head
after he took a cellphone
[video](https://twitter.com/TimCarpenterMKE/status/1275716467007328258)
of protesters who had been marching through downtown Madison for several
hours to protest police violence and racism.

He was treated in the hospital for injuries to his head, neck, nose and
ribs.

On Monday, after the Madison Police Department released surveillance
images of two women it described as persons of interest, [the police
said](https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=26641)
the women, Samantha R. Hamer, 26, and Kerida E. O’Reilly, 33, turned
themselves in.

Both women face charges of battery and robbery, the police said. They
were being held on those charges in a Dane County jail, [inmate records
showed on Wednesday](https://danesheriff.com/Inmates/Detail/660287). It
was not immediately clear whether they had lawyers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Their initial court appearance in Dane County Circuit Court was
scheduled for Wednesday.

Ms. Hamer was put on administrative leave from her job as a social
worker for the Mount Horeb School District in suburban Madison, [The
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
reported](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/28/school-social-worker-therapist-arrested-assault-senator/5527959002/).
Ms. O’Reilly is a licensed physical therapist in Madison, the newspaper
reported.

Mr. Carpenter was [assaulted just after midnight on
June 24](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/tim-carpenter-wisconsin-senator-protest.html)
during demonstrations in the city protesting police violence against
Black people in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis in
police custody, in May.

The state senator posted his [video of the incident on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/TimCarpenterMKE/status/1275716467007328258)
in the hours after it took place. As he records a line of demonstrators
on a street, the video shows, two women break away from the group and
run toward him. “Leave my phone alone,” he can be heard saying. “Delete
it,” one of the women replies. Then the recording goes dark.

In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Carpenter said he had gone to the
Capitol to do some work when he noticed that one of the city’s statues
had been pulled down. There were “roving bands” of protesters, some
peaceful and some “rioting,” he said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He parked his car, and noticed a line of demonstrators pausing in a
march. Other people were standing around watching them, too.

Mr. Carpenter said he had participated in protests for years, in
Wisconsin and in Washington, many in support of gay rights. “I got out
of my car, just curious,” he said. He decided after a few minutes to
record the demonstrators.

There was movement in the crowd, and then the two women, and possibly a
third person, moved toward him. He said there was “no warning
whatsoever” that he would be attacked.

“One of the two put her hand over the camera and pushed me back, and
then the phone was knocked out of my hand,” he said. “That precipitated
it. All of a sudden there were eight to 10 people, kicking and punching
and doing all sorts of things.”

He said he supports peaceful protests and Black Lives Matter.

“I tried telling them, ‘Why are you doing this? I am an ally of yours,’”
he said. “I am gay, I have been in the Legislature for 36 years. That is
when the beating kind of slowed down a bit.”

He said he was treated on the scene for a concussion, a broken nose and
bruises by ambulance medics and then later by a family doctor.

There had been protests in Madison for weeks, alongside those across the
United States after Mr. Floyd’s death. But on the night that Mr.
Carpenter was assaulted, the tenor of the marches had intensified after
the arrest of a Black activist, identified as Devonere A. Johnson, 28,
at a restaurant near the Capitol. Video of that arrest shows officers
pulling Mr. Johnson by the legs and carrying his body to force him into
a police car.

On July 8, Mr. Johnson was indicted on federal extortion charges and
accused of threatening to destroy a business unless it paid him, the
U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Wisconsin
[said](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwi/pr/grand-jury-returns-indictments-100).
Prosecutors also accused Mr. Johnson of threatening another business
unless he and “his associates were provided free food and beverages.”

A lawyer listed for Mr. Johnson on court records was not immediately
available for comment on Wednesday.

The mayor of Madison, Satya Rhodes-Conway, [has described the flare-up
of violence the
night](https://www.cityofmadison.com/news/mayor-rhodes-conway-city-leaders-announce-agreement-to-end-school-resource-officer-contracts)
of Mr. Carpenter’s assault as “far from the peaceful protests” the city
had seen on previous nights. “The behaviors we saw were incredibly
dangerous and intolerable — putting people’s lives at risk,” she said in
a statement last month.

She said people were pulled out of cars. Some protesters tried to set
fire to a building with dozens of people inside, used vehicles to push
through crowds, or tossed firebombs, the mayor said.

[Protesters also toppled two
statues](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/tim-carpenter-wisconsin-senator-protest.html):
one of a 19th-century abolitionist, [Hans Christian
Heg](https://www.nps.gov/people/hans-heg.htm), and another of the
[“Forward”
figure](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2752), an
allegorical work meant to embody the state’s motto.

But mentioning Mr. Johnson’s arrest, the mayor also added, “I recognize
that we need better options to de-escalate situations and offer
restorative justice in our community.”
