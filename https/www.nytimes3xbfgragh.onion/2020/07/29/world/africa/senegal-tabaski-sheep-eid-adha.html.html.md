# For Senegal’s Biggest Holiday, a Shortage of the All-Important Sheep

</div>

Properly celebrating Tabaski, as Eid al-Adha is known in Senegal,
requires a sacrificial sheep. Coronavirus restrictions have made the
animals more expensive, putting them out of reach of many.

MISSIRAH, Senegal — The couscous was all ready for the lunchtime crowd
in Yassin Dicko’s restaurant near one of the biggest sheep markets in
Senegal.

But except for family members, the place was empty. Ms. Dicko’s usual
customers, shepherds from Mauritania, had not shown up. She looked
outside to the vast holding area where just a few meager herds of sheep
trotted around, their bleating oddly human.

While the corrals in Missirah, in central Senegal, are usually packed
with sheep at this time of year, hardly any salesmen had shown up.
Almost no buyers either.

“This is a real crisis,” she said.

It was 13 days before Tabaski, the Senegalese version of Eid al-Adha,
the biggest religious celebration of the year in the country, which is
about 95 percent Muslim.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

No sheep for the Tabaski feast for a Muslim Senegalese family is like no
presents at Christmas for a Christian one, and in the two weeks before
the holiday, which takes place this year on July 31, there is usually a
shopping rush for the animals.

But monthslong government-imposed measures to contain the coronavirus —
borders closed, markets shuttered and travel severely restricted — have
been financially devastating for many people in Senegal, putting a
purchase of great cultural and social importance beyond the reach of
many this year.

Even in ordinary years, the sheep is a major purchase for many families,
who take out high-interest
[loans](https://www.boaniger.com/particuliers/prets/pret-tabaski/) to
pay for it and the other food and new clothes that are typically an
obligatory part of the celebration.

Owners guard their sheep purchases closely, sometimes even sleeping in
the same room with the animal, to avoid falling victim to a theft. While
most families buy their sheep in the month before Tabaski, some buy them
a year or more in advance and do the fattening up themselves.

This year, aware that citizens would be worried about catching the virus

Buyers were able to swipe left or right through hundreds of sheep
profiles on Sama Xaru Tabaski — or “My Tabaski Sheep” in Wolof, the most
widely spoken of Senegal’s many languages — and then arrange a deal for
the animal that catches their fancy, skipping hours of risky
face-to-face haggling.

But the service has received meager traffic so far, and even if a
would-be buyer can find a sheep, it may not be affordable.

A $140 sheep last year now costs over $170, with the hike attributable,
according to industry players, to the ripple effects of the coronavirus
restrictions.

Around half of Senegal’s Tabaski sheep come from neighboring Mali and
Mauritania, and until late June, all the herds were completely stuck on
the other side of the border, except those smuggled
across.

Now sheep are welcome, but even though the bovid border has been
reopened, the expected surge of sheep has not materialized.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One reason is that sheep now must be transported only in trucks, and
many drivers are charging twice as much as usual to move the animals.

On a recent Saturday, shepherds, swinging their sticks, yipped and
whooped their skinny charges into the back of a truck in Kidira, a town
in Senegal on the border with Mali where the sheep had been let out to
graze. They were traveling to Dakar with the animals, riding in hammocks
strung from truck beams above their undulant flocks.

Watching the shepherds and their charges scurry aboard was Alassane
Ndongo, president of the local herders’ association.

While three shepherds can ride in each truck, Mr. Ndongo said that
owners don’t because they generally travel alongside by car, and cars
are banned from crossing the border.

So many owners were simply keeping their flocks home, another reason for
the shortages.

In addition, Mr. Ndongo added, in typical years, many herds would cross
the border on foot. But that requires setting off months in advance, and
in 2020, that start date for the journey was just when governments were
ordering everyone
indoors.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“Women usually want a fat sheep, and a young one, because they’re
thinking about how it will taste,” he said from behind a mask, as
assistants hauled mangers up and down his ovine kingdom. “Men, on the
other hand, buy for aesthetics, and for love.”

Professional butchers are kept busy in Dakar for those who are too
squeamish to slit the animal’s throat themselves or for those who have
grown too close to their woolly companion.

“Sheep for us are like dogs for Europeans,” said Mr. Kane, who is also
president of the National Federation of Sheep Industry Actors. “They’re
good company. They’re useful, and they’re
friendly.”

The sheep’s role in the Tabaski celebration is far more central than
just providing a meal. Eid al-Adha honors the story of Ibrahim, whom God
asked to sacrifice his cherished son, Ismail, but then told him at the
last minute he could swap in a ram.

“God did not tell Ibrahim to kill the sheep, or to eat it,” Mr. Kane
said. “He said it should be a sacrifice. So you have to choose the sheep
you love.”

Most of Mr. Kane’s sheep are less lovable than imposing: They are
Ladoums, an enormous and majestic crossbreed much prized by the
Senegalese, for whom the mere mention of a Ladoum can elicit a wistful
sigh.

Mr. Kane’s best Ladoums sell for up to $3,500, and as I spoke with their
owner, the regal creatures seemed to know it. One tossed his long tail;
another stamped groomed hooves in freshly sprinkled sand. A third, his
ears poking through striped, curling horns, looked up with a snooty
expression as we walked past.

They needn’t be so conceited. This year, even elite buyers are thin on
the ground, Mr. Kane said.

The reduced incomes brought by the pandemic shutdown has pushed some
Senegalese from comfortable to struggling.

Ms. Dicko, the restaurant owner, said she was worrying about her friends
and neighbors, those who used to make $9 a day and now could only make
$4. For them, she said, a sheep was out of the question, and tough days
were ahead.

“There will be a lot of hardship,” she said.
