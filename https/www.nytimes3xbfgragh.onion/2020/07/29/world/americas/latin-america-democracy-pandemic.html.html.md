CARACAS, Venezuela — Postponed elections. Sidelined courts. A persecuted
opposition.

As the coronavirus pandemic tears through Latin America and the
Caribbean, killing more than 180,000 and destroying the livelihoods of
tens of millions in the region, it is also undermining democratic norms
that were already under strain.

Leaders ranging from the center-right to the far left have used the
crisis as justification to extend their time in office, weaken oversight
of government actions and silence critics — actions that under different
circumstances would be described as authoritarian and antidemocratic but
that now are being billed as lifesaving measures to curb the spread of
the disease.

The gradual undermining of democratic rules during an economic crisis
and public health catastrophe could leave Latin America primed for
slower growth and an increase in corruption and human rights abuses,
experts warned. This is particularly true in places where political
rights and accountability were already in steep decline.

“It’s not a matter of left or right, it’s a general decline of democracy
across the region,” said Alessandra Pinna, a Latin America researcher at

dictatorships transitioned to peace and democracy.

In Bolivia, a caretaker government has used the pandemic to postpone
elections, tap into emergency aid to bolster its electoral campaign and
threaten to ban the main opposition candidate from running.

And in the islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, the government imposed a
strict lockdown on its 50,000 people during the campaign for general
elections in June, hampering opposition efforts to meet voters while
also keeping international election observers from traveling to the
country.

It was the first time that the Organization of American States, a
regional group that promotes democracy, had its invitation to observe
elections withdrawn by a host country in recent
history.

The loss of public trust in Latin America is not new, but the erosion of
democratic norms in the pandemic arrived at a time when the region’s
economic growth and social progress were already unraveling, leaving
many uncertain about the ability of democratic leaders to solve
entrenched problems such as inequality, crime and corruption.

By 2018, only one in four Latin Americans said they were satisfied with
democracy — the lowest number since Latinobarómetro, a regional polling
company, began asking that question 25 years ago.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Discontent with the political establishment led to a wave of populist
victories in recent years, including President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil,
who is on the far right, and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of
Mexico, who is on the left. It also led to mass street protests in
several Latin American countries last year.

The pandemic, hitting during this time of political upheaval, has
plunged the region into the deepest recession in its history,
exacerbating weaknesses in health and welfare systems and highlighting
the ways in which many leaders are unable to meet public demands.

“All the things that Latin Americans have already been clamoring for —
greater equality, better services — have been dramatically worsened by
the pandemic,” said Cynthia Arnson, Latin America program director at
the Wilson Center, a think-tank in Washington. “The economic pain is
dramatic, and it’s putting additional strain on the already-weak
institutions.”

It has also put a strain on the region’s struggling health care systems.
Latin America has become a global hot spot for the virus, with Brazil,
Mexico and Peru among the 10 nations with the highest number of deaths.
And according to the United Nations, about 16 million Latin Americans
are expected to fall into extreme poverty this year, reversing nearly
all the gains made by the region this
century.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Adding to these challenges, democracy in Latin America has also lost a
champion in the United States, which had played an important role in
promoting democracy after the end of the Cold War by financing good
governance programs and calling out authoritarian abuses.

Under President Trump, the United States has mostly focused regional
policy on opposing left-wing autocrats in Venezuela and Cuba and curbing
immigration, making aid to Central American nations, among the region’s
poorest, contingent on cooperating with the administration on
immigration.

The Trump administration also refrained from commenting when Nayib
Bukele, the president of El Salvador, ignored Supreme Court rulings and
used the military to crack down on quarantine violators during the
pandemic.

American support for democracy initiatives in Latin America fell by
almost half last year to $326 million, according to preliminary figures
compiled by the United States Agency for International Development.

“In the last few years, we have not only abandoned our role as a
democratizing force in Latin America and the world, but we have promoted
negative forces,” said Orlando Pérez, a political scientist at the
University of North Texas. “Our policy is now: ‘You’re on your own —
America
first.’”

In the few democratic strongholds in Latin America, such as Uruguay and
Costa Rica, leaders responded to the pandemic with efficiency and
transparency, boosting public trust in the government. In the Dominican
Republic and Suriname, incumbent presidents recently bowed out of power
after losing elections that were held despite the pandemic.

In many instances, judges and civil servants have resisted the attacks
on democratic institutions during the pandemic, said Javier Corrales, a
professor of Latin American studies at Amherst College in Massachusetts.
“The defenders of liberal democracy in Latin America are not defeated,”
said Mr. Corrales. “It’s not an open terrain for would-be
authoritarians.”

Yet in most Latin American nations, the coronavirus accelerated a
pre-existing democratic decline by exposing the weakness and corruption
of governments in the face of the catastrophe.

“When confronted with an existential threat, countries that did not
already have deep democratic systems are choosing tactics that help
leaders consolidate their power,” said John Polga-Hecimovich, a
political scientist at the United States Naval Academy in Maryland.

The political tensions gripping the region in the pandemic could be just
the beginning of a longer wave of unrest and authoritarianism, said
Thomas Carothers, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace. “It will drag the region down into poorer economic performance,”
he said. “It also means poorer treatment of human beings, their dignity
and
rights.”
