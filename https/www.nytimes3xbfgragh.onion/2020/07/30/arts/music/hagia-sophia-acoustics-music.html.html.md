# How a Historian Stuffed Hagia Sophia’s Sound Into a Studio

Bissera Pentcheva used virtual acoustics to bring Istanbul to California
and reconstruct the sonic world of Byzantine cathedral music.

Turquoise carpets covered the marble floor, with its geometric designs.
White drapes concealed the mosaic of the Virgin and Christ. Scaffolding
obscured crosses and other Christian symbols.

Footage broadcast around the world last week captured some of these
striking changes to Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine cathedral in Istanbul,
which served as a mosque under Ottoman rule before becoming a museum in
1934. On the orders of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, [it is
now once again used as a
mosque](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/world/europe/turkey-hagia-sophia-mosque-prayers.html).

But for a group of scholars, scientists and musicians, Hagia Sophia’s
rededication as a Muslim place of worship threatens to cloak a less
tangible treasure: its sound. Bissera Pentcheva, [an art historian at
Stanford University](https://art.stanford.edu/people/bissera-pentcheva)
and an expert in the burgeoning field of acoustic archaeology, has spent
the past decade studying the building’s extravagantly reverberant
acoustics to reconstruct [the sonic world of Byzantine cathedral
music](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/iconsofsound/film/). Ms.
Pentcheva argues that Hagia Sophia’s mystical brilliance reveals itself
fully only if it is viewed as a vessel for animated light — and sound.

“The void is a stage,” she said in a recent interview over Zoom.

Conducting research inside this contested monument has required a
mixture of diplomacy, ingenuity and technology. Turkish authorities
forbade singing inside Hagia Sophia, even when it was operated as a
museum. Now that the building falls under the jurisdiction of religious
authorities, that ban will harden, and further research may be even more
difficult.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Ms. Pentcheva’s existing work culminated last fall in the release of
“The Lost Voices of Hagia Sophia,” an album that brings to life the
stately mystery of Byzantine cathedral liturgy, bathed in the glittering
acoustics of the space for which it was written — even though it was
recorded in a studio in California.

For about 20 years, it has been possible to superimpose the acoustics of
a particular space onto recorded music during postproduction. A pioneer
was Altiverb, a plug-in software that draws on [a large
library](https://www.audioease.com/altiverb/browse.php) of virtual
spaces so that a recorded track can be retrofitted to seem like it was
done in, for example, the Berlin Philharmonie or the King’s Chamber
inside the Great Pyramid of Giza.

But in what has become known as live virtual acoustics, processors and
speakers provide the acoustic feedback of a particular space in real
time, so that musicians can adjust their performance as if they were
really in another building.

[Jonathan Abel](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/people/jonathan-abel), a
consulting professor at the Center for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics at Stanford, devised a plan with Ms. Bissera that allowed her
to capture vital information about the acoustic properties of Hagia
Sophia with the help of a balloon, discreet recording equipment and a
cooperative security guard.

In the winter of 2010, Ms. Pentcheva obtained permission to enter what
was then a museum at dawn, when Istanbul was quiet. She persuaded a
guard to stand in a spot that would have been occupied by singers during
the Byzantine era and to pop a balloon. In the meantime, she stationed
herself where a privileged member of the public might have experienced
mass. Microphones captured the explosion of sound and the ensuing wash
of reverberations.

Ms. Pentcheva was allowed to capture only four such pops over two
visits. But those bursts of sound yielded a wealth of
data.

“That little balloon pop brings back all the information about the
material and the size of the space,” Mr. Abel said. “You can think of a
human voice as being made up of a whole bunch of balloon pops. Each
voice drags behind it a bunch of impulse responses, like streamers
behind a wedding car.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The balloon noises, along with maps of the interior, allowed Mr. Abel to
identify what he called the acoustic fingerprint of the building,
including the multidirectional refraction of sound as it bounces off the
dome and marble colonnades. His computer simulation was then integrated
into a set of microphones and speakers.

Thus the members of [Cappella Romana](https://cappellaromana.org/), a
vocal ensemble based in Portland, Ore., specializing in Byzantine chant,
recorded “The Lost Voices” in a space that persuasively mimicked the
acoustics of Hagia Sophia — with its luscious reverberation, cross
echoes and amplification of particular frequencies.

Alexander Lingas, a musicologist and the music director of Cappella
Romana, said that the live virtual acoustics were transformative to his
understanding of the group’s repertory. The long reverberation time
dictated slower tempos. Basses singing drones made subtle pitch
adjustments to match frequencies of maximum resonance.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Lingas said that some pieces only “made sense” inside the simulated
acoustics. One example featured on the album is a cherubic hymn that
likens the singers to angels.

“The music is designed to convey that,” Mr. Lingas said. “But I remember
editing this piece and thinking, ‘My, this is really strange.’” Yet, he
added, as the group rehearsed it with the virtual acoustics, a pattern
of repeated undulating motifs built up rippling momentum until, as he
described it, “the sound essentially achieved
liftoff.”

Ms. Pentcheva believed that in Byzantine cathedral chant, reverberation
was key to invoking the divine presence. She pointed to the exuberant
amount of melisma in the repertory, where a single syllable is stretched
over multiple notes. In the liquid acoustics of Hagia Sophia, words sung
in this way blur, the way a line drawn in ink bleeds on wet paper.

“Rather than containing this smearing of semantics, the music itself
actually intensifies it,” Ms. Pentcheva said. “So there is this process
of alienation and estrangement from the register of human language that
happens in Hagia Sophia, and is a desired goal.”

In Greek Orthodox rites, Ms. Pentcheva argued, acoustics and chant
interact in a way that “is not about sound carrying information, but
sound precipitating experience. It is a fully corporeal investment.”

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The recording provides a glimpse of that experience. Phrases chanted in
unison leave a ghostly imprint. Rhythmic shudders and grace notes set
off blurry squiggles of overlapping echoes. Chords unfurl in reverberant
bloom.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The acoustic drama of Hagia Sophia would have unfolded alongside the
changing light and curling smoke of burning incense, enveloping the
senses. The effect is described in a 6th-century description of the
building by Paul the Silentiary, an aristocrat and poet at the court of
Justinian.

“He speaks about a human action that brings into presence the divine
reaction, the divine voice,” Ms. Pentcheva said. “In a sense that is the
reverberation of the space: After the human voice stops singing, the
building continues.”
