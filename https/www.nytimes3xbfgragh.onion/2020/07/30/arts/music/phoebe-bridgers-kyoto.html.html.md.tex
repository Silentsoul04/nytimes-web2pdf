Song}\label{how-phoebe-bridgers-begrudgingly-writes-a-rock-song}}

The singer and songwriter prefers a ballad. But collaborators yanked her
out of her comfort zone for ``Kyoto,'' a breakout from her latest
acclaimed album. Here's how she made it.

When Phoebe Bridgers, the 25-year-old singer and songwriter from Los
Angeles, has the first inklings of a musical idea, it's usually in the
form of a ballad --- slow and somber, but with enough wry energy to keep
it interesting.

Most of the time --- including across Bridgers's 2017 debut, ``Stranger
in the Alps,'' and its follow-up from this year, ``Punisher'' --- the
songs stay that way: quiet, slow, dreamy. But sometimes, Bridgers's
reliable band of collaborators can convince her to add some pep to a
track, if only to disguise its melancholy.

That's the story of ``Kyoto,'' the first straight-ahead indie rock song
on ``Punisher,'' one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the year
so far. Writing in The New York Times, the critic Lindsay Zoladz
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/arts/music/phoebe-bridgers-punisher-review.html}{called
it ``strange and exquisitely moving,''} noting Bridgers's ``great
strength as a songwriter: weaving tiny, specific, time-stamped details
(chemtrails, Saltines, serotonin) into durable big-tent tapestries of
feeling.''

In the latest episode of Diary of a Song, which breaks down how music is
made today, Bridgers discusses how ``Kyoto'' came together over the span
of months, combining a stray lyric, a bare-bones voice memo from tour
and shared memories of childhood with her drummer and co-writer Marshall
Vore. And while the song started as a trademark Bridgers dirge, she
says, it reached its final form only once she was in the studio with her
fellow producers on ``Punisher,'' Ethan Gruska and Tony Berg, who helped
establish her sound on her first album.

``I don't think about all my songs as ballads anymore,'' Bridgers said.
``I feel like they're not even really fully written until I've shown
them to those guys, and they're like, `This stays a ballad,' or, `This
is a rock song.'''

In addition to interviews with Bridgers, Vore, Gruska and Berg, the
video above features various demo versions of the song in-progress and
the story of how the triumphant horns in ``Kyoto'' almost ended the
musician and composer Nate Walcott's career as a brass player.

\emph{``Diary of a Song'' provides an up-close, behind-the-scenes look
at how pop music is made today, using archival material --- voice memos,
demo versions, text messages, emails, interviews and more --- to tell
the story behind the track.}
