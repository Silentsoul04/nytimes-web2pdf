# Trevor Noah Thinks Trump Is ‘Oddly Chilled Out’ About Russia

</div>

The president said he didn’t ask Vladimir Putin whether Russia paid to
have U.S. troops killed. The “Daily Show” host can see why that talk
would have been “super awkward.”

*Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s
highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy.
We’re all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the* [*50 best movies
on Netflix right
now*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/arts/television/best-movies-on-netflix.html)*.*

## No Room for Intelligence

U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Russia paid bounties to
Afghan militants to kill American soldiers. [In an
interview](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/politics/trump-putin-bounties.html)
released on Wednesday, President Trump said he didn’t bring that up in a
recent conversation with President Vladimir Putin, and that a briefing
on the subject never reached his desk.

“Unlike every other American president, he’s been oddly chilled out
about Russian aggression toward the U.S.,” Trevor Noah said on “The
Daily Show.”

## The Bits Worth Watching
