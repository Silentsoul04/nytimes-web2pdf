of it. This series is modeled after Llewellyn's experiences, and it

ashamed of her mother's frequent hospitalizations and her father's
alcoholism. But Bethan is an excellent liar. After all, she's trying to
balance an unstable home life with the typical anxieties of a teenager
--- like friendships and crushes --- as best as she can. The first
season is available for streaming.

\textbf{THE BIRDS} (1963) **** \emph{10:45 p.m. on TCM.} A later
addition to the filmography of Alfred Hitchcock, the director nicknamed
the ``Master of Suspense,'' ``The Birds'' tells the story of a peaceful
seaside town suddenly plagued by feathered foes. ** In it, Melanie
Daniels (Tippi Hedren), follows a man named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor)
from San Francisco to a small fishing village, where his family lives.
Almost immediately after Melanie arrives in the town, she is attacked by
a sea gull, sparking a chain of horrific bird attacks that turn deadly.
In his review for The New York Times in 1963,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1963/04/01/archives/screen-the-birdshitchcocks-feathered-fiends-are-chilling.html}{Bosley
Crowther wrote} that ``Mr. Hitchcock and his associates have constructed
a horror film that should raise the hackles on the most courageous and
put goose-pimples on the toughest hide.''
