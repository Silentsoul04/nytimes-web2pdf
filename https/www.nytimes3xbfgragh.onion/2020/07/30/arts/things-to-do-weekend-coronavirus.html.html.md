Madonna beat Beyoncé to the title “Queen of Pop,” but Beyoncé’s more
open-ended honorific, “Queen Bey,” turned out to be quite fitting: These
days, she hardly limits herself to just the one medium. Since 2013’s
self-titled LP, her albums have been cinematic feats as much as musical
events. Her latest opus, due out on Friday, is [“Black Is
King,”](https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/movie/black-is-king) a
visual corollary to last year’s album, [“The Lion King: The
Gift”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnDdyeOaXy0&list=OLAK5uy_nkj8U4dj1uSMUhZsAp0R3TpYH0xWvbcPc)
— itself a companion to Disney’s [blockbuster
remake](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/11/movies/the-lion-king-review.html)
of the 1994 animated classic.

A new chapter in her ongoing project of foregrounding Black experience
in her work, the film represents the collaborative efforts of more than
a dozen co-directors, including the Ghanaian filmmaker Blitz Bazawule
([“The Burial of
Kojo”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/28/movies/the-burial-of-kojo-review.html))
and Ibra Ake, Donald Glover’s longtime creative collaborator. And like
the album that inspired it, “Black Is King” boasts an all-star cast that
includes Naomi Campbell, Lupita Nyong’o, Kelly Rowland, Pharrell
Williams and Jay-Z.

“Black Is King” premieres on Disney+ as part of an exclusive
distribution deal that will bring the film to many countries in Africa.
The combined might of three cultural juggernauts — Beyoncé, Disney and
its leonine (and most profitable) franchise — should make for a truly
spectacular global celebration of “the breadth and beauty of Black
ancestry,” to borrow Beyoncé’s
[words](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCAMxfrHjAL/).

Bisa Butler’s work originates from the idea of absence. The subjects for
her quilts tend to be anonymous, sometimes given little more than a
designation of “Negro,” which is the search term she plugged into one of
the Library of Congress’s photographic databases to find some of her
source material.

Fusing figuration with collage for the pieces in her current exhibition
at the Katonah Museum of Art, [“Bisa Butler:
Portraits,”](http://www.katonahmuseum.org/exhibitions/) she used
vividly patterned African fabrics to create large-scale images of Black
people, reconstructing their stories and seemingly riffing on a Black
tradition of oral histories that take shape through their retelling. Her
work evokes the poignant, generations-old legacy of quilting in the
Black community, made famous by the [women of Gee’s
Bend](https://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/gees-bend-quiltmakers).

The [Katonah Museum of Art](http://www.katonahmuseum.org/), about 45
miles north of New York City, has reopened, so you can see the show in
person through Oct. 4, or you can visit the museum’s website, whose
offerings include a virtual walk-through of the galleries. [On Sunday
at 4
p.m.](http://www.katonahmuseum.org/programs-and-events/BisaButler-Virtual-BisaButler-LiveInConversation/)
Eastern time, Butler will talk with the museum’s executive director,
Michael Gitlitz, in a Zoom session available to the public for $5; the
proceeds will benefit Black Lives Matter. The discussion will focus on
her works and their influences — those who have names, and the many
others who do not.

For many Brooklynites, Green-Wood Cemetery has emerged as a welcome
oasis over the past few months; the setting, free of exercise
enthusiasts, offers breathing space and quiet. Now, Gelsey Bell and
Joseph White’s immersive audio project “Cairns” will take visitors on a
self-guided tour that not only respects the cemetery’s tranquillity but
also preserves social distancing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bell wrote and narrated the track, and composed the music with White.
Her involvement makes “Cairns” particularly intriguing: In recent years,
she has emerged as one of New York’s most adventurous musicians, leading
visitors through the Museum of Modern Art’s Fluxus sound collection one
day and appearing in the Dave Malloy musicals “Natasha, Pierre & the
Great Comet of 1812” and “Ghost Quartet” the next.

You can download “Cairns” (available for $7 starting Friday) from
[Bell’s Bandcamp page](https://gelseybell.bandcamp.com/album/cairns)
and the website of the performing arts center
[HERE](http://here.org/events/), which commissioned the piece. Then head
to Green-Wood’s Sunset Park entrance, on Fourth Avenue and 35th Street,
and amble along as directed. Expect to drop by some of Green-Wood’s
notable, if undersung, views and burial sites, including those of the
19th-century Native American performer Do-Hum-Me and Susan S. McKinney
Steward, New York’s first Black female doctor.

Not near Green-Wood? You can listen from home and be transported.

The weekly podcast [“Dance and Stuff,”](https://www.danceandstuff.com/)
hosted by the artists [Jack Ferver and Reid
Bartelme](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/arts/dance/reid-bartelme-jack-ferver-podcast.html),
is full of spirited conversation with performers, choreographers and
others working in dance. But a recent pair of episodes struck a deeper
chord.

A few weeks ago, Ferver and Bartelme released a two-part interview with
three of the four Black dancers ever to join the Merce Cunningham Dance
Company in that institution’s nearly 60 years: Gus Solomons Jr., Michael
Cole and Rashaun Mitchell. (The fourth, [Ulysses
Dove](https://charlierose.com/videos/15779), died in 1996.)

In [the first
part](https://anchor.fm/danceandstuff/episodes/Episode-159-With-Gus-Solomons--Jr---Michael-Cole--and-Rashaun-Mitchell-eg322s),
the dancers share their personal stories of discovering and pursuing
Cunningham’s work. In [the
second](https://anchor.fm/danceandstuff/episodes/Episode-160-Dancing-for-Merce-Cunningham-eg7ed4),
they speak in greater depth about being the only Black company member at
a given time (their tenures never overlapped) and the broader
implications of the company’s whiteness.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The candid, cross-generational dialogue sheds light on dimensions of
Cunningham’s legacy too rarely discussed on the record. And it’s easy to
complement these podcasts with videos. A few places to start: Learn more
about Solomons in the web series “Mondays With Merce” (he’s featured in
[Episode 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rRKRX0U6NA)); see Cole in

Of all the difficult subjects to explain to children, racism is one of
the hardest and most relevant.

Last year, Jelani Memory, a biracial author and father, took on the task
with [“A Kids Book About
Racism,”](https://akidsbookabout.com/products/a-kids-book-about-racism)
which incorporates his own experiences. Now [Khalia
Davis](https://khaliadavis.com/) has adapted [his
text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnaltG5N8nE) into a half-hour
virtual theater production, [“A Kids Play About
Racism,”](https://www.akidsplayabout.org/) which will be free all
weekend on [Broadway on
Demand](https://www.broadwayondemand.com/series/teJ66dfuOEak-a-kids-play-about-racism).

“We cast an actor who is also biracial to play Jelani at 10 years old,”
said Davis, who directed the show as well. That performer is [Davied
Morales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWPOrq7qt_g), who wrote the
raps it includes. ([Justin Ellington](http://www.justinellington.com/)
composed the music.) “I wanted to expand the world of the book, so he
had someone to respond to,” Davis said of the Jelani character, who is
surrounded by players enacting his memories and emotions.

Produced by 41 companies in the organization [Theater for Young
Audiences/USA](http://www.tyausa.org/), the show and accompanying
educational videos will be streamable from midnight on Friday to
midnight on Sunday Eastern time. (Davis hopes to make the presentation
permanently available online.) Families can also register for related
[Zoom theater workshops](https://www.akidsplayabout.org/more) on
Saturday and Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The play, Davis added, helps children of any background understand not
only racism, but also how to “do something about it.”

After a car accident nearly resulted in the amputation of her left hand
at age 7, Molly Joyce spent years in search of an instrument that would
fit her body.

When the composer, who has written for [virtuosos like Vicky
Chow](https://vickychow.bandcamp.com/track/rave-composed-by-molly-joyce),
started working with vintage toy organs, she quickly perceived the
opportunities they offered her as a performer. (The buttons on a toy
organ’s left side permit a musician to play a chord with one finger
while navigating traditional keys with another hand on its right side.)

In [a 2017 TEDx Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcIavUYjRzg),
Joyce described how composing on this instrument allowed for a creative
process that could move beyond the binary of ability and disability.
Proof of her breakthrough is abundant throughout [“Breaking and
Entering,”](https://mollyjoyce.bandcamp.com/album/breaking-and-entering)
the musician’s debut full-length solo album. In a phone interview before
the recording’s release in June, Joyce cited not only early minimalists
like Steve Reich and Philip Glass as stylistic touchstones, but also
artists like the Cocteau Twins, Beach House and My Brightest Diamond.

Aside from her appreciation for “less vibrato, very on-pitch” singing,
Joyce noted her taste for enveloping production styles that come across
as a “wash” of sound. All those affections can be heard on the album’s
opening track, [“Body and
Being,”](https://mollyjoyce.bandcamp.com/track/body-and-being) in
which sustained chords, MIDI tones and her dream-pop vocals work
together to produce an airy, liberating sensation.

Far be it for me to quibble with Emmy voters, but quibble I shall,
because [Gary Gulman](https://garygulman.com/), perhaps the best comedy
writer in America, put out a special in the past year that’s both
heartfelt and hilarious, with inimitable diction holding it together,
and yet the show failed to receive a nomination.

“Quibble” is one of many words Gulman employs with such unequivocal
specificity in his 2019 HBO special, [“The Great
Depresh,”](https://www.hbo.com/specials/gary-gulman-the-great-depresh)
which features his stand-up at Roulette in Brooklyn, along with his
conversations with stand-up colleagues at the Comedy Cellar and sessions
with his psychiatrist and his wife, Sadé, at Weill Cornell Medicine.
Cameras even follow Gulman back to his mother’s house outside of Boston
to revisit his childhood. Over the course of 70-plus minutes, Gulman
demonstrates that comedians can struggle with depression without
becoming sad clowns, and that if he could find help, so can you.

That he manages to do so while accentuating his punch lines with precise
vocabulary sets him apart. In one of the special’s early bits, he
describes his experience at drinking fountains in elementary school as
“fraught” and “perilous” for a “precocious” kid trying to get his full
