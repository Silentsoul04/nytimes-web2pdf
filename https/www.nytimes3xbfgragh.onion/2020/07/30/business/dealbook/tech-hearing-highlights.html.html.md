## ‘Emperors of the online economy’

For more than five hours yesterday, U.S. lawmakers grilled Jeff Bezos,
Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg over [the power that their
companies
command](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html)
and the potential for abusing that power. Talk about [Zoom
fatigue](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/smarter-living/coronavirus-zoom-facetime-fatigue.html).
(Or, technically, Cisco Webex fatigue.)

**The chairman of the antitrust subcommittee set the tone early.**
Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, called Amazon,
Apple, Facebook and Google “emperors of the online economy” that “enjoy
the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and
enrich themselves while choking off competitors.”

**These moments stood out to us:**

• **Jeff Bezos of Amazon** faced questions about his company’s
relationships with third-party sellers. When Representative Pramila
Jayapal, the Democrat who represents Amazon’s district in Washington,
asked him whether the company misused sales data to develop products
that competes with those merchants, a rattled Mr. Bezos said, “I can’t
answer that question yes or no.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

• **Tim Cook of Apple** was confronted over his company’s iron-fisted
control of its App Store and whether its demands of other developers
were unfair. When Representative Jerry Nadler of New York asked whether
Apple’s pressing Airbnb and ClassPass for additional commissions for
sales made through their apps [constituted “pandemic
profiteering,”](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony)
Mr. Cook said the tech giant would “never” do that — but said some such
cases would require additional payouts to Apple.

• **Sundar Pichai of Google** confronted several questions about his
company’s dominance in advertising. The hearing began when Mr. Cicilline
said documents showed the tech giant sought to create “a walled garden
that increasingly keeps users within its sites.” Mr. Pichai responded,
“I’m really focused on giving users what they want.”

• **Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook** was presented with [awkward emails
that he sent
in 2012](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21345723/facebook-instagram-documents-emails-mark-zuckerberg-kevin-systrom-hearing)
to Facebook’s C.F.O. about acquiring smaller competitors, including
Instagram. “One way of looking at this is that what we’re really buying
is time,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Less than an hour after sending that
email, the Facebook founder sent another noting that, “I didn’t mean to
imply that we’d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in
any way.” Mr. Nadler pressed him hard on this.

**How they rated.** The C.E.O.s appeared virtually, beamed into the
hearing room where socially-distanced, masked lawmakers sat on a
wood-paneled stage. The Times’s Mike Isaac gave Mr. Bezos [the best
marks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony/tech-executives-looked-like-they-work-in-well-tech-offices)
for the quality of his setup: “8/10 for the cool Pacific Northwest dad
office vibes. Two points subtracted for his connectivity issues.” The
Times’s fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, [rated their
attire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/style/Bezos-zuckerberg-cook-pichai-testimony-suits.html),
noting that they “looked more like four guys dressed up in their first
graduation suits — serious, sincere, a little uncomfortable — than the
four horsemen of the digital apocalypse whose planetary power was a
threat to one and all.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**By the numbers.** Mr. Cook drew fewer questions from lawmakers than
the others, [as
compiled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony#heres-which-tech-ceo-was-asked-the-most-questions-by-lawmakers)
by The Times’s Kellen Browning. But Apple’s chief stood out for the
number of times he shifted attention to competitors, or to China,
arguing that their market power was more pressing: He employed this
tactic 13 times during the hearing, twice as often as Mr. Zuckerberg,
according to Kellen’s
calculations.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What the C.E.O.s** ***didn’t*** **say.** The website Protocol listed
[all the
questions](https://www.protocol.com/some-questions-big-tech-ceos-refused-to-answer)
that the executives responded to with some variation of “I’ll get back
to you on that.” Kellen notes that Mr. Pichai did this the most, 13
times, versus seven times for Mr. Zuckerberg and three each for Mr.
Bezos and Mr. Cook.

• Today, the executives will be on safer ground, as all four report
quarterly earnings after the market closes. Will they stick to
discussing income statements and balance sheets, or will they push back
on what was said during yesterday’s
proceedings?

## Here’s what is happening

**Pandemic unemployment benefits are set to expire on Friday.** The
extra $600 a week that many jobless workers in the U.S. [have relied
upon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus.html)
are likely to vanish after [President Trump
undercut](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/virus-aid-trump.html)
Senate Republicans’ effort to negotiate a coronavirus aid package with
Democrats.

**TikTok’s C.E.O. tried to reduce the political heat.** Kevin Mayer, the
video app’s American chief, offered to [open up some of its core
algorithms](https://www.axios.com/tiktoks-new-ceo-says-company-will-reveal-how-its-algorithms-work-aff01b6c-8f33-454f-9b4a-7d52292ce501.html)
to address concerns about its treatment of user data and ownership by a
Chinese tech giant. Republican lawmakers say a separate plan for TikTok
to sell a majority stake to Western investors [wouldn’t allay their
concerns](https://www.ft.com/content/45373b5e-0d7d-4478-9c72-525cfd541ec5).

**Big European corporates reported earnings.** It was a mixed bag:
**Airbus** reported [a big
loss](https://www.ft.com/content/c9e9b984-ff43-460e-97c9-75c5e481927b)
for the first half and vowed to conserve cash; **AstraZeneca** reported
a [26 percent rise in
earnings](https://www.ft.com/content/2def1ffd-186c-494c-b5e3-a9a9b2c429a8)
for its first half as sales of new drugs beat forecasts; **Credit
Suisse** [beat
expectations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-30/credit-suisse-revamps-trading-and-investment-bank-in-overhaul),
thanks to a surge in trading revenue; trading also aided **Shell**,
which reported [a smaller-than-expected
loss](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-30/shell-saved-from-a-dismal-second-quarter-by-oil-trading-gains),
and **Total**, which disclosed a surprise profit; and **Nestlé**
announced an [18 percent rise in first-half
profit](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nestle-profit-rises-but-sees-slower-growth-ahead-2020-07-30)
but warned of slowing growth for the rest of the year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Qualcomm struck a patent deal with Huawei.** The U.S. chip maker
announced that it had [settled a long-running licensing
dispute](https://www.wsj.com/articles/qualcomm-inks-licensing-deal-with-huawei-despite-u-s-china-tensions-11596059709)
at a time when the Trump administration has cracked down on the Chinese
tech giant. Shares in Qualcomm jumped 12 percent on the news.

**Ashley Judd can sue Harvey Weinstein for sexual harassment.** A panel
of judges [overturned a lower court’s
ruling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/media/judd-weinstein-lawsuit-appeal.html)
that the actress could not sue Mr. Weinstein for sexual harassment under
California law because Ms. Judd and the movie producer did not have a
specific business relationship at the time that she said the misconduct
took place.

## It’s going to be bad

The Commerce Department will today publish a preliminary estimate of
U.S. economic output for the second quarter. It’s expected to be the
worst result since quarterly G.D.P. statistics were first compiled more
than 70 years ago.

**How bad?** The headline number is expected to show that G.D.P. fell 35
percent in the second quarter. But that doesn’t mean that the economy
shrank by more than a third in just three months, [The Times’s Ben
Casselman
explains](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/us-gdp-report.html).
The U.S. reports these statistics using annualized rates, which amplify
short-term changes. In fact, G.D.P. is expected to be about 10 percent
smaller in the second quarter than it was in the first. (That would be
about the same as Germany, which reported [a 10.1 percent
decline](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/german-economy-suffers-biggest-slump-in-50-years)
in its G.D.P. this morning.) Still terrible, but not quite as
eye-popping.

**“The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of
the virus.”** Underscoring the economy’s fragility, [the Fed chairman
Jay Powell
noted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates.html)
at a news conference yesterday that containing the coronavirus was the
“fundamental” factor that would determine the path of growth in the
future. That path is “extraordinarily uncertain,” he said, adding that a
rebound in the labor market was “going to take a while.” In the
meantime, the central bank is “not even thinking about thinking about
thinking about raising rates.” (Compared with his last news conference,
that’s an extra “thinking about.”)

## The not-so painful C.E.O. pay cuts

As the pandemic hit, prompting waves of furloughs and layoffs, many
corporate leaders showed solidarity by cutting their pay. As it turns
out, it often wasn’t much of a sacrifice.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Two-thirds of C.E.O.s who reduced their pay took only a 10 percent hit
at most,** [The Times’s Peter Eavis
reports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/ceo-pay-pandemic-layoffs.html),
citing a study by the research firm CGLytics. The reductions typically
hit executives’ salaries, which form only a small part of their total
pay. (Stock awards and bonuses are usually much bigger parts of their
pay packages.)

**Here’s how some C.E.O.s fared, compared with what they earned in
2019:**

• **Ed Bastian** of Delta Air Lines took a 5.35 percent cut.

• **Oscar Munoz** of United Airlines took a 3 percent cut.

• **Bob Iger** of Walt Disney took a 3.3 percent cut.

• **Arne Sorenson** of Marriott took a cut of less than 2 percent.

• **Glenn Kelman** of the real estate brokerage Redfin took a $284,000
cut, worth 100 percent of his 2019
pay.

## What’s up with Kodak?

Its stock price, for starters. Shares in the erstwhile photography
pioneer soared in recent days as it [won a federal

to produce ingredients for coronavirus treatments. But the timing of the
trading has aroused suspicion.

**Kodak’s stock jumped more than 15 times higher** **this week,**

unsurprisingly, Kodak shares have become [a favorite of speculative day

**Some have cried foul,** pointing to heavy trading volumes ahead of
Kodak’s official announcement about the government loan. The Wall Street
Journal reports that there is an explanation: Kodak [had briefed news
outlets](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tweets-and-articles-sent-kodak-shares-surging-before-official-announcement-11596056729?mod=hp_lista_pos2)
