# How Pimco’s Cayman-Based Hedge Fund Can Profit From the Fed’s Rescue

Congress said borrowers in taxpayer-backed rescue programs had to be
from the United States. Wall Street has a workaround.

WASHINGTON — Pacific Investment Management Company runs a [hedge
fund](https://sec.report/Document/0001569540-16-000003/) registered in
the Cayman Islands, a common structure for avoiding certain U.S. taxes.
But when a profit opportunity arose from the ashes of America’s
[coronavirus
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus), that
international location did not stop it from seizing the moment.

The Federal Reserve opened a highly anticipated emergency lending
program in June, a revamped version of one it used during the 2008
financial crisis. This time around, [Congress
stipulated](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20059055/final-final-cares-act.pdf)
that only American companies can participate as borrowers in such
programs. Despite being offshore, Pimco’s fund had an easy way to
benefit.

The offshore fund is invested in an entity [registered in
Delawar](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/entitysearch/NameSearch.aspx)e.
That entity can be used by investment managers to buy and sell bonds.
The Delaware operation borrowed $13.1 million from the Fed program by
pledging a bundle of debt as collateral. Investors in the Cayman-based
hedge fund ultimately stand to profit from the transaction.

The Pimco example is not unique — other foreign investors have put money
into U.S.-based funds that are tapping the Fed program. That they found
a way to participate in a program restricted to American borrowers ****
highlights the potential for financial firms to make money from the
Fed’s market rescue programs, even if doing so means maneuvering
around congressional limitations on eligibility. Investors earned
double-digit returns on the program during the 2008 financial crisis and
they stand to profit this time around as well, as they collect interest
on the debt bundles and, thanks to the Fed’s cheap funding, pay very
little to hold them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Fed’s program is intended to keep credit flowing through the
economy, but its design has provided an opportunity for global financial
players to profit from **** an initiative backed by taxpayer funding.
That side effect could **** draw further scrutiny **** to **** the Fed’s
rescue efforts, which are already prompting questions from lawmakers
about who benefits, and on what terms.

The lending programs “drag the Fed into political crossfire,” said Mark
Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital and an author
of a book on the politics of the Fed. “The Fed is seen as the honest
broker in town — but just because you’re the honest broker today,
doesn’t mean you’re not going to face questions down the road.”

The goal of the Fed program in question, known as the Term Asset-Backed
Securities Loan Facility or TALF, is to bolster a critical corner of
U.S. debt markets, one where loans are bundled and sold off to investors
who are willing to take on risk in exchange for interest payments. That
helps to keep the market for commercial mortgages functioning, and
allows student loans and credit card debt to continue flowing to
end-users.

A fund can buy those securities using some combination of cash and
short-term loans and then take them to the Fed in exchange for a TALF
loan.

The TALF loan can be used to pay back whatever money the fund borrowed
to make the purchase in the first place, so that its holdings are
financed mostly by the cheap Fed loan, and a sliver of its own money
(what is known as a “haircut” in financial parlance). It essentially
earns the difference between what it makes in interest from the
securities and what it is paying on the Fed loan.

Because investors have just a small amount of money at stake, returns on
each invested dollar can be quite high. Investors said they anticipated
high single-digit returns in 2020, far lower than the double-digit
returns in 2008 but still generous.

The Fed has so far released detailed data only on TALF’s first round of
loans, though the program has since finalized [two more
round](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/term-asset-backed-securities-loan-facility/term-asset-backed-securities-loan-facility-rates)s.
The Fed will most likely release additional data in mid-August.

Pimco’s Cayman Islands-based fund, which has borrowed via a U.S.-based
entity called TOCU IX, is one of several foreign investors using an
American investment vehicle to gain access to TALF. The pension plan of
the Oxford University Press Group will tap the program through a fund
set up by the New York-based investment manager MacKay Shields. A
Singapore-based fund is a material investor in an offering by the giant
financial firm BlackRock, according to the Fed’s first round of
[detailed
disclosures](https://www.federalreserve.gov/reports-to-congress-covid-19.htm).

The fact that some investors based overseas can make money from TALF
does not break Congress’s rules, but it may fall shy of what some
lawmakers intended. They [specified
that](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr748enr/pdf/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf)
loans, advances and asset purchases made under the Fed’s programs should
be restricted to “businesses that are created or organized in the United
States or under the laws of the United States.” But they said nothing
about who could ultimately benefit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There are going to be people who focus on this like a laser,” Peter
Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton
School, said of the fact that foreign investors in some cases benefit
from Fed programs. But the reality, he pointed out, is that financial
markets are global.

“Others are going to say that there’s no way to provide liquidity
without benefiting international counterparties.”

And while Pimco’s fund and other foreign investors may profit by
participating in the program, their investment is also helping to keep
more money flowing into the Fed’s program, smoothing over U.S.
securitization markets.

That reality has presented a challenge for the Fed, which has had to
walk a fine line between creating emergency programs that are effective
while also making them politically palatable. Lawmakers want the Fed to
help the economy, but have also warned the central bank against allowing
companies to take advantage of taxpayer-backed funding.

When Republicans and Democrats were hammering out the details of their
coronavirus rescue package in March, congressional leaders agreed to
give the Treasury Department $454 billion to back up Fed emergency
programs.

The Fed requires a Treasury backstop for many of those efforts, to
insure against losses in case borrowers default. But because the Fed did
not expect to lose every dollar it lent out, it could use the $454
billion to field a huge rescue: potentially more than $4 trillion in
loans to businesses, states and cities.

The ability to supersize the coronavirus response package was an
attractive proposition. But many lawmakers in both parties were wary
about handing the Fed and the Treasury so much money. Many remembered
the 2008 bank bailouts and the bad taste they had left behind. They did
not want a
repeat.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and key lawmakers agreed to
terms that attached strings to the funding. Companies borrowing direct
loans might be asked to try to maintain their payroll. Those who
borrowed directly would also be banned from making dividend payments,
and executives would face compensation limits. Only U.S. companies could
borrow.

Those requirements are generally guidelines rather than binding rules,
given the way the programs work. The Fed has found itself being hammered
on both sides — some lawmakers have questioned whether the central bank
is precluding companies from using its programs by being too strict,
while others have warned it against letting big corporations and Wall
Street firms benefit.

Foreign investor participation in the TALF program could raise similar
questions from lawmakers and the oversight groups set up to police where
the funds are going. Mr. Conti-Brown and others say that while Congress
gave the Fed the room to make design choices, that will not insulate the
central bank from critique.

The fact that the Fed has discretion “is a byproduct of political
compromise,” Mr. Conti-Brown said. But “the Fed is always open to
criticism down the road.”
