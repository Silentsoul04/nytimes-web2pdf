Cover}\label{oprah-magazine-features-breonna-taylor-on-the-cover}}

To highlight racism and police violence, O: The Oprah Magazine gives its
cover to someone other than its founder for the first time.

O: The Oprah Magazine has covered a wide swath of American culture since
it started 20 years ago, but all of its 241 issues have had one thing in
common: Oprah Winfrey, the publication's founder and editorial director,
has been on the cover.

That will change with the
\href{https://www.oprahmag.com/life/a33449982/oprah-breonna-taylor/}{September
issue}, which will be available on newsstands Aug. 11. The new cover,
unveiled Thursday, features a portrait of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/breonna-taylor-police.html}{Breonna
Taylor}, a 26-year-old Black woman who was shot and killed by the police
in her home in Louisville, Ky., in March.

Ms. Winfrey started an essay for the issue with her name, writing:

``Breonna Taylor.

``She was just like me. She was just like you.''

Ms. Winfrey ended the essay by explaining why she had decided to give up
the cover spot of her namesake magazine: ``What I know for sure: We
can't be silent. We have to use whatever megaphone
\href{https://www.oprahmag.com/life/a32838616/white-privilege-lesson-black-lives-matter-movement/}{we
have to cry for justice.}

``And that is why Breonna Taylor is on the cover of O magazine.''

Along with George Floyd, the Black man who was killed by a Minneapolis
officer in May, Ms. Taylor has been a central figure for protesters who
have taken to the streets to demonstrate against racism and police
violence in recent months.

No criminal charges have been filed against the three Louisville Metro
Police Department officers who entered the home of Ms. Taylor, an
emergency medical technician, shortly after midnight on March 13.

Last month, Brett Hankison, one of the three officers, was fired. The
police chief, Robert Schroeder, accused him of violating the
department's policy on the use of deadly force, saying he had
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/us/breonna-taylor-brett-hankison-fired.html}{``wantonly
and blindly''} fired 10 shots into Ms. Taylor's home. The other two
officers were reassigned.

Ms. Taylor was shot at least eight times. She did not receive medical
attention for more than 20 minutes after she was struck, The Courier
Journal reported, citing police logs. The officers involved in the case
have said they identified themselves when they entered; Ms. Taylor's
boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was present, said the police did not
identify themselves.

The Louisville police said that Mr. Walker shot and wounded one officer
in the leg and charged him with the attempted murder of a police
officer. That charge was dismissed in May.

The idea of putting Ms. Taylor on the O cover was the brainchild of
Deirdre Read, the magazine's visual research editor, said Lucy Kaylin,
the editor in chief of O, in an email.

``I brought the idea to Oprah, who immediately said `YES,''' Ms. Kaylin
said.

On Wednesday, O's publisher, Hearst Magazines, and Ms. Winfrey announced
that O would discontinue regular print editions and become more
digitally focused. ``This is a natural progression for the brand,''
Kristen O'Hara, the Hearst Magazines chief business officer, said in a
statement. The company added that the December issue will be O's last
regular monthly print edition.

Average paid circulation for O has fallen over the years, from a high of
2.75 million shortly after its founding, in 2001, to 2.28 million in the
second half of last year, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.

On June 5, what would have been Ms. Taylor's 27th birthday, the hashtag
\#SayHerName was widely shared in a social media campaign that included
the participation of Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, and
Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California.

Ms. Winfrey invoked Ms. Taylor's full name frequently in her essay for
the issue, writing, ``Breonna Taylor treated all her friends like
besties. Breonna Taylor was a force in the life of her 20-year-old
sister. Breonna Taylor felt meaning and purpose in her work as an
emergency room technician.''
