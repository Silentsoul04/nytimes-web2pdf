Study
Finds}\label{johnson--johnsons-coronavirus-vaccine-protects-monkeys-study-finds}}

It's the second study in a week to report promising results in monkeys
for a vaccine candidate. But the real test will come with human trials
that are now underway.

An experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by Johnson \& Johnson
protected monkeys from infection in a new study. It is the second
vaccine candidate to show promising results in monkeys this week.

The company recently began a clinical trial in Europe and the United
States to test its vaccine in people. It is one of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{more
than 30 human trials} for coronavirus vaccines underway across the
world. But until these trials are complete --- which will probably take
several months --- the monkey data offers the best clues to whether the
vaccines will work.

``This week has been good --- now we have two vaccines that work in
monkeys,'' said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University
who was not involved in the studies. ``It's nice to be upbeat for a
change.''

But she cautioned that the new results shouldn't be used to rush
large-scale trials in humans. ``We just can't take shortcuts,'' she
said.

Unlike many other vaccines in development that might require two
injections, the Johnson \& Johnson candidate shielded the monkeys with
just one dose, according to a
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2607-z}{study}
published on Thursday in Nature.

``It's a very reassuring level of protection we saw,'' said Dr. Dan
Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston
and a co-author of the new study.

The study comes just two days after a similar one was published on a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html}{vaccine
tested by Moderna}and the National Institutes of Health.

But the two vaccines work in very different ways.

The Moderna vaccine delivers a kind of genetic material called
``messenger RNA'' into cells.

The cells use the vaccine RNA to produce a protein found on the surface
of the coronavirus, called spike protein, which then hopefully prompts
an immune response.

RNA-based vaccines are being tested for a number of diseases, but none
have yet been licensed for use in people.

In the Moderna study, researchers vaccinated monkeys by giving them two
shots spaced over four weeks. A month later, they infected the animals
with the coronavirus. In some of the vaccinated monkeys, researchers
could not detect the virus in the nose or lungs. In others, the virus
replicated slowly before disappearing.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/health/coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-janssen.html}{The
Johnson \& Johnson vaccine}, in contrast, is based on a virus called
Ad26, which researchers have modified so that it carries the coronavirus
spike protein gene. The Ad26 virus can slip into human cells, but cannot
replicate once inside them. Its host cell then uses the spike gene to
make the coronavirus proteins.

This month, European regulators approved Johnson \& Johnson's Ad26
vaccine for Ebola. It was the first time this kind of virus-assisted
gene delivery was approved for any disease.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/30/science/30VIRUS-MONKEYS2/30VIRUS-MONKEYS2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

In March, Dr. Barouch and his colleagues designed seven variants of an
Ad26 vaccine for the coronavirus. They made tiny changes to the spike
gene to see whether they could get cells to make more copies of the
viral protein. They also tested variants that would make the spike
protein more stable, which might prompt a stronger immune response.

Based
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-harvard.html}{on
earlier research}, Dr. Barouch and his colleagues suspected that the
Ad26 vaccine would be very potent. They decided to run their experiment
using just one dose, to see whether that was enough to provide immunity.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

After a single injection of the vaccine, they waited six weeks and then
infected the animals with the coronavirus. Six of the seven vaccine
variants offered monkeys partial protection against the coronavirus,
meaning that the virus replicated only at low levels in the animals.

The seventh version proved more powerful than the rest: Five out of six
monkeys that received it had no detectable viruses at all. The sixth had
only low levels in its nose.

``The fact that we could protect with a single shot in animal models was
quite a positive surprise to us,'' said Dr. Paul Stoffels, the chief
scientific officer of Johnson \& Johnson.

It was this best-performing vaccine that Johnson \& Johnson used last
week to begin its first human safety trial, a so-called Phase 1 trial.
If it goes well, the company hopes by September to enter Phase 3 trials,
which test not only whether the vaccine is safe, but also whether it
works.

The company plans on testing both single and double doses. Dr. Rasmussen
said that a vaccine that proved effective with a single dose would make
it far easier to treat the billions of people who need it.
``Theoretically, you would need less of it, so you give it to more
people more quickly,'' she said.

Inovio, a company developing a DNA-based vaccine, announced Thursday
that monkeys challenged four months after vaccination had a reduced load
of the virus in their nose and lungs. Their
\href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.225649v1}{report}
has not yet been published in a scientific journal.

AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have developed a vaccine based
on yet
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/world/covid-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{another
type of modified virus}, called ChAdOx1. In May, they released promising
monkey data, which was also
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2608-y}{published} on
Thursday in Nature. The team is now running Phase 3 trials in people,
which could produce results by October.

``It's exciting to see the number of platforms that are showing promise
for a vaccine,'' said Stacey L. Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis who was not involved in any of
the trials.
