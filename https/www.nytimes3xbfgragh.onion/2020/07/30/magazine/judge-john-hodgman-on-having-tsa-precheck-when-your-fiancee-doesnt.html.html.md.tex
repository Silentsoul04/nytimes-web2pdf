\textbf{Amber writes:} \emph{My fiancée has TSA PreCheck. When we travel
together, she leaves me in the regular security line while she zips
through. Recently while checking in, my partner pointed to me and asked
the TSA agent, ``Where's the line for regular people?'' Please order her
to go through normal security with me.}

I had PreCheck in the before-times. I'd always go through the regular
line when traveling with my family, but only because some of them are
children. While your fiancée was rude by pointing and scream-shaming
you, ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers''-style, I'm with her. She didn't
join PreCheck for extra time at the food court (though: bonus) but for a
slightly less humiliating security experience. It's not right that we
should trade our fingerprints to the government in exchange for keeping
our shoes on, but that's the world we live in until we break it and
build it again.
