Attention to the stranger crossing any road in any town or city;
patience with the awkward encounter, the unknown intention; respect for
the other whom you do not know, but with a slightest stretch of mind,
imagine you do. Tracy K. Smith's unforgettable poem from ``Wade in the
Water'' feels so potent right now. The pedestrian sees himself one way
--- hears his own music in those engines idling for him --- but who
doesn't? Take it easy. I am thunderstruck by the human care of these
last lines. \emph{Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye}

\emph{By Tracy K. Smith}

I watch him bob across the intersection,\\
Squat legs bowed in black sweatpants.

I watch him smile at nobody, at our traffic\\
Stopped to accommodate his slow going.

His arms churn the air. His comic jog\\
Carries him nowhere. But it is as if he hears

A voice in our idling engines, calling him\\
\emph{Lithe, Swift, Prince of Creation.} Every least leaf

Shivers in the sun, while we sit, bothered,\\
Late, captive to this thing commanding

\emph{Wait for this man. Wait for him.}
