<div class="css-53u6y8">

On an otherwise quiet pandemic Sunday, the unmistakable songs of the
Beatles started blaring from the roof of a building on the Upper West
Side. The band was belting out faithful renditions from the [1969
rooftop
concert](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beatles-famous-rooftop-concert-15-things-you-didnt-know-58342/)
in London — “Get Back,” “Don’t Let Me Down,” “I’ve Got a Feeling” — and
people stepped out onto their balconies and fire escapes to listen.

When the band finished, and Upper West Siders shut their windows and
headed back into their apartments, a 28-year-old Columbia University
physics grad student named Ben Markham stood on the roof savoring the
moment with a joint and beer.

“I was worried the cops might come,” he said. “If John was watching, I
hope he liked it.”

Mr. Markham moved to New York a year ago, and a week before he was
forced to move out of his apartment, he’d found the cover band, [the
Meetles](http://www.meetles.com/), on Craigslist, hiring them to play on
his building’s rooftop. The show was Mr. Markham’s unusual way of saying
goodbye to his first New York neighborhood.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a few days, he would become one of the last tenants to vacate a small
apartment building on West 74th Street that has been steadily emptying
out since the pandemic began. Last month, his landlord didn’t renew his
lease, because he’s apparently considering selling the building,
according to Mr. Markham, and so he was getting the boot. (He stressed
that his landlord worked with him to accommodate a smooth exit.) Mr.
Markham decided to commemorate his first strange year in New York City
with an absurdist send-off to himself.

But as Mr. Markham crushed more beers on his rooftop, he said that he
was also just trying to make life in the city a little bit more
interesting. He wanted to reclaim some of the crazy and colorful New
York that was promised but stolen away by the pandemic.

“When I got here a year ago, I realized that what everyone says about
New York is true,” said Mr. Markham. “The hype is real. It was like
being on line for a roller coaster. You wait and wait and wait. And then
it started raining really
hard.”

The rain, so to speak, began with the first signs of lockdown, and one
after the other, his roommates gradually all left to return home. Then
it was just him and another guy in the building. Mr. Markham says he’s
become only more resolved to stay here, and he’s now convinced of his
destiny to become a New Yorker.

“They all went back to mommy and daddy,” he said. “But New York is my
home now. The pandemic won’t stop me. I think I’ve maybe always been a
New Yorker, I just had to get here first.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Markham, who is from Jupiter, Fla., arrived in Manhattan last August
after serving in the Navy as a nuclear submarine officer aboard the
[U.S.S. Pasadena](https://www.csp.navy.mil/pasadena/About/) in San
Diego. He’d been accepted into Columbia University’s engineering school,
and soon after getting here, he immersed himself in the city’s colorful
tumult.

By spring, Mr. Markham was smitten with New York, seeing a kind of
mathematical poetry in it. “Physics is beautiful because it is
unpredictable and random,” he said. “I see that same beautiful chaos in
New York.”

Then, the pandemic gripped the city, and the New York he was getting
intimate with became bleak and barren overnight.

Couches got tossed on his street as people moved out. On Tinder,
conversations ended swiftly: “I’d try to meet up and they’d say, ‘Oh,
I’m with my parents in Connecticut. I’ll be here until it settles
down.’ I’d reply: ‘Uh, OK. Talk soon then, I guess.’” Soon, Mr. Markham
felt like he had been left alone on a ghostly Upper West Side.

To his surprise, he began appreciating the city anew. At night, he biked
through the empty canyons of Midtown. He set up a projector on his roof
and watched “[Yellow
Submarine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefJAtG-ZKI)” on the wall of
the building next door. One day, he walked into a nice neighborhood he’d
never visited before, and discovered it had its own [private
garden](https://gothamist.com/news/how-gramercy-park-became-a-private-playground-for-nycs-elite).

“It’s called Gramercy Park,” he said. “They have this special little
garden just to themselves. You need a key to get in, right? No, you
don’t. You just need a pair of legs and to be able to jump a fence.
And guess what? It’s just like any other
park.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

And then there’s his Beatles obsession.

Mr. Markham has had a morning ritual: a quarantine sanity stroll from
his apartment to the [Strawberry Fields
memorial](https://www.centralparknyc.org/attractions/strawberry-fields)
in Central Park, where he’d sit on a bench and strum Beatles songs on
his guitar. Sometimes, he’d stand outside the Dakota and its flickering
gas lanterns, and wonder what Lennon’s life was like in New York. Once,
he said, he played the riff to “Day Tripper” on the very spot Lennon was
murdered.

“I’ve been a Beatles fan my whole life,” he said. “I didn’t even realize
the Dakota was a couple blocks from me until after I moved in. The fact
that John died near me, and I had the opportunity to pay homage to him
in some way, with everything going on, it just made
sense.”

Well, it made sense to Mr. Markham, anyway.

At the rooftop concert, he invited a friend he made in the neighborhood,
Richard Wooley, 55, to watch the “Let It Be” show with him. Mr. Wooley
considered the newcomer’s choice to commit to New York.

“Does anyone get the New York they are promised?” Mr. Wooley asked. “I
praise people like Ben who have stuck it out, because this is how New
York will survive. He just got here, but maybe people like him are the
real New Yorkers.”

Last week, Mr. Markham finally settled into his new apartment, a sublet
in the East Village he’s sharing with three roommates. Tompkins Square
Park is just down the block and he’s already become fond of its resident
musicians and eccentrics and he said that the neighborhood has better
bars than the Upper West Side.

As it happens, August will mark Mr. Markham’s first full year in New
York.

“I think I’m still standing on line for that roller coaster,” he said.
“It’s still raining and I’m waiting for the next chapter. But the wait
has been beautiful in its own way, even in the rain.”
