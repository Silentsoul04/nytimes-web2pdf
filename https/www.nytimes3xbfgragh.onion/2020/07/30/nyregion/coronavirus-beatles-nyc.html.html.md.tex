A Columbia grad student, new to the city, lost his lease. So he
organized the perfect send-off.

On an otherwise quiet pandemic Sunday, the unmistakable songs of the
Beatles started blaring from the roof of a building on the Upper West
Side. The band was belting out faithful renditions from the
\href{https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beatles-famous-rooftop-concert-15-things-you-didnt-know-58342/}{1969
rooftop concert} in London --- ``Get Back,'' ``Don't Let Me Down,''
``I've Got a Feeling'' --- and people stepped out onto their balconies
and fire escapes to listen.

When the band finished, and Upper West Siders shut their windows and
headed back into their apartments, a 28-year-old Columbia University
physics grad student named Ben Markham stood on the roof savoring the
moment with a joint and beer.

``I was worried the cops might come,'' he said. ``If John was watching,
I hope he liked it.''

Mr. Markham moved to New York a year ago, and a week before he was
forced to move out of his apartment, he'd found the cover band,
\href{http://www.meetles.com/}{the Meetles}, on Craigslist, hiring them
to play on his building's rooftop. The show was Mr. Markham's unusual
way of saying goodbye to his first New York neighborhood.

In a few days, he would become one of the last tenants to vacate a small
apartment building on West 74th Street that has been steadily emptying
out since the pandemic began. Last month, his landlord didn't renew his
lease, because he's apparently considering selling the building,
according to Mr. Markham, and so he was getting the boot. (He stressed
that his landlord worked with him to accommodate a smooth exit.) Mr.
Markham decided to commemorate his first strange year in New York City
with an absurdist send-off to himself.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/01/nyregion/01nyrooftop-04/01nyrooftop-04-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

But as Mr. Markham crushed more beers on his rooftop, he said that he
was also just trying to make life in the city a little bit more
interesting. He wanted to reclaim some of the crazy and colorful New
York that was promised but stolen away by the pandemic.

``When I got here a year ago, I realized that what everyone says about
New York is true,'' said Mr. Markham. ``The hype is real. It was like
being on line for a roller coaster. You wait and wait and wait. And then
it started raining really hard.''

The rain, so to speak, began with the first signs of lockdown, and one
after the other, his roommates gradually all left to return home. Then
it was just him and another guy in the building. Mr. Markham says he's
become only more resolved to stay here, and he's now convinced of his
destiny to become a New Yorker.

``They all went back to mommy and daddy,'' he said. ``But New York is my
home now. The pandemic won't stop me. I think I've maybe always been a
New Yorker, I just had to get here first.''

Mr. Markham, who is from Jupiter, Fla., arrived in Manhattan last August
after serving in the Navy as a nuclear submarine officer aboard the
\href{https://www.csp.navy.mil/pasadena/About/}{U.S.S. Pasadena} in San
Diego. He'd been accepted into Columbia University's engineering school,
and soon after getting here, he immersed himself in the city's colorful
tumult.

By spring, Mr. Markham was smitten with New York, seeing a kind of
mathematical poetry in it. ``Physics is beautiful because it is
unpredictable and random,'' he said. ``I see that same beautiful chaos
in New York.''

Then, the pandemic gripped the city, and the New York he was getting
intimate with became bleak and barren overnight.

Couches got tossed on his street as people moved out. On Tinder,
conversations ended swiftly: ``I'd try to meet up and they'd say, `Oh,
I'm with my parents in Connecticut. I'll be here until it settles down.'
I'd reply: `Uh, OK. Talk soon then, I guess.''' Soon, Mr. Markham felt
like he had been left alone on a ghostly Upper West Side.

To his surprise, he began appreciating the city anew. At night, he biked
through the empty canyons of Midtown. He set up a projector on his roof
and watched ``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vefJAtG-ZKI}{Yellow
Submarine}'' on the wall of the building next door. One day, he walked
into a nice neighborhood he'd never visited before, and discovered it
had its own
\href{https://gothamist.com/news/how-gramercy-park-became-a-private-playground-for-nycs-elite}{private
garden}.

``It's called Gramercy Park,'' he said. ``They have this special little
garden just to themselves. You need a key to get in, right? No, you
don't. You just need a pair of legs and to be able to jump a fence. And
guess what? It's just like any other park.''

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

``Now everything is strange, but I like strange,'' he added. ``I'm
learning more about the city now than I was before.''

And then there's his Beatles obsession.

Mr. Markham has had a morning ritual: a quarantine sanity stroll from
his apartment to the
\href{https://www.centralparknyc.org/attractions/strawberry-fields}{Strawberry
Fields memorial} in Central Park, where he'd sit on a bench and strum
Beatles songs on his guitar. Sometimes, he'd stand outside the Dakota
and its flickering gas lanterns, and wonder what Lennon's life was like
in New York. Once, he said, he played the riff to ``Day Tripper'' on the
very spot Lennon was murdered.

``I've been a Beatles fan my whole life,'' he said. ``I didn't even
realize the Dakota was a couple blocks from me until after I moved in.
The fact that John died near me, and I had the opportunity to pay homage
to him in some way, with everything going on, it just made sense.''

Well, it made sense to Mr. Markham, anyway.

At the rooftop concert, he invited a friend he made in the neighborhood,
Richard Wooley, 55, to watch the ``Let It Be'' show with him. Mr. Wooley
considered the newcomer's choice to commit to New York.

``Does anyone get the New York they are promised?'' Mr. Wooley asked.
``I praise people like Ben who have stuck it out, because this is how
New York will survive. He just got here, but maybe people like him are
the real New Yorkers.''

Last week, Mr. Markham finally settled into his new apartment, a sublet
in the East Village he's sharing with three roommates. Tompkins Square
Park is just down the block and he's already become fond of its resident
musicians and eccentrics and he said that the neighborhood has better
bars than the Upper West Side.

As it happens, August will mark Mr. Markham's first full year in New
York.

``I think I'm still standing on line for that roller coaster,'' he said.
``It's still raining and I'm waiting for the next chapter. But the wait
has been beautiful in its own way, even in the rain.''
