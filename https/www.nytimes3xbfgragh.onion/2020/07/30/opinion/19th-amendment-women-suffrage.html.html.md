What better way to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage
than by discussing the way it turned out to be a big flop?

The great champions of the 19th Amendment thought that when America’s
women got the right to vote, they’d immediately start to change the
nation. Promote women’s issues, like better health care and education.
Refocus politics from special interests to the general good.

Then in 1920, for the first time, they went to polls across the nation
with their husbands, brothers, fathers and sons and elected — President
Warren Harding.

In 1921, Congress, with a wary eye on the newly enfranchised sex, passed
the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act. It was a
modest effort to improve health care for the poor by training nurses,
licensing midwives and establishing clinics for young mothers and their
babies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The physicians’ associations saw it as government-subsidized competition
— socialized medicine\! — and hated it. During debate on the bill, one
opponent claimed the sponsors were pandering to busybody old maids who
were always pushing do-gooder causes.

“Old maids are voting now,” a colleague reminded him.

But the doctors kept complaining, and as time passed, politicians began
to notice that they weren’t hearing much from the new female electorate.
In 1929, the act was repealed.

The Sheppard-Towner debacle was one of the best examples of how the
effects of women’s suffrage turned out to be more complicated than its
champions had imagined. Everything worked great when it came to the
title cause of giving women the right to vote. But the leaders of the
movement had expected to use the ballot to transform the nation. For a
very long time, nothing happened.

Well, except for Prohibition. Banning the sale of liquor was one cause
that really did bring the women together. Most of them didn’t drink, but
their husbands did. The upper-class men retired to the study or a club
after dinner to sip some liquor and have fun talking among themselves.
Poor men went off to a saloon to get soused, spending the family’s
much-needed cash.

Many American girls grew up believing that virtually every social evil
came from alcohol. [Frances
Perkins](https://francesperkinscenter.org/life-new/), the New Deal
secretary of labor, recalled that she was raised to believe that poverty
was just a result of drinking — and laziness.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Once Congress approved the 19th Amendment, the liquor lobbyists
stampeded to the state legislatures to try to stop ratification. They
won enough battles to leave suffragists one state short of victory and
only Tennessee left to vote. All eyes turned to Nashville.

The State Senate voted yes while virtually everybody in the capitol was
getting [swacked on the lobbyists’ free
samples](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/05/opinion/women-votes-feminism-alcohol.html).
Then it all came down to the House of Representatives, where the “no”
group had a one-man majority. On Aug. 18, 1920, a 24-year-old suffrage
opponent named Harry Burn got up and reported to his colleagues that
he’d gotten a letter from his mother telling him to “be a good boy”
and help the women’s cause.

“I know that a mother’s advice is always the safest for a boy to
follow,” he told his colleagues. And he switched his vote. Suffrage
ruled.

That was a great culmination, and much more fun to report than the slog
that preceded it. We will refrain from revisiting what suffragists
counted as 480 campaigns to get state legislatures to submit the issue
to the voters.

Some fights had been much, much easier than others. Lawmakers in Wyoming
had eagerly voted for the franchise in 1869, hoping it might be a draw
for a territory in which men outnumbered women six to one. “We now
expect quite an immigration of ladies to Wyoming,” said The Cheyenne
Leader hopefully after the legislature voted for women’s suffrage, as
well as women’s property rights and equal pay for women schoolteachers.

(There was nothing like being a rare commodity to raise the bar on
women’s opportunities. Back when the first male colonists were
settling into the New World, they wrote back advertising for female
émigrés, promising they would find a husband in a snap, as long as they
were “but civil and under 50 years of age.”)

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Wherever suffrage arrived, there were lots of women who resisted the
idea of getting involved. Election Day was, in many neighborhoods, a
rowdy time when political parties tried to encourage voter turnout with
— yes\! — free liquor. “Saloons, marching, drinking all day — voting
was seen as a very masculine act,” says Debbie Walsh of the [Center for
American Women and Politics](https://cawp.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers
University.

Theodore Roosevelt told a crowd of suffrage supporters he was the only
person in his family who agreed with their agenda, and urged them to “go
and convert my wife and daughters.” His young niece Eleanor was among
the unenthusiastic.

I don’t have to tell you that things changed. Women went to the polls
more and more with every generation. But politicians still presumed that
they’d vote with their menfolk unless something very unusual cropped up.

When Woodrow Wilson was up for re-election in 1916 his handlers did
worry about the “women’s vote” in the states where they already had the
franchise. The president’s wife had died during his first term of office
and Wilson rather quickly picked up with Edith Galt, the widow of a
prominent Washington jeweler. They wanted to marry right away, but
Wilson’s aides were afraid of how the news might affect the female
electorate. In the end, the answer was: not much.

Perhaps voters didn’t hear the gossip in political circles about what
was said to be a hot and heavy premarital affair. (The political
columnist Murray Kempton told me he heard a joke when he was a boy in
the 1920s, in which when the president proposed, Mrs. Galt was so
excited she fell out of bed. “I think my sainted mother told me that
one,” Kempton recalled.) After the Wilson engagement became official,
The Washington Post printed a social note containing one of the most
famous typos in American history: “The President gave himself up for the
time being to entering his
fiancée.”

OK, that’s just an interesting diversion. But Wilson won, and the
conviction that women were mainly just duplicating the votes of their
husbands or fathers held sway.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

You have to wonder, as the years went on, how many husbands were
actually reflecting their wives’ opinions when they went to the polls.
The balance of power within families has shifted dramatically over the
last 50 years, mainly because of money. The transformation began when
the country’s post-World War II economic boom hit the killer recession
of the 1970s, and everyone began to realize that a whole lot of the
families of the future would not be able to afford a middle-class
lifestyle unless the wives kept working.

The women’s movement combined with the hard facts of the economy created
a world in which almost no one envisioned young women with a distinctly
different wage-earning future from men. I’ll never forget a visit I made
to a community college in Connecticut, back around 1980. I was invited
for some reason to speak to a class of young men, and I asked them to
describe for me their ideal mate. There were a few polite murmurs about
a good sense of humor and fine moral character — then someone called
out, “And a good earner\!” I cannot tell you how enthusiastic the room
became over the “good earner” qualification.

It took professional politicians quite a while to notice there was a
change going on. Then in 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated
then-President Jimmy Carter, it became clear the country had moved on to
a whole new political wave. [Analysis of the final
tallies](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/ggpresvote.pdf)
showed that both sexes favored Reagan, but the women split very narrowly
while the men went Republican 55 percent to 36 percent. The gender gap
was born, and it really turned into a canyon in 1996, when Bill Clinton
won the women’s vote by a wide margin, while men narrowly favored Bob
Dole.

These days, women go to the polls more faithfully than men, and they are
more likely to vote Democratic. That doesn’t mean they always win. In
2000, women favored Al Gore for president over George W. Bush, 54-44
percent, while the men went for Bush, 54-43. In 2016, the male voters
gave us Donald Trump in an election where the gender gap yawned at 11
points.

But the power is there. Black women, who’ve fought dual battles against
racism and sexism to exercise their right to vote, knocked the socks off
Democratic organizers in Alabama in 2017 when they gave long-shot Senate
candidate Doug Jones [98 percent of their
vote](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/364665-exit-polls-98-percent-of-black-women-voted-for-jones)
and a victory over Republican former-judge-and-pursuer-of-teenage-girls
Roy
Moore.

If 1920s heroines like Susan B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells were around
now, they’d be setting their targets way higher than the voting booth.
We live in an era that’s beginning to find women running for office
almost as normal as Mom having a job outside the home. Nearly [a quarter
of our current Congress is
female](https://cawp.rutgers.edu/current-numbers), and the pace is
picking up all the time. I still remember in 2001 when Hillary Clinton
was sworn in to the Senate and my young niece innocently asked my sister
if men were allowed to be in the Senate, too. Susan B. Anthony would
have fainted with happiness.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Women who tearily discovered in 2016 that they weren’t going to be able
to introduce their daughters to the first woman president have mostly
gotten over it. If everything we think we know about the current
presidential race is reasonably true — and nothing crazy happens over
the rest of the campaign — next January the country will have a female
vice president, a woman who the voters trusted as second in command to
78-year-old Joe Biden.

“Women’s issues” — like guaranteed quality health care for all and
reproductive freedom — may still not have universal political support.
But they’re now political goals for a vast swath of the voting public,
both male and female. And maybe it won’t be too long before someone’s
little niece in the future innocently asks her mother whether men are
allowed to be president, too.
