# John Lewis’s Plea to Young Americans

</div>

Readers are moved by an Op-Ed piece he wrote days before his death,
urging people to “stand up for what you truly believe.”

**To the Editor:**

Re “[Together, You Can Redeem the Soul of Our
Nation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/opinion/john-lewis-civil-rights-america.html),”
by John Lewis (Op-Ed, July 30):

Working in Montgomery, Ala., I have walked on the trails that many of
our civil rights heroes forged and I have listened to the stories of
unspeakable violence but also unimaginable courage. But I have never
felt compelled to act — not until May 25. George Floyd was my Emmitt
Till. In those [8 minutes and 46
seconds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/george-floyd-timing.html),
I heard the cries of my ancestors that came before me and the cries of
my descendants to come. It was as if I could reach into the past and
stretch into the future to gain the strength I needed to say enough is
enough.

I encourage all people, regardless of race, to say enough is enough. We
as a people must, as John Lewis put it, get into good trouble, necessary
trouble. Mr. Lewis has given us his last(ing) words of wisdom, and to
me, these words have meaning, these words hold power.

We must not, as Mr. Lewis said, let fear constrain us like an imaginary
prison. Our nation, and indeed our world, deserves better. Now is the
time to embrace his words and to use them as a catalyst for change. We
can repair the soul of our nation, but we can do so only as a unified
force — as one nation.

Cassandra Cavness  
Prattville, Ala.

**To the Editor:**

Thank you so much for publishing this powerful call from John Lewis from
beyond the grave, exhorting us to continue the struggle for peace and
justice for all\! How can we ignore such an eloquent case made by one
who devoted his life and blood to this cause and lived this commitment
every day of his life?

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We all need to commit ourselves to emulate his example to continue the
struggle and not get weary, and we need to share this clarion call far
and wide until his and our goals for truth, justice and the American way
for all, regardless of race, color, creed or sexual orientation, are not
just a dream, but a reality.

Mary Maxwell Thomas  
Gurnee, Ill.

**To the Editor:**

When John Lewis died, I was sad but grateful for his service to my
country and his quest to make real the principles it was built upon.
When John Lewis’s body lay in state, I smiled and rejoiced at the sight
of so many Black faces in historically white halls of power. When I read
his piece in The Times, my face streamed with tears.

John Lewis called on young people to “answer the highest calling of your
heart.” I wish I knew how that appeal could reach those who need his
message of healing and inspiration the most — many of whom remain
maskless and clueless. When that message is widely broadcast, and we can
return to a time of more polite discourse and tolerance, we may see a
day when “peace finally triumphed over violence, aggression and war.”

May we all “walk with the wind,” young and old, and finally bring the
American experiment to life — in living color.
