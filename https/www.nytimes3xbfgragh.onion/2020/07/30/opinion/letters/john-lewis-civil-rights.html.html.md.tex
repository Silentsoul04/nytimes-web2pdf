\section{John Lewis's Plea to Young
Americans}\label{john-lewiss-plea-to-young-americans}}

Readers are moved by an Op-Ed piece he wrote days before his death,
urging people to ``stand up for what you truly believe.''

Re
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/opinion/john-lewis-civil-rights-america.html}{Together,
You Can Redeem the Soul of Our Nation},'' by John Lewis (Op-Ed, July
30):

Working in Montgomery, Ala., I have walked on the trails that many of
our civil rights heroes forged and I have listened to the stories of
unspeakable violence but also unimaginable courage. But I have never
felt compelled to act --- not until May 25. George Floyd was my Emmett
Till. In those
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/george-floyd-timing.html}{8
minutes and 46 seconds}, I heard the cries of my ancestors that came
before me and the cries of my descendants to come. It was as if I could
reach into the past and stretch into the future to gain the strength I
needed to say enough is enough.

I encourage all people, regardless of race, to say enough is enough. We
as a people must, as John Lewis put it, get into good trouble, necessary
trouble. Mr. Lewis has given us his last(ing) words of wisdom, and to
me, these words have meaning, these words hold power.

We must not, as Mr. Lewis said, let fear constrain us like an imaginary
prison. Our nation, and indeed our world, deserves better. Now is the
time to embrace his words and to use them as a catalyst for change. We
can repair the soul of our nation, but we can do so only as a unified
force --- as one nation.

\textbf{To the Editor:}

Thank you so much for publishing this powerful call from John Lewis from
beyond the grave, exhorting us to continue the struggle for peace and
justice for all! How can we ignore such an eloquent case made by one who
devoted his life and blood to this cause and lived this commitment every
day of his life?

We all need to commit ourselves to emulate his example to continue the
struggle and not get weary, and we need to share this clarion call far
and wide until his and our goals for truth, justice and the American way
for all, regardless of race, color, creed or sexual orientation, are not
just a dream, but a reality.

\textbf{To the Editor:}

When John Lewis died, I was sad but grateful for his service to my
country and his quest to make real the principles it was built upon.
When John Lewis's body lay in state, I smiled and rejoiced at the sight
of so many Black faces in historically white halls of power. When I read
his piece in The Times, my face streamed with tears.

John Lewis called on young people to ``answer the highest calling of
your heart.'' I wish I knew how that appeal could reach those who need
his message of healing and inspiration the most --- many of whom remain
maskless and clueless. When that message is widely broadcast, and we can
return to a time of more polite discourse and tolerance, we may see a
day when ``peace finally triumphed over violence, aggression and war.''

May we all ``walk with the wind,'' young and old, and finally bring the
American experiment to life --- in living color.
