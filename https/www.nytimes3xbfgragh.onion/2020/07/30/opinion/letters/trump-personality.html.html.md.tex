``Mr. Trump, you are unpopular because of your myriad shortcomings as a
leader, and not merely because of your personality flaws,'' a reader
says. Also: The solace of art.

Re
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/trump-nobody-likes-me-walks-out-briefing.html}{Weird
Science and Self-Pity From President During Briefing}'' (news article,
July 29):

How refreshing to hear Donald Trump actually show some understanding,
even if only partial. Trying to figure out why ``nobody likes me,'' Mr.
Trump concluded, ``it can only be my personality.''

Indeed, Mr. Trump, your personality does explain, albeit not completely,
your unpopularity. The very fact that you are discussing your
unpopularity at a briefing about a catastrophic virus is itself evidence
of the narcissism that partly explains that very unpopularity. Yet this
horrid behavior is itself insufficient to explain why you are held in
such low regard.

A more complete explanation would surely include a consideration of your
incompetence; your corruption; your general failure to grasp how
viruses, tariffs, science and a host of other things work; your sexism;
your homophobia; your support of white supremacists; your contempt for
the majority of your constituents; and countless other aspects of your
failed presidency.

In sum, Mr. Trump, you are unpopular because of your myriad shortcomings
as a leader, and not merely because of your personality flaws.

\textbf{To the Editor:}

What a breath of (virtual) fresh air to read
''\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/arts/design/massmoca-clark-art-museum.html}{Berkshires
Museums Are Beckoning},'' Jason Farago's July 24 Critic's Notebook on
his recent visit to two reopened Berkshire museums, the
\href{https://www.clarkart.edu/}{Clark Art Institute} and the
\href{https://massmoca.org/}{Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art}.
Both are superb venues with richly varied collections, and I recall my
own visits there with pleasure.

Most gratifying --- and surprising --- was Mr. Farago's candid
reflection on the solace and purpose of art. Favoring the tender and
evocative qualities of some of the Clark's paintings, he ventures a
truth that I thought I would never read in The Times: ``that art's
political power still derives, above all, from having no pragmatic
application. It can't fix the world.''

Indeed, at a time when the world seems wholly off-kilter, I suspect that
there are many like me who are not interested in turning our every
activity into a protest or a didactic lesson. In the arts, at least
occasionally, I am grateful, as Mr. Farago wrote, ``to be reminded what
to live for'' --- not given a lesson on how to live that life.
