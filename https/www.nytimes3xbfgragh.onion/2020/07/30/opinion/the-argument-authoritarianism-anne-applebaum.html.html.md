## When Conservatives Fall for Demagogues

### With Frank Bruni and Michelle Goldberg

#### A debate with “Twilight of Democracy” author Anne Applebaum.

Thursday, July 30th, 2020

</div>

  - frank bruni  
    I’m Frank Bruni.

  - michelle goldberg  
    I’m Michelle Goldberg. And this is “The Argument.” \[MUSIC PLAYING\]
    
    Today, our guest is writer and historian Anne Applebaum. We’ll talk
    about how authoritarianism became so appealing to conservative
    thinkers in the 21st century. \[MUSIC PLAYING\]
    
    Anne Applebaum’s latest book is “Twilight of Democracy: The
    Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism.” It’s part memoir, part history,
    the story of people she once called friends, anti-communist
    intellectuals and conservative defenders of liberal ideals who,
    during the Cold War, fought for things like an independent press and
    a free market. In recent years, these same friends have become foot
    soldiers in the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism in the
    West. I read the book and found it utterly fascinating, even though
    I disagreed with a big part of Applebaum’s premise. As I wrote in a
    recent column, “there’s no mystery in the right’s surrender to
    authoritarianism because for many of the people Applebaum describes,
    it wasn’t a surrender at all, it was a liberation.” Anne, not
    surprisingly, disagrees, writing on Twitter, “It is just as
    incorrect to write, quote, ‘conservatism always contained the seeds
    of authoritarianism,’ as it is to write progressivism always
    contained the seeds of authoritarianism.” It is an honor to get to
    debate it with her on the show today. Anne, welcome to “The
    Argument.”

  - anne applebaum  
    Thanks so much for talking to me.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Before you explain why you think my argument about your book is
    wrong, maybe you could just give a sense of the case that the book
    is making or the story that the book is telling.

  - anne applebaum  
    So first of all, to be clear, the book doesn’t really make a case.
    This isn’t a political science book.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Mmhmm.

  - anne applebaum  
    It doesn’t have a thesis. It’s not an op-ed column. It rather is a
    reflection on a series of events that I took part in or I was aware
    of or people that I knew over the last 20 and 30 years. My previous
    books were works of history in which I did lots of research, and
    then I tried to show a problem from lots of points of view. And this
    is really the opposite of that. It’s a very narrow and subjective
    view, including some events that I have a role in or I’m somehow
    implicated in or biased about. It’s about four countries, mostly
    about the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, with a big
    chunk about Hungary and some reflections on Spain. And it looks at
    the evolution of the right in all of those countries or the thing
    that used to be called the conservative movement or the center right
    or the Tories or the Polish Right or the Republican Party, and it
    observes that some people who used to think they were on the same
    side 20 or 30 years ago now are not. I start with a party at my
    house that took place in 1999. It was not a fancy party. And no,
    it’s not a book about parties or catering. That just was a
    metaphor that I used for this alliance.

  - michelle goldberg  
    No, it’s a cinematic intro.

  - anne applebaum  
    \[LAUGHING\] And I try to explain that some of the people who were
    at that party are now people who I no longer speak to and many of
    the other people at the party no longer speak to. And the reasons
    are not personal, they’re political. We’re now all on opposite sides
    of this very profound political divide in Poland, which is a very
    profoundly polarized country, some ways weirdly like the United
    States in which people live in alternate informational universes and
    don’t speak to each other and have a completely different view of
    the world. And so the book was a kind of reflection about how those
    deep divides happen, what causes polarization. There are a few
    historical references. I talk about the Dreyfus trial in France,
    which was a similarly polarizing moment in French history. I talk
    about division over Brexit, which was different in many ways from
    the Polish division, but also caused everybody to get mad at each
    other. And I tried to show what were some of the deeper reasons for
    these changes. Again, the book has no thesis. It doesn’t argue that
    there is one explanation, and it looks rather for historical echoes
    across countries rather than tying everything together in a neat
    knot. I spent a lot of time, like you both do, writing op-ed columns
    that have to end with a single paragraph saying, x is y, \[BRUNI
    LAUGHS\] and therefore we should do z. And it was really a relief in
    this book to write something in which, no, sorry, I’m not going to
    tie up all the loose ends for you. You’re just going to have to
    figure it out yourself.

  - michelle goldberg  
    It was really striking to me, your use of Fritz Stern’s “The
    Politics of Cultural Despair” to sort of diagnose some of what you
    were seeing on the contemporary right. Stern was a history professor
    and a refugee from Nazi Germany who wrote about conservative
    intellectuals. So I also used “The Politics of Cultural Despair” to
    try to diagnose the contemporary right, but I did it in a book that
    came out in 2006. So I’m just going to put this quote out there that
    I used to try to explain what was going on in George W. Bush’s
    re-election campaign in 2004. “The ideologists of the conservative
    revolution superimposed division of national redemption upon the
    dissatisfaction with liberal culture and with the loss of
    authoritative faith. They posed as the true champions of nationalism
    and berated the socialists for their internationalism and the
    liberals for their pacifism and their indifference to national
    greatness.” And so I guess this is maybe the heart of our
    disagreement, right? I mean, I think I agree with you obviously
    about the horrors of Trumpism, but I do see it as more of a sort of
    evolutionary maybe inevitability of trends that were certainly
    present in the American right through most of my adult life as
    opposed to this real break with what had previously been known as
    conservatism. One of the things I saw specifically when I was
    covering George W. Bush’s re-election in 2004 was a lot of talk
    about the, quote unquote, “homosexual agenda” as a kind of
    totalizing ideology. So when I read what you’ve written about, the
    use of anti-gay prejudice almost as a kind of conspiracy theory in
    Polish politics, that seemed really familiar to me.

  - anne applebaum  
    So I’m not really disagreeing with you about that. I don’t think
    it’s incorrect to say that some of the seeds of what we’re seeing
    now were present 15 or 20 years ago. I think my disagreement is that
    I believe that the anti-communist movement, which is, remember, the
    book begins at a slightly different moment, not in 2007, but in
    1999, and it’s reflecting on an earlier period, which is the late
    1980s and early 1990s. I’m arguing that the anti-communist movement
    in that period had different components, and people were
    anti-communist for different reasons. Some of them were
    anti-communist because they believed in Realpolitik and they were
    worried about Soviet nuclear weapons, OK? And some people were
    anti-communist because they cared about democracy and human rights
    and the rule of law. And there were some people who were
    anti-communist because they were Christians and the Soviet Union was
    Marxist and atheist, and therefore they were against it for that
    reason. And one of the things that I trace in the book is this idea
    that that coalition over time break up. I think I even say at one
    point that it was probably artificially held together by 9/11, which
    kind of kept some people on the same team for longer than they might
    have been anyway. I mean, you could even argue that it was breaking
    up by the end of the ‘90s in the United States. And the same is true
    in Poland, where the anti-communist movement in Poland had people in
    it whom you would describe as left-wing. There were a lot of
    anti-communist children of communists and so on. As these different
    bits of it broke up, some people went in one direction and some
    people went in another. So I’m not actually disagreeing about that.
    I mean, I think what I’m disagreeing about is your implication that
    this was somehow inevitable, that, of course, the right would end up
    like that because the right was always authoritarian, and that’s
    what it was about. That I disagree with. If you’d been looking at
    the left in the 1980s, you might have been able to make that same
    argument. I was actually looking for a copy of my own book, which I
    can’t seem to find, which is my history of the Gulag that was
    published in 2004.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Right.

  - anne applebaum  
    And in the introduction to that book, I talk a little bit about the
    communist tolerant part of the Western left, which chose to ignore
    and dismiss and downplay the existence of Soviet concentration camps
    because it was politically inconvenient. There was a piece of the
    left that was always also charmed by authoritarianism and tempted by
    extremism. Well, that’s also in my new book a little bit too. But if
    I’d said at that time, well, of course, it was inevitable that the
    left will therefore from this moment develop into an authoritarian
    movement, I would have been wrong. I mean, it could have been that
    those elements took over the left, and actually in one or two
    countries they did.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Right.

  - anne applebaum  
    The point is that these movements were, particularly in the United
    States where we’re cursed with our two party system, these movements
    are coalitions, and I was simply dissecting what happened to the
    right-wing coalition or the center right coalition that I felt
    myself to be a part of and clearly no longer do. I simply don’t
    think that Trumpism was some kind of inevitability, that it had to
    be that way because that was the way the party was going. That there
    are these elements of cultural despair of deep pessimism about
    American society of fear and anxiety caused by modernity and
    technological change and social change, that that is all present on
    the right right now, of course, it’s absolutely true. I write about
    it all the time, and it’s part of my book. What I don’t agree with
    is that retrospectively colors all anti-communists as
    proto-authoritarians, which would be ridiculous.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Oh, I don’t think— no, I mean, I don’t think it retrospectively
    colors all anti-communists as proto-authoritarians. I just think —
    and I think that this comes out in your book — that the segment of
    that coalition that was genuinely concerned about human rights and
    democracy is smaller than, I think, people would have admitted at
    the time.

  - anne applebaum  
    I mean, depends on which country, and it depends which time we’re
    talking about. A lot of this is also to do with who won power and
    how and when. The anti-liberal or anti-democratic part of the Polish
    right, for example, was a fringe minority for 25 years, which had
    very little influence on Polish politics and was not even really
    visible. And even the Law and Justice party, which is now the ruling
    party, it was very briefly in power once before for a year and a
    half, and it exhibited a much more limited and narrow and less
    ambitious version of what it’s doing now. It was still then a
    coalition that contained a wide range of people. Even the Law and
    Justice president, who was the one who died in the tragic plane
    crash, was somebody who cared a lot about the rule of law, for
    example, and polish judges and so on, and it’s hard to imagine him
    presiding over this destruction of the judicial system that’s taking
    place now. So that’s around 2005. Even then, they were the truly
    anti-democratic anti-pluralist piece of the party was a fringe piece
    of the extreme. And that it has now moved to the center is the drama
    of the current story.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, I kept on wondering as I was reading you, when you look at the
    group of you on the right, conservatives, however you want to call
    yourselves, when you look at your kind of wide group of friends and
    acquaintances, not just in Poland, but also in Britain and the
    United States, and I assume you had some in Hungary as well, and you
    kind of observe who drifted readily, or at least eventually, toward
    the lure of authoritarianism or some of these more nativist
    administrations or governments, and who, like you, resisted or like
    the Never Trumpers here, what are the kind of character or logical
    or socioeconomic differences, what distinguishes the people who
    decided to go along versus the people who said, no way?

  - anne applebaum  
    So first of all, to be clear, there are no sociological differences.
    I mean, we are talking about elite people. We’re talking about
    educated sophisticated people who were not damaged by Poland’s
    post-communist resurgence. Quite the contrary. I hesitate to
    generalize because one of the things I liked about this book is
    that, unlike as in writing columns, I didn’t really have to
    generalize. I could just focus on a few people. But very often in
    Poland, a lot of the people that I’m talking about are people who,
    for one reason or another, became dissatisfied. I mean, so for
    example, in Poland with the post-communist state. And sometimes they
    were dissatisfied for political reasons, and often they were
    dissatisfied for personal reasons. So they personally had not
    prospered to the degree to which they felt they should have done.

  - frank bruni  
    Right.

  - anne applebaum  
    And so there is a quality of resentment, a feeling that the wrong
    people have risen to power, the wrong people are achieving
    prominence. Our business class is not the right kind of people. So
    there’s a feeling that the wrong people have somehow won or are
    somehow in charge. And you can look back through history, and the
    sort of classic profile of the revolutionary is somebody who’s part
    of the elite, but not on top. So look at Lenin. Lenin came from the
    Russian aristocracy, but the lowest rung of the aristocracy, right?
    And then his family even dropped out of the aristocracy after his
    brother was sentenced as a revolutionary, and he has fantastic
    resentment, even though he’s not from the working class. He’s not
    the poorest part of the country, but he has this feeling of
    resentment against Russia’s rulers. OK, the Russian revolution is a
    more complicated story than that. It wasn’t all about Lenin’s
    personal psychosis. I don’t want to keep going with that analogy.
    I’m just saying that if you do look back, you do find that a lot
    of radicals often fit that profile. And I think even in the U.S.,
    Laura Ingraham, who I write about at some length, isn’t somebody
    that I do know that well. She doesn’t really count as a friend. She
    was just somebody I met a few times. And we have some mutual friends
    and so on, but I’m not close to her. But she is somebody who I know
    was always very resentful of the fact that her achievements weren’t
    more recognized. So she also has that quality of resenting the
    elite, which she is also somehow part of. I mean, to say that she’s
    not an elite is ridiculous. I mean, she’s —

  - michelle goldberg  
    Did you ever read her book about what an elite is?

  - anne applebaum  
    I read several of her books. I can’t remember.

  - michelle goldberg  
    She wrote this book in 2003 where she basically defines elitism as a
    state of mind that sort of has nothing to do—

  - anne applebaum  
    With your actual—

  - michelle goldberg  
    —with class.

  - anne applebaum  
    —class. Yeah, right. Right.

  - michelle goldberg  
    So it’s kind of this bizarre fantasmagorical version of elitism in
    which a person with the right politics can never, by definition, be
    part of the elite.

  - anne applebaum  
    Right. So she has defined herself as somebody — even though she’s
    extremely wealthy, television presenter with millions of social
    media followers and a huge fan base, and a large house and all that,
    she nevertheless defines herself as being somehow anti-elite, which
    is, of course, ridiculous.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Right.

  - anne applebaum  
    If you’re asking what people like that have in common, this is often
    it. There’s some element of resentment or a feeling of outsiderism.

  - michelle goldberg  
    But do you think she’s changed? Because in your book, you sort of
    associate her with this optimistic post-Cold War milieu of Reaganism
    and people who felt like we won, and now we’re going to go on to
    keep winning. Whereas when I look at her history, I mean, starting
    with Dartmouth where she is the editor of this school newspaper with
    Dinesh D’Souza, where they become famous for trying to humiliate gay
    students by sending an undercover reporter to the gay student
    group’s meeting and publishing excerpts of things that people
    talked about. Her book in 2003 is obviously extremely resentful and
    nationalist. I guess I don’t see a Laura Ingraham that was at one
    point different or better than the one that we see today.

  - anne applebaum  
    No, I’m not sure that Laura Ingraham was ever different or better.
    Her views about the world have certainly changed. I mean, she has a
    much different view of American foreign policy. She has a different
    analysis of American history than she once had. I’m not intimate
    with her. I don’t know her well enough to tell you exactly all the
    components of it, although I tease it apart a little bit in the
    book. But that she was an anti-communist at a time when other people
    on the left weren’t is true. And so I probably gave her more credit
    for that than she deserved in the ‘80s and ‘90s. But to me, that was
    a really important quality, and it remained an important quality for
    me for a long time.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, I want to say something very cynical and ask something very
    cynical, but these last years have made me pretty cynical, which is,
    you used the verb “prospered” before. You were just talking about
    Laura Ingraham’s views have changed. I find myself wondering as we
    talk about resentment as a motivating factor, the size of the chip
    on someone’s shoulder, to what extent do they actually have
    convictions that change in ideologies, or are they just grabbing
    onto the winning formula that puts them on the top of the team or in
    the winner’s circle or make sure that they prosper? I mean, are they
    just kind of choosing horses rather than, in fact, evolving
    ideologically?

  - anne applebaum  
    Some of them. I mean, some of them are deeply cynical. So one other
    person who I talk about in the book who won’t be familiar to
    American listeners is a Hungarian woman called Maria Schmidt, whom I
    suspect of deep and profound cynicism. She’s somebody who has a
    number of both business and political interests in Hungary, and
    she’s made great efforts to stay on the right side of the current
    ruling party and is now one of their chief propagandists, even
    though I know that in earlier eras she was more doubtful about them.
    And I suspect her of being profoundly cynical. So one of the things
    that I tried to argue in the book is that, again, the human
    personality is very complex, and people can be motivated by more
    than one thing. And some people are motivated by an idealism or an
    ideology or politics, and some people are motivated by personal
    ambition. Some people are motivated by resentment. Some people are
    motivated by the pleasure in seeing their enemies squirm. And some
    people are, as you say, profoundly cynical, and sometimes those
    qualities dominate at different moments. I mean, I actually end the
    book with this discussion of cynicism and nihilism, and I say that
    this is the really dangerous sentiment for liberal democracy is
    that. Because once people become cynical and once they think it’s
    all a game and it doesn’t matter who wins, then you do begin to lose
    the virtue of the state, and then you really are open for all kinds
    of extreme politics. But yeah, I mean, are they cynical? Some of
    them really are, yes.

  - michelle goldberg  
    But there’s also a relationship, right, between kind of doubt and
    fanaticism. If you’re going to insist on something that on some
    level you know it not to be true, it’s likely to make you more
    histrionic and more sort of uncompromising.

  - anne applebaum  
    I think there’s a quote in the book that I’m not going to be able to
    recite to you off the top of my head, but it’s a quote actually that
    comes from a guy who was a young communist in Poland in the 1940s,
    Jacek Trzynadel. And he described in a famous memoir that he wrote
    years later, he described what it felt like to be talking to a crowd
    of people. People are shouting and cheering, and he was lecturing
    the crowd whatever, support our Marxist state. I mean, I’m just
    making up what he said. I don’t remember the exact thing. And he
    writes, the more I was shouting, the more I was doubting what I was
    saying. Did I really believe what I was shouting? And I felt I had
    to shout louder not just to convince the crowd, but to convince
    myself.

  - frank bruni  
    I think I was talking a little bit about something else, which is
    just rank opportunism. We were talking moments ago about Laura
    Ingraham. One of her Fox News colleagues Tucker Carlson, if you go
    back and you listen to Tucker Carlson 15, 20 years ago, he doesn’t
    sound exactly or really all that much like he sounds now. And his
    voice has evolved in relationship to where he’s gotten the largest
    audience, the most traction, the most power. And Donald Trump, I
    mean, does any one of us really believe that Donald Trump has an
    intrinsic and abiding ideology versus a set of hunches and instincts
    about which direction to turn in to maximize the adulation and the
    purchase on power?

  - michelle goldberg  
    But actually, Frank, I mean, I would say I actually think that
    racism is pretty deep in Donald Trump and is as close to a sincere
    belief as he’s possible of holding.

  - anne applebaum  
    So actually, Tucker Carlson, who I didn’t write about, but is
    probably a better example, as you say, of somebody who has changed
    very profoundly. David Frum has a thesis about Carlson, which is
    that it was because what he really, really, really, really always
    wanted to do was be on television and be good at television. He
    tried various television projects, and they kept failing. And then
    finally, he hit on the formula that would win him millions of fans,
    and that was this kind of strange racist, nationalist, nativist
    language that is designed to appeal to mobs of like thinkers in
    America and that that was what finally brought him fame and glory,
    and that’s why he’s sticking with it. And so, yes, that would be an
    example of really sort of pure opportunism and a kind of nihilism.
    And that, as I say, is one of the enemies of good politics.

  - frank bruni  
    But where would you put Trump, Anne? Is Trump more Tucker or more
    Lenin? \[GOLDBERG AND APPLEBAUM LAUGH\]

  - anne applebaum  
    Actually, a bit of — \[LAUGHS\] golly, that’s not a question I ever
    thought I was going to have to answer.

  - frank bruni  
    It’s not a question I ever thought I’d ask. \[BOTH LAUGH\]

  - anne applebaum  
    So, I mean, actually, you can see elements of both. I mean, think
    about it. Trump is somebody who he’s very rich. He’s on the front
    page of tabloids. And yet, is he ever really accepted by the New
    York elite who he resents? Is he accepted by the real movers and
    shakers, the real bankers and businessmen in New York? Do they see
    him as a real player? I mean, no, they don’t. I mean, for all I
    know, he may be deeply resentful of the people who look down on him
    because he was vulgar and so on. So he may well fit into that sort
    of, in that sense, the Leninist category, and at the same time be
    someone who, as Michelle said, is somebody who just has this
    instinct for kind of negative publicity. He understands how to move
    crowds and how to appeal to really base instincts. So he’s somebody
    you can see both of those aspects in.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Now, one of the things that I think is really valuable about your
    book is its kind of international scope. So it’s not just about what
    happened to the Republican Party. But to me, one of the questions
    that keeps — this may be a provincial question, but compared to
    maybe if Hungary is the worst case scenario out of all of the
    countries that you’re writing about in this book, possibly followed
    by Poland, these are both countries where, as you write about,
    there’s sort of a conspiracy at the very center of the government.
    Where do you see the United States on that trajectory? How far are
    we from Poland, or how far are we from Victor Orbán’s Hungary?

  - anne applebaum  
    So this may sound very bizarre, and I accept that it’s my own weird
    provincialism, and it’s my strange perspective as an American who
    lives at least part of the time in Poland. I think the United States
    and Poland are really similar in the sense that I do think that
    Trump came to power also on the back of a conspiracy that all of us
    — including me, but also many other people — underrated, which was
    the conspiracy of birtherism. And it’s now sort of forgotten because
    so many things have happened, that this was the moment when he
    really broke into national politics was by being the kind of the
    loudest spokesman for birtherism. And what was birtherism? It was
    the argument that the president of the United States is
    illegitimate. He’s not even American. And this argument had a
    tremendous amount of power and was believed by an enormous number of
    people. I saw a statistic once, it’s between 20 percent and 30
    percent of Americans believed this to be true. Now, think about what
    that means. If the president is illegitimate, that means that
    everybody — the media, the courts, the Congress, the civil service —
    everybody is lying to you. So the entire state is covering up this
    fact that the president is an illegal outsider and should not be
    president at all. If you believe that, OK, then you are ready for
    all kinds of radical changes and all kinds of radical politics
    because you have come to doubt all of the institutions of your
    democracy.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Oh, that’s really interesting. So that creates much more of a kind
    of — I don’t think that I’ve thought before that there is such a
    through line between birtherism and then the deep state conspiracy.

  - anne applebaum  
    Oh, absolutely. No, no, I mean, the use of conspiracy theories and
    conspiracy thinking by Trump is very similar to the way this was
    used in Poland and where it’s been used in other places. And by the
    way, throughout history, OK? The Bolsheviks were great conspiracy
    theorists. And the way in which he used it and the way in which he
    has consistently sought to undermine public trust in a range of
    institutions — the deep state, the fake news media, the judges who
    are really Mexicans, they’re not Americans — all that language used
    over and over. Some of it I think he does in a calculating way and
    some of it is instinctive. I mean, this is genuinely, I think,
    probably how he sees the world. All of this has built up and
    amplified the existing lack of trust in American society and helped
    to undermine people’s faith in institutions. I mean, if you think
    American democracy is so rotten that we had a president for eight
    years who wasn’t even American and it was all lied to us, then
    you’re willing to see all kinds of things overthrown. Then what do
    you care about the State Department being decimated or the Inspector
    General of the C.I.A. being fired? Why should you care? All those
    people, it’s so obvious that all of it is corrupt. And this is
    something that Trumpism has in common with the way politics are done
    not just in Poland, but in Brazil and in many other countries.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, I ask you this because you are a student, a scholar of
    authoritarians and authoritarianism, and because I suspect it’s a
    question that’s on a lot of our listeners’ minds. Donald Trump,
    let’s say he loses in early November. Do you think there’s a real
    possibility that he rejects the results? And what does that look
    like? And if he wins, what do you suspect the next four years look
    like?

  - anne applebaum  
    So those are two different questions. I mean, first of all, I think
    it’s almost certain that he is going to question the results. He’s
    said so already. He’s been asked point blank, will you accept the
    result? And he’s refused to say yes. So I think that is a clear
    possibility. It’s something everybody should be prepared for. It may
    be that there is a very easy solution to that if it happens, and the
    solution is I think Biden himself has said, well, on January the
    20th, he’ll walk into the White House, and the Secret Service will
    escort Mr. Trump out because Trump will have trouble fighting the
    legality of it. But that doesn’t mean that he can’t cause an
    enormous amount of trouble or do an enormous amount of damage by
    campaigning around the country between November and January and
    saying that the election was rigged and seek once again to use
    conspiracy theory to move people and prepare them for some other
    political project still to come. And so, yes, it’s possible. But I
    should also say that I also think it’s possible he’ll try to cheat
    in other ways. I mean, I think the attempt to undermine absentee
    ballots, the hints that he might undermine the work of the post
    office so that it couldn’t deliver absentee ballots, I mean, all of
    that is preparing both to try and cheat and to prevent people from
    voting, and also to begin to make the case that the election was
    rigged. So it is highly possible he’ll do that. Second question —
    well, no, sorry, your second question was about what if he wins.

  - frank bruni  
    If he wins, is that it? Are we on a fast track, an express train to
    authoritarianism?

  - anne applebaum  
    So if he wins, I mean, the main difference between Trump’s first
    term and Trump’s second term will be the kinds of people working for
    him. Because if you remember, in the early part of his presidency,
    there were still people working for him who believed they were there
    to do something good and they were there to protect the institutions
    of the United States. And although I’ve criticized James Mattis, I
    do accept that he thought that what he was doing there was making
    sure that the army was OK and that elements of U.S. foreign policy,
    like our relationship with allies, were maintained. And a number of
    people who worked for Trump in the beginning had that commitment to
    the institutions and to democracy. In Trump’s second term, there
    will be no such people. And so the government, the institutions will
    be run by people who are intent on destroying what they can and who
    will do so rather aggressively. And yes, I do think that would cause
    an enormous crisis in American democracy.

  - frank bruni  
    The other scenario is Biden wins, Trump leaves voluntarily or is
    escorted out. What then happens to the authoritarian fervor that he
    has cultivated during his four years when he’s out of office?

  - anne applebaum  
    So this is a really interesting question, and one that I have been
    talking to people about. Most think that — and these are mostly
    ex-Republicans, but people who know the party quite well — most
    people think that everything depends on how he loses. So if he loses
    by a lot, if it’s a wipeout, if the Republican Party loses the
    Senate and if it loses even more seats in the House, then it is
    possible that a part of the party leadership will say we’re right,
    that was a big disaster, and that was a really bad idea. And
    Trumpism was a road to nowhere, and it’s a road to an ever-shrinking
    base. And therefore, there will be an election or an argument inside
    the party, and a new kind of leader will be chosen. And then as
    somebody said to me recently, and then there’s at least a chance
    that we get rid of this authoritarian or we push to the fringes this
    authoritarian streak in the Republican Party. It doesn’t mean that
    we will, but it means that then there’s a chance. If the election is
    very close, on the other hand, if Trump loses very slightly, if the
    Republicans retain the Senate, and if the party still feels that
    this kind of rhetoric and this kind of language is a winning ticket,
    then the next presidential candidate may well be Tucker Carlson or
    Don Jr. \[BRUNI LAUGHS\] or Ivanka or someone who —

  - frank bruni  
    So if it’s Tom Cotton, we’re lucky, right?

  - anne applebaum  
    If it’s Tom Cotton, you’re lucky.

  - frank bruni  
    That’s actually — \[APPLEBAUM LAUGHS\]

  - anne applebaum  
    Or Mike Pompeo. I mean —

  - frank bruni  
    Ugh.

  - anne applebaum  
    — there’s a range of people who will be competing for the role of
    the next and possibly more efficient and more intelligent Trumpist
    leader. And so then we are in a real national conundrum because then
    we have one political party which is not dedicated to playing by the
    rules of the game, and then the kind of polarization that we’ve had
    will continue and get worse. And then we will find ourselves in the
    position of having every four years a kind of electoral moment of
    crisis.

  - michelle goldberg  
    So obviously, a lot of these trends that we’re talking about in
    other countries predate the election of Donald Trump. But I’m
    curious how you think the — I mean, collapse isn’t the right word,
    but the kind of damage incurred to the ideal of liberal democracy in
    America has empowered authoritarianism in other countries and how
    the sort of fate of this election will then— the echoes that will
    have in other countries that have basically argued that liberal
    democracy has failed, that it was a joke, that its time is over.

  - anne applebaum  
    So the election of Donald Trump, the re-election of Donald Trump,
    would have an enormous negative impact around the world, and it
    would absolutely empower other authoritarians, both sitting ones,
    whether in Russia or in China, for that matter, or in the Middle
    East, as well as aspiring ones in other countries that are current
    democracies. And this is both by the power of example. Trump and his
    language are quoted and imitated by people all over the world. I
    mean, for example, his use of the expression “fake news” to
    undermine the media is one that has been picked up and repeated by
    dozens of other authoritarian leaders or would-be authoritarian
    leaders. I mean, the other part of the story is that the
    authoritarian right, the new radical right around the world has deep
    links. There are deep financial links. There are deep links, kind of
    organic links on social media. These groups of people speak to one
    another. They share one another’s memes. They communicate in
    different ways across borders. And the influence of the American
    alt-right on the European far right or the international alt-right
    is quite profound and vice versa. I think they influence one
    another. And there is no question that the re-election of Donald
    Trump would embolden and motivate those different groups who, as I
    say, are speaking to one another all the time anyway and help them
    propagate their ideas further.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, can I ask you a meta question, so to speak? In the very title
    of your book Twilight of Democracy and I think sort of the subtext
    of a lot of the discussion that we’re all having here today is this
    notion that the trend line is away from democracy. The trend line is
    toward, very scarily, authoritarianism. I just want to kind of play
    devil’s advocate maybe in a very hopeful vein. Poland just had an
    election. I believe— you can correct me if I’m wrong — was the
    closest election since the end of communism. And in fact, the
    authoritarian government barely won. You go back to 2016. Trump got
    almost 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton did in the popular
    vote. He won only after Russian interference, only after a late in
    the game assist from Jim Comey, and possibly also because so many
    people were so convinced the outcome was predetermined in Hillary
    Clinton’s favor that they didn’t rouse themselves to vote. And since
    then, almost every metric, almost every measure, almost every
    election has suggested the limits of Trump’s appeal. Is it possible
    that what we’re seeing in Poland and what we’re seeing in America
    is, at the end of the day, a blip, he asked hopefully.

  - anne applebaum  
    I mean, maybe. I, too, hope that that’s the correct interpretation.
    And our country and other countries have overcome even worse crises
    before. I mean, the Civil War was a pretty big blip on the history
    of American democracy. It was a moment of total collapse, and
    somehow we nevertheless recovered from that with some caveats. I
    think one of the reasons I wrote the book and one of the reasons I
    concluded it the way I did is that what I don’t want is for
    Americans to become complacent, for us to say, well, our democracy
    is so great and so strong and our Constitution is so fantastic, and
    we’re a superpower. I don’t have to try that hard to make sure that
    everything goes well in our country, and it’s all going to go back
    to how it was eventually. And anyway, Poland is far away, and they
    are central Europeans, and they have nothing to do with us. I mean,
    I really believe that it is that conviction of inevitability which
    was the big mistake, I should say, of my entourage or my milieu, my
    friends in the ‘90s. There was a kind of complacency that now that
    we’re on this road to democracy, nothing can take us back. Because
    that is wrong. Countries do reverse themselves, and they do cease to
    be democracies. And we are going through a really extraordinary
    moment of technological and informational and demographic and social
    change, and changes make society very volatile and all kinds of
    outcomes are possible. And I don’t want people to be complacent or
    certain that we will somehow go back to everything being the way it
    was before, and you don’t have to really do anything about it or
    worry about it. because it’s that feeling of inevitability that
    turned out to be wrong.

  - michelle goldberg  
    So I think we will end it there. And even though we have some
    disagreements about the nature of pre-Trump conservatism, it was a
    pleasure to read “The Twilight of Democracy.” It’s a fascinating
    book, and I’m thrilled that you came on the show. Thank you so much.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, thank you so much for your time and your thoughtfulness.

  - anne applebaum  
    Oh, thanks for talking to me.
    
    \[MUSIC PLAYING\]

  - frank bruni  
    And we’re back. Michelle, what did you think?

  - michelle goldberg  
    So I think that she’s extraordinarily brilliant obviously. And it’s
    often funny when you disagree with someone on Twitter in a column,
    and then you end up talking and you find out you agree more than you
    might have thought. And I should say that Anne Applebaum is someone
    who her willingness to kind of call out authoritarianism on the
    right certainly didn’t begin with Trump. Something I probably should
    have brought up is that she was at one time a big fan of John
    McCain, who refused to vote for him, I think very honorably, in 2008
    because he put Sarah Palin on the ticket, right? And Sarah Palin’s
    rise to prominence was in a lot of ways a premonition of what we’re
    living through now. And so one of the things that is so interesting
    about this moment is how you end up being in political coalitions
    with people that you never could have imagined, right? It’s such a
    reminder of how long life is. That it would have been hard enough
    for me to imagine maybe being on the same side as Anne Applebaum in
    2000 or 2003, never mind David Frum and Bill Kristol. But one of the
    things I wrote in my piece is that I think a lot of people on the
    left are very, very suspicious of Never Trump conservatives, and I
    really admire them because they’ve really sacrificed something to
    stand up to him. And they’ve sacrificed more than I’ve had to or
    more than people on the left have had to just in terms of the
    fissuring of personal relationships, professional networks, right? I
    mean, I think it’s really not easy to turn your back on the social
    and political world that you’ve lived your whole life in.

  - frank bruni  
    What you just described or what you just talked about is actually
    where I get my hope during these dark times. And what I mean by that
    is, you’re right, you and Anne Applebaum agree more than you
    disagree, and that becomes clear when you talk with each other, and
    you have made temporary whatever kind of partnership with people
    whom you didn’t expect to. I think that if I’m going to be an
    optimist, one thing that could come out of all of this — and our
    conversation with Anne reacquainted me with this optimism — is that
    we can focus on what unites us more than what divides us.
    Understanding what a threat Trump is, being so deeply offended by
    some of the divisions he’s exploited and the ways he’s governed has
    reminded so many people from various points of the political
    spectrum of what they have in common and of how overlapping their
    fundamental values are in so many ways. Don’t you think?

  - michelle goldberg  
    I guess, but I really wonder if that’s more of an elite phenomenon,
    right? That sort of people who make their living by kind of arguing
    and writing in the search for truth and good faith argumentation are
    sort of necessarily in this moment on the same side. Instead of kind
    of politics— I’ve written this before. Instead of politics being a
    war of ideas, the people who takes ideas seriously are aside in
    politics. I think if you look at the country as a whole, I don’t see
    how you look out at America right now and say that this is a country
    where people are more aware of what unites them than divides them. I
    mean, to me, it looks like a country that’s coming apart at the
    seams.

  - frank bruni  
    I mean, it looks and feels that way. And yet, I don’t think it’s
    just an elite phenomenon. I mean, if I flash back over the last
    couple of years, once Trump had been in office for a while and the
    offenses had mounted and mounted and mounted, the number of times
    somebody in a store, in a fast food restaurant, wherever, has kind
    of set an aside, an aside of disgust that lets me know that they’ve
    developed the same reservations or deep concerns that someone
    writing op-ed pieces and simply using a different vocabulary is
    expressing. I mean, that happens all the time. And I look more
    recently — and I think this has been so fascinating and hopeful — I
    look at the polls regarding how Americans feel about Black Lives
    Matter and where that puts them in opposition to Trump, and I see an
    overwhelming majority of Americans coming together with the same
    idea of justice and rejecting Donald Trump. And —

  - michelle goldberg  
    No, I think you’re right that Donald Trump has created — and I think
    Jemele wrote about this, right, that Donald Trump has created, I
    don’t know if it’s a silent majority, but he’s definitely created
    a fairly solid anti-Trump majority.

  - frank bruni  
    Again, when I want to wear my optimist hat, I think Donald Trump in
    the long run, if things turn out better and not worse, I think
    Donald Trump has shown us who we don’t want to be.
    
    At the end of the conversation with Anne, we talked in what I found
    to be a very fascinating manner about various scenarios. Trump
    barely loses. Trump loses big. Trump wins. Beyond all of those,
    there’s a scenario where he loses, we move on. And again, this is my
    hope. This is me at my most hopeful and optimistic. Call me
    Pollyanna. We remember what Donald Trump did to us. We remember what
    he showed us in terms of the kind of America we don’t want to be.
    And maybe we’re the better for it.

  - michelle goldberg  
    So I think that’s certainly a possibility, right? I mean, if you
    look at all the reforms that you saw after Richard Nixon, I mean,
    most of them stood up fairly well until Donald Trump dismantled
    them. But there was not just this huge wave after, this huge
    Democratic wave that followed Nixon’s resignation, but a whole
    flurry of lawmaking to try to solidify accountability, solidify
    transparency, solidify democratic institutions. I think it’s going
    to be really, really important that people keep pushing on that.
    When Barack Obama first became president, there were people who
    wanted some sort of accountability for the people who had both
    misled the country into war under George W. Bush and also the people
    responsible for the financial crisis. And I understand why Obama,
    facing all these interlocking crises, thought that it was the time
    to sort of look forward rather than backward. But I think that was a
    mistake in retrospect, and it would be a fatal mistake if,
    inshallah, Biden becomes president. I think it will be really
    important to have something— I don’t know if it’s a Truth and
    Reconciliation Commission, if it’s a commission in the Justice
    Department — to sort of expose both the kind of instances of
    corruption and lawlessness that we maybe half know about. And I’m
    sure there are a lot that we don’t know about, right? I’m sure there
    are a lot of utterly corrupt phone calls with foreign leaders as bad
    as the one with the president of Ukraine that we just haven’t heard
    about. And so I think it’ll be really, really important to figure
    out the places where norms need to be replaced by laws.

  - frank bruni  
    I suspect we will be excavating the muck of the Trump administration
    for decades to come. I just hope that excavation begins sooner
    rather than later. \[GOLDBERG LAUGHS\] But we should probably wrap
    it up there, Michelle. It’s just you and me this week, which means
    50/50 chance that you’re going to be the one doing the
    recommendation. And I just tossed a coin. Heads it’s you. What’s
    your recommendation this week?

  - michelle goldberg  
    So I am going to recommend — it’s not a new book. I’m going to
    recommend an old book that I’ve been thinking about a lot recently
    and that I recently re-read, Milan Kundera’s “The Joke.” So I don’t
    know about you, but I have a lot of these books that I feel like
    have been really formative, and yet at the same time I can barely
    remember. But I decided to reread “The Joke” recently because we’ve
    been, or I’ve been at any rate, embroiled in this discussion over
    cancel culture, which even though I don’t like the phrase cancel
    culture, it seems somewhat inescapable, and sort of what it means to
    be publicly shamed, what it means for a ideological movement to
    enforce its boundaries. And when I see people kind of cast out, I
    often think of this book.

  - frank bruni  
    What is the storyline of “The Joke“?

  - michelle goldberg  
    OK, so the storyline of “The Joke” is there is a young communist in
    Czechoslovakia in the ‘40s, a very ardent communist, but somebody
    with a sort of slightly ironic temperament, who has a crush on this
    girl who is kind of earnest to a fault. And he teases her by sending
    her this jokey postcard — hold on, I’ll just get the actual line
    because I have it underlined here. \[PAGES FLIPPING\] So he teases
    her by sending her this jokey postcard that says, “Optimism is the
    opium of the people. A healthy atmosphere stinks of stupidity. Long
    live Trotsky.” And this postcard, this joke, ends up completely
    derailing his life. He’s drummed out of the party, drummed out of
    the university. He’s sent to go work in the mines. So in some ways,
    this is not at all comparable to what we talk about when we talk
    about cancellation, right? Because the sort of horror of it is that
    it has the power of the state behind it. And sometimes I think that
    people my age and older, those of us who grew up on Milan Kundera
    and books like it, there are certain rhetorical modes that signal to
    us authoritarianism. And we see them on Twitter and maybe overreact
    because what was so frightening about them was that they had the
    power of the state behind them. And yet at the same time, I think he
    sort of really captures the emotional experience, or what I imagine
    to be the emotional experience, of being sort of drummed out of a
    movement that you identify with. Because the significant thing about
    Ludvik is that he really is a communist, and so he really does
    identify with the people who are casting him out. He doesn’t really
    want to be a dissident. I’ll just quote this line: “I came to
    realize that there was no power capable of changing the image of my
    person lodged somewhere in the supreme court of human destinies. But
    this image, even though it bore no resemblance to me, was much more
    real than my actual self, that I was its shadow and not it mine.” I
    think that line captures some of what happens when people become
    reduced to either the worst thing that they’ve ever said or
    someone’s impression of the worst thing that they ever said.

    It’s so interesting to hear you describe it, Michelle, because one
    of the more celebrated novels to come out in the last six months and
    one of the novels I most recently read is called “A Burning.” I’m
    going to probably mispronounce the author’s name, for which I
    apologize, but her name is Megha Majumdar, and it’s set in India.
    And I’m realizing how timeless, what stamina the story you’re
    describing from “The Joke” has. It is, again, about someone who,
    with a single communication, miscommunication, call it what you
    will, is branded forevermore and becomes a convenient object of
    analysis, demonization, caricature, whatever, for the society around
    her. So this is clearly a story that, regardless of epoch of decade,
    speaks to certain eternal verities of human nature.

  - michelle goldberg  
    I had heard of that book, but I hadn’t realized that that was what
    it was about. But now I’m gonna — we can make that a recommendation
    too because I’m going to order it.

  - frank bruni  
    But this is your week. Your recommendation again is?

  - michelle goldberg  
    My recommendation is Milan Kundera’s “The Joke.” That’s our show
    this week. Thanks for listening. “The Argument” is a production of
    The New York Times opinion section. The team includes Phoebe Lett,
    Paula Schumann, and Pedro Rafael Rosado. Special thanks to Brad
    Fisher and Kristin Lin. See you next week. \[MUSIC

## When Conservatives Fall for Demagogues

### With Frank Bruni and Michelle Goldberg

#### A debate with “Twilight of Democracy” author Anne Applebaum.

Thursday, July 30th, 2020

  - frank bruni  
    I’m Frank Bruni.

  - michelle goldberg  
    I’m Michelle Goldberg. And this is “The Argument.” \[MUSIC PLAYING\]
    
    Today, our guest is writer and historian Anne Applebaum. We’ll talk
    about how authoritarianism became so appealing to conservative
    thinkers in the 21st century. \[MUSIC PLAYING\]
    
    Anne Applebaum’s latest book is “Twilight of Democracy: The
    Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism.” It’s part memoir, part history,
    the story of people she once called friends, anti-communist
    intellectuals and conservative defenders of liberal ideals who,
    during the Cold War, fought for things like an independent press and
    a free market. In recent years, these same friends have become foot
    soldiers in the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism in the
    West. I read the book and found it utterly fascinating, even though
    I disagreed with a big part of Applebaum’s premise. As I wrote in a
    recent column, “there’s no mystery in the right’s surrender to
    authoritarianism because for many of the people Applebaum describes,
    it wasn’t a surrender at all, it was a liberation.” Anne, not
    surprisingly, disagrees, writing on Twitter, “It is just as
    incorrect to write, quote, ‘conservatism always contained the seeds
    of authoritarianism,’ as it is to write progressivism always
    contained the seeds of authoritarianism.” It is an honor to get to
    debate it with her on the show today. Anne, welcome to “The
    Argument.”

  - anne applebaum  
    Thanks so much for talking to me.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Before you explain why you think my argument about your book is
    wrong, maybe you could just give a sense of the case that the book
    is making or the story that the book is telling.

  - anne applebaum  
    So first of all, to be clear, the book doesn’t really make a case.
    This isn’t a political science book.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Mmhmm.

  - anne applebaum  
    It doesn’t have a thesis. It’s not an op-ed column. It rather is a
    reflection on a series of events that I took part in or I was aware
    of or people that I knew over the last 20 and 30 years. My previous
    books were works of history in which I did lots of research, and
    then I tried to show a problem from lots of points of view. And this
    is really the opposite of that. It’s a very narrow and subjective
    view, including some events that I have a role in or I’m somehow
    implicated in or biased about. It’s about four countries, mostly
    about the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, with a big
    chunk about Hungary and some reflections on Spain. And it looks at
    the evolution of the right in all of those countries or the thing
    that used to be called the conservative movement or the center right
    or the Tories or the Polish Right or the Republican Party, and it
    observes that some people who used to think they were on the same
    side 20 or 30 years ago now are not. I start with a party at my
    house that took place in 1999. It was not a fancy party. And no,
    it’s not a book about parties or catering. That just was a
    metaphor that I used for this alliance.

  - michelle goldberg  
    No, it’s a cinematic intro.

  - anne applebaum  
    \[LAUGHING\] And I try to explain that some of the people who were
    at that party are now people who I no longer speak to and many of
    the other people at the party no longer speak to. And the reasons
    are not personal, they’re political. We’re now all on opposite sides
    of this very profound political divide in Poland, which is a very
    profoundly polarized country, some ways weirdly like the United
    States in which people live in alternate informational universes and
    don’t speak to each other and have a completely different view of
    the world. And so the book was a kind of reflection about how those
    deep divides happen, what causes polarization. There are a few
    historical references. I talk about the Dreyfus trial in France,
    which was a similarly polarizing moment in French history. I talk
    about division over Brexit, which was different in many ways from
    the Polish division, but also caused everybody to get mad at each
    other. And I tried to show what were some of the deeper reasons for
    these changes. Again, the book has no thesis. It doesn’t argue that
    there is one explanation, and it looks rather for historical echoes
    across countries rather than tying everything together in a neat
    knot. I spent a lot of time, like you both do, writing op-ed columns
    that have to end with a single paragraph saying, x is y, \[BRUNI
    LAUGHS\] and therefore we should do z. And it was really a relief in
    this book to write something in which, no, sorry, I’m not going to
    tie up all the loose ends for you. You’re just going to have to
    figure it out yourself.

  - michelle goldberg  
    It was really striking to me, your use of Fritz Stern’s “The
    Politics of Cultural Despair” to sort of diagnose some of what you
    were seeing on the contemporary right. Stern was a history professor
    and a refugee from Nazi Germany who wrote about conservative
    intellectuals. So I also used “The Politics of Cultural Despair” to
    try to diagnose the contemporary right, but I did it in a book that
    came out in 2006. So I’m just going to put this quote out there that
    I used to try to explain what was going on in George W. Bush’s
    re-election campaign in 2004. “The ideologists of the conservative
    revolution superimposed division of national redemption upon the
    dissatisfaction with liberal culture and with the loss of
    authoritative faith. They posed as the true champions of nationalism
    and berated the socialists for their internationalism and the
    liberals for their pacifism and their indifference to national
    greatness.” And so I guess this is maybe the heart of our
    disagreement, right? I mean, I think I agree with you obviously
    about the horrors of Trumpism, but I do see it as more of a sort of
    evolutionary maybe inevitability of trends that were certainly
    present in the American right through most of my adult life as
    opposed to this real break with what had previously been known as
    conservatism. One of the things I saw specifically when I was
    covering George W. Bush’s re-election in 2004 was a lot of talk
    about the, quote unquote, “homosexual agenda” as a kind of
    totalizing ideology. So when I read what you’ve written about, the
    use of anti-gay prejudice almost as a kind of conspiracy theory in
    Polish politics, that seemed really familiar to me.

  - anne applebaum  
    So I’m not really disagreeing with you about that. I don’t think
    it’s incorrect to say that some of the seeds of what we’re seeing
    now were present 15 or 20 years ago. I think my disagreement is that
    I believe that the anti-communist movement, which is, remember, the
    book begins at a slightly different moment, not in 2007, but in
    1999, and it’s reflecting on an earlier period, which is the late
    1980s and early 1990s. I’m arguing that the anti-communist movement
    in that period had different components, and people were
    anti-communist for different reasons. Some of them were
    anti-communist because they believed in Realpolitik and they were
    worried about Soviet nuclear weapons, OK? And some people were
    anti-communist because they cared about democracy and human rights
    and the rule of law. And there were some people who were
    anti-communist because they were Christians and the Soviet Union was
    Marxist and atheist, and therefore they were against it for that
    reason. And one of the things that I trace in the book is this idea
    that that coalition over time break up. I think I even say at one
    point that it was probably artificially held together by 9/11, which
    kind of kept some people on the same team for longer than they might
    have been anyway. I mean, you could even argue that it was breaking
    up by the end of the ‘90s in the United States. And the same is true
    in Poland, where the anti-communist movement in Poland had people in
    it whom you would describe as left-wing. There were a lot of
    anti-communist children of communists and so on. As these different
    bits of it broke up, some people went in one direction and some
    people went in another. So I’m not actually disagreeing about that.
    I mean, I think what I’m disagreeing about is your implication that
    this was somehow inevitable, that, of course, the right would end up
    like that because the right was always authoritarian, and that’s
    what it was about. That I disagree with. If you’d been looking at
    the left in the 1980s, you might have been able to make that same
    argument. I was actually looking for a copy of my own book, which I
    can’t seem to find, which is my history of the Gulag that was
    published in 2004.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Right.

  - anne applebaum  
    And in the introduction to that book, I talk a little bit about the
    communist tolerant part of the Western left, which chose to ignore
    and dismiss and downplay the existence of Soviet concentration camps
    because it was politically inconvenient. There was a piece of the
    left that was always also charmed by authoritarianism and tempted by
    extremism. Well, that’s also in my new book a little bit too. But if
    I’d said at that time, well, of course, it was inevitable that the
    left will therefore from this moment develop into an authoritarian
    movement, I would have been wrong. I mean, it could have been that
    those elements took over the left, and actually in one or two
    countries they did.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Right.

  - anne applebaum  
    The point is that these movements were, particularly in the United
    States where we’re cursed with our two party system, these movements
    are coalitions, and I was simply dissecting what happened to the
    right-wing coalition or the center right coalition that I felt
    myself to be a part of and clearly no longer do. I simply don’t
    think that Trumpism was some kind of inevitability, that it had to
    be that way because that was the way the party was going. That there
    are these elements of cultural despair of deep pessimism about
    American society of fear and anxiety caused by modernity and
    technological change and social change, that that is all present on
    the right right now, of course, it’s absolutely true. I write about
    it all the time, and it’s part of my book. What I don’t agree with
    is that retrospectively colors all anti-communists as
    proto-authoritarians, which would be ridiculous.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Oh, I don’t think— no, I mean, I don’t think it retrospectively
    colors all anti-communists as proto-authoritarians. I just think —
    and I think that this comes out in your book — that the segment of
    that coalition that was genuinely concerned about human rights and
    democracy is smaller than, I think, people would have admitted at
    the time.

  - anne applebaum  
    I mean, depends on which country, and it depends which time we’re
    talking about. A lot of this is also to do with who won power and
    how and when. The anti-liberal or anti-democratic part of the Polish
    right, for example, was a fringe minority for 25 years, which had
    very little influence on Polish politics and was not even really
    visible. And even the Law and Justice party, which is now the ruling
    party, it was very briefly in power once before for a year and a
    half, and it exhibited a much more limited and narrow and less
    ambitious version of what it’s doing now. It was still then a
    coalition that contained a wide range of people. Even the Law and
    Justice president, who was the one who died in the tragic plane
    crash, was somebody who cared a lot about the rule of law, for
    example, and polish judges and so on, and it’s hard to imagine him
    presiding over this destruction of the judicial system that’s taking
    place now. So that’s around 2005. Even then, they were the truly
    anti-democratic anti-pluralist piece of the party was a fringe piece
    of the extreme. And that it has now moved to the center is the drama
    of the current story.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, I kept on wondering as I was reading you, when you look at the
    group of you on the right, conservatives, however you want to call
    yourselves, when you look at your kind of wide group of friends and
    acquaintances, not just in Poland, but also in Britain and the
    United States, and I assume you had some in Hungary as well, and you
    kind of observe who drifted readily, or at least eventually, toward
    the lure of authoritarianism or some of these more nativist
    administrations or governments, and who, like you, resisted or like
    the Never Trumpers here, what are the kind of character or logical
    or socioeconomic differences, what distinguishes the people who
    decided to go along versus the people who said, no way?

  - anne applebaum  
    So first of all, to be clear, there are no sociological differences.
    I mean, we are talking about elite people. We’re talking about
    educated sophisticated people who were not damaged by Poland’s
    post-communist resurgence. Quite the contrary. I hesitate to
    generalize because one of the things I liked about this book is
    that, unlike as in writing columns, I didn’t really have to
    generalize. I could just focus on a few people. But very often in
    Poland, a lot of the people that I’m talking about are people who,
    for one reason or another, became dissatisfied. I mean, so for
    example, in Poland with the post-communist state. And sometimes they
    were dissatisfied for political reasons, and often they were
    dissatisfied for personal reasons. So they personally had not
    prospered to the degree to which they felt they should have done.

  - frank bruni  
    Right.

  - anne applebaum  
    And so there is a quality of resentment, a feeling that the wrong
    people have risen to power, the wrong people are achieving
    prominence. Our business class is not the right kind of people. So
    there’s a feeling that the wrong people have somehow won or are
    somehow in charge. And you can look back through history, and the
    sort of classic profile of the revolutionary is somebody who’s part
    of the elite, but not on top. So look at Lenin. Lenin came from the
    Russian aristocracy, but the lowest rung of the aristocracy, right?
    And then his family even dropped out of the aristocracy after his
    brother was sentenced as a revolutionary, and he has fantastic
    resentment, even though he’s not from the working class. He’s not
    the poorest part of the country, but he has this feeling of
    resentment against Russia’s rulers. OK, the Russian revolution is a
    more complicated story than that. It wasn’t all about Lenin’s
    personal psychosis. I don’t want to keep going with that analogy.
    I’m just saying that if you do look back, you do find that a lot
    of radicals often fit that profile. And I think even in the U.S.,
    Laura Ingraham, who I write about at some length, isn’t somebody
    that I do know that well. She doesn’t really count as a friend. She
    was just somebody I met a few times. And we have some mutual friends
    and so on, but I’m not close to her. But she is somebody who I know
    was always very resentful of the fact that her achievements weren’t
    more recognized. So she also has that quality of resenting the
    elite, which she is also somehow part of. I mean, to say that she’s
    not an elite is ridiculous. I mean, she’s —

  - michelle goldberg  
    Did you ever read her book about what an elite is?

  - anne applebaum  
    I read several of her books. I can’t remember.

  - michelle goldberg  
    She wrote this book in 2003 where she basically defines elitism as a
    state of mind that sort of has nothing to do—

  - anne applebaum  
    With your actual—

  - michelle goldberg  
    —with class.

  - anne applebaum  
    —class. Yeah, right. Right.

  - michelle goldberg  
    So it’s kind of this bizarre fantasmagorical version of elitism in
    which a person with the right politics can never, by definition, be
    part of the elite.

  - anne applebaum  
    Right. So she has defined herself as somebody — even though she’s
    extremely wealthy, television presenter with millions of social
    media followers and a huge fan base, and a large house and all that,
    she nevertheless defines herself as being somehow anti-elite, which
    is, of course, ridiculous.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Right.

  - anne applebaum  
    If you’re asking what people like that have in common, this is often
    it. There’s some element of resentment or a feeling of outsiderism.

  - michelle goldberg  
    But do you think she’s changed? Because in your book, you sort of
    associate her with this optimistic post-Cold War milieu of Reaganism
    and people who felt like we won, and now we’re going to go on to
    keep winning. Whereas when I look at her history, I mean, starting
    with Dartmouth where she is the editor of this school newspaper with
    Dinesh D’Souza, where they become famous for trying to humiliate gay
    students by sending an undercover reporter to the gay student
    group’s meeting and publishing excerpts of things that people
    talked about. Her book in 2003 is obviously extremely resentful and
    nationalist. I guess I don’t see a Laura Ingraham that was at one
    point different or better than the one that we see today.

  - anne applebaum  
    No, I’m not sure that Laura Ingraham was ever different or better.
    Her views about the world have certainly changed. I mean, she has a
    much different view of American foreign policy. She has a different
    analysis of American history than she once had. I’m not intimate
    with her. I don’t know her well enough to tell you exactly all the
    components of it, although I tease it apart a little bit in the
    book. But that she was an anti-communist at a time when other people
    on the left weren’t is true. And so I probably gave her more credit
    for that than she deserved in the ‘80s and ‘90s. But to me, that was
    a really important quality, and it remained an important quality for
    me for a long time.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, I want to say something very cynical and ask something very
    cynical, but these last years have made me pretty cynical, which is,
    you used the verb “prospered” before. You were just talking about
    Laura Ingraham’s views have changed. I find myself wondering as we
    talk about resentment as a motivating factor, the size of the chip
    on someone’s shoulder, to what extent do they actually have
    convictions that change in ideologies, or are they just grabbing
    onto the winning formula that puts them on the top of the team or in
    the winner’s circle or make sure that they prosper? I mean, are they
    just kind of choosing horses rather than, in fact, evolving
    ideologically?

  - anne applebaum  
    Some of them. I mean, some of them are deeply cynical. So one other
    person who I talk about in the book who won’t be familiar to
    American listeners is a Hungarian woman called Maria Schmidt, whom I
    suspect of deep and profound cynicism. She’s somebody who has a
    number of both business and political interests in Hungary, and
    she’s made great efforts to stay on the right side of the current
    ruling party and is now one of their chief propagandists, even
    though I know that in earlier eras she was more doubtful about them.
    And I suspect her of being profoundly cynical. So one of the things
    that I tried to argue in the book is that, again, the human
    personality is very complex, and people can be motivated by more
    than one thing. And some people are motivated by an idealism or an
    ideology or politics, and some people are motivated by personal
    ambition. Some people are motivated by resentment. Some people are
    motivated by the pleasure in seeing their enemies squirm. And some
    people are, as you say, profoundly cynical, and sometimes those
    qualities dominate at different moments. I mean, I actually end the
    book with this discussion of cynicism and nihilism, and I say that
    this is the really dangerous sentiment for liberal democracy is
    that. Because once people become cynical and once they think it’s
    all a game and it doesn’t matter who wins, then you do begin to lose
    the virtue of the state, and then you really are open for all kinds
    of extreme politics. But yeah, I mean, are they cynical? Some of
    them really are, yes.

  - michelle goldberg  
    But there’s also a relationship, right, between kind of doubt and
    fanaticism. If you’re going to insist on something that on some
    level you know it not to be true, it’s likely to make you more
    histrionic and more sort of uncompromising.

  - anne applebaum  
    I think there’s a quote in the book that I’m not going to be able to
    recite to you off the top of my head, but it’s a quote actually that
    comes from a guy who was a young communist in Poland in the 1940s,
    Jacek Trzynadel. And he described in a famous memoir that he wrote
    years later, he described what it felt like to be talking to a crowd
    of people. People are shouting and cheering, and he was lecturing
    the crowd whatever, support our Marxist state. I mean, I’m just
    making up what he said. I don’t remember the exact thing. And he
    writes, the more I was shouting, the more I was doubting what I was
    saying. Did I really believe what I was shouting? And I felt I had
    to shout louder not just to convince the crowd, but to convince
    myself.

  - frank bruni  
    I think I was talking a little bit about something else, which is
    just rank opportunism. We were talking moments ago about Laura
    Ingraham. One of her Fox News colleagues Tucker Carlson, if you go
    back and you listen to Tucker Carlson 15, 20 years ago, he doesn’t
    sound exactly or really all that much like he sounds now. And his
    voice has evolved in relationship to where he’s gotten the largest
    audience, the most traction, the most power. And Donald Trump, I
    mean, does any one of us really believe that Donald Trump has an
    intrinsic and abiding ideology versus a set of hunches and instincts
    about which direction to turn in to maximize the adulation and the
    purchase on power?

  - michelle goldberg  
    But actually, Frank, I mean, I would say I actually think that
    racism is pretty deep in Donald Trump and is as close to a sincere
    belief as he’s possible of holding.

  - anne applebaum  
    So actually, Tucker Carlson, who I didn’t write about, but is
    probably a better example, as you say, of somebody who has changed
    very profoundly. David Frum has a thesis about Carlson, which is
    that it was because what he really, really, really, really always
    wanted to do was be on television and be good at television. He
    tried various television projects, and they kept failing. And then
    finally, he hit on the formula that would win him millions of fans,
    and that was this kind of strange racist, nationalist, nativist
    language that is designed to appeal to mobs of like thinkers in
    America and that that was what finally brought him fame and glory,
    and that’s why he’s sticking with it. And so, yes, that would be an
    example of really sort of pure opportunism and a kind of nihilism.
    And that, as I say, is one of the enemies of good politics.

  - frank bruni  
    But where would you put Trump, Anne? Is Trump more Tucker or more
    Lenin? \[GOLDBERG AND APPLEBAUM LAUGH\]

  - anne applebaum  
    Actually, a bit of — \[LAUGHS\] golly, that’s not a question I ever
    thought I was going to have to answer.

  - frank bruni  
    It’s not a question I ever thought I’d ask. \[BOTH LAUGH\]

  - anne applebaum  
    So, I mean, actually, you can see elements of both. I mean, think
    about it. Trump is somebody who he’s very rich. He’s on the front
    page of tabloids. And yet, is he ever really accepted by the New
    York elite who he resents? Is he accepted by the real movers and
    shakers, the real bankers and businessmen in New York? Do they see
    him as a real player? I mean, no, they don’t. I mean, for all I
    know, he may be deeply resentful of the people who look down on him
    because he was vulgar and so on. So he may well fit into that sort
    of, in that sense, the Leninist category, and at the same time be
    someone who, as Michelle said, is somebody who just has this
    instinct for kind of negative publicity. He understands how to move
    crowds and how to appeal to really base instincts. So he’s somebody
    you can see both of those aspects in.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Now, one of the things that I think is really valuable about your
    book is its kind of international scope. So it’s not just about what
    happened to the Republican Party. But to me, one of the questions
    that keeps — this may be a provincial question, but compared to
    maybe if Hungary is the worst case scenario out of all of the
    countries that you’re writing about in this book, possibly followed
    by Poland, these are both countries where, as you write about,
    there’s sort of a conspiracy at the very center of the government.
    Where do you see the United States on that trajectory? How far are
    we from Poland, or how far are we from Victor Orbán’s Hungary?

  - anne applebaum  
    So this may sound very bizarre, and I accept that it’s my own weird
    provincialism, and it’s my strange perspective as an American who
    lives at least part of the time in Poland. I think the United States
    and Poland are really similar in the sense that I do think that
    Trump came to power also on the back of a conspiracy that all of us
    — including me, but also many other people — underrated, which was
    the conspiracy of birtherism. And it’s now sort of forgotten because
    so many things have happened, that this was the moment when he
    really broke into national politics was by being the kind of the
    loudest spokesman for birtherism. And what was birtherism? It was
    the argument that the president of the United States is
    illegitimate. He’s not even American. And this argument had a
    tremendous amount of power and was believed by an enormous number of
    people. I saw a statistic once, it’s between 20 percent and 30
    percent of Americans believed this to be true. Now, think about what
    that means. If the president is illegitimate, that means that
    everybody — the media, the courts, the Congress, the civil service —
    everybody is lying to you. So the entire state is covering up this
    fact that the president is an illegal outsider and should not be
    president at all. If you believe that, OK, then you are ready for
    all kinds of radical changes and all kinds of radical politics
    because you have come to doubt all of the institutions of your
    democracy.

  - michelle goldberg  
    Oh, that’s really interesting. So that creates much more of a kind
    of — I don’t think that I’ve thought before that there is such a
    through line between birtherism and then the deep state conspiracy.

  - anne applebaum  
    Oh, absolutely. No, no, I mean, the use of conspiracy theories and
    conspiracy thinking by Trump is very similar to the way this was
    used in Poland and where it’s been used in other places. And by the
    way, throughout history, OK? The Bolsheviks were great conspiracy
    theorists. And the way in which he used it and the way in which he
    has consistently sought to undermine public trust in a range of
    institutions — the deep state, the fake news media, the judges who
    are really Mexicans, they’re not Americans — all that language used
    over and over. Some of it I think he does in a calculating way and
    some of it is instinctive. I mean, this is genuinely, I think,
    probably how he sees the world. All of this has built up and
    amplified the existing lack of trust in American society and helped
    to undermine people’s faith in institutions. I mean, if you think
    American democracy is so rotten that we had a president for eight
    years who wasn’t even American and it was all lied to us, then
    you’re willing to see all kinds of things overthrown. Then what do
    you care about the State Department being decimated or the Inspector
    General of the C.I.A. being fired? Why should you care? All those
    people, it’s so obvious that all of it is corrupt. And this is
    something that Trumpism has in common with the way politics are done
    not just in Poland, but in Brazil and in many other countries.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, I ask you this because you are a student, a scholar of
    authoritarians and authoritarianism, and because I suspect it’s a
    question that’s on a lot of our listeners’ minds. Donald Trump,
    let’s say he loses in early November. Do you think there’s a real
    possibility that he rejects the results? And what does that look
    like? And if he wins, what do you suspect the next four years look
    like?

  - anne applebaum  
    So those are two different questions. I mean, first of all, I think
    it’s almost certain that he is going to question the results. He’s
    said so already. He’s been asked point blank, will you accept the
    result? And he’s refused to say yes. So I think that is a clear
    possibility. It’s something everybody should be prepared for. It may
    be that there is a very easy solution to that if it happens, and the
    solution is I think Biden himself has said, well, on January the
    20th, he’ll walk into the White House, and the Secret Service will
    escort Mr. Trump out because Trump will have trouble fighting the
    legality of it. But that doesn’t mean that he can’t cause an
    enormous amount of trouble or do an enormous amount of damage by
    campaigning around the country between November and January and
    saying that the election was rigged and seek once again to use
    conspiracy theory to move people and prepare them for some other
    political project still to come. And so, yes, it’s possible. But I
    should also say that I also think it’s possible he’ll try to cheat
    in other ways. I mean, I think the attempt to undermine absentee
    ballots, the hints that he might undermine the work of the post
    office so that it couldn’t deliver absentee ballots, I mean, all of
    that is preparing both to try and cheat and to prevent people from
    voting, and also to begin to make the case that the election was
    rigged. So it is highly possible he’ll do that. Second question —
    well, no, sorry, your second question was about what if he wins.

  - frank bruni  
    If he wins, is that it? Are we on a fast track, an express train to
    authoritarianism?

  - anne applebaum  
    So if he wins, I mean, the main difference between Trump’s first
    term and Trump’s second term will be the kinds of people working for
    him. Because if you remember, in the early part of his presidency,
    there were still people working for him who believed they were there
    to do something good and they were there to protect the institutions
    of the United States. And although I’ve criticized James Mattis, I
    do accept that he thought that what he was doing there was making
    sure that the army was OK and that elements of U.S. foreign policy,
    like our relationship with allies, were maintained. And a number of
    people who worked for Trump in the beginning had that commitment to
    the institutions and to democracy. In Trump’s second term, there
    will be no such people. And so the government, the institutions will
    be run by people who are intent on destroying what they can and who
    will do so rather aggressively. And yes, I do think that would cause
    an enormous crisis in American democracy.

  - frank bruni  
    The other scenario is Biden wins, Trump leaves voluntarily or is
    escorted out. What then happens to the authoritarian fervor that he
    has cultivated during his four years when he’s out of office?

  - anne applebaum  
    So this is a really interesting question, and one that I have been
    talking to people about. Most think that — and these are mostly
    ex-Republicans, but people who know the party quite well — most
    people think that everything depends on how he loses. So if he loses
    by a lot, if it’s a wipeout, if the Republican Party loses the
    Senate and if it loses even more seats in the House, then it is
    possible that a part of the party leadership will say we’re right,
    that was a big disaster, and that was a really bad idea. And
    Trumpism was a road to nowhere, and it’s a road to an ever-shrinking
    base. And therefore, there will be an election or an argument inside
    the party, and a new kind of leader will be chosen. And then as
    somebody said to me recently, and then there’s at least a chance
    that we get rid of this authoritarian or we push to the fringes this
    authoritarian streak in the Republican Party. It doesn’t mean that
    we will, but it means that then there’s a chance. If the election is
    very close, on the other hand, if Trump loses very slightly, if the
    Republicans retain the Senate, and if the party still feels that
    this kind of rhetoric and this kind of language is a winning ticket,
    then the next presidential candidate may well be Tucker Carlson or
    Don Jr. \[BRUNI LAUGHS\] or Ivanka or someone who —

  - frank bruni  
    So if it’s Tom Cotton, we’re lucky, right?

  - anne applebaum  
    If it’s Tom Cotton, you’re lucky.

  - frank bruni  
    That’s actually — \[APPLEBAUM LAUGHS\]

  - anne applebaum  
    Or Mike Pompeo. I mean —

  - frank bruni  
    Ugh.

  - anne applebaum  
    — there’s a range of people who will be competing for the role of
    the next and possibly more efficient and more intelligent Trumpist
    leader. And so then we are in a real national conundrum because then
    we have one political party which is not dedicated to playing by the
    rules of the game, and then the kind of polarization that we’ve had
    will continue and get worse. And then we will find ourselves in the
    position of having every four years a kind of electoral moment of
    crisis.

  - michelle goldberg  
    So obviously, a lot of these trends that we’re talking about in
    other countries predate the election of Donald Trump. But I’m
    curious how you think the — I mean, collapse isn’t the right word,
    but the kind of damage incurred to the ideal of liberal democracy in
    America has empowered authoritarianism in other countries and how
    the sort of fate of this election will then— the echoes that will
    have in other countries that have basically argued that liberal
    democracy has failed, that it was a joke, that its time is over.

  - anne applebaum  
    So the election of Donald Trump, the re-election of Donald Trump,
    would have an enormous negative impact around the world, and it
    would absolutely empower other authoritarians, both sitting ones,
    whether in Russia or in China, for that matter, or in the Middle
    East, as well as aspiring ones in other countries that are current
    democracies. And this is both by the power of example. Trump and his
    language are quoted and imitated by people all over the world. I
    mean, for example, his use of the expression “fake news” to
    undermine the media is one that has been picked up and repeated by
    dozens of other authoritarian leaders or would-be authoritarian
    leaders. I mean, the other part of the story is that the
    authoritarian right, the new radical right around the world has deep
    links. There are deep financial links. There are deep links, kind of
    organic links on social media. These groups of people speak to one
    another. They share one another’s memes. They communicate in
    different ways across borders. And the influence of the American
    alt-right on the European far right or the international alt-right
    is quite profound and vice versa. I think they influence one
    another. And there is no question that the re-election of Donald
    Trump would embolden and motivate those different groups who, as I
    say, are speaking to one another all the time anyway and help them
    propagate their ideas further.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, can I ask you a meta question, so to speak? In the very title
    of your book Twilight of Democracy and I think sort of the subtext
    of a lot of the discussion that we’re all having here today is this
    notion that the trend line is away from democracy. The trend line is
    toward, very scarily, authoritarianism. I just want to kind of play
    devil’s advocate maybe in a very hopeful vein. Poland just had an
    election. I believe— you can correct me if I’m wrong — was the
    closest election since the end of communism. And in fact, the
    authoritarian government barely won. You go back to 2016. Trump got
    almost 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton did in the popular
    vote. He won only after Russian interference, only after a late in
    the game assist from Jim Comey, and possibly also because so many
    people were so convinced the outcome was predetermined in Hillary
    Clinton’s favor that they didn’t rouse themselves to vote. And since
    then, almost every metric, almost every measure, almost every
    election has suggested the limits of Trump’s appeal. Is it possible
    that what we’re seeing in Poland and what we’re seeing in America
    is, at the end of the day, a blip, he asked hopefully.

  - anne applebaum  
    I mean, maybe. I, too, hope that that’s the correct interpretation.
    And our country and other countries have overcome even worse crises
    before. I mean, the Civil War was a pretty big blip on the history
    of American democracy. It was a moment of total collapse, and
    somehow we nevertheless recovered from that with some caveats. I
    think one of the reasons I wrote the book and one of the reasons I
    concluded it the way I did is that what I don’t want is for
    Americans to become complacent, for us to say, well, our democracy
    is so great and so strong and our Constitution is so fantastic, and
    we’re a superpower. I don’t have to try that hard to make sure that
    everything goes well in our country, and it’s all going to go back
    to how it was eventually. And anyway, Poland is far away, and they
    are central Europeans, and they have nothing to do with us. I mean,
    I really believe that it is that conviction of inevitability which
    was the big mistake, I should say, of my entourage or my milieu, my
    friends in the ‘90s. There was a kind of complacency that now that
    we’re on this road to democracy, nothing can take us back. Because
    that is wrong. Countries do reverse themselves, and they do cease to
    be democracies. And we are going through a really extraordinary
    moment of technological and informational and demographic and social
    change, and changes make society very volatile and all kinds of
    outcomes are possible. And I don’t want people to be complacent or
    certain that we will somehow go back to everything being the way it
    was before, and you don’t have to really do anything about it or
    worry about it. because it’s that feeling of inevitability that
    turned out to be wrong.

  - michelle goldberg  
    So I think we will end it there. And even though we have some
    disagreements about the nature of pre-Trump conservatism, it was a
    pleasure to read “The Twilight of Democracy.” It’s a fascinating
    book, and I’m thrilled that you came on the show. Thank you so much.

  - frank bruni  
    Anne, thank you so much for your time and your thoughtfulness.

  - anne applebaum  
    Oh, thanks for talking to me.
    
    \[MUSIC PLAYING\]

  - frank bruni  
    And we’re back. Michelle, what did you think?

  - michelle goldberg  
    So I think that she’s extraordinarily brilliant obviously. And it’s
    often funny when you disagree with someone on Twitter in a column,
    and then you end up talking and you find out you agree more than you
    might have thought. And I should say that Anne Applebaum is someone
    who her willingness to kind of call out authoritarianism on the
    right certainly didn’t begin with Trump. Something I probably should
    have brought up is that she was at one time a big fan of John
    McCain, who refused to vote for him, I think very honorably, in 2008
    because he put Sarah Palin on the ticket, right? And Sarah Palin’s
    rise to prominence was in a lot of ways a premonition of what we’re
    living through now. And so one of the things that is so interesting
    about this moment is how you end up being in political coalitions
    with people that you never could have imagined, right? It’s such a
    reminder of how long life is. That it would have been hard enough
    for me to imagine maybe being on the same side as Anne Applebaum in
    2000 or 2003, never mind David Frum and Bill Kristol. But one of the
    things I wrote in my piece is that I think a lot of people on the
    left are very, very suspicious of Never Trump conservatives, and I
    really admire them because they’ve really sacrificed something to
    stand up to him. And they’ve sacrificed more than I’ve had to or
    more than people on the left have had to just in terms of the
    fissuring of personal relationships, professional networks, right? I
    mean, I think it’s really not easy to turn your back on the social
    and political world that you’ve lived your whole life in.

  - frank bruni  
    What you just described or what you just talked about is actually
    where I get my hope during these dark times. And what I mean by that
    is, you’re right, you and Anne Applebaum agree more than you
    disagree, and that becomes clear when you talk with each other, and
    you have made temporary whatever kind of partnership with people
    whom you didn’t expect to. I think that if I’m going to be an
    optimist, one thing that could come out of all of this — and our
    conversation with Anne reacquainted me with this optimism — is that
    we can focus on what unites us more than what divides us.
    Understanding what a threat Trump is, being so deeply offended by
    some of the divisions he’s exploited and the ways he’s governed has
    reminded so many people from various points of the political
    spectrum of what they have in common and of how overlapping their
    fundamental values are in so many ways. Don’t you think?

  - michelle goldberg  
    I guess, but I really wonder if that’s more of an elite phenomenon,
    right? That sort of people who make their living by kind of arguing
    and writing in the search for truth and good faith argumentation are
    sort of necessarily in this moment on the same side. Instead of kind
    of politics— I’ve written this before. Instead of politics being a
    war of ideas, the people who takes ideas seriously are aside in
    politics. I think if you look at the country as a whole, I don’t see
    how you look out at America right now and say that this is a country
    where people are more aware of what unites them than divides them. I
    mean, to me, it looks like a country that’s coming apart at the
    seams.

  - frank bruni  
    I mean, it looks and feels that way. And yet, I don’t think it’s
    just an elite phenomenon. I mean, if I flash back over the last
    couple of years, once Trump had been in office for a while and the
    offenses had mounted and mounted and mounted, the number of times
    somebody in a store, in a fast food restaurant, wherever, has kind
    of set an aside, an aside of disgust that lets me know that they’ve
    developed the same reservations or deep concerns that someone
    writing op-ed pieces and simply using a different vocabulary is
    expressing. I mean, that happens all the time. And I look more
    recently — and I think this has been so fascinating and hopeful — I
    look at the polls regarding how Americans feel about Black Lives
    Matter and where that puts them in opposition to Trump, and I see an
    overwhelming majority of Americans coming together with the same
    idea of justice and rejecting Donald Trump. And —

  - michelle goldberg  
    No, I think you’re right that Donald Trump has created — and I think
    Jemele wrote about this, right, that Donald Trump has created, I
    don’t know if it’s a silent majority, but he’s definitely created
    a fairly solid anti-Trump majority.

  - frank bruni  
    Again, when I want to wear my optimist hat, I think Donald Trump in
    the long run, if things turn out better and not worse, I think
    Donald Trump has shown us who we don’t want to be.
    
    At the end of the conversation with Anne, we talked in what I found
    to be a very fascinating manner about various scenarios. Trump
    barely loses. Trump loses big. Trump wins. Beyond all of those,
    there’s a scenario where he loses, we move on. And again, this is my
    hope. This is me at my most hopeful and optimistic. Call me
    Pollyanna. We remember what Donald Trump did to us. We remember what
    he showed us in terms of the kind of America we don’t want to be.
    And maybe we’re the better for it.

  - michelle goldberg  
    So I think that’s certainly a possibility, right? I mean, if you
    look at all the reforms that you saw after Richard Nixon, I mean,
    most of them stood up fairly well until Donald Trump dismantled
    them. But there was not just this huge wave after, this huge
    Democratic wave that followed Nixon’s resignation, but a whole
    flurry of lawmaking to try to solidify accountability, solidify
    transparency, solidify democratic institutions. I think it’s going
    to be really, really important that people keep pushing on that.
    When Barack Obama first became president, there were people who
    wanted some sort of accountability for the people who had both
    misled the country into war under George W. Bush and also the people
    responsible for the financial crisis. And I understand why Obama,
    facing all these interlocking crises, thought that it was the time
    to sort of look forward rather than backward. But I think that was a
    mistake in retrospect, and it would be a fatal mistake if,
    inshallah, Biden becomes president. I think it will be really
    important to have something— I don’t know if it’s a Truth and
    Reconciliation Commission, if it’s a commission in the Justice
    Department — to sort of expose both the kind of instances of
    corruption and lawlessness that we maybe half know about. And I’m
    sure there are a lot that we don’t know about, right? I’m sure there
    are a lot of utterly corrupt phone calls with foreign leaders as bad
    as the one with the president of Ukraine that we just haven’t heard
    about. And so I think it’ll be really, really important to figure
    out the places where norms need to be replaced by laws.

  - frank bruni  
    I suspect we will be excavating the muck of the Trump administration
    for decades to come. I just hope that excavation begins sooner
    rather than later. \[GOLDBERG LAUGHS\] But we should probably wrap
    it up there, Michelle. It’s just you and me this week, which means
    50/50 chance that you’re going to be the one doing the
    recommendation. And I just tossed a coin. Heads it’s you. What’s
    your recommendation this week?

  - michelle goldberg  
    So I am going to recommend — it’s not a new book. I’m going to
    recommend an old book that I’ve been thinking about a lot recently
    and that I recently re-read, Milan Kundera’s “The Joke.” So I don’t
    know about you, but I have a lot of these books that I feel like
    have been really formative, and yet at the same time I can barely
    remember. But I decided to reread “The Joke” recently because we’ve
    been, or I’ve been at any rate, embroiled in this discussion over
    cancel culture, which even though I don’t like the phrase cancel
    culture, it seems somewhat inescapable, and sort of what it means to
    be publicly shamed, what it means for a ideological movement to
    enforce its boundaries. And when I see people kind of cast out, I
    often think of this book.

  - frank bruni  
    What is the storyline of “The Joke“?

  - michelle goldberg  
    OK, so the storyline of “The Joke” is there is a young communist in
    Czechoslovakia in the ‘40s, a very ardent communist, but somebody
    with a sort of slightly ironic temperament, who has a crush on this
    girl who is kind of earnest to a fault. And he teases her by sending
    her this jokey postcard — hold on, I’ll just get the actual line
    because I have it underlined here. \[PAGES FLIPPING\] So he teases
    her by sending her this jokey postcard that says, “Optimism is the
    opium of the people. A healthy atmosphere stinks of stupidity. Long
    live Trotsky.” And this postcard, this joke, ends up completely
    derailing his life. He’s drummed out of the party, drummed out of
    the university. He’s sent to go work in the mines. So in some ways,
    this is not at all comparable to what we talk about when we talk
    about cancellation, right? Because the sort of horror of it is that
    it has the power of the state behind it. And sometimes I think that
    people my age and older, those of us who grew up on Milan Kundera
    and books like it, there are certain rhetorical modes that signal to
    us authoritarianism. And we see them on Twitter and maybe overreact
    because what was so frightening about them was that they had the
    power of the state behind them. And yet at the same time, I think he
    sort of really captures the emotional experience, or what I imagine
    to be the emotional experience, of being sort of drummed out of a
    movement that you identify with. Because the significant thing about
    Ludvik is that he really is a communist, and so he really does
    identify with the people who are casting him out. He doesn’t really
    want to be a dissident. I’ll just quote this line: “I came to
    realize that there was no power capable of changing the image of my
    person lodged somewhere in the supreme court of human destinies. But
    this image, even though it bore no resemblance to me, was much more
    real than my actual self, that I was its shadow and not it mine.” I
    think that line captures some of what happens when people become
    reduced to either the worst thing that they’ve ever said or
    someone’s impression of the worst thing that they ever said.

  - frank bruni  
    It’s so interesting to hear you describe it, Michelle, because one
    of the more celebrated novels to come out in the last six months and
    one of the novels I most recently read is called “A Burning.” I’m
    going to probably mispronounce the author’s name, for which I
    apologize, but her name is Megha Majumdar, and it’s set in India.
    And I’m realizing how timeless, what stamina the story you’re
    describing from “The Joke” has. It is, again, about someone who,
    with a single communication, miscommunication, call it what you
    will, is branded forevermore and becomes a convenient object of
    analysis, demonization, caricature, whatever, for the society around
    her. So this is clearly a story that, regardless of epoch of decade,
    speaks to certain eternal verities of human nature.

  - michelle goldberg  
    I had heard of that book, but I hadn’t realized that that was what
    it was about. But now I’m gonna — we can make that a recommendation
    too because I’m going to order it.

  - frank bruni  
    But this is your week. Your recommendation again is?

  - michelle goldberg  
    My recommendation is Milan Kundera’s “The Joke.” That’s our show
    this week. Thanks for listening. “The Argument” is a production of
    The New York Times opinion section. The team includes Phoebe Lett,
    Paula Schumann, and Pedro Rafael Rosado. Special thanks to Brad
    Fisher and Kristin Lin. See you next week. \[MUSIC PLAYING\]

How did the conservative defenders of classical liberal ideals like free
speech and the rule of law wind up abetting authoritarians across Europe
and the U.S.? With Ross out for the week, Frank and Michelle are joined
by Anne Applebaum, author of “[Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure
of
Authoritarianism](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/621076/twilight-of-democracy-by-anne-applebaum/),”
to debate the origins of the center right’s schism over nationalism.
Then, if you’ve got consternation over cancel culture, Michelle has “The
Joke” for
you.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist for The Times since 2011, but my career
with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and
turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests. I covered
Congress, the White House and several political campaigns; I also spent
five years in the role of chief restaurant critic. As the Rome bureau
chief, I reported on the Vatican; as a staff writer for The Times’s
Sunday magazine, I wrote many celebrity profiles. That jumble has
informed my various books, which focus on the Roman Catholic Church,
George W. Bush, my strange eating life, the college admissions process
and meatloaf. Politically, I’m grief-stricken over the way President
Trump has governed and I’m left of center, but I don’t think that the
center is a bad place or “compromise” a dirty word. I’m
Italian-American, I’m gay and I write a [weekly Times
newsletter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/frank-bruni)
in which you’ll occasionally encounter my dog, Regan, who has the run of
our Manhattan
apartment.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing
mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the
right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s
basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency
has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books,
including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its
religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global
battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics,
about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.)
I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we
spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our
son and daughter.
