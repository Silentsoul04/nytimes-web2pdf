## Episode Two: ‘I Still Believe in It’

### Reported by Chana Joffe-Walt; produced by Julie Snyder; edited by Sarah Koenig, Neil Drumming and Ira Glass; editorial consulting by Eve L. Ewing and Rachel Lissy; and sound mix by Stowe Nelson

#### White parents in the 1960s fought to be part of a new, racially integrated school in Brooklyn. So why did their children never attend?

Thursday, July 30th, 2020

</div>

  -   
    “Nice White Parents” is brought to you by Serial Productions, a New
    York Times Company.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    The New York City Board of Education has an archive of all of its
    records. Everything that goes into making thousands of schools run
    for years and years is sitting in boxes in the municipal building. I
    love the B.O.E. archive.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Good morning. How are you doing?

chana joffe-walt

First of all, to look through it, you have to go to a century-old
municipal building downtown. Arched doorways, lots of marble, an echo,
vaulted ceilings really makes a person feel like she’s up to something
important. You sit at a table, and then a librarian rolls your boxes up
to you on a cart. Inside the boxes are all the dramas of a school
system. Big ones, tiny ones, bureaucratic, personal, it’s all in there.
There’s a union contract and then a zoning plan and special reports on
teacher credentialing, a weird personal note from a bureaucrat to his
assistant, a three-page single-spaced plea from Cindy’s grandmother, who
would please like for her not to be held back in the second grade. An
historian friend once pulled a folder out of the archive and a note fell
out, something a teacher clearly made a kid write in the 1950s, that
read, quote, “I am a lazy boy. Miss Fitzgerald says, when I go in the
army, I will be expendable. Expendable means that the country doesn’t
care whether I get killed or not. I do not like to be expendable. I’m
going to do my work and improve.”

\[music\]

I came to the Board of Ed archive after I attended the gala thrown by
the French embassy, the fundraiser for SIS organized by the new
upper-class white families coming into the school. I felt like I’d just
watched an unveiling ceremony for a brand-new school, but I didn’t
really know what it was replacing. Everyone was talking as if this was
the first time white parents were taking an interest in the School for
International Studies. But at the archive, I found out it wasn’t the
first time. White parents had invested in the school before, way before,
at the very beginning of the school. Before the beginning. I found a
folder labeled I.S. 293, Intermediate School 293, the original name for
SIS. And this folder was filled with personal letters to the president
of the New York City Board of Education, a man named Max Rubin, pleading
with him to please make I.S. 293 an integrated school. “Dear Mr. Rubin,
my husband and I were educated in public schools, and we very much want
for our children to have this experience. However, we also want them to
attend a school which will give them a good education, and today, that
is synonymous with an integrated school.” “Dear Mr. Rubin, as a resident
of Cobble Hill, a teacher and a parent, I want my child to attend
schools which are desegregated. I do not want her to be in a situation
in which she will be a member of a small, white, middle-income clique.”
These are letters from parents — largely white parents, as far as I
could tell — written in 1963, just a few years before I.S. 293 was
built. At issue was where the school was going to be built. The Board of
Education was proposing to build the school right next to some housing
projects. The school would be almost entirely Black and Puerto Rican.
These parents, white parents, came in and said, no, no, no, don’t build
it there. Put it closer to the white neighborhood. That way, all our
kids can go to school together. These parents wanted the school built in
what was known as a fringe zone. This was a popular idea at the time,
fringe schools to promote school integration. Comes up in the letters.
“Dear Mr. Rubin, this neighborhood is changing with the influx of a
middle-class group which is very interested in public education for
their children.” “Dear Mr. Rubin, if there is a possibility of achieving
some degree of integration, it is more likely if the Board of
Education’s theory of fringe schools is applied.” And from another
letter, “it is apparent from the opinion of the neighborhood groups
involved that the situation is not at all hopeless.” This lobbying
effort was so successful that the Board of Education did move the site
of the school. This is why SIS is located where it is today, on the
fringe, closer to the white side of town, so that it would be
integrated.

I tried to imagine who these people were — young, idealistic white
parents living in Brooklyn in the 1960s, feeling good about the future.
They would have had their children around the time the Supreme Court
ruled on Brown versus Board of Education. They probably followed the
news of the Civil Rights Movement unfolding down South. Maybe they were
supporters or active in the movement themselves. These were white
parents saying, we understand we’re at a turning point and we have a
choice to make right now, and we choose integration. One of my favorite
letters was from a couple who left the suburbs to come to New York City
for integration, the opposite of white flight. “Dear Mr. Rubin, we have
recently moved into the home we purchased at the above address in Cobble
Hill. It was our hope in moving into the neighborhood that our children
would enjoy the advantages of mixing freely with children of other
classes and races, which we were not able to provide to them when we
lived in a Westchester suburb.”

  - chana joffe-walt  
    So this is the letter.

  - carol netzer  
    This is the letter that I wrote? I can’t believe it. OK.

chana joffe-walt

This is Carol Netzer. Most of the letter writers were not that hard to
find.

  - carol netzer  
    We had moved to Scarsdale for the children, because Scarsdale has
    the best — it probably still does — the best school system in the
    country, but we hated it. We found that we were bored to death with
    it. It was bland. It was just homogeneous. But living — I don’t know
    if you’ve ever lived in a suburb. It’s just boring, tedious, you
    know? There’s nothing going on.

chana joffe-walt

She didn’t like the suburbs. So they moved to Brooklyn and wrote that
letter, which I showed her, her 37-year-old self writing about her hopes
for her young children, the choices she made back then.

  - carol netzer  
    But it sounds as though I was fairly impassioned about it. You know,
    that it meant something. But I — actually, I can’t think what it
    meant.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

I went through this box of letters and called as many parents as I
could. Most of them didn’t remember writing these letters, which isn’t
surprising, more than 50 years ago and all. What I did find surprising
is that, by the time 293 opened, five years later, none of them, not a
one, actually sent their kids to I.S. 293.

\[music\]

From Serial Productions, I’m Chana Joffe-Walt. This is “Nice White
Parents,” a series about the 60-year relationship between white parents
and the public school down the block, a relationship that began with a
commitment to integration. In the 1960s, much like today, white people
were surrounded by a movement for the civil rights of Black Americans.
White people were forced to contend with systemic racism. And here was a
group of white parents who supported the movement for school
integration, threw their weight behind it. What happened in those five
years between 1963, when these white parents planted an impassioned
pro-integration flag on the school, and 1968, when it came time to
enroll their children? Why didn’t they show up?

These white parents who wanted an integrated I.S. 293, they didn’t come
to that idea on their own. They were part of a bigger story unfolding
around them. I want to zoom out to that dramatic story because it takes
us right up to the moment these parents wrote their letters, and then
made the decision not to send their kids to the school. To begin, I’d
like to introduce you to our main character in this historical, tale,
the recipient of the parents’ letters, the New York City Board of
Education. Back in the 1950s, the New York City Board of Ed was not one
of those boring bureaucracies that chugs along in the background,
keeping its head down. It had personality. It invested in self-image.
For instance, in 1954, when the Supreme Court found school segregation
unconstitutional, New York City didn’t just say we support that ruling,
it celebrated the Brown v Board decision. And notably, it celebrated
itself, calling Brown, quote, “a moral reaffirmation of our fundamental
educational principles.” That same year, 1954, the New York City Board
of Ed made a film honoring multiculturalism in its schools. \[CHILDREN
SINGING\] The film opens with a multiracial choir of schoolchildren
singing “Let Us Break Bread Together.” Like I said, the Board of Ed went
the extra mile. The Schools Superintendent was a 66-year-old man named
Dr. William Jansen, a man that newspapers described as slow and steady.
And he definitely delivers on that promise here.

    The film you’re about to see tells the story of how the schools and
    community are working together to build brotherhood.

A teacher addresses her classroom, filled with children of all races and
ethnicities.

    Who among you can give some of the reasons why people left their
    native lands to come to the United States of America?

The camera cuts to a white boy, maybe 9 or 10.

    Some came because they wanted to get away from the tyranny and
    cruelty of kings.

    My people are free now. They are proud to be American. But the
    Negroes were brought here by wicked men who traded in slaves.

This keeps going, kid to kid.

    We came a little while ago from Puerto Rico. My father wanted work.
    He wants to give me and my brother a good education. Japan is very
    overcrowded. The people have little land. So many Japanese came to
    this country because they wanted to farm.

chana joffe-walt

New York City was the biggest city in America, with the largest Black
population in America, and it was saying in films, press releases,
public speeches, Brown v Board, we agree. Separate but equal has no
place in the field of public education. No problem here. It was also
saying, you know who does have a problem? The South. New York City loved
comparing itself to the backward South. There are plenty of examples of
this in the Board archives, New Yorkers bragging about their superiority
to places like Georgia or Virginia or Louisiana. This was the story the
Board of Ed was telling. The South was ignorant and racist. New York
City was enlightened and integrated. But here is what it was actually
like to walk into a New York City school in a Black neighborhood at this
time.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    The school had an awful smell. It was just — oh, it smelled like
    this county abattoir.

chana joffe-walt

This is an archival recording of a woman named Mae Mallory. In the
1950s, Mallory’s two Black children were students in Harlem. And when
Mallory walked into their school, she did not see children building
brotherhood in interracial classrooms. She saw an all-Black and Puerto
Rican school with terrible facilities, in disrepair.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    So my kids told me, says, well, Mommy, this is what we’ve been
    trying to tell you all along, that this place is so dirty. And this
    is why we run home to the bathroom every night. So I went to the
    bathroom. And in 1957 in New York City, they had toilets that were
    worse than the toilets in the schools that I went to in Macon,
    Georgia in the heart of the South. The toilet was a thing that
    looked like horse stalls. And then it had one long board with holes
    cut in it. And then you’d have to go and use the toilet, but you
    couldn’t flush it. The water would come down periodically and flush,
    you know, whatever’s there. Now imagine what this is like, you know,
    dumping waste on top of waste that’s sitting there waiting, you
    know, accumulating till the water comes. This was why this place
    smelled so bad.

chana joffe-walt

Mae Mallory says the school had two bathrooms for 1,600 children.
Mallory’s family fled racial violence in the South, like millions of
other Black Americans, who headed to places like New York City, where
everyone was supposed to be equal. Instead of welcoming these new
students and spreading them out, creating interracial classrooms, the
Board of Education kept Black and Puerto Rican students segregated in
what were sometimes referred to as ghetto schools, schools that were
often just blocks away from white schools. White schools in New York
City had toilets that flushed. White children had classrooms with
experienced teachers and principals, people who lived in their
communities and looked like them. In Black and Puerto Rican schools,
half the teachers were not certified to teach by the Board of Education.
The buildings were in disrepair, and packed, sometimes more than 1,000
kids in a single hallway. The overcrowding got so bad the Board of
Education decided to send kids to school in shifts. And mind you, this
was not in the middle of a global pandemic. This was normal, non-crisis
school for Black and Puerto Rican kids. One group of children would go
to school in the morning until noon. The next group of kids would come
in at noon, and stay until 3:00. The Board was literally giving Black
kids half an education. In some schools in Harlem, they had triple
shifts. This made it harder to learn elementary skills. Reading, for
instance. Black parents complained that the schools were not teaching
their kids basic literacy, that their white teachers didn’t care, that
the summer reading programs were only in white communities, that their
children were two years behind white children in reading. This at
exactly the same time the Board of Education was making a film promoting
the virtues of integration. It was effectively running a dual,
segregated and unequal school system.

\[music\]

For many Black families, the Board of Education was not to be trusted.
It did not care for Black children, and it didn’t respect the voices and
concerns of Black parents. Mae Mallory says she visited her kids’ school
that day because they’d come home the day before and told her a child
had died at school. He was playing in the street at recess. Mallory
hardly believed it, but she says when she visited the school, she
learned, yes, indeed, this child was playing the street because the
schoolyard was closed. He was hit by a beer truck. And she learned the
schoolyard was closed because pieces of steel from the side of the
building had fallen into the yard.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    And when I found out that this was true, I went to the principal. So
    this principal told me that, well, Mrs. Mallory, you really don’t
    have anything to worry about. You see, our sunshine club went to see
    the mother, and we took her a bag of canned goods. So actually,
    she’s better off, because she had so many children to feed. And I
    couldn’t believe that here a white man is going to tell a Black
    woman in Harlem that a can of peaches is better than your child. I
    just didn’t know what to do or where to go. But I know you’re
    supposed to do something.

chana joffe-walt

It was 1957, three years after the Supreme Court declared segregation by
law unconstitutional. New York City didn’t have Jim Crow laws on the
books, but Mae Mallory would ask, the schools are segregated. What’s the
difference? She didn’t care whether that segregation was codified by law
or by convention. The harm was just as dire. And she wanted it
addressed.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    This was nothing to do with wanting to sit next to white folks. But
    it was obvious that a whole pattern of Black retardation was the
    program of the Board of Education. So I filed a suit against the
    Board of Education. And I just fought back.

chana joffe-walt

Integration, Mae Mallory would say, was about, quote, demanding a fair
share of the pie. She said, our children want to learn, and they
certainly have the ability to learn. What they need is the opportunity.
The Board of Education had defined integration as a multiracial choir.
It was a virtue in and of itself. Mae Mallory saw integration as a
remedy, a way to get the same stuff everyone else had — functioning
toilets, books, certified teachers, a full school day. Integration was a
means to an end.

\[music\]

Mae Mallory won her lawsuit. She and a few other parents were allowed to
transfer their kids out of segregated schools. As for the segregation in
the entire system, the judge in the lawsuit turned to the Board of Ed
and said, this segregation, it’s your responsibility. Fix it.

Now, on the question of responsibility, the Board of Education was
cagey. And that caginess set the stage for the I.S. 293 parents when it
came time to send their kids to the school. Here’s what happened. The
Schools Superintendent, William Jansen, decided school segregation was
not his problem. In fact, he rejected the idea that New York City had
segregated schools in the first place. After all, New York City was not
barring Black children from entering white schools. This wasn’t the
South. Segregation, Jansen said, is such an unfortunate word. He
preferred the phrase racial imbalance or racial separation. The way he
saw it, racial imbalance in the schools was just a matter of housing.
Neighborhoods were segregated. Again, unfortunate, but that had nothing
to do with the schools. To make this argument, William Jansen had to
ignore the many powerful tools available to the Board of Education. The
Board of Education was responsible for where kids went to school. It
decided where to build new schools. It drew zoning lines. It decided
where experienced teachers teach. There were many ways the Board could
have made schools less segregated. I know this because of the Board’s
own reports. Jansen did very little to break up school segregation, but
man, did he study it. He organized commissions that led to reports that
led to further study. You see a pattern emerge, starting in the late
1950s, that looks something like this. Black parents and civil rights
groups would pressure the Board to act on segregation. The Board would
invite its critics to join a commission to investigate the problem. The
commission would study the schools, discover extreme segregation, lay
out solutions. The Board of Ed would then take a tiny step toward
implementing some of the recommendations until white parents started to
complain about the changes, at which point the Board would back off and
say it needed more evidence. Another commission, another report. For
instance, there’s the Report on the Committee on Integration, a Plan for
Integration, the City’s Children and the Challenge of Racial
Discrimination, Redoubling Efforts on Integration, the Board Commission
on Integration, the Status of the Public School Education of Negro and
Puerto Rican Children in New York City, and, my favorite, a bound little
red book from 1960 called Toward Greater Opportunity, which summarizes
the previous investigations with this groundbreaking conclusion. Quote,
“we must integrate as much and as quickly as we can.” I want to pause
for one second and step out of the past back into the world we all live
in, just to point out that, over the last few years in New York City,
we’ve been reliving this chapter of history. It’s eerie. New York City
schools are segregated. There’s a growing movement to do something about
that. And for the first five years of his administration, the city’s
mayor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, responded in the following way. He refused
to say the word segregation, commissioned a number of reports on school
diversity. He’s pointed a finger at housing problems as a way to say
this isn’t our fault, and he’s studying the problem deeply, which,
again, is not segregation, no matter how many times reporters would ask
the mayor at press conferences, why don’t you use that word?

  - archived recording (bill de blasio)  
    I don’t get lost in terminology. I think the notion of saying we
    have to diversify our schools is the best way to say it.

chana joffe-walt

I heard a live call-in show on WNYC, the public radio station. A young
integration advocate, an 11th grader named Tiffani Torres, asked the
mayor, how much longer until you do something?

  - archived recording (tiffani torres)  
    And how much more time do you need to study the issue? So to repeat
    my question, how much longer will it take?

  - archived recording (bill de blasio)  
    Tiffani, with all due respect, I really think you’re not hearing
    what we’re saying to you, so I’ll repeat it. There is a task force,
    an extraordinary task force, which I’ve met with. They are coming
    forward with their next report in a matter of weeks. So when that
    diversity task force comes out with their report, I think they’re
    amazing. I think they’ve done fantastic work. And so far, there’s a
    high level —

chana joffe-walt

Mayor de Blasio likes to point out that this was a problem created by
people long before him, which is exactly what people long before him
said, too.

\[music\]

In the late 1950s, when Black parents and civil rights activists also
asked the Board of Ed, why is it taking so long, board members
complained about the, quote, extremists who wanted instant integration.
Superintendent Jansen said, “some people want us to build Rome in one
day.” While the Board of Education was building Rome in 1956, ‘57, ‘59,
and in 1960, 1962, ‘63, Black parents found each other on PTAs, in civil
rights organizations, pro-integration groups. They formed new groups,
organized sit-ins, boycotts, demanded the Board provide a timetable for
citywide integration. They joined forces with Puerto Rican parents, and
their numbers grew. These were volunteers, mothers mostly, who left
their jobs at the end of a workday and headed directly to a meeting
about how to get the Board to give their kids the education white
children were already receiving. Finally, in 1964, 10 years after Brown
versus Board, Black and Puerto Rican parents said, enough. They were
sick of waiting, sick of lawsuits, sick of asking for a remedy, sick of
being ignored. So they went big, spectacularly big. They shut down the
schools. They organized a civil rights demonstration that was the
largest in US history, larger than the March on Washington. It was
called Freedom Day, a massive school boycott.

  - archived recording  
    (CHANTING) Freedom now\!

chana joffe-walt

On February 3rd, 1964, parents headed out to schools in the morning
before sunrise to spread the word about the boycott. It was freezing
cold that day. There’s a brief TV news clip of a group of mothers
picketing outside their kids’ school at the start of the school day.
They’re holding up signs that say, “we demand a real integration
timetable now,” and “integration means better schools for all.” They’re
handing out leaflets to other parents about Freedom Day, looking
spirited and cold. A white NBC news reporter in a fedora walks up to one
of the women.

  - archived recording  
    Ma’am, it’s a little after eight o’clock now. How successful has the
    boycott been so far? Very effective. So far, about 10 children have
    gone in, and there would be ordinarily 240 children. And 10 have
    gone into the morning session, which begins at eight o’clock. So you
    think you’ve already seen the result? Yes, I think so. The school is
    just empty. Does it surprise you? No, because we knew how effective
    — We talked with the parents. We distributed leaflets. We’ve been
    working very hard. And we prayed that it would be effective.

chana joffe-walt

There were maps and charts and instructions with picket times and picket
captains for hundreds of schools. There were volunteer shifts to make
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, to hand out thousands of leaflets
and stencil posters. The boycott wasn’t just effective — it was
extraordinarily effective. Half a million kids stayed home from school
that day. Half a million, close to half the school system. But the press
barely covered it. After searching every major TV network, I found only
one kid who was interviewed, a teenage boy, maybe around 16, on the
street with some friends, protesting. A white ABC News reporter doesn’t
ask him why he’s there. The only thing he asks him about is violence.
The kid responds.

  - archived recording  
    We’re coming down here today for a peaceful — peaceful— No comment\!
    No, we’re not going to be violent. We’re just teenagers and kids.
    And — Do you expect violence here today? No, sir, not if — look at
    the blue uniforms. You ask me do I expect violence.

chana joffe-walt

He gestures to the police on horseback.

    None of us have any weapons, horses. And all we want is equal
    education. That’s all. Equal education. Thank you. You get all that?

chana joffe-walt

That was it. Every once in a while, I’ll hear a politician or friend or
school administrator say, yeah, integration was a good idea, but there
was no political will to make it happen. 460,000 kids, half the school
system. The will was there. The majority wanted integration.

\[music\]

After Freedom Day, the Board of Education introduced some small-scale
integration plans, and white parents protested. \[CHILDREN SINGING\] We
love our children. Oh, yes, we do. We will not transfer —

chana joffe-walt

With their own marches, they put on their own school boycott. The
flipside of freedom day, a white boycott. The white parents were far
fewer in number. But as far as I can tell, they got a thousand times
more press coverage.

  - archived recording  
    Mrs. Carcevski?

  - speaker  
    Yes? Are you going to send Johnny back to school now? No. She
    belongs here, and I want to send my child here. So nobody is going
    to tell me where to send my kid.

chana joffe-walt

This protest worked. The Board of Ed backed off. And in the decades
since, the Board of Education has never proposed a city-wide integration
plan. The schools have never been integrated. I think the fact of white
moms in Queens in the 1960s yelling about zoning changes and busing,
it’s not surprising they played a role in killing school integration
efforts. But there was another group of white parents who played a
quieter, but I’d argue more forceful, role in killing integration. The
white parents who said they supported it, parents like the ones who
wrote letters asking for an integrated I.S. 293. How did their vocal
support for integration turn lethal? That’s after the break. In the
American South, schools were desegregated with court orders. Cities and
counties mandated desegregation, and the schools desegregated. By the
early 1970s, the South was the most integrated region in the country.
But New York City did not want to do it that way. No mandates. The New
York City Board of Education wanted to appeal to hearts and minds. They
wanted to sell white people on the virtues of integration. Have it all
happen, quote, “naturally.” Some white people were sold. The white
parents who wrote letters about I.S. 293. They believed in integration.
So I made a lot of calls to ask, why’d you bail? They had a lot of
different reasons. One couple got divorced, and moved. Another guy told
me he had political ambitions that pulled him out of the city.

  - speaker  
    We loved our brownstone, but I was involved in a political race. And
    we needed some money for that.

chana joffe-walt

So he sold the house and moved the family to the suburbs, where he
thought he’d have a better chance running against Republicans. Many
white people moved to the suburbs for jobs, for newly paved roads and
subsidized mortgages, leaving Brooklyn behind. I understood what
happened there. But some explanations made less sense. Like one guy I
called, he did stay in Brooklyn. On the phone, he was telling me why he
believed it was important that I.S. 293 be integrated. But then he said
his own kids went to Brooklyn Friends, a Quaker private school. I said,
oh, they didn’t go to I.S. 293.

  - speaker  
    No. As I said, I’m a Quaker, and —

chana joffe-walt

But you were a Quaker when you wrote this letter, asking for an
integrated 293.

  - speaker  
    I believed it. I believed in it, but —

chana joffe-walt

You weren’t planning to send your kid there?

  - speaker  
    No, no, no.

chana joffe-walt

What to make of that? When you get what you say you want and then, given
the opportunity, don’t take it. Maybe you never really wanted it in the
first place. Then I spoke to Elaine Hencke. Of all the people I spoke
with, everything about Elaine indicated someone who did believe in
integration, someone who would send her kids to 293. And yet, she
didn’t. Elaine was a public school teacher. She taught in an
integrated elementary school, until she had her own kids. She was
looking forward to sending them to an integrated 293. When her daughter
was old enough for junior high school, Elaine visited the school. She
was the only letter writer I spoke with who actually went into the
building. If this was going to work with anyone, it was going to be
Elaine.

  - elaine hencke  
    I didn’t know quite what to make of it because the school had a nice
    plant. Physically, it was a nice school. But it just seemed chaotic
    and noisy, and kids were disruptive. And kids — \[LAUGHS\] — kids
    were doing the wrong things, you know? And kids do. I mean, it
    wasn’t that they were nasty kids or doing — it was not drugs. It
    was not drugs. It was just — it just seemed too chaotic to me at the
    time.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine and I talked for a long time I pushed her — not to make her feel
bad, but to get to what felt like a more real answer. At the time that
you are visiting, was it majority Black and Hispanic kids?

  - elaine hencke  
    Yes, I’m sure it was.

chana joffe-walt

And did that have anything to do with the way that you saw the classroom
as disruptive and chaotic?

  - elaine hencke  
    I would hope not.
    
    I’m not — I’m not sure how well educated they were, or — you know, I
    don’t know. I don’t know why I’m going into this.

chana joffe-walt

Well, did you have reason to think that they weren’t well educated?

  - elaine hencke  
    Before 293? Well, their reading levels were way down. You know.

chana joffe-walt

I’m just — when you say chaos and disruptive, I’m trusting that what you
saw was chaotic and disruptive. But I also know that those are words
white people use — we use to express our racial fears, to express real
racial fears. Do you think that’s what was happening with you?

  - elaine hencke  
    I don’t think I would admit to that. I don’t think that was true.
    But what I may have thought was that these kids are not expected to
    do so well in school, all the way from the beginning of school. And
    here they are, really unprepared in some way, for junior high school
    or — I mean, the reading levels were low.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine told me when she wrote that letter to the Board of Education, she
pictured her children becoming friends with Black kids, learning
side-by-side, learning that all children are equal. That’s what
motivated her to write that letter. She wanted the picture of
integration the Board of Ed was promoting — the picture of harmonious
integration. But when she visited I.S. 293, that didn’t seem possible.
The reading levels were low. The kids were not entering the school on
equal grounds. Her white children had received years of high quality
teaching at well-resourced schools. The kids coming from segregated
elementary schools had not had that experience.

  - elaine hencke  
    I mean, one of the problems is that many of the white kids had
    higher sort of academic skills, or skills. They could read better. I
    think — I mean, if the white kids knew how to read in first grade
    and — and I guess there were Black kids who also could. But it just
    seemed as if most of the black kids didn’t really learn — learn to
    read.

chana joffe-walt

But part of the — part of the vocal complaints of black parents at this
period of time was that their kids were not learning how to read because
schools were segregated, and their kids were kept in schools that were
inferior. And that was part of the argument for integration.

  - elaine hencke  
    Yes, yes.

chana joffe-walt

That their kids were not going to get the resources, and quality
teaching, and good facilities unless they were in the same buildings
with kids like yours.

  - elaine hencke  
    Right.
    
    I don’t know what to say to that. I just — I guess I just began to
    feel that things were really difficult for these kids. Schools were
    not made for them. If the schools were made for them, with their
    background, what would they be like?
    
    I think there was — and that’s another whole thing. I don’t know
    about it. I think there was sort of anger in the black community at
    the white community. A lot of the teachers were white. There were
    more white teachers, I suppose. People said that that was racism.
    And of course, it was racism. But maybe the kids were a little angry
    at the school. I wouldn’t — I couldn’t fault them for that. But on
    the other hand, then they don’t get as much from the school. I don’t
    know. I thought the problems were kind of enormous. And I guess I
    just, at one point, I just decided that my kids should go — went to
    Brooklyn Friends. And we could afford to pay for it. It wasn’t easy,
    you know. It was — \[LAUGHS\] but —

chana joffe-walt

Did your feelings about integration change? Did you believe in it less?

  - elaine hencke  
    Maybe.
    
    I think I would have said no, theoretically. But maybe they did. I
    guess I saw it as a more difficult project then. I sort of did back
    off from it. I just —

chana joffe-walt

Yeah. It felt when you guys wrote these letters like, this is —
integration is this exciting ideal, and we can be part of it, and it’s
going to be a meaningful project that’s also going to be kind of easy.

  - elaine hencke  
    I certainly didn’t think it would be so difficult. But I — I was, I
    was innocent, you know? I don’t know. I still believe in it. I do.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

I think what Elaine actually meant was not that she was innocent, but
that she was naive. She was naive about the reality of segregation, the
harm of it. And naive about what it would take to undo it. She did not
know. And I think she didn’t want to know. When Elaine said the word
innocent, I felt a jolt of recognition. I felt like Elaine had walked me
right up to the truth about her, and about me.

When my own kids were old enough, I sent them to our zoned public
school. It was racially mixed and economically mixed. I was excited
about that. And it was nice walking to school with neighbors, people I
likely never would have gotten to know otherwise. My kid’s first day of
school was another boy’s first week in the country. He’d just moved from
China, and his mom asked the neighbor where the school was. When she
said goodbye that first morning, I think he thought I was a teacher, and
he crawled into my lap. We had no words in common, so I just held him
while he screamed and cried. By the holiday show three months later, I
watched that same boy belt out “This Pretty Planet” on a stage with his
classmates. He was the star. He nailed the hand motions. Every other kid
up on stage was just following his lead, just trying to keep up. It was
such a sweet picture, all of them up there — Black kids, and Mexican
kids, and Colombian, and Asian and white kids. And all of us adults
supporting all of them. It’s moving, to me, this picture of integration.
It is also, I’m realizing right now, writing these words down, the very
same picture the Board of Education put forth in 1954 — a multiracial
choir singing together, building brotherhood. And it’s dangerous, I
think, this picture of integration. It seems perfectly designed to
preserve my innocence, to make me comfortable, not to remedy inequality,
but a way to bypass it entirely. I can sit in that assembly and feel
good about the gauzy display of integration without ever being asked to
think about the fact that much of the time, white kids in the school
building are having a different educational experience than kids of
color. A large share of the white students at the school are clustered
in a gifted program. They have separate classrooms and separate
teachers. We all blithely call these white children gifted and talented,
G\&T, starting at four years old. White children are performing better
at the school than black children and Latino children. White families
are the loudest and most powerful voices in the building. The advantages
white kids had back in the 1950s, they’re still in place. When Elaine
said she was innocent, I thought about the things we say, nice, white
parents, to each other about why we won’t send our kids to segregated
schools — because they’re too strict, or too chaotic, or too disruptive.
Because the test scores are bad, because we want more play. We want
fewer worksheets. Because we don’t want to ride a bus. We don’t want
uniforms. We don’t want tests. We want innocence. We need it, to protect
us from the reality that we are the ones creating the segregation, and
we’re not sure we’re ready to give it up.

\[music\]

Elaine was not for segregation. But in the end, she wasn’t really for
integration, either. All of the choices she made, choices she had the
luxury of making, were meant to advantage her own kids. And I understand
that. That’s what parents do.

  - elaine  
    I remember thinking very clearly that OK, I believe in this. But I
    don’t sort of want to sacrifice my children to it. I have to look at
    what they will learn, and what they will do. And for people who sent
    their kids to 293, it seemed to work out well. So that made me
    think, well, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe they should have gone
    there. I know at one point it was very clear to me that I had
    beliefs that I thought were kind of contrary to my own children’s
    best interests. And I decided that I wasn’t going to use them to
    sort of extend my own beliefs. But then I regretted that, because
    that wasn’t really true.

chana joffe-walt

You regretted what?

  - elaine  
    Well, I kind of wish I had sent them to 293 because Joan’s kids had
    a good experience there.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine’s friend Joan, another white mom who did send her kids to I.S.
293. Elaine still feels bad about her choice. But not everyone felt bad.

  - carol netzer  
    We were not pious, kind of, oh, the kids have to go to public
    school. Not at all. I went to public schools, and there’s nothing to
    write about.

chana joffe-walt

Carol is the woman who wrote the letter about how she’d come to New York
City from the suburbs for integration. I had a hard time reconciling her
lack of piety with her letter, which I read back to her, about wanting
her kids to mix freely with children of other classes and races.
\[READING\] — which we were not able to provide for them when we lived
in the Westchester suburb.

  - carol netzer  
    That was all true. Yeah, yeah.

chana joffe-walt

You remember feeling that way?

  - carol netzer  
    Well, I don’t really remember feeling that way. And I think that we
    say a lot of things that are politically correct, without even
    realizing that we are not telling exactly how we feel. So I can’t
    really guarantee that it was 100% the way I felt. I don’t really
    remember. Probably close to it, but I mean, I’m a liberal, you know?

chana joffe-walt

As a parent, did you — do you remember feeling like, I hope my kid has
experiences outside of just people like them?

  - carol netzer  
    Not especially. I mean, we rushed right away to send them to private
    school, right? So what was most important to us was that they get
    the best education. But one of the things that changed it was St.
    Anne’s School, a sort of progressive school with this man,
    headmaster, who was brilliant. Opened up St. Anne’s. And if you keep
    working on this, you’ll hear a lot about St. Anne’s.

chana joffe-walt

I’m not going to tell you a lot about St. Anne’s, except to say this —
it’s one of the most prominent private schools in Brooklyn. Upscale
neighborhood, prime real estate, lots of heavy-hitters send their kids
to St. Anne’s. I had heard of it. What I didn’t know is that St. Anne’s
opened at the very same time that Black parents were waging their
strongest fight for integration in New York City, in 1965. Right when a
lot of the letter writers would have been looking for schools. And it
wasn’t just St. Anne’s. New progressive private schools were opening and
expanding all over the city. Brooklyn Friends School expanded into a new
building, and would double its enrollment. They were opening private
schools in the South, too. But down there, it was all very explicit.
They became known as quote, unquote, “segregation academies,” schools
for white people who were wholeheartedly committed to avoiding
integration. In the North, private schools opened as if they were
completely disconnected from everything else that was happening at that
very moment. St. Anne’s marketed itself as a pioneer, a community of
like-minded, gifted kids, no grades. Lots of talk about progressive,
child-centered education, the whole child. At one point in my
conversation with Carol Netzer I was talking about how integration was
happening around his time. And she surprised me by saying, no, not at
that time.

  - carol netzer  
    I think the — I think that you may be off on the timing for me,
    because it was too early. They didn’t start really any kind of
    crusade about integrating until well after I had left the
    neighborhood.

chana joffe-walt

No, they were integrating the schools in the ‘60s, though.

  - carol netzer  
    Oh. It didn’t make much of a splash. We weren’t against it. There
    was — it wasn’t a big item.

chana joffe-walt

That’s how easy it was to walk away from integration in New York City.
You could do it without even knowing you’d thrown a bomb over your
shoulder on the way out.

\[music\]

Here is what I think happened over those five years between the writing
of the letters in 1963 and not sending their kids to the school in 1968.
Those five years were a battle between the Board of Education’s
definition of integration and the actual integration that black parents
wanted. For black parents, integration was about safe schools for their
children, with qualified teachers and functioning toilets, a full day of
school. For them, integration was a remedy for injustice. The Board of
Ed, though, took that definition and retooled it. Integration wasn’t a
means to an end. It was about racial harmony and diversity. The Board
spun integration into a virtue that white parents could feel good about.
And their side triumphed. That’s the definition of integration that
stuck, that’s still with us today. It’s the version of integration that
was being celebrated 50 years later, at the French Cultural Services
Building at the Gala for SAS.

In some of my calls with the white letter writers, a few people
mentioned that yes, they wanted integration. But also, they wanted the
school closer to them. They weren’t comfortable sending their kids over
to the other side of the neighborhood. Which brings me to one final
letter from the other side of the neighborhood. One I haven’t told you
about, from the I.S. 293 folder in the archives. It’s one of the only
letters, as far as I can tell, that is not from a white parent. It’s
from the Tenants Association for the Gowanus Houses, a housing project,
home to mostly Black and Puerto Rican families. They also wanted a
school closer to them. The letter from the Tenants Association is formal
and straightforward. It says, please build the school on the original
site you proposed, right next to the projects. That way, they explained,
our kids won’t have to cross many streets. We’ll get recreational
facilities, which we desperately need. And it’ll be close to the people
who will actually use it. The letter says they represent over 1,000
families. The white families, they numbered a couple dozen. Still, in
the name of integration, the white letter writers got what they wanted —
a new building close to where they lived, that they did not attend. Note
the Black and Puerto Rican families we’re not asking to share a school
with white people. They were not seeking integration. That’s not what
their letter was about. They were asking for a school, period. The
school they got was three blocks further than they wanted. And from the
moment it opened, I.S. 293 was de facto segregated — an overwhelmingly
Black and Puerto Rican school. What were those years like, once the
white parents pushing their priorities went away? Once there were no
more efforts at feel-good integration, and the community was finally
left alone? Was that better? That’s next time, on “Nice White Parents.”

#### White parents in the 1960s fought to be part of a new, racially integrated school in Brooklyn. So why did their children never attend?

  -   
    “Nice White Parents” is brought to you by Serial Productions, a New
    York Times Company.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    The New York City Board of Education has an archive of all of its
    records. Everything that goes into making thousands of schools run
    for years and years is sitting in boxes in the municipal building. I
    love the B.O.E. archive.

  - chana joffe-walt  
    Good morning. How are you doing?

chana joffe-walt

First of all, to look through it, you have to go to a century-old
municipal building downtown. Arched doorways, lots of marble, an echo,
vaulted ceilings really makes a person feel like she’s up to something
important. You sit at a table, and then a librarian rolls your boxes up
to you on a cart. Inside the boxes are all the dramas of a school
system. Big ones, tiny ones, bureaucratic, personal, it’s all in there.
There’s a union contract and then a zoning plan and special reports on
teacher credentialing, a weird personal note from a bureaucrat to his
assistant, a three-page single-spaced plea from Cindy’s grandmother, who
would please like for her not to be held back in the second grade. An
historian friend once pulled a folder out of the archive and a note fell
out, something a teacher clearly made a kid write in the 1950s, that
read, quote, “I am a lazy boy. Miss Fitzgerald says, when I go in the
army, I will be expendable. Expendable means that the country doesn’t
care whether I get killed or not. I do not like to be expendable. I’m
going to do my work and improve.”

\[music\]

I came to the Board of Ed archive after I attended the gala thrown by
the French embassy, the fundraiser for SIS organized by the new
upper-class white families coming into the school. I felt like I’d just
watched an unveiling ceremony for a brand-new school, but I didn’t
really know what it was replacing. Everyone was talking as if this was
the first time white parents were taking an interest in the School for
International Studies. But at the archive, I found out it wasn’t the
first time. White parents had invested in the school before, way before,
at the very beginning of the school. Before the beginning. I found a
folder labeled I.S. 293, Intermediate School 293, the original name for
SIS. And this folder was filled with personal letters to the president
of the New York City Board of Education, a man named Max Rubin, pleading
with him to please make I.S. 293 an integrated school. “Dear Mr. Rubin,
my husband and I were educated in public schools, and we very much want
for our children to have this experience. However, we also want them to
attend a school which will give them a good education, and today, that
is synonymous with an integrated school.” “Dear Mr. Rubin, as a resident
of Cobble Hill, a teacher and a parent, I want my child to attend
schools which are desegregated. I do not want her to be in a situation
in which she will be a member of a small, white, middle-income clique.”
These are letters from parents — largely white parents, as far as I
could tell — written in 1963, just a few years before I.S. 293 was
built. At issue was where the school was going to be built. The Board of
Education was proposing to build the school right next to some housing
projects. The school would be almost entirely Black and Puerto Rican.
These parents, white parents, came in and said, no, no, no, don’t build
it there. Put it closer to the white neighborhood. That way, all our
kids can go to school together. These parents wanted the school built in
what was known as a fringe zone. This was a popular idea at the time,
fringe schools to promote school integration. Comes up in the letters.
“Dear Mr. Rubin, this neighborhood is changing with the influx of a
middle-class group which is very interested in public education for
their children.” “Dear Mr. Rubin, if there is a possibility of achieving
some degree of integration, it is more likely if the Board of
Education’s theory of fringe schools is applied.” And from another
letter, “it is apparent from the opinion of the neighborhood groups
involved that the situation is not at all hopeless.” This lobbying
effort was so successful that the Board of Education did move the site
of the school. This is why SIS is located where it is today, on the
fringe, closer to the white side of town, so that it would be
integrated.

I tried to imagine who these people were — young, idealistic white
parents living in Brooklyn in the 1960s, feeling good about the future.
They would have had their children around the time the Supreme Court
ruled on Brown versus Board of Education. They probably followed the
news of the Civil Rights Movement unfolding down South. Maybe they were
supporters or active in the movement themselves. These were white
parents saying, we understand we’re at a turning point and we have a
choice to make right now, and we choose integration. One of my favorite
letters was from a couple who left the suburbs to come to New York City
for integration, the opposite of white flight. “Dear Mr. Rubin, we have
recently moved into the home we purchased at the above address in Cobble
Hill. It was our hope in moving into the neighborhood that our children
would enjoy the advantages of mixing freely with children of other
classes and races, which we were not able to provide to them when we
lived in a Westchester suburb.”

    So this is the letter.

  - carol netzer  
    This is the letter that I wrote? I can’t believe it. OK.

chana joffe-walt

This is Carol Netzer. Most of the letter writers were not that hard to
find.

  - carol netzer  
    We had moved to Scarsdale for the children, because Scarsdale has
    the best — it probably still does — the best school system in the
    country, but we hated it. We found that we were bored to death with
    it. It was bland. It was just homogeneous. But living — I don’t know
    if you’ve ever lived in a suburb. It’s just boring, tedious, you
    know? There’s nothing going on.

chana joffe-walt

She didn’t like the suburbs. So they moved to Brooklyn and wrote that
letter, which I showed her, her 37-year-old self writing about her hopes
for her young children, the choices she made back then.

  - carol netzer  
    But it sounds as though I was fairly impassioned about it. You know,
    that it meant something. But I — actually, I can’t think what it
    meant.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

I went through this box of letters and called as many parents as I
could. Most of them didn’t remember writing these letters, which isn’t
surprising, more than 50 years ago and all. What I did find surprising
is that, by the time 293 opened, five years later, none of them, not a
one, actually sent their kids to I.S. 293.

\[music\]

From Serial Productions, I’m Chana Joffe-Walt. This is “Nice White
Parents,” a series about the 60-year relationship between white parents
and the public school down the block, a relationship that began with a
commitment to integration. In the 1960s, much like today, white people
were surrounded by a movement for the civil rights of Black Americans.
White people were forced to contend with systemic racism. And here was a
group of white parents who supported the movement for school
integration, threw their weight behind it. What happened in those five
years between 1963, when these white parents planted an impassioned
pro-integration flag on the school, and 1968, when it came time to
enroll their children? Why didn’t they show up?

These white parents who wanted an integrated I.S. 293, they didn’t come
to that idea on their own. They were part of a bigger story unfolding
around them. I want to zoom out to that dramatic story because it takes
us right up to the moment these parents wrote their letters, and then
made the decision not to send their kids to the school. To begin, I’d
like to introduce you to our main character in this historical, tale,
the recipient of the parents’ letters, the New York City Board of
Education. Back in the 1950s, the New York City Board of Ed was not one
of those boring bureaucracies that chugs along in the background,
keeping its head down. It had personality. It invested in self-image.
For instance, in 1954, when the Supreme Court found school segregation
unconstitutional, New York City didn’t just say we support that ruling,
it celebrated the Brown v Board decision. And notably, it celebrated
itself, calling Brown, quote, “a moral reaffirmation of our fundamental
educational principles.” That same year, 1954, the New York City Board
of Ed made a film honoring multiculturalism in its schools. \[CHILDREN
SINGING\] The film opens with a multiracial choir of schoolchildren
singing “Let Us Break Bread Together.” Like I said, the Board of Ed went
the extra mile. The Schools Superintendent was a 66-year-old man named
Dr. William Jansen, a man that newspapers described as slow and steady.
And he definitely delivers on that promise here.

New York City was the biggest city in America, with the largest Black
population in America, and it was saying in films, press releases,
public speeches, Brown v Board, we agree. Separate but equal has no
place in the field of public education. No problem here. It was also
saying, you know who does have a problem? The South. New York City loved
comparing itself to the backward South. There are plenty of examples of
this in the Board archives, New Yorkers bragging about their superiority
to places like Georgia or Virginia or Louisiana. This was the story the
Board of Ed was telling. The South was ignorant and racist. New York
City was enlightened and integrated. But here is what it was actually
like to walk into a New York City school in a Black neighborhood at this
time.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    The school had an awful smell. It was just — oh, it smelled like
    this county abattoir.

chana joffe-walt

This is an archival recording of a woman named Mae Mallory. In the
1950s, Mallory’s two Black children were students in Harlem. And when
Mallory walked into their school, she did not see children building
brotherhood in interracial classrooms. She saw an all-Black and Puerto
Rican school with terrible facilities, in disrepair.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    So my kids told me, says, well, Mommy, this is what we’ve been
    trying to tell you all along, that this place is so dirty. And this
    is why we run home to the bathroom every night. So I went to the
    bathroom. And in 1957 in New York City, they had toilets that were
    worse than the toilets in the schools that I went to in Macon,
    Georgia in the heart of the South. The toilet was a thing that
    looked like horse stalls. And then it had one long board with holes
    cut in it. And then you’d have to go and use the toilet, but you
    couldn’t flush it. The water would come down periodically and flush,
    you know, whatever’s there. Now imagine what this is like, you know,
    dumping waste on top of waste that’s sitting there waiting, you
    know, accumulating till the water comes. This was why this place
    smelled so bad.

chana joffe-walt

Mae Mallory says the school had two bathrooms for 1,600 children.
Mallory’s family fled racial violence in the South, like millions of
other Black Americans, who headed to places like New York City, where
everyone was supposed to be equal. Instead of welcoming these new
students and spreading them out, creating interracial classrooms, the
Board of Education kept Black and Puerto Rican students segregated in
what were sometimes referred to as ghetto schools, schools that were
often just blocks away from white schools. White schools in New York
City had toilets that flushed. White children had classrooms with
experienced teachers and principals, people who lived in their
communities and looked like them. In Black and Puerto Rican schools,
half the teachers were not certified to teach by the Board of Education.
The buildings were in disrepair, and packed, sometimes more than 1,000
kids in a single hallway. The overcrowding got so bad the Board of
Education decided to send kids to school in shifts. And mind you, this
was not in the middle of a global pandemic. This was normal, non-crisis
school for Black and Puerto Rican kids. One group of children would go
to school in the morning until noon. The next group of kids would come
in at noon, and stay until 3:00. The Board was literally giving Black
kids half an education. In some schools in Harlem, they had triple
shifts. This made it harder to learn elementary skills. Reading, for
instance. Black parents complained that the schools were not teaching
their kids basic literacy, that their white teachers didn’t care, that
the summer reading programs were only in white communities, that their
children were two years behind white children in reading. This at
exactly the same time the Board of Education was making a film promoting
the virtues of integration. It was effectively running a dual,
segregated and unequal school system.

\[music\]

For many Black families, the Board of Education was not to be trusted.
It did not care for Black children, and it didn’t respect the voices and
concerns of Black parents. Mae Mallory says she visited her kids’ school
that day because they’d come home the day before and told her a child
had died at school. He was playing in the street at recess. Mallory
hardly believed it, but she says when she visited the school, she
learned, yes, indeed, this child was playing the street because the
schoolyard was closed. He was hit by a beer truck. And she learned the
schoolyard was closed because pieces of steel from the side of the
building had fallen into the yard.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    And when I found out that this was true, I went to the principal. So
    this principal told me that, well, Mrs. Mallory, you really don’t
    have anything to worry about. You see, our sunshine club went to see
    the mother, and we took her a bag of canned goods. So actually,
    she’s better off, because she had so many children to feed. And I
    couldn’t believe that here a white man is going to tell a Black
    woman in Harlem that a can of peaches is better than your child. I
    just didn’t know what to do or where to go. But I know you’re
    supposed to do something.

chana joffe-walt

It was 1957, three years after the Supreme Court declared segregation by
law unconstitutional. New York City didn’t have Jim Crow laws on the
books, but Mae Mallory would ask, the schools are segregated. What’s the
difference? She didn’t care whether that segregation was codified by law
or by convention. The harm was just as dire. And she wanted it
addressed.

  - archived recording (mae mallory)  
    This was nothing to do with wanting to sit next to white folks. But
    it was obvious that a whole pattern of Black retardation was the
    program of the Board of Education. So I filed a suit against the
    Board of Education. And I just fought back.

chana joffe-walt

Integration, Mae Mallory would say, was about, quote, demanding a fair
share of the pie. She said, our children want to learn, and they
certainly have the ability to learn. What they need is the opportunity.
The Board of Education had defined integration as a multiracial choir.
It was a virtue in and of itself. Mae Mallory saw integration as a
remedy, a way to get the same stuff everyone else had — functioning
toilets, books, certified teachers, a full school day. Integration was a
means to an end.

\[music\]

Mae Mallory won her lawsuit. She and a few other parents were allowed to
transfer their kids out of segregated schools. As for the segregation in
the entire system, the judge in the lawsuit turned to the Board of Ed
and said, this segregation, it’s your responsibility. Fix it.

Now, on the question of responsibility, the Board of Education was
cagey. And that caginess set the stage for the I.S. 293 parents when it
came time to send their kids to the school. Here’s what happened. The
Schools Superintendent, William Jansen, decided school segregation was
not his problem. In fact, he rejected the idea that New York City had
segregated schools in the first place. After all, New York City was not
barring Black children from entering white schools. This wasn’t the
South. Segregation, Jansen said, is such an unfortunate word. He
preferred the phrase racial imbalance or racial separation. The way he
saw it, racial imbalance in the schools was just a matter of housing.
Neighborhoods were segregated. Again, unfortunate, but that had nothing
to do with the schools. To make this argument, William Jansen had to
ignore the many powerful tools available to the Board of Education. The
Board of Education was responsible for where kids went to school. It
decided where to build new schools. It drew zoning lines. It decided
where experienced teachers teach. There were many ways the Board could
have made schools less segregated. I know this because of the Board’s
own reports. Jansen did very little to break up school segregation, but
man, did he study it. He organized commissions that led to reports that
led to further study. You see a pattern emerge, starting in the late
1950s, that looks something like this. Black parents and civil rights
groups would pressure the Board to act on segregation. The Board would
invite its critics to join a commission to investigate the problem. The
commission would study the schools, discover extreme segregation, lay
out solutions. The Board of Ed would then take a tiny step toward
implementing some of the recommendations until white parents started to
complain about the changes, at which point the Board would back off and
say it needed more evidence. Another commission, another report. For
instance, there’s the Report on the Committee on Integration, a Plan for
Integration, the City’s Children and the Challenge of Racial
Discrimination, Redoubling Efforts on Integration, the Board Commission
on Integration, the Status of the Public School Education of Negro and
Puerto Rican Children in New York City, and, my favorite, a bound little
red book from 1960 called Toward Greater Opportunity, which summarizes
the previous investigations with this groundbreaking conclusion. Quote,
“we must integrate as much and as quickly as we can.” I want to pause
for one second and step out of the past back into the world we all live
in, just to point out that, over the last few years in New York City,
we’ve been reliving this chapter of history. It’s eerie. New York City
schools are segregated. There’s a growing movement to do something about
that. And for the first five years of his administration, the city’s
mayor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, responded in the following way. He refused
to say the word segregation, commissioned a number of reports on school
diversity. He’s pointed a finger at housing problems as a way to say
this isn’t our fault, and he’s studying the problem deeply, which,
again, is not segregation, no matter how many times reporters would ask
the mayor at press conferences, why don’t you use that word?

  - archived recording (bill de blasio)  
    I don’t get lost in terminology. I think the notion of saying we
    have to diversify our schools is the best way to say it.

chana joffe-walt

I heard a live call-in show on WNYC, the public radio station. A young
integration advocate, an 11th grader named Tiffani Torres, asked the
mayor, how much longer until you do something?

  - archived recording (tiffani torres)  
    And how much more time do you need to study the issue? So to repeat
    my question, how much longer will it take?

  - archived recording (bill de blasio)  
    Tiffani, with all due respect, I really think you’re not hearing
    what we’re saying to you, so I’ll repeat it. There is a task force,
    an extraordinary task force, which I’ve met with. They are coming
    forward with their next report in a matter of weeks. So when that
    diversity task force comes out with their report, I think they’re
    amazing. I think they’ve done fantastic work. And so far, there’s a
    high level —

chana joffe-walt

Mayor de Blasio likes to point out that this was a problem created by
people long before him, which is exactly what people long before him
said, too.

\[music\]

In the late 1950s, when Black parents and civil rights activists also
asked the Board of Ed, why is it taking so long, board members
complained about the, quote, extremists who wanted instant integration.
Superintendent Jansen said, “some people want us to build Rome in one
day.” While the Board of Education was building Rome in 1956, ‘57, ‘59,
and in 1960, 1962, ‘63, Black parents found each other on PTAs, in civil
rights organizations, pro-integration groups. They formed new groups,
organized sit-ins, boycotts, demanded the Board provide a timetable for
citywide integration. They joined forces with Puerto Rican parents, and
their numbers grew. These were volunteers, mothers mostly, who left
their jobs at the end of a workday and headed directly to a meeting
about how to get the Board to give their kids the education white
children were already receiving. Finally, in 1964, 10 years after Brown
versus Board, Black and Puerto Rican parents said, enough. They were
sick of waiting, sick of lawsuits, sick of asking for a remedy, sick of
being ignored. So they went big, spectacularly big. They shut down the
schools. They organized a civil rights demonstration that was the
largest in US history, larger than the March on Washington. It was
called Freedom Day, a massive school boycott.

  - archived recording  
    (CHANTING) Freedom now\!

chana joffe-walt

On February 3rd, 1964, parents headed out to schools in the morning
before sunrise to spread the word about the boycott. It was freezing
cold that day. There’s a brief TV news clip of a group of mothers
picketing outside their kids’ school at the start of the school day.
They’re holding up signs that say, “we demand a real integration
timetable now,” and “integration means better schools for all.” They’re
handing out leaflets to other parents about Freedom Day, looking
spirited and cold. A white NBC news reporter in a fedora walks up to one
of the women.

  - archived recording  
    Ma’am, it’s a little after eight o’clock now. How successful has the
    boycott been so far? Very effective. So far, about 10 children have
    gone in, and there would be ordinarily 240 children. And 10 have
    gone into the morning session, which begins at eight o’clock. So you
    think you’ve already seen the result? Yes, I think so. The school is
    just empty. Does it surprise you? No, because we knew how effective
    — We talked with the parents. We distributed leaflets. We’ve been
    working very hard. And we prayed that it would be effective.

chana joffe-walt

There were maps and charts and instructions with picket times and picket
captains for hundreds of schools. There were volunteer shifts to make
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, to hand out thousands of leaflets
and stencil posters. The boycott wasn’t just effective — it was
extraordinarily effective. Half a million kids stayed home from school
that day. Half a million, close to half the school system. But the press
barely covered it. After searching every major TV network, I found only
one kid who was interviewed, a teenage boy, maybe around 16, on the
street with some friends, protesting. A white ABC News reporter doesn’t
ask him why he’s there. The only thing he asks him about is violence.
The kid responds.

  - archived recording  
    We’re coming down here today for a peaceful — peaceful— No comment\!
    No, we’re not going to be violent. We’re just teenagers and kids.
    And — Do you expect violence here today? No, sir, not if — look at
    the blue uniforms. You ask me do I expect violence.

chana joffe-walt

He gestures to the police on horseback.

  - archived recording  
    None of us have any weapons, horses. And all we want is equal
    education. That’s all. Equal education. Thank you. You get all that?

chana joffe-walt

That was it. Every once in a while, I’ll hear a politician or friend or
school administrator say, yeah, integration was a good idea, but there
was no political will to make it happen. 460,000 kids, half the school
system. The will was there. The majority wanted integration.

\[music\]

After Freedom Day, the Board of Education introduced some small-scale
integration plans, and white parents protested. \[CHILDREN SINGING\] We
love our children. Oh, yes, we do. We will not transfer —

chana joffe-walt

With their own marches, they put on their own school boycott. The
flipside of freedom day, a white boycott. The white parents were far
fewer in number. But as far as I can tell, they got a thousand times
more press coverage.

  - archived recording  
    Mrs. Carcevski?

  - speaker  
    Yes? Are you going to send Johnny back to school now? No. She
    belongs here, and I want to send my child here. So nobody is going
    to tell me where to send my kid.

chana joffe-walt

This protest worked. The Board of Ed backed off. And in the decades
since, the Board of Education has never proposed a city-wide integration
plan. The schools have never been integrated. I think the fact of white
moms in Queens in the 1960s yelling about zoning changes and busing,
it’s not surprising they played a role in killing school integration
efforts. But there was another group of white parents who played a
quieter, but I’d argue more forceful, role in killing integration. The
white parents who said they supported it, parents like the ones who
wrote letters asking for an integrated I.S. 293. How did their vocal
support for integration turn lethal? That’s after the break. In the
American South, schools were desegregated with court orders. Cities and
counties mandated desegregation, and the schools desegregated. By the
early 1970s, the South was the most integrated region in the country.
But New York City did not want to do it that way. No mandates. The New
York City Board of Education wanted to appeal to hearts and minds. They
wanted to sell white people on the virtues of integration. Have it all
happen, quote, “naturally.” Some white people were sold. The white
parents who wrote letters about I.S. 293. They believed in integration.
So I made a lot of calls to ask, why’d you bail? They had a lot of
different reasons. One couple got divorced, and moved. Another guy told
me he had political ambitions that pulled him out of the city.

  - speaker  
    We loved our brownstone, but I was involved in a political race. And
    we needed some money for that.

chana joffe-walt

So he sold the house and moved the family to the suburbs, where he
thought he’d have a better chance running against Republicans. Many
white people moved to the suburbs for jobs, for newly paved roads and
subsidized mortgages, leaving Brooklyn behind. I understood what
happened there. But some explanations made less sense. Like one guy I
called, he did stay in Brooklyn. On the phone, he was telling me why he
believed it was important that I.S. 293 be integrated. But then he said
his own kids went to Brooklyn Friends, a Quaker private school. I said,
oh, they didn’t go to I.S. 293.

  - speaker  
    No. As I said, I’m a Quaker, and —

chana joffe-walt

But you were a Quaker when you wrote this letter, asking for an
integrated 293.

  - speaker  
    I believed it. I believed in it, but —

chana joffe-walt

You weren’t planning to send your kid there?

  - speaker  
    No, no, no.

chana joffe-walt

What to make of that? When you get what you say you want and then, given
the opportunity, don’t take it. Maybe you never really wanted it in the
first place. Then I spoke to Elaine Hencke. Of all the people I spoke
with, everything about Elaine indicated someone who did believe in
integration, someone who would send her kids to 293. And yet, she
didn’t. Elaine was a public school teacher. She taught in an
integrated elementary school, until she had her own kids. She was
looking forward to sending them to an integrated 293. When her daughter
was old enough for junior high school, Elaine visited the school. She
was the only letter writer I spoke with who actually went into the
building. If this was going to work with anyone, it was going to be
Elaine.

  - elaine hencke  
    I didn’t know quite what to make of it because the school had a nice
    plant. Physically, it was a nice school. But it just seemed chaotic
    and noisy, and kids were disruptive. And kids — \[LAUGHS\] — kids
    were doing the wrong things, you know? And kids do. I mean, it
    wasn’t that they were nasty kids or doing — it was not drugs. It
    was not drugs. It was just — it just seemed too chaotic to me at the
    time.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine and I talked for a long time I pushed her — not to make her feel
bad, but to get to what felt like a more real answer. At the time that
you are visiting, was it majority Black and Hispanic kids?

  - elaine hencke  
    Yes, I’m sure it was.

chana joffe-walt

And did that have anything to do with the way that you saw the classroom
as disruptive and chaotic?

  - elaine hencke  
    I would hope not.
    
    I’m not — I’m not sure how well educated they were, or — you know, I
    don’t know. I don’t know why I’m going into this.

chana joffe-walt

Well, did you have reason to think that they weren’t well educated?

  - elaine hencke  
    Before 293? Well, their reading levels were way down. You know.

chana joffe-walt

I’m just — when you say chaos and disruptive, I’m trusting that what you
saw was chaotic and disruptive. But I also know that those are words
white people use — we use to express our racial fears, to express real
racial fears. Do you think that’s what was happening with you?

  - elaine hencke  
    I don’t think I would admit to that. I don’t think that was true.
    But what I may have thought was that these kids are not expected to
    do so well in school, all the way from the beginning of school. And
    here they are, really unprepared in some way, for junior high school
    or — I mean, the reading levels were low.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine told me when she wrote that letter to the Board of Education, she
pictured her children becoming friends with Black kids, learning
side-by-side, learning that all children are equal. That’s what
motivated her to write that letter. She wanted the picture of
integration the Board of Ed was promoting — the picture of harmonious
integration. But when she visited I.S. 293, that didn’t seem possible.
The reading levels were low. The kids were not entering the school on
equal grounds. Her white children had received years of high quality
teaching at well-resourced schools. The kids coming from segregated
elementary schools had not had that experience.

  - elaine hencke  
    I mean, one of the problems is that many of the white kids had
    higher sort of academic skills, or skills. They could read better. I
    think — I mean, if the white kids knew how to read in first grade
    and — and I guess there were Black kids who also could. But it just
    seemed as if most of the black kids didn’t really learn — learn to
    read.

chana joffe-walt

But part of the — part of the vocal complaints of black parents at this
period of time was that their kids were not learning how to read because
schools were segregated, and their kids were kept in schools that were
inferior. And that was part of the argument for integration.

  - elaine hencke  
    Yes, yes.

chana joffe-walt

That their kids were not going to get the resources, and quality
teaching, and good facilities unless they were in the same buildings
with kids like yours.

  - elaine hencke  
    Right.
    
    I don’t know what to say to that. I just — I guess I just began to
    feel that things were really difficult for these kids. Schools were
    not made for them. If the schools were made for them, with their
    background, what would they be like?
    
    I think there was — and that’s another whole thing. I don’t know
    about it. I think there was sort of anger in the black community at
    the white community. A lot of the teachers were white. There were
    more white teachers, I suppose. People said that that was racism.
    And of course, it was racism. But maybe the kids were a little angry
    at the school. I wouldn’t — I couldn’t fault them for that. But on
    the other hand, then they don’t get as much from the school. I don’t
    know. I thought the problems were kind of enormous. And I guess I
    just, at one point, I just decided that my kids should go — went to
    Brooklyn Friends. And we could afford to pay for it. It wasn’t easy,
    you know. It was — \[LAUGHS\] but —

chana joffe-walt

Did your feelings about integration change? Did you believe in it less?

  - elaine hencke  
    Maybe.
    
    I think I would have said no, theoretically. But maybe they did. I
    guess I saw it as a more difficult project then. I sort of did back
    off from it. I just —

chana joffe-walt

Yeah. It felt when you guys wrote these letters like, this is —
integration is this exciting ideal, and we can be part of it, and it’s
going to be a meaningful project that’s also going to be kind of easy.

  - elaine hencke  
    I certainly didn’t think it would be so difficult. But I — I was, I
    was innocent, you know? I don’t know. I still believe in it. I do.

\[music\]

chana joffe-walt

I think what Elaine actually meant was not that she was innocent, but
that she was naive. She was naive about the reality of segregation, the
harm of it. And naive about what it would take to undo it. She did not
know. And I think she didn’t want to know. When Elaine said the word
innocent, I felt a jolt of recognition. I felt like Elaine had walked me
right up to the truth about her, and about me.

When my own kids were old enough, I sent them to our zoned public
school. It was racially mixed and economically mixed. I was excited
about that. And it was nice walking to school with neighbors, people I
likely never would have gotten to know otherwise. My kid’s first day of
school was another boy’s first week in the country. He’d just moved from
China, and his mom asked the neighbor where the school was. When she
said goodbye that first morning, I think he thought I was a teacher, and
he crawled into my lap. We had no words in common, so I just held him
while he screamed and cried. By the holiday show three months later, I
watched that same boy belt out “This Pretty Planet” on a stage with his
classmates. He was the star. He nailed the hand motions. Every other kid
up on stage was just following his lead, just trying to keep up. It was
such a sweet picture, all of them up there — Black kids, and Mexican
kids, and Colombian, and Asian and white kids. And all of us adults
supporting all of them. It’s moving, to me, this picture of integration.
It is also, I’m realizing right now, writing these words down, the very
same picture the Board of Education put forth in 1954 — a multiracial
choir singing together, building brotherhood. And it’s dangerous, I
think, this picture of integration. It seems perfectly designed to
preserve my innocence, to make me comfortable, not to remedy inequality,
but a way to bypass it entirely. I can sit in that assembly and feel
good about the gauzy display of integration without ever being asked to
think about the fact that much of the time, white kids in the school
building are having a different educational experience than kids of
color. A large share of the white students at the school are clustered
in a gifted program. They have separate classrooms and separate
teachers. We all blithely call these white children gifted and talented,
G\&T, starting at four years old. White children are performing better
at the school than black children and Latino children. White families
are the loudest and most powerful voices in the building. The advantages
white kids had back in the 1950s, they’re still in place. When Elaine
said she was innocent, I thought about the things we say, nice, white
parents, to each other about why we won’t send our kids to segregated
schools — because they’re too strict, or too chaotic, or too disruptive.
Because the test scores are bad, because we want more play. We want
fewer worksheets. Because we don’t want to ride a bus. We don’t want
uniforms. We don’t want tests. We want innocence. We need it, to protect
us from the reality that we are the ones creating the segregation, and
we’re not sure we’re ready to give it up.

\[music\]

Elaine was not for segregation. But in the end, she wasn’t really for
integration, either. All of the choices she made, choices she had the
luxury of making, were meant to advantage her own kids. And I understand
that. That’s what parents do.

  - elaine  
    I remember thinking very clearly that OK, I believe in this. But I
    don’t sort of want to sacrifice my children to it. I have to look at
    what they will learn, and what they will do. And for people who sent
    their kids to 293, it seemed to work out well. So that made me
    think, well, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe they should have gone
    there. I know at one point it was very clear to me that I had
    beliefs that I thought were kind of contrary to my own children’s
    best interests. And I decided that I wasn’t going to use them to
    sort of extend my own beliefs. But then I regretted that, because
    that wasn’t really true.

chana joffe-walt

You regretted what?

  - elaine  
    Well, I kind of wish I had sent them to 293 because Joan’s kids had
    a good experience there.

chana joffe-walt

Elaine’s friend Joan, another white mom who did send her kids to I.S.
293. Elaine still feels bad about her choice. But not everyone felt bad.

  - carol netzer  
    We were not pious, kind of, oh, the kids have to go to public
    school. Not at all. I went to public schools, and there’s nothing to
    write about.

chana joffe-walt

Carol is the woman who wrote the letter about how she’d come to New York
City from the suburbs for integration. I had a hard time reconciling her
lack of piety with her letter, which I read back to her, about wanting
her kids to mix freely with children of other classes and races.
\[READING\] — which we were not able to provide for them when we lived
in the Westchester suburb.

  - carol netzer  
    That was all true. Yeah, yeah.

chana joffe-walt

You remember feeling that way?

  - carol netzer  
    Well, I don’t really remember feeling that way. And I think that we
    say a lot of things that are politically correct, without even
    realizing that we are not telling exactly how we feel. So I can’t
    really guarantee that it was 100% the way I felt. I don’t really
    remember. Probably close to it, but I mean, I’m a liberal, you know?

chana joffe-walt

As a parent, did you — do you remember feeling like, I hope my kid has
experiences outside of just people like them?

  - carol netzer  
    Not especially. I mean, we rushed right away to send them to private
    school, right? So what was most important to us was that they get
    the best education. But one of the things that changed it was St.
    Anne’s School, a sort of progressive school with this man,
    headmaster, who was brilliant. Opened up St. Anne’s. And if you keep
    working on this, you’ll hear a lot about St. Anne’s.

chana joffe-walt

I’m not going to tell you a lot about St. Anne’s, except to say this —
it’s one of the most prominent private schools in Brooklyn. Upscale
neighborhood, prime real estate, lots of heavy-hitters send their kids
to St. Anne’s. I had heard of it. What I didn’t know is that St. Anne’s
opened at the very same time that Black parents were waging their
strongest fight for integration in New York City, in 1965. Right when a
lot of the letter writers would have been looking for schools. And it
wasn’t just St. Anne’s. New progressive private schools were opening and
expanding all over the city. Brooklyn Friends School expanded into a new
building, and would double its enrollment. They were opening private
schools in the South, too. But down there, it was all very explicit.
They became known as quote, unquote, “segregation academies,” schools
for white people who were wholeheartedly committed to avoiding
integration. In the North, private schools opened as if they were
completely disconnected from everything else that was happening at that
very moment. St. Anne’s marketed itself as a pioneer, a community of
like-minded, gifted kids, no grades. Lots of talk about progressive,
child-centered education, the whole child. At one point in my
conversation with Carol Netzer I was talking about how integration was
happening around his time. And she surprised me by saying, no, not at
that time.

  - carol netzer  
    I think the — I think that you may be off on the timing for me,
    because it was too early. They didn’t start really any kind of
    crusade about integrating until well after I had left the
    neighborhood.

chana joffe-walt

No, they were integrating the schools in the ‘60s, though.

  - carol netzer  
    Oh. It didn’t make much of a splash. We weren’t against it. There
    was — it wasn’t a big item.

chana joffe-walt

That’s how easy it was to walk away from integration in New York City.
You could do it without even knowing you’d thrown a bomb over your
shoulder on the way out.

\[music\]

Here is what I think happened over those five years between the writing
of the letters in 1963 and not sending their kids to the school in 1968.
Those five years were a battle between the Board of Education’s
definition of integration and the actual integration that black parents
wanted. For black parents, integration was about safe schools for their
children, with qualified teachers and functioning toilets, a full day of
school. For them, integration was a remedy for injustice. The Board of
Ed, though, took that definition and retooled it. Integration wasn’t a
means to an end. It was about racial harmony and diversity. The Board
spun integration into a virtue that white parents could feel good about.
And their side triumphed. That’s the definition of integration that
stuck, that’s still with us today. It’s the version of integration that
was being celebrated 50 years later, at the French Cultural Services
Building at the Gala for SAS.

In some of my calls with the white letter writers, a few people
mentioned that yes, they wanted integration. But also, they wanted the
school closer to them. They weren’t comfortable sending their kids over
to the other side of the neighborhood. Which brings me to one final
letter from the other side of the neighborhood. One I haven’t told you
about, from the I.S. 293 folder in the archives. It’s one of the only
letters, as far as I can tell, that is not from a white parent. It’s
from the Tenants Association for the Gowanus Houses, a housing project,
home to mostly Black and Puerto Rican families. They also wanted a
school closer to them. The letter from the Tenants Association is formal
and straightforward. It says, please build the school on the original
site you proposed, right next to the projects. That way, they explained,
our kids won’t have to cross many streets. We’ll get recreational
facilities, which we desperately need. And it’ll be close to the people
who will actually use it. The letter says they represent over 1,000
families. The white families, they numbered a couple dozen. Still, in
the name of integration, the white letter writers got what they wanted —
a new building close to where they lived, that they did not attend. Note
the Black and Puerto Rican families we’re not asking to share a school
with white people. They were not seeking integration. That’s not what
their letter was about. They were asking for a school, period. The
school they got was three blocks further than they wanted. And from the
moment it opened, I.S. 293 was de facto segregated — an overwhelmingly
Black and Puerto Rican school. What were those years like, once the
white parents pushing their priorities went away? Once there were no
more efforts at feel-good integration, and the community was finally
left alone? Was that better? That’s next time, on “Nice White Parents.”

In this episode, Chana Joffe-Walt searches the New York City Board of
Education archives for more information about the School for
International Studies, which was originally called I.S. 293.

In the process, she finds a folder of letters written in 1963 by mostly
white families in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. They are asking for the board
to change the proposed construction of the school to a site where it
would be more likely to be racially integrated.

It’s less than a decade after Brown v. Board of Education, amid a
growing civil rights movement, and the white parents writing letters are
emphatic that they want an integrated school. They get their way and the
school site changes — but after that, nothing else goes as planned.
