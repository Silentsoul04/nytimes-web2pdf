``Nice White Parents'' is a new podcast from Serial Productions, a New
York Times Company, about the 60-year relationship between white parents
and the public school down the block.

In this episode, Chana Joffe-Walt searches the New York City Board of
Education archives for more information about the School for
International Studies, which was originally called I.S. 293.

In the process, she finds a folder of letters written in 1963 by mostly
white families in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. They are asking for the board
to change the proposed construction of the school to a site where it
would be more likely to be racially integrated.

It's less than a decade after Brown v. Board of Education, amid a
growing civil rights movement, and the white parents writing letters are
emphatic that they want an integrated school. They get their way and the
school site changes --- but after that, nothing else goes as planned.

``Nice White Parents'' was reported by Chana Joffe-Walt; produced by
