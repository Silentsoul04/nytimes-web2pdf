# SEC Becomes Latest College Football League to Shrink Schedule

</div>

The Southeastern Conference, the most influential league in college
football, said it would delay the start of its season and have its teams
play only within the conference.

As universities desperately try to rescue the college football season
while [the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus)
continues to grip the country, the Southeastern Conference became the
latest — and most influential — league to push back the start of its
season and trim its schedule to conference-only games.

The SEC’s decision, made by the conference’s 14 university presidents,
comes one day after the Atlantic Coast Conference came to a similar
conclusion — also including Notre Dame, which is a member of the
conference in other sports but usually an independent in football.

The SEC announced it would move the start of the season back by at least
three weeks, to Sept. 26, and play 10 games, which would leave each
school with an open date — along with another open weekend preceding the
conference championship game, which is now scheduled for Dec. 19.

The Big Ten and the Pac-12 conferences had previously announced they
would play only conference games this season. That leaves only the Big
12 among the so-called Power 5 conferences that has not amended its
schedule, though the conference on Thursday did cancel its media day,
which had already been pushed back.

The shrinking and fluid schedules are the extraordinary measures being
taken to ensure that universities can salvage the lucrative television
revenues that, along with an unpaid labor force — the players — fuel the
college athletics industrial complex. The SEC brought in $720.6 million
in revenue for the fiscal year ending last Aug. 31, [according to USA
Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2020/01/30/sec-generated-721-million-revenue-still-trails-big-ten/2856234001/).

Even without fans, the schools still stand to receive considerable
payouts from their broadcast deals. The Big Ten has the richest TV
contract, paying its schools as much as $54 million each last season.

The conference-only schedules have meant the cancellation of certain
rivalry games, like South Carolina and Clemson, and marquee interleague
games, [like Alabama and Southern
California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/sports/ncaafootball/college-football-no-fans.html),
which had been scheduled in Arlington, Tex., and Texas at Louisiana
State.

But by playing only conference games, schools can mostly avoid traveling
outside their regions and also can more firmly standardize virus testing
and safety protocols.

“We believe these schedule adjustments offer the best opportunity to
complete a full season by giving us the ability to adapt to the fluid
nature of the virus and the flexibility to adjust schedules as necessary
if disruptions occur,” SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said in a statement
announcing the changes.

The SEC plans to announce its new schedule next month.

The college football season, though, is increasingly in jeopardy at a
time when the virus, which had caused [nearly 152,000 deaths in the
United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)as
of Thursday, has shown few signs of slowing. The difficulty of playing
even a truncated season has been on display in the last week in Major
League Baseball, which saw the Miami Marlins temporarily shut down — and
their opponents rescheduled — after half the roster contracted the
virus.

More than a dozen college football teams — with Michigan State, Colorado
State and Rutgers among the latest — have been forced to abandon
football workouts over the summer after outbreaks. Meanwhile, Penn State
reported eight positive coronavirus tests among its athletes on
Wednesday.

Conditions have recently been dire in many of the 11 states that are
part of the SEC footprint — including Florida and Mississippi, which is
experiencing the [greatest increase in cases per
capita.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
