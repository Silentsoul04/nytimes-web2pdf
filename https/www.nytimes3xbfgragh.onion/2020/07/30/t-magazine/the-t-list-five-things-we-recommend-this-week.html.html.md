A few blocks from Paris’s stately Palais-Royal in the First
Arrondissement exists a dramatic enclave of flowers. This eponymous new
floral gallery, created by the Honduran (and formerly New York
City-based) florist [Arturo
Arita](https://www.instagram.com/arturoarita/), is an all-white grotto
that enshrines fresh blooms — not mythological deities — in its rocky
alcoves. Arita’s shop was designed by the Parisian architect [Sophie
Dries](https://www.sophiedries.com/), whose assignment was to come up
with something inspired by the pair’s shared appreciation for the
Mannerist-style caves found in Renaissance-era Italian gardens,
including those of Villa d’Este in Tivoli and Villa Medici in Rome.
There’s also a [Barovier &
Toso](https://www.barovier.com/en/collections/chandeliers) chandelier
that looks like a piece of fruit hanging from the vine, a leaf-shaped
lamp by André Arbus and a dramatic center table made of a raw-edged slab
of Brazilian marble upon which Arita creates his designs. He tends to
feature vibrantly hued, sculptural flowers such as Heliconia She Kongs
and Protea Venuses along with geometric fronds, placed in
contrasting-colored, Art Deco-style vases. The space’s mirrored walls
heighten its lushness so much so that you might feel as though you’re in
a botanical garden, not the center of Paris.

Founded in the aftermath of 9/11, the [River to River
Festival](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/26/arts/dance/river-to-river-festival.html)
is an annual celebration of the arts in Lower Manhattan that in the past
has included work by Yoko Ono and Pam Tanowitz. The challenges of the
present moment led the organizers to rethink how the public can interact
with art — and the result is River to River 2020: Four Voices, where
projects take on a physical presence that can be viewed in open spaces
over time. In “Blessing of the Boats*,*” the artist Muna Malik asks us
to consider what concrete actions can lead us to a better future, write
them on an origami boat and place them in a 20-foot maquette of a ship
in the Battery’s Belvedere Plaza. The artist Jean Shin has two pieces —
“Floating MAiZE” ** and “The Last Straw” — ** that repurpose plastic
waste to raise questions of belonging and identity. The
multidisciplinary artist Mona Chalabi, known for transforming
statistical truths into visual narratives, has used census data to
condense the city’s sprawling population down to a graphic project
called “100 New Yorkers,*”* which will be displayed on posters and
screens around the Oculus building. Finally, the poet Asiya Wadud
presents “Echo Exhibit,” in which she and other writers have transformed
15-minute phone calls with residents of Lower Manhattan into poems that
are displayed on vinyl posters in storefronts throughout the
neighborhood. From over 200 hours of conversations in half a dozen
languages — including American Sign Language — Wadud has curated a
series of 20 poems, which she calls echoes. “Poems in public spaces
create the potential to encounter something new and unexpected,” said
Wadud, who teaches poetry at Saint Ann’s School in Brooklyn. *All events
are free and run through August 30 in various locations in New York
City,*

As many restaurateurs around the globe wonder when, if ever, they’ll be
able to reopen their dining rooms, the husband-and-wife duo Michael and
Lindsay Tusk — who run San Francisco’s renowned Quince, among other
spots — have come up with a creative solution: bringing diners to the
farm. Two farms, in fact: Fresh Run in Bolinas, Calif., and McEvoy Ranch
in nearby Marin County, where, each weekend from now through the end of
October, they’ll host a rotating series of socially distanced alfresco
lunches and dinners across the rolling acreage from which many of their
ingredients are sourced. The meals, which are meant to be more casual
than those served at their flagship — flat shoes and hats are encouraged
— begin with California-inspired aperitifs and passed canapés (such as
local halibut tartare and Romano bean salad) before moving onto a
hyperlocal, multicourse offering that changes by the week but might
include, say, fresh corn with edible farm flowers and Stemple roast beef
“grilled from up the road in its own smoked fat,” as the menu explains.
The idea isn’t simply to relocate their business but to fully reimagine
it, bringing Quince closer to its roots. Fittingly, at the end of each
feast, guests will be invited to pick vegetables or berries to take
home. *For details, pricing and availability, visit*

Earlier this year, it was announced that 10 works of art by Ruth Asawa —
about whom I
[wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/t-magazine/ruth-asawa.html)
for T’s online art issue, “True Believers,” which launched last week —
would appear on United States postage stamps. Asawa, who was born in
Norwalk, Calif., in 1926 and was incarcerated during World War II along
with over 100,000 other Japanese-Americans and people of Japanese
descent, eventually found her way to Black Mountain College, where she
studied with Buckminster Fuller and Josef Albers. A gifted artist, she
began creating masterful abstract sculpture work made from wire in 1947.
Though she was represented by a well-respected midtown gallery called
Peridot in the 1950s and ’60s, Asawa eventually withdrew from the New
York City art scene, becoming more engaged with public sculpture,
community-based arts education and activism in San Francisco. More
recently, Asawa has become the subject of what some might call a
rediscovery, so it comes as no surprise that she’s been given the honor
of being featured on a postage stamp, alongside other great Americans,
such as the artist Ellsworth Kelly, the writer Nella Larsen and the poet
Walt Whitman. Designed by Ethel Kessler, the stamps can be preordered
now and will be made available Aug. 13. *$11 for a sheet of 20 stamps,*

As New York cautiously reopens its public spaces, a project by the
design group Pentagram is offering the city’s residents a digital one in
which to both reflect and look forward. Visitors to the web page [Dear
New York](https://dear-new-york.com/) are invited to explore and add to
a collection of messages written on virtual sticky notes, each one
expressing what its author has missed about the city in recent months or
desires for its future. Overseen by Pentagram partner Giorgia Lupi, an
authority in data visualization, the project has been an exercise in
creating **** a humanized digital interface that encourages genuine
connection. The “crowdsourced love letter,” as Lupi describes it,
presents a rich, dynamic **** world — notes can be precisely positioned
on one of a number of randomized backgrounds that depict intimate
surface details of everyday New York, from dust-streaked storefront
windows to mottled patches of sidewalk. As contributions multiply, Lupi
hopes the project will become an engaging emotional record of a city in
the midst of social and cultural upheaval — a “monument of a moment in
time.” [*dear-new-york.com*](https://dear-new-york.com/)*.*
