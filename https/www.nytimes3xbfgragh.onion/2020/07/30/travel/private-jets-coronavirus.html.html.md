# Afraid of Airlines? There’s Always the Private Jet

</div>

Concerned about virus-related safety on commercial planes, many fliers
are turning to private jets for the first time. The catch, of course, is
the price.

Lexi Shangraw, a San Francisco resident, flew to Phoenix in early March
for what was supposed to be a brief visit. But when lockdowns started,
she ended up staying longer than anticipated in hopes of waiting out
Covid-19.

Last month, she decided it was finally time to return home. Dubious
about the safety of big commercial airlines, she chose
[JSX,](https://www.jsx.com/home/search) a hybrid private jet service
that departs from small, private terminals. In the world of private jet
travel, Ms. Shangraw got a good deal. Her one-way ticket on a
semiprivate jet to Oakland, Calif., cost $159. That same day, a flight
to the Bay Area on American Airlines would have cost $150, she said.

Ms. Shangraw is among the growing number of Americans using private
jets, seeing them as a safer alternative to the often [cramped
commercial
flights](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/travel/crowded-flights-coronavirus.html)
filled with strangers during the pandemic. The day after the Fourth of
July, when commercial airline travel was down 74 percent year-over-year,
private jet flights were up five percent, according to [an analysis of
data from Argus, an aviation consulting
firm](https://privatejetcardcomparisons.com/2020/07/10/heres-where-the-private-jets-were-flying-for-the-july-4th-holiday/#more-38454),
by Doug Gollan, who runs the website [Private Jet Card
Comparisons.](https://privatejetcardcomparisons.com/)

On JSX, passengers still fly with up to 29 strangers (though Ms.
Shangraw said there were fewer than 15 on her flight), but there’s no
need to arrive two hours early (the company recommends 20 minutes),
because there are no security lines and no complex boarding procedures.
JSX flights tend to cost between $300 and $500 one way, per person, but
some shorter legs can cost less than $100.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## The price of exclusivity

Compared to most private jet services, JSX is downright affordable. Some
customers are opting for pricey, custom charter flights that can cost
anywhere from a few thousand dollars to more than $10,000 per hour,
based on factors like aircraft type and in-flight service.

Even when paying top dollar, many travelers are seeing value in
springing for private flights amid a pandemic. That includes people like
Franklin Antoian, the founder of the personal training website iBodyFit,
who — along with his wife and two kids — took his first-ever private jet
ride last month from Palm Beach, Fla., to visit family in upstate New
York. It cost $20,000, about six times more than Mr. Antoian’s usual
first-class fares for his family of four. He justified the cost, saying
this may be his family’s only flight this year.

A town car arrived at their home and shuttled them directly to the door
of a small airport with plush chairs and no blaring loudspeakers. The
plane left when the family was ready.

It’s a far cry from [ever-changing rules about middle
seats](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/world/canada/canada-airlines-coronavirus.html),
[passengers refusing to wear
masks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/american-airlines-mask-brandon-straka.html)
and [flight attendants telling off passengers for sitting in an
unoccupied exit
row](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/travel/airplanes-social-distancing-coronavirus.html)
for more space. And while travelers on commercial airlines report
[confusion over mask
policies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/travel/coronavirus-flying-face-masks.html)
not being enforced, flying private means everyone has their face
covered.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’d always wanted to fly on a private jet, and then I started thinking
about what travel might otherwise be like on a commercial airline,” Mr.
Antoian said. “I didn’t want to wait in a crowded terminal. I didn’t
want the chance that someone on the plane might complain about wearing a
mask and the plane might be delayed.”

“Flying private is much safer, and consistently so,” said Sridhar Tayur,
founder of OrganJet, a company that provides private jet travel for
organ-transplant patients. “Social distancing is easier. The pilots wear
masks. The passengers — usually a small number — know each
other.”

The major drawback for many travelers is, of course, the cost. A one-way
charter flight between New York and Miami with the private jet company
[Silver Air](https://www.silverair.com/) costs between $15,000 and
$20,000 for the entire aircraft, depending on the jet (their planes seat
between four and 10). Bring nine friends, and that still amounts to a
few thousand dollars per person each way — significantly more than the
cost of your average first-class ticket, and far more than the price of
a basic economy seat. Another company, [Jet It,](https://gojetit.com/)
charges $4,200 per hour (though purchasing a membership reduces the
per-hour rate to $1,600), not including airport fees. Their HondaJet
Elite aircraft seats six.

To reduce the price of the $8,000-to-$10,000-per-hour flight, Jamie
Gibson, the founder of the website
[Flightess](https://www.flightess.com/) and a high-end charter flight
attendant, says more groups of first-time fliers are chartering planes
with friends and family, and thus reducing the per-person cost.
Prepandemic, her regular clients were executives who tended to travel
alone. The cost is further reduced by the CARES Act tax break. Private
jet customers aren’t required to pay the 7.5 percent Federal Excise Tax
between March 28 and Dec. 31, 2020, which is typically charged on all
private jet flights and hours. Additionally, companies don’t have to pay
any fuel taxes during that period, which is one less cost they would
otherwise pass onto consumers.

## Gaining in popularity

While [commercial air
travel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/10/business/airlines-coronavirus-bleak-future.html)
is getting pummeled, private jet travel has not been hit nearly as hard,
said Mr. Gollan.

In April, passenger count on commercial airlines fell 95 percent
year-over-year, while passenger count on private jet charters was down
67 percent, according to Mr. Gollan’s analysis of Argus’s data. By June,
private jet operators saw just a 22 percent decrease.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“With virtually no business travel, the rebound was fueled by existing
customers flying for personal reasons and newcomers to the market,” Mr.
Gollan said. “Private flying isn’t fully back, but certainly the
industry is in much better shape than airlines. There is a strong flow
of new-to-private-aviation customers.”

XO, which offers both private charters and the ability to book
individual seats on private jets, saw a 19.8 percent decrease in hours
flown in the first half of 2020 versus the first half of 2019, according
to Argus data. But the company said monthly membership sales between
March and May 2020 among first-time private jet fliers averaged five
times higher than their monthly averages.

Two other companies have also seen increased interest. [Sentient
Jet](https://www.sentient.com/) said more than 50 percent of the 8,000
flight hours in June were sold to first-time customers, up from about 25
to 30 percent in most months. And [Air Charter
Service](https://www.aircharterserviceusa.com/) said in a press release
that in May and June, it saw a 75 percent increase in year-over-year
inquiries from potential customers.

The trend looks likely to continue as commercial air travel may only
become more painful. JetBlue is blocking middle seats through at least
Sept. 8 and Southwest Airlines is doing the same through at least Oct.
31 — but it’s unclear what happens after that. Luxuries like airport
lounges are closed with no indication when they’ll reopen. And
passengers report [flights being canceled at the last
minute](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/travel/travel-refunds-airlines.html).

## Who is flying private

Ms. Gibson said in addition to families and friends on vacation, she’s
recently flown students who needed to return from college or boarding
schools and older passengers who feel especially at risk flying
commercial airlines. And as airlines cut back on international flights
in response to [countries closing their
borders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html)
to some foreigners, including Americans, she’s also flying a number of
repatriation
trips.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Private jet travel allows citizens of other countries to find a way
home. For repatriation flights from the United States to a country where
travel is restricted to citizens only, the plane can land, but Ms.
Gibson and her crewmates can’t set foot on foreign land. The passenger
departs, and the crew immediately leaves the country. It is not advised
to use a private jet to skirt entry restrictions — just look at the
[five American travelers who chartered a private jet to
Sardinia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/world/europe/american-passport-privilege-coronavirus.html),
but were turned away upon arrival.

Even dogs are flying on chartered planes. Elsa Chen, a Bernedoodle
puppy, was purchased by her owners through a website called
[PuppySpot](https://www.puppyspot.com/). They paid the company’s
standard flat rate of $799 to send dogs via air cargo. But when Elsa’s
American Airlines flight from Chicago O’Hare to San Francisco was
canceled last month and could not be rebooked for several days,
PuppySpot rebooked Elsa on a private jet and had her arrive in San
Francisco nearly on schedule. As a result, PuppySpot is now flying all
of its dogs on private planes.

## Mask, gloves and cleaning

These days, most passengers’ biggest safety concerns center on Covid-19.
Ms. Gibson and her crewmates now wear a mask and gloves throughout the
flight, but she said some customers still opt out of most in-flight
service as a precaution. About 15 percent of her clients now prefer
plastic plates in lieu of fine porcelain china to minimize risk, and
about the same number ask to be mostly left alone in the cabin to
maintain distancing.

JSX said they’ve always wiped down high-touch areas like seats, armrests
and tray tables at the start and end of each day. Since the Covid-19
pandemic, they’ve ramped up cleaning to occur “throughout the day” with
hospital-grade disinfectant.

With most of the modern stresses of commercial travel absent, Mr.
Antoian said his private jet experience harkened back to the 1950s era
of “the Golden Age of plane travel,” a time when flying felt glamorous.

“You’re not just offering coffee or tea,” Ms. Gibson said. “You’re
offering a cappuccino or espresso. You’re not just handing them a bag of
cookies or peanuts. I offer to bake them a souffle. Any custom food
requests, we can order or make.”

Mr. Antoian didn’t ask for any custom orders (his kids ate sandwiches
from home) — but it wasn’t out of any coronavirus-related caution.

“I just didn’t want to inconvenience anyone,” he said. Even without a
souffle, Mr. Antoian said the experience was well worth it for (most of)
his family.

His 4-year-old son still prefers Delta.

“He knows how to work the Delta TV and how to navigate the Disney
movies,” he said. “He had to watch it on my wife’s iPad. He was
disappointed.”
