# Native Americans Feel Devastated by the Virus Yet Overlooked in the Data

</div>

Statistical gaps can make it difficult to properly allocate public
resources to Native Americans. When that’s the case, one leader said,
“tribal nations have an effective death sentence.”

HARRAH, Wash. — As the coronavirus outbreak in Washington State’s Yakima
County worsened last month, Tashina Nunez recognized more and more of
the patients who arrived in her hospital. They had coughs, fevers and,
in some severe cases, respiratory failure. And many of them were her
acquaintances and neighbors, members of the tribes that make up the
Yakama Nation.

Ms. Nunez, a nurse at a hospital in Yakima County and a Yakama Nation
descendant, noticed that Native Americans, who make up about 7 percent
of the county’s population, seemed to account for many of the hospital’s
virus patients. Because the hospital does not routinely record race and
ethnicity data, she said, it was hard for Ms. Nunez to know for certain.

“Not being counted is not new to us,” she said. Without firm figures,
she and other health care providers for Native communities said they
struggled to know where or how to intervene to stop the spread. “You
don’t know how bad it is until it’s too late,” Ms. Nunez said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By mid-July, more than 650 members of the Yakama Nation, in central
Washington State, had contracted the virus — about 6 percent of the
total membership. Twenty-eight people have died, Delano Saluskin,
chairman of the Yakama Nation, [said in a video
update](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/YakamaNationInfo/posts/2901001803343892).

“We all grieve those losses,” he said. “This has been devastating for
many families on the reservation and it means that, every week, a family
member is impacted.”

The situation among the Yakama Nation is not unique. Even with
significant gaps in the data that is available, there are strong
indications that Native Americans have been disproportionately affected
by the coronavirus.

The rate of known cases in the eight counties with the largest
populations of Native Americans is nearly double the national average, a
New York Times analysis has found. The analysis cannot determine which
individuals are testing positive for the virus, but these counties are
home to one in six U.S. residents who describe themselves in census
surveys as non-Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska
Native.

The Times identified at least 15 counties that have elevated case rates
and are home to sizable numbers of Native American residents. Those
counties ranged from large metropolitan areas in Arizona to rural
communities in Nebraska and
Mississippi.

In New Mexico, Native American and Alaska Native people have accounted
for [nearly 40 percent of virus
cases](https://cvprovider.nmhealth.org/public-dashboard.html) even
though they make up 9 percent of the population.

Native Americans in the Phoenix area have been [infected at four times
the rate of their white
neighbors](https://phdata.maricopa.gov/Dashboard/e10a16d8-921f-4aac-b921-26d95e638a45?e=false&vo=viewonly).
The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation [extended a shelter-in-place

[Hospitalization rates
published](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html)
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also suggest that
Native Americans are overrepresented among those who become seriously
ill from the virus. The data about Covid-19 is collected from a sample
of counties and provides an incomplete picture, but the conclusion is
unsurprising to epidemiologists who study the health of Native
Americans.

“The disparities we see there with Covid are aligned with those that we
see for hospitalizations and deaths due to influenza and other
respiratory viruses,” said Allison Barlow, director of the Center for
American Indian Health at Johns Hopkins University.

Native Americans — particularly those living on reservations — are more
prone to contract the virus because of crowded housing conditions that
make social distancing difficult, she said. And years of underfunded
health systems, food and water insecurity and other factors contribute
to underlying health conditions that can make the illness more severe
once contracted.

Yet understanding the extent of how Native American people have been
disproportionately affected by Covid-19 is extremely difficult.

Calculating how many people who identify as Native American have had the
virus and how many have died of it is nearly impossible because federal
data tracking individual coronavirus cases often omits information about
the race and ethnicity of people; such information is missing from about
half the cases reported to the C.D.C., which serves as a clearinghouse
for cases reported by state and local authorities.

Even when such information is collected, it is uncertain how accurate it
is. Miscounting can begin at testing sites and health clinics, public
health officials said, where health care workers sometimes do not record
a patient’s race and ethnicity data, or simply guess without asking a
patient.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Indian Health Service has identified at least 30,987 cases among
Native Americans and Alaska Natives, but tribal nations are not required
to share their data. Just under half of tribal health centers and 61
percent of urban health services serving Native Americans have provided
case information, an I.H.S. spokeswoman said.

After suing the C.D.C., [The Times obtained a database with the
characteristics of 1.5 million
individuals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html)
who tested positive for the virus through the end of May. The data
showed that people who were Black or Latino were three times as likely
to become infected as people who were white.

The data provided only part of the picture, though, when it came to
Native Americans because of gaps in the data: It included geographic
information and racial classifications for just 974 of the 3,143
counties in the nation, and did not include some of the places where
Native American people make up large parts of the population. What
information there was did show a disparity: The infection rate for
Native Americans was 1.7 times the rate for white people over all, and
somewhat higher in younger age groups.

In the Yakama Nation, Haver Jim Ptxunu, a 42-year-old resident who works
for the tribal power company and helps run a nonprofit group called the
Peacekeeper Society, said he and his wife contracted the virus in
June.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“It was physical torture,” he said, adding that one of his most
debilitating symptoms was a constant eye irritation that he described
like “a bad sunburn, but inside your eyes.” Still, he felt fortunate
that he and his wife recovered after about three weeks, because he had
seen a few older couples on the reservation die.

The Peacekeeper Society operates a weekly food giveaway and delivers
food and cleaning supplies to households where people have fallen ill.
Mr. Jim said he suspected he caught the virus while out on such a
delivery.

As soon as he recovered, Mr. Jim said, he returned to his work
distributing food. On a hot July afternoon, he helped distribute boxes
filled with potatoes, zucchini, cabbage and onions to a line of hundreds
of cars. Families could choose between chicken and salmon waiting in two
kiddie pools stocked with ice.

Adding to the toll of the virus among Native Americans has been swift
and grim economic fallout. “People lost jobs really quick,” he said. “We
went from serving a dozen people a week to hundreds.”

Tribal epidemiology centers have fought for months to obtain case
information from the C.D.C., and are only now receiving snippets of what
they requested, several of the dozen centers in the United States said.
Without an accurate portrait of the rates of illness within their
populations, tribal nations have struggled to receive federal funds
aimed at economic recovery and protective gear.

“I think this historic, deep neglect is just coming into sharper focus
because of Covid,” said Liz Malerba, policy and legislative affairs
director for the United South and Eastern Tribes, a tribal epidemiology
center. “It’s always been there, but now you are seeing more clearly
what the depths are.”

A spokeswoman from the C.D.C. said the agency was working to fill gaps
in its data to better understand the impact of the virus.

“There is still more work to be done to ensure complete race and
ethnicity data in the case report forms,” said the spokeswoman, Jasmine
Reed. Since April, the agency has increased its collection of race and
ethnicity data from patients tested for the coronavirus, she said.

Ms. Malerba said many tribes did not receive federal emergency funds
equal to their needs because the Treasury Department allocated the money
using census data that undercounted tribal memberships.

“If you eliminate us in the data, you have effectively eliminated us for
the allocation of resources,” said Abigail Echo-Hawk, the director of
the Urban Indian Health Institute.

In California, tribal epidemiologists have tried to uncover cases
themselves. The California Department of Public Health publishes a daily
count of coronavirus cases, and California Tribal Epidemiology Center
pulls data from that tally in order to track the virus among the 87,000
Native people who access tribal health programs in the state.

“We can only see the number but we don’t know more information about
them, where they reside, their specific symptoms,” said Aurimar Ayala,
the center’s epidemiology manager. “It means we cannot further
investigate those cases.”

She added that the epidemiology center had created a workaround by
contacting local clinics and tracking down the cases, but said that it
was a cumbersome solution.

Although health officials are still struggling to fully understand the
impact of the coronavirus on Native American people, the severity of the
crisis in Yakama Nation is clear to residents, some said.

“It’s devastating to our community,” Ms. Nunez said. “We have these
elders that have lived through residential schools and the outlawing of
their own religion — they’ve been keeping this culture alive and now
Covid hits and it’s taking them from us.”
