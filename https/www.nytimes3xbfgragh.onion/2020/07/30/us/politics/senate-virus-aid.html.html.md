WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday dissolved into partisan bickering
over a sweeping economic stabilization package, clashing over dueling
proposals but failing to reach an agreement to prevent the expiration on
Friday of jobless aid that tens of millions of Americans have depended
on for months.

Senate Republicans, on largely party lines, ultimately forced the
chamber to begin moving forward with a continuation of the unemployment
benefits at a much lower rate, but it was mainly a tactic to compel
Democrats, who support maintaining the payments at $600 per week, to go
on the record opposing an extension.

The bitter impasse over any form of coronavirus relief persisted despite
news that the United States economy [wiped away nearly five years of
growth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)
in the second quarter of 2020, with the tally of new claims for state
unemployment benefits exceeding one million for the 19th consecutive
week. With several programs that have staved off a wave of evictions,
foreclosures and layoffs either expired or set to end in days,
economists warn that a lapse could wreak further havoc on an already
shuddering economy.

“The proposals we made were not received warmly,” Mark Meadows, the
White House chief of staff, said after a meeting on Thursday evening on
Capitol Hill with top Democratic leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin. He added as he left the building, “I wouldn’t say that optimism
is the word I would characterize the negotiations.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Mnuchin said he and Mr. Meadows, the lead negotiators for the White
House, had proposed a short-term deal in the nearly two-hour meeting,
though he declined to share details of the offer. But both Speaker Nancy
Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the
Democratic leader, rejected the proposal, Mr. Mnuchin said, and talks
are expected to continue
Friday.

“I think they understand that we have to have a bill, but they just
don’t realize how big it has to be,” Ms. Pelosi said, dismissing a
one-week extension of unemployment benefits as “worthless.”

The two administration officials and President Trump have previously
pushed for a narrow measure that would continue the unemployment
benefits and revive an expired federal moratorium on evictions. Some
Republicans have also panned the prospect of leaving other provisions
for later.

“There’s certain aspects that I think have to be in there,” said Senator
Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, before ticking off a number of
provisions, such as school funding, assistance for small businesses and
money for testing. “This is what happens when you start going through
the bill; there’s so many priorities that simply have to receive funding
in order for us to help minimize the impact of the virus.”

But many Republicans are wary of any additional spending to stabilize
the economy, saying the nearly $3 trillion in cumulative relief measures
enacted in quick succession in the spring had swollen the deficit.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Faced with significant pressure to prevent the expiration of the
unemployment insurance benefit, Republicans worked feverishly to
coalesce around a stopgap bill that could extend it, though most
proposals unveiled this week would slash the aid and present overwhelmed
state systems with [a difficult
switch](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/unemployment-payments-change.html)
that experts say is likely to disadvantage lower-wage workers.

One such proposal, which Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike
Braun of Indiana tried to push across the Senate floor on Thursday,
would have continued the extra jobless aid payments through the end of
the year, but slashed the payments to $200 a week from $600 or allow the
benefit to replace two-thirds of a worker’s prior income.

Mr. Meadows said President Trump would support a flat, one-week
extension of the $600 benefit in order to buy lawmakers time to
negotiate a longer agreement. But Democrats rejected an attempt by
Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, to win approval of such
an extension, with Mr. Schumer dismissing the effort as “a stunt” on the
Senate floor.

“This is disappointing and a political stunt and a game,” Ms. McSally,
who is badly trailing her Democratic opponent in Arizona’s Senate race,
shot back. “It’s the minority leader who is against this on his path to
try to become the majority leader, and that’s
unfortunate.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Mr. Schumer, his flip phone ringing in his pocket, spent a portion of
his day on the Senate floor, swatting last-ditch attempts by Republicans
to push through short extensions of the jobless aid and to try to pin
the blame on Democrats for blocking them. He responded with a futile and
politically loaded tactic of his own: an attempt to win approval of the
$3 trillion stimulus package House Democrats passed in May. Republicans
blocked that as well, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the
majority leader, deriding it as “a totally unserious proposal.”

“The House speaker moves the goal posts while the Democratic leader
hides the football,” said Mr. McConnell, accusing Democrats of blocking
discussions among rank-and-file lawmakers. “They won’t engage when the
administration tries to discuss our comprehensive plan. They won’t
engage when the administration floats a narrower proposal. They
basically won’t engage, period.”

Comparing negotiations with Republicans to “trying to nail Jell-O to the
wall,” Mr. Schumer noted that Mr. McConnell, whose conference remained
divided over another relief package, was notably absent from the daily
negotiations with administration officials in Ms. Pelosi’s Capitol Hill
suite. The time crunch, he said, came because Republicans had “dithered
for months” and still had yet to reach agreement on the $1 trillion
proposal they had put forward on Monday.

“Get in the room and negotiate a real deal,” Mr. Schumer said. “And stop
doing stunts that simply are political, get-it-off-my-back, that you
know cannot pass.”
