Senate Republicans forced the chamber to begin moving forward with an
extension of unemployment benefits that expire on Friday, but there was
no agreement on a measure to do so.

WASHINGTON --- The Senate on Thursday dissolved into partisan bickering
over a sweeping economic stabilization package, clashing over dueling
proposals but failing to reach an agreement to prevent the expiration on
Friday of jobless aid that tens of millions of Americans have depended
on for months.

Senate Republicans, on largely party lines, ultimately forced the
chamber to begin moving forward with a continuation of the unemployment
benefits at a much lower rate, but it was mainly a tactic to compel
Democrats, who support maintaining the payments at \$600 per week, to go
on the record opposing an extension.

The bitter impasse over any form of coronavirus relief persisted despite
news that the United States economy
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html}{wiped
away nearly five years of growth} in the second quarter of 2020, with
the tally of new claims for state unemployment benefits exceeding one
million for the 19th consecutive week. With several programs that have
staved off a wave of evictions, foreclosures and layoffs either expired
or set to end in days, economists warn that a lapse could wreak further
havoc on an already shuddering economy.

``The proposals we made were not received warmly,'' Mark Meadows, the
White House chief of staff, said after a meeting on Thursday evening on
Capitol Hill with top Democratic leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin. He added as he left the building, ``I wouldn't say that
optimism is the word I would characterize the negotiations.''

Mr. Mnuchin said he and Mr. Meadows, the lead negotiators for the White
House, had proposed a short-term deal in the nearly two-hour meeting,
though he declined to share details of the offer. But both Speaker Nancy
Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the
Democratic leader, rejected the proposal, Mr. Mnuchin said, and talks
are expected to continue Friday.

``I think they understand that we have to have a bill, but they just
don't realize how big it has to be,'' Ms. Pelosi said, dismissing a
one-week extension of unemployment benefits as ``worthless.''

The two administration officials and President Trump have previously
pushed for a narrow measure that would continue the unemployment
benefits and revive an expired federal moratorium on evictions. Some
Republicans have also panned the prospect of leaving other provisions
for later.

``There's certain aspects that I think have to be in there,'' said
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, before ticking off a number
of provisions, such as school funding, assistance for small businesses
and money for testing. ``This is what happens when you start going
through the bill; there's so many priorities that simply have to receive
funding in order for us to help minimize the impact of the virus.''

But many Republicans are wary of any additional spending to stabilize
the economy, saying the nearly \$3 trillion in cumulative relief
measures enacted in quick succession in the spring had swollen the
deficit.

Faced with significant pressure to prevent the expiration of the
unemployment insurance benefit, Republicans worked feverishly to
coalesce around a stopgap bill that could extend it, though most
proposals unveiled this week would slash the aid and present overwhelmed
state systems with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/unemployment-payments-change.html}{a
difficult switch} that experts say is likely to disadvantage lower-wage
workers.

One such proposal, which Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike
Braun of Indiana tried to push across the Senate floor on Thursday,
would have continued the extra jobless aid payments through the end of
the year, but slashed the payments to \$200 a week from \$600 or allow
the benefit to replace two-thirds of a worker's prior income.

Mr. Meadows said President Trump would support a flat, one-week
extension of the \$600 benefit in order to buy lawmakers time to
negotiate a longer agreement. But Democrats rejected an attempt by
Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, to win approval of such
an extension, with Mr. Schumer dismissing the effort as ``a stunt'' on
the Senate floor.

``This is disappointing and a political stunt and a game,'' Ms. McSally,
who is badly trailing her Democratic opponent in Arizona's Senate race,
shot back. ``It's the minority leader who is against this on his path to
try to become the majority leader, and that's unfortunate.''

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

Mr. Schumer, his flip phone ringing in his pocket, spent a portion of
his day on the Senate floor, swatting last-ditch attempts by Republicans
to push through short extensions of the jobless aid and to try to pin
the blame on Democrats for blocking them. He responded with a futile and
politically loaded tactic of his own: an attempt to win approval of the
\$3 trillion stimulus package House Democrats passed in May. Republicans
blocked that as well, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the
majority leader, deriding it as ``a totally unserious proposal.''

``The House speaker moves the goal posts while the Democratic leader
hides the football,'' said Mr. McConnell, accusing Democrats of blocking
discussions among rank-and-file lawmakers. ``They won't engage when the
administration tries to discuss our comprehensive plan. They won't
engage when the administration floats a narrower proposal. They
basically won't engage, period.''

Comparing negotiations with Republicans to ``trying to nail Jell-O to
the wall,'' Mr. Schumer noted that Mr. McConnell, whose conference
remained divided over another relief package, was notably absent from
the daily negotiations with administration officials in Ms. Pelosi's
Capitol Hill suite. The time crunch, he said, came because Republicans
had ``dithered for months'' and still had yet to reach agreement on the
\$1 trillion proposal they had put forward on Monday.

``Get in the room and negotiate a real deal,'' Mr. Schumer said. ``And
stop doing stunts that simply are political, get-it-off-my-back, that
you know cannot pass.''
