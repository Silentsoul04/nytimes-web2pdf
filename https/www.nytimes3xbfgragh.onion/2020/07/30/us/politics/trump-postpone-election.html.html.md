<div class="css-53u6y8">

President Trump, who is trailing badly in polling of the race for the
White House, [suggested on
Thursday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html)
that the Nov. 3 general election be delayed “until people can properly,
securely and safely vote.” Even for him, floating the idea of postponing
the election was an extraordinary breach of presidential decorum.

But the president does not have the authority to move the date of a
federal election. And Mr. Trump’s other claim on Thursday, that
widespread mail-in voting would make the election “inaccurate and
fraudulent,” is false.

Here are answers to some key questions about holding elections in a
crisis.

## Can the president cancel or postpone an election with an executive order?

No.

## Why not?

[Article
II](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C4-1/ALDE_00000230/)
of the Constitution [empowers
Congress](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46413) to
choose the timing of the general election. [An 1845 federal
law](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/28th-congress/session-2/c28s2ch1.pdf)
fixed the date as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

It would take a change in federal law to move that date. That would mean
legislation enacted by Congress, signed by the president and subject to
challenge in the courts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## How likely is it that the November election will be delayed?

Did we mention that the House of Representatives, which is controlled by
Democrats; the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans; and President
Trump would all have to approve such legislation?

To call that unlikely would be an understatement.

Even if all of that happened, there would not be much flexibility in
choosing an alternate election date: The Constitution mandates that the
new Congress must be sworn in on Jan. 3, and that the new president’s
term must begin on Jan. 20. Those dates cannot be changed just by the
passage of normal legislation.

Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer, on Thursday
knocked down the idea that Mr. Trump could move the election on his own.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Didn’t many states postpone their primary elections this year?

Yes: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, [sixteen states and two
territories](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html)
either pushed back their presidential primaries or extended deadlines
for voting by mail.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

States have broad autonomy to define the timing and procedures for
primary elections. The exact process for setting primary dates varies
from state to
state.

For example, in Louisiana, state law allows the governor to reschedule
an election because of an emergency, so long as the secretary of state
has certified that an emergency exists. In March, Gov. John Bel Edwards
and Secretary of State R. Kyle Ardoin did just that. (In fact, they
later postponed the primary election for a second time, buying more time
for the state to prepare to hold its vote amid the
pandemic.)

## Have federal officials considered moving a general election in the past?

It was reported in 2004 that some Bush administration officials had
discussed putting in place a method of postponing a federal election in
the event of a terrorist attack. But that idea fizzled quickly, and
Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser,
[said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/07/13/trail/trail/white-house-tries-to-calm-hubbub-over-vote-delay.html)
that the United States had held “elections in this country when we were
at war, even when we were in civil war. And we should have the elections
on time.”

## What about the procedures for voting in the November election?

While the date of the presidential election is set by federal law, the
procedures for voting are generally controlled at the state level.

That’s why the nation has such a complicated patchwork of voting
regulations, with some states allowing early and absentee voting; some
permitting voting by mail or same-day voter registration; others
requiring certain kinds of identification for voters; and many states
doing few or none of those things.

Democrats included $3.6 billion in their latest coronavirus aid package
to help states administer their elections safely during the pandemic.
Republicans did not include any such funding in the proposal they rolled
out this week.

Several states have tried to make it easier for voters to use mail-in
ballots this year, helping them to avoid going to polling places on
Election Day. [In
Michigan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-mail-in-voting-absentee-ballots.html),
for example, the secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, mailed absentee
ballot applications to all 7.7 million registered voters for the state’s
August primary election and the November general election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even before this year, five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and
Washington — regularly conducted their elections almost entirely by
mail.

Other states have struggled to manage a flood of absentee ballots. In
New York, where voters requested hundreds of thousands more absentee
ballots than in a typical election, [officials are still counting
votes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/nyregion/election-absentee-ballots-primary.html)
more than a month after Primary Day. Key races in the 12th and 15th
Congressional Districts are still unresolved.

That may offer a preview of [what could happen on election night in
November](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/politics/november-2020-election-day-results.html):
Unless one candidate wins in a landslide, there may be no clear and
immediate winner in the presidential race. But that does not mean that
the election would be fraudulent, only that it may take more time to
determine the
victor.

## Is Trump correct that voting by mail leads to voter fraud?

[No.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html)

Numerous studies have shown that [all forms of voting fraud are very
rare](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html)
in the United States. A panel that Mr. Trump established to investigate
election corruption was disbanded in 2018 after [it found no real
evidence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html)
of fraud.

Experts have said that voting by mail is less secure than voting in
person, but it is still extremely rare to see broad cases of voter
fraud.

In Washington, one of the states that votes almost entirely by mail, a
study conducted by the Republican secretary of state found that 142
potential cases of improper voting in the 2018 election were referred to
county sheriffs and prosecutors for legal action, out of more than 3.1
million ballots cast, which amounted to roughly 0.004 percent of the
electorate.

One of the most prominent recent cases of fraud came in North Carolina’s
Ninth Congressional District, where a political operative [was
charged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/30/us/mccrae-dowless-indictment.html)
with fraudulently collecting and submitting absentee ballots in an
effort to manipulate the election results in favor of the Republican
candidate. But such broad schemes are likely to be detected, as this one
was, experts say; the district held a do-over election.

And Mr. Trump himself voted by mail in the last election.
