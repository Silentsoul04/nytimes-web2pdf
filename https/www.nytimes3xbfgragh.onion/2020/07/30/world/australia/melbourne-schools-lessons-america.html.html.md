# What Can Victorian Schools Teach America About Reopening?

With around 100 schools closed because of students or teachers with
COVID-19, Australia has lessons for other countries aiming to reopen.

Every night, we wait for the email. Sometimes it comes in the late
afternoon, but many nights it doesn’t hit my inbox until 10 or 11 p.m.
Eventually, it arrives, written by a beleaguered school principal
letting us know that my son’s high school is still closed.

My family is in the same position as thousands of others in Victoria,
where around 100 schools are dealing with similar situations.

After months of remote learning, year 11 and 12 students in Melbourne
returned to the classroom on July 14. For my son, who is in 11th grade,
this in-person schooling lasted less than a week — on July 20 we were
informed that a student at his school had tested positive for
coronavirus and all in-person learning would be suspended while the
school was cleaned and contact tracing conducted.

As of today, July 31, the school is clean but the contact tracing
continues. There has never been a timeline given to parents or students
about how long that tracing will take. We wait day-to-day for updates on
whether school will resume the next day. The principal waits on the
Department of Health to let him know when contact tracing is complete,
and the overburdened Department of Health does — I assume — its best,
probably with some waiting of its own for coronavirus test results.

With debate in the United States raging about whether schools should
reopen after the annual summer break, there are some useful lessons in
the struggles of our schools in Victoria. An [opinion piece in the Times
this week asked, “what happens when there is a Covid-19 case in a
school?”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/opinion/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html?searchResultPosition=2)
Well, here in Melbourne, many schools are already answering that
question.

I spoke to Times education reporter Eliza Shapiro today just as she was
finishing up a news brief about the plans drawn up by New York City’s
school district — the largest in the U.S. — for reopening. It is one of
the only large districts in the country to be attempting in-person
learning any time soon, with most major districts opting for distance
learning for the foreseeable future.

Eliza’s reporting, along with Dana Goldstein, has [shown that most large
school districts are in danger of major community coronavirus spread if
they
reopen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html),
but New York is eager to move ahead and the plans Eliza described to me
are complex and ambitious, with specific standards for when schools will
close down and under what conditions.

“It’s really really complicated,” she told me. “We have so many
vulnerable kids, so many kids with disabilities, so many homeless kids,
so there’s a lot of interest in getting as many kids back in the
classroom as possible. But once we actually open — if we open — real
life is going to collide with these plans and it’s going to be really
difficult.”

What the Americans may not fully grasp is what we’ve already learned in
Victoria: Plans can disappear quickly when the unpredictability of the
virus comes into play. Each case or cluster becomes its own mystery,
demanding time and resources while raising anxiety to new levels.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To be clear: I place no blame on anyone for my son’s school situation.
It’s an overused word in these bizarre times, but the situation is
unprecedented and extremely complex. I applaud everyone involved for
trying to keep the community as safe as possible. But Victorian schools
are in a far better position than many American school systems by almost
every metric, and yet things here are messy and unpredictable and often
delayed for reasons that are unknown or not fully shared.

Just like our nightly ritual of learning on-the-fly what our situation
will be the following morning, the most disconcerting thing about this
virus is the extreme uncertainty and endurance that it demands. What
will tomorrow bring? Or the next day, month and year? I hope what we’re
going through can, at the very least, help inform and prepare other
parents, students and school districts what their own future may hold.
And for now, it’s mostly anticipation followed by disappointment.

What are your biggest concerns about schools reopening, in Australia or
elsewhere? Let us know at

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

**And Over to You …**

*Last week* [*we wrote about pandemic
reading*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/world/australia/divisions-decency-and-the-plague.html)*,
and asked what you were reading right now. Here are some reader
responses and suggestions:*

I am reading a novel that is not about pandemics, but, I think, nicely
captures the spirit of stay-at-home claustrophobia: “A Gentleman in
Moscow,” by Amor Towles.

**— Kurt van der Walde**

An illuminating biography, “Uncrowned Queen” by Nicola Tallis has really
helped me in the ongoing situation of staying safe indoors. It’s about
Tudor matriarch Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry V11, and her
extraordinary life.

**— Peter James**

During Covid quarantine I’ve discovered Australian female authors and
been enjoying books that focus on station life in outback rural areas.
Authors like Fleur McDonald I found brilliant at developing complex
characters, relationships and behaviors particular to Australian rural
areas. I quite enjoyed a number of books by Karly Lane, also based in
rural Australia. I can recommend exploring books by Anne Rennie, Di
Morrissey and Kate Grenville; all accomplished writers of Australian
fiction.

**— Wendy Williams**
