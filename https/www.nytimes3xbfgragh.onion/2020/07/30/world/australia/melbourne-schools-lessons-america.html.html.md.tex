Reopening?}\label{what-can-victorian-schools-teach-america-about-reopening}}

With around 100 schools closed because of students or teachers with
COVID-19, Australia has lessons for other countries aiming to reopen.

Every night, we wait for the email. Sometimes it comes in the late
afternoon, but many nights it doesn't hit my inbox until 10 or 11 p.m.
Eventually, it arrives, written by a beleaguered school principal
letting us know that my son's high school is still closed.

My family is in the same position as thousands of others in Victoria,
where around 100 schools are dealing with similar situations.

After months of remote learning, year 11 and 12 students in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/world/australia/coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown.html}{Melbourne}
returned to the classroom on July 14. For my son, who is in 11th grade,
this in-person schooling lasted less than a week --- on July 20 we were
informed that a student at his school had tested positive for
coronavirus and all in-person learning would be suspended while the
school was cleaned and contact tracing conducted.

As of today, July 31, the school is clean but the contact tracing
continues. There has never been a timeline given to parents or students
about how long that tracing will take. We wait day-to-day for updates on
whether school will resume the next day. The principal waits on the
Department of Health to let him know when contact tracing is complete,
and the overburdened Department of Health does --- I assume --- its
best, probably with some waiting of its own for coronavirus test
results.

With debate in the United States raging about whether schools should
reopen after the annual summer break, there are some useful lessons in
the struggles of our schools in Victoria. An
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/opinion/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html?searchResultPosition=2}{opinion
piece in the Times this week asked, ``what happens when there is a
Covid-19 case in a school?''} Well, here in Melbourne, many schools are
already answering that question.

I spoke to Times education reporter Eliza Shapiro today just as she was
finishing up a news brief about the plans drawn up by New York City's
school district --- the largest in the U.S. --- for reopening. It is one
of the only large districts in the country to be attempting in-person
learning any time soon, with most major districts opting for distance
learning for the foreseeable future.

Eliza's reporting, along with Dana Goldstein, has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html}{shown
that most large school districts are in danger of major community
coronavirus spread if they reopen}, but New York is eager to move ahead
and the plans Eliza described to me are complex and ambitious, with
specific standards for when schools will close down and under what
conditions.

``It's really really complicated,'' she told me. ``We have so many
vulnerable kids, so many kids with disabilities, so many homeless kids,
so there's a lot of interest in getting as many kids back in the
classroom as possible. But once we actually open --- if we open --- real
life is going to collide with these plans and it's going to be really
difficult.''

What the Americans may not fully grasp is what we've already learned in
Victoria: Plans can disappear quickly when the unpredictability of the
virus comes into play. Each case or cluster becomes its own mystery,
demanding time and resources while raising anxiety to new levels.

To be clear: I place no blame on anyone for my son's school situation.
It's an overused word in these bizarre times, but the situation is
unprecedented and extremely complex. I applaud everyone involved for
trying to keep the community as safe as possible. But Victorian schools
are in a far better position than many American school systems by almost
every metric, and yet things here are messy and unpredictable and often
delayed for reasons that are unknown or not fully shared.

Just like our nightly ritual of learning on-the-fly what our situation
will be the following morning, the most disconcerting thing about this
virus is the extreme uncertainty and endurance that it demands. What
will tomorrow bring? Or the next day, month and year? I hope what we're
going through can, at the very least, help inform and prepare other
parents, students and school districts what their own future may hold.
And for now, it's mostly anticipation followed by disappointment.

elsewhere? Let us know at

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second
    bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a
    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to

I am reading a novel that is not about pandemics, but, I think, nicely
captures the spirit of stay-at-home claustrophobia: ``A Gentleman in
Moscow,'' by Amor Towles.

\textbf{--- Kurt van der Walde}

An illuminating biography, ``Uncrowned Queen'' by Nicola Tallis has
really helped me in the ongoing situation of staying safe indoors. It's
about Tudor matriarch Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry V11, and
her extraordinary life.

\textbf{--- Peter James}

During Covid quarantine I've discovered Australian female authors and
been enjoying books that focus on station life in outback rural areas.
Authors like Fleur McDonald I found brilliant at developing complex
characters, relationships and behaviors particular to Australian rural
areas. I quite enjoyed a number of books by Karly Lane, also based in
rural Australia. I can recommend exploring books by Anne Rennie, Di
Morrissey and Kate Grenville; all accomplished writers of Australian
fiction.
