## Billie Eilish, ‘My Future’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1u3pw94">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m in love but not with anybody else/Just want to get to know myself,”
Billie Eilish sings on “My Future,” her first self-isolation-era single
— everyone’s quarantine awakening should be so wise. Eilish’s ode to
loving oneself is both textured and uncomplicated. For a full minute and
a half, she leans into her crooner side, singing deep exhales with heavy
flutter. The ambience echoes the astral, roomy R\&B of the Internet and
Steve Lacy, and even when the song kicks into something slightly more
zippy, Eilish’s ease is the dominant mode — worrying about yourself
first makes for no worry at all. JON

## Snakehips and Jess Glynne featuring A Boogie Wit da Hoodie and Davido, ‘Lie for You’

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

British dance music producers working with a British singer, an American
sing-rapper and a Nigerian Afrobeats star — in theory, collaborations
like these are a streaming-era blessing. Music like this accelerates
cross-genre, cross-border conversations, and helps export local sounds
globally. In reality, though, what begin as regional particularities —
unique sonic identifiers and sales pitches — end up smeared together so
intensely here that the implicit argument ends up being that these
styles were all the same to begin with. CARAMANICA

## Subculture featuring Rachel Chinouriri, ‘The River Bend’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rachel Chinouriri’s voice goes slinking through a jazzy minefield in
“River Bend,” a 2019 song from the British producer Subculture about
urban paranoia that was just rereleased with a video. The bass line
repeats and then multiplies, leaping around the low register as other
instruments and sounds materialize and vanish with equal suddenness:
cowbell, slide guitar, wordless voices, trumpet. She’s surrounded by
phantom threats, with nothing to count on. JON PARELES

## Laura Veirs, ‘Burn Too Bright’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Burn Too Bright” is an up-tempo elegy for [Richard
Swift](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/why-richard-swift-was-an-indie-rock-treasure/),
a prolific Pacific Northwest songwriter, producer and backup musician
who was 41 when he died of hepatitis in 2018 after a long alcohol
addiction. “Who were you running from?/It was yourself all right,” Veirs
sings amid crosscurrents of strings, electric guitars and a
teakettle-whistle synthesizer, sympathetic but also curious about how
well-loved musicianship was not enough. PARELES

## Mina Tindle featuring Sufjan Stevens, ‘Give a Little Love’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sufjan Stevens wrote, produced, arranged and sang wispy backup vocals
for “Give a Little Love” by Mina Tindle, a.k.a. the Parisian singer and
songwriter Pauline De Lassus, who has also sung backup for the National.
It’s from the watercolor zone of Stevens’s catalog, made even more
diaphanous by De Lassus’s guileless voice. In the first half of the
song, she realizes “I’m all alone” in music with a subliminally unstable
seven-beat meter. In the second, she quietly calls for what she needs —
“Give a little bit of your heart” — as the music settles into 4/4 and
she and Stevens overdub themselves into a supportive choir. PARELES

## Randy Travis, ‘Fool’s Love Affair’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Randy Travis was always a master of stoic, moral songs, even the ones
about misbehavior. So it is with “Fool’s Love Affair,” his first new
song in years. Based on a demo Travis recorded in the early 1980s — way
before his 2013 stroke, which has left him with aphasia — it’s a
reassuringly sturdy jolt of traditionalism. His grip on regret is firm,
so tight he makes it sound like decency. CARAMANICA

## Bill Frisell, ‘Valentine’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The guitarist Bill Frisell tends to build his improvisations around warm
harmonic intervals and circular gestures — not exactly the jagged
dissonances and sharp jabs of Thelonious Monk. But Monk’s influence is
subtly written into a lot of Frisell’s music, and it comes to the
surface on “Valentine,” a 12-bar blues the guitarist wrote with a
Monkish, asymmetrical wobble. In Monk’s band, the other musicians
usually held fast to a swinging foundation while he dashed off
idiosyncrasies. But the members of Frisell’s trio, the drummer Rudy
Royston and the bassist Thomas Morgan, take a loosened approach,
scattering and scrambling around the melody. “Valentine” is the title
track from this trio’s first album together, due out on Blue Note on
Aug. 14. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## A.G. Cook, ‘7G (7 Minute Mix)’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A.G. Cook, the metapop-loving, ultra-shiny electronics auteur who
founded PC Music, plans to release a seven-disc, 49-track collection in
August with each disc devoted to an instrument or concept — i.e., drums,
piano, “extreme vocals” — called “7G.” This is a seven-minute preview
with snippets of a track from each disc — mostly brittle and artificial,
occasionally abrasive or perky. For some people, it’ll be a promising
teaser; for others, it might be all they need. PARELES

## Charles Tolliver, ‘Emperor March’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The trumpeter Charles Tolliver’s compositions tend to balance syncopated
elements as if they were structural beams. The drums, the piano and
bass, the horns: Each scribbles out its own pattern, contrasting with
the others and occasionally uniting. “Connect,” Tolliver’s first album
in over a decade, stands out in large part based on the quality of his
compositions. The caliber of his company helps too: Across the LP’s four
long tracks, Tolliver is joined by the immortal Buster Williams on bass
and Lenny White on drums, among others. Soloing on “Emperor March,”
Tolliver, 78, steers neatly through the song’s multipart form, starting
out sounding pebbly and piecemeal, ending up spinning triumphant blues
variations. RUSSONELLO
