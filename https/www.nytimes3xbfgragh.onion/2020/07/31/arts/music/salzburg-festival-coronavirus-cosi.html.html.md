SALZBURG, Austria — A poster advertising this year’s Salzburg Festival
bears a quotation from one of the festival’s founders, the poet and
dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal: “Wo der Wille erwacht, dort ist schon
fast etwas erreicht.”

Roughly translated: “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.”

Plenty of will — along with political and financial resources few other
classical music organizations could possibly deploy — is evident here
this summer. For its 100th anniversary season, Salzburg, bucking the
coronavirus-prompted trend of canceling cultural events or presenting
them only with onstage social distancing, is going ahead with
performances featuring casts interacting closely and full orchestras in
the pit.

Which is not to say the festival has been unaffected by the pandemic. A
sprawling, 44-day anniversary program has been mostly postponed until
next year. It has been replaced with a reduced, 30-day schedule, through
Aug. 30, of concerts, plays and two (instead of seven) staged operas:
Strauss’s “Elektra” and a production of Mozart’s “Così Fan Tutte” that
was planned over the past few months, almost unheard-of short notice for
opera on this level.

While the 90 performances will take place in a country and region where
infections have ebbed and audiences of up to 1,000 — about half the
capacity of Salzburg’s main theater — have been permitted, the threat
remains present. On July 27, [health officials
announced](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-austria/austrian-resort-town-st-wolfgang-grapples-with-coronavirus-outbreak-idUKKCN24S13J)
an outbreak of the virus in St. Wolfgang, a lakeside resort town about
20 miles from Salzburg.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Markus Hinterhäuser, the festival’s artistic director, said in an
interview that he felt the “sword of Damocles” hanging over the artists
and staff. But in Austria, he added, “we have measures for cultural
institutions — which are 200 percent necessary — that respect the health
of the people working and the audience.”

The otolaryngologist (and trained baritone) Joseph Schlömicher-Thier
helped form the festival’s coronavirus plan, which he described in an
interview as “Fortress Festspielhaus,” a reference to the festival’s
main theater. It puts in place stricter measures than the Austrian
government has mandated.

The festival’s theaters will each be capped at about half their
capacities; audiences will sit in a staggered, chessboard-like formation
and will be asked to wear masks as they enter and leave, but can remove
them during performances. Intermissions will be eliminated, and
attendees will provide their contact information with the purchase of
each nontransferable ticket, so that they can be informed if it turns
out they attended a performance with an infected person.

Artists and staff have been divided into three groups, depending on
their ability to socially distance. Singers, orchestra musicians and
others who need to interact with one another closely are in the “red”
group and are tested weekly, whether they have symptoms or not.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Other workers are divided into “orange” (those, like hair and makeup
artists and festival executives, who must closely interact with the red
group but can otherwise socially distance and wear masks) and “yellow”
(those who can always socially distance and wear masks). Red and orange
employees must keep logs of their health and contacts. Visitors —
including journalists — must provide evidence of a recent negative test
before having even distanced contact with members of the red
group.

The festival has contracted with a private laboratory so that it can
test large numbers of people quickly. For example, the singers,
choristers and orchestra players for “Elektra,” a company of around 200,
can all be tested at the same time and get results within a few hours.

“Fortress Festspielhaus” depends both on Austria’s generally strong
public health system and on the festival’s deep pockets and connections.
The festival’s president, Helga Rabl-Stadler, served as a prominent
member of parliament for Austria’s conservative People’s Party, now in
power, before joining Salzburg in 1995. (She originally planned to
retire after this summer, but has committed to stay on for an extra year
to see through the postponed centennial celebrations.)

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Helga here has been fantastic,” said Franz Welser-Möst, who is
conducting “Elektra.” “You have to be proactive.”

And Austria may be among the only countries where classical music is a
powerful lobby. Daniel Froschauer, a member of the board of directors of
the Vienna Philharmonic and one of its violinists, described in an
interview calling the country’s prime minister directly several times
during the lockdown to plan the orchestra’s return to public
performance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He said he’d put it on his priority list,” Mr. Froschauer said. “On
top.”

The Philharmonic, the festival’s traditional house band, will play in
the pit for the two operas and in a series of concerts. Its members have
been tested regularly since returning to public performances for small
audiences in Vienna in early June.

“Of course, if there are clusters in Salzburg, the whole thing will be
canceled,” Mr. Froschauer said. “The highest value we have is our
health, and we don’t want to risk that.”

Although Austria had a strict lockdown from mid-March to mid-April,
Salzburg’s narrow streets — and its shops, cafes and restaurants — are
now bustling with maskless patrons. But inside the festival’s
facilities, said Dr. Schlömicher-Thier, “our employees are acting as
though it’s still March.”

“My fear is that there could be a problem with the people outside —
tourists,” he added. “I tell everyone to be careful where they go.”

While one festival employee tested positive earlier this month, the
administration argues that the episode reveals the strength of the
system it has put in place. “That girl was in a faraway office and had
no contact with any artists,” said Ms. Rabl-Stadler, referring to the
infected employee, who is currently self-isolating with mild symptoms.
Ms. Rabl-Stadler added that all of the employee’s contacts were tested
within hours and were found not to have the virus. The festival said it
would inform the press and public about every confirmed infection of an
employee, artist or ticket holder.

This ambitious plan comes with a substantial price, and just as
Salzburg’s potential revenue has been slashed. The festival is giving
back 24.5 million euros (roughly $28.2 million) it had sold in tickets
to its original program, and has only 7.5 million euros’ worth of new
tickets to sell. While Ms. Rabl-Stadler said that sponsors and donors
had been generous this year, it would be nearly impossible to have
another festival under the same conditions.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Every concert is a deficit,” she said. “For opera, you can’t even
talk.”

If coronavirus-related cancellations have been a headache for the opera
world’s administrators, they have dealt a devastating financial and
psychological blow to artists. The cast, director and conductor of “Così
Fan Tutte,” which is being presented in a one-act version of just over
two hours, are aware of their privileged position at a time when few can
perform.

“It’s huge luck,” the soprano Elsa Dreisig said in an interview. Ms.
Dreisig, who will be singing the role of Fiordiligi for the first time,
had her scheduled debut in the part canceled at the Berlin State Opera
in March. Now, she said, “I feel like I am part of the resistance.”

The mezzo-soprano Marianne Crebassa takes on the role of Dorabella after
two of her scheduled “Così” productions were canceled — including in
Berlin, where she was going to appear opposite Ms.
Dreisig.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“I know I am taking a risk by being onstage with people,” Ms. Crebassa
said. “But I really believe it’s important for everyone to start finding
solutions. It is nice to watch streaming concerts, but after a while I
got a bit depressed. This is not what we are supposed to do.”

And streaming, she pointed out, doesn’t pay the bills. Free streams, she
said, were “a beautiful gesture and a gift for the audience, but I don’t
believe it can last. I am in a privileged position, but if I accept
being paid less because of the virus, or free streaming, what does that
do for all artists?”

For Joana Mallwitz, a rising conductor who is music director of the
opera house in Nuremberg, rehearsing Mozart was a welcome change from
months of coronavirus contingency planning.

“Here, at the moment,” she said, “the joy outweighs everything else.”

Not that bitter “Così” is always a joyful story. Fiordiligi and
Dorabella are sisters whose boyfriends pretend to go off to war;
instead, they return in disguise to try and seduce each other’s girl.
The women are on the verge of marrying the “wrong” men before the game
is revealed.

Christof Loy, who has directed often at Salzburg and was originally
scheduled for “Boris Godunov” this summer, said “Così” is closer to him
than almost any other opera. Pointing to the subtitle — “The School for
Lovers” — he said in an interview that “there is a very long history of
misunderstanding this piece.” Many artists in the 19th and 20th
centuries, he added, “treated it like a stupid comedy. It did not give
justice to the deep humanity of the piece; it portrayed the women as too
stupid and too
cheap.”

Mr. Loy translates the characters’ thoughts and backgrounds into their
distance from one another onstage. “The piece is about how distant you
are,” he said. “Very far or very close. Not so much in between.” As is
typical of his often visually minimalist work, the production takes
place on a simple white set — though one that can open to offer a single
view of a midsummer evening — and in contemporary dress.

Mr. Loy and Ms. Mallwitz began their collaboration in June with a series
of long phone calls. A new production at Salzburg would normally emerge
from years of planning in which conductor and director could discuss
their conceptions of the work. But the breakneck planning of this
staging — not to mention the cuts to the score — has not stinted depth:
While Fiordiligi is often presented as a prudish caricature, Ms. Dreisig
said that Mr. Loy and Ms. Mallwitz were committed to presenting every
character in his or her full humanity.

“It’s a comedy,” Ms. Dreisig said, “but everything has to be done with
an ethic of respecting the character you are singing, and respecting the
music. It’s a true collaboration.”

One recent evening, at the first rehearsal of the work’s finale, Ms.
Mallwitz led the cast through the score. Then the music stands were put
away, and Mr. Loy began to walk the performers through the staging. They
stopped and started as they discussed back stories and psychological
motivations. Except for the masks being worn by dramaturgs and
assistants, the pandemic seemed to have receded from the room.

The lovers circled each other uneasily, singing, “Repeat the joyful
music, renew the lovely song, and we will sit here in the greatest joy.”
Mr. Hinterhäuser, watching from the side of the room, looked, above his
mask, as though he might cry.

“It’s maybe the fastest-ever-realized opera production in the world,” he
had said the previous day. “Vital, fresh, unexpected. At the end, with
all the risks and all the thin ice that we are on, it is important to
make this try.”
