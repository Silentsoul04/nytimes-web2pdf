\textbf{BLACK IS KING} (2020) **** \emph{Stream on}
\href{https://www.disneyplus.com/home}{\emph{Disney+}}\emph{.} This time
last year, Beyoncé released
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/24/arts/music/beyonce-the-lion-king-the-gift-review.html}{``The
Lion King: The Gift,''} a companion album to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/11/movies/the-lion-king-review.html}{Disney's
high-tech remake of ``The Lion King''} that brought together an
international roster of artists including Pharrell Williams, the South
African musician Moonchild Sanelly, Jay-Z, the Nigerian
singer-songwriter Tiwa Savage and the Cameroonian songwriter Salatiel.
Artists from that album appear alongside stars like Naomi Campbell and
Lupita Nyong'o in this new visual album based on ``The Gift'' --- a rare
film based on an album that was itself based on a film.

The filmmaker Annie Silverstein casts her gaze on a physically and
emotionally scarred rodeo rider and his young unlikely protégé in this
slow-burn drama. They don't start out as friends: Kris (Amber Havard), a
teenager with an incarcerated mother and a sick grandmother, breaks into
the home of a worn rodeo wrangler, Abe (Rob Morgan), and uses the house
to party with her friends. Abe calls the police when he gets home. But
rather than having Kris sent to juvenile detention, Abe agrees to have
her work for him to offset the offense. The story of the bond that grows
between them touches on issues of racism, poverty and addiction. The
film ``handles hot-button issues with a cool eye and a calming tone''
Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/movies/bull-review.html}{her
review for The New York Times}. ``There's a matter-of-fact quality to
the filmmaking,'' she added, ``a rejection of melodrama and embrace of
naturalism that slows the movie's pulse and softens its edges.''

The superheroes of this comic book adaptation --- a group of foster
siblings with supernatural abilities --- spent the show's first season
trying to stop an apocalypse. They're plucked from the present day and
dropped into the early 1960s in the second season, which begins with a
bout of time travel and again tasks them with saving the world.

\textbf{LITTLE WOMEN} (2019) \emph{8 p.m. on Starz.} ``I always knew who
the Marches were,'' the actress and filmmaker Greta Gerwig
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/23/movies/little-women-review.html}{told
The New York Times last year}. ``It got absorbed into the fabric of who
I was.'' She was referring to the family at the heart of Louisa May
Alcott's novel ``Little Women.'' Gerwig got a chance to create her own
spin on the classic story in this film adaptation, the latest take on
the Civil War-era tale of the four March sisters --- Jo (Saoirse Ronan),
Meg (Emma Watson), Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and Amy (Florence Pugh) ---
coming of age in Massachusetts. Gerwig scrambles the timeline of
Alcott's plot, locking the old story to a fresh rhythm. But the movie
stays ``faithful enough to satisfy the book's passionate devotees,''
A.O. Scott wrote in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/23/movies/little-women-review.html}{his
review for The Times}. ``It's as if the book has been carefully cut
apart and reassembled,'' he added, ``its signatures sewn back together
in an order that produces sparks of surprise and occasional bouts of
pleasurable dizziness.''
