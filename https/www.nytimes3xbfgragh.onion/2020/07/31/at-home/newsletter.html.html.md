Welcome. We started [At
Home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/spotlight/at-home) to help
readers lead a full and cultured life during the pandemic, featuring
great reads and helpful advice alongside recommendations for things to
do and watch and listen to and see.

Four months into the experiment, we see a hunger, as well, for
direction. One reader wrote recently to ask if we might suggest to her,
forcefully, that she clean her oven, her washing machine. She wanted,
she wrote, “something along the lines of ‘At Home: This Week Clean
*This.*’”

It’s too hot for oven cleaning, though, in most parts of the country,
and not everyone has a washing machine. (If you do, just run it with no
clothes at its hottest water setting, with bleach. Easy win.)

No, this weekend, you should clean your *stove*. Take the grates off if
your stove has grates, and get them soaking in warm, soapy water. Make a
paste out of baking soda and water to scrub the stovetop — don’t use
anything abrasive. Get all the gunge off everything with elbow grease
and time. Wipe down the front of the stove with all-purpose cleaner.
Clean up the grates and dry them. Put everything back together. The
gleaming result is its own satisfaction.

  - If you’re looking for an adventure this weekend, [you may be
    considering
    Randonautica](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/style/randonautica-app.html),
    an app that generates coordinates and sends users off exploring.
    Before you try it, you may want to dive into its history, its
    success and its potential drawbacks. If you want something with a
    more reliable payoff, our culture reporters put together a list of
    [seven things to do this
    weekend](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/arts/things-to-do-weekend-coronavirus.html),
    including an audio tour of Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

  - Our [latest
    playlist](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/arts/music/playlist-billie-eilish-snakehips-a-boogie.html)
    has a new track from Billie Eilish, among others. Jon Caramanica
    says of Eilish, “For a full minute and a half, she leans into her
    crooner side, singing deep exhales with heavy flutter.” To go even
    deeper into the music, check out our latest “Diary of a Song,” in
    which [Phoebe Bridgers opens
    up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/arts/music/phoebe-bridgers-kyoto.html)
    about what it was like to write a song outside of her comfort zone.

  - And in 2020, [Karen is no longer an “easy
    name.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/style/karen-name-meme-history.html)
    We explored the history of the name and how it has evolved in pop
    culture.

  - In “Palm Springs,” Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti (above) have a
    memorable meet-cute. For our [“Anatomy of a
    Scene](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/movies/palm-springs-clip-hulu.html)”
    series, the film’s director, Max Barbakow, narrates the scene and
    explains how it came together.

  - As always, our television critic Margaret Lyons has her eye on the
    clock. If you have 30 minutes this weekend, and you’re feeling
    hopeful, she wants you to give [“Muppets
    Now”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/arts/television/muppets-disney-errol-morris-first-person.html)
    a try, if only for the chance that the series could improve in the
    future. In the “already good” category of shows, Mike Hale has [five
    series from Britain that you can
    try](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/arts/television/in-my-skin-hulu.html),
    including the brilliant “In My Skin.”

  - The Go-Go’s went from punk to pop to split. [A new
    documentary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/arts/music/the-go-gos-documentary.html)
    delves into the process that led to each change, and looks at the
    group’s importance. As Kathleen Hanna, the legendary singer of
    Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, said of attending a Go-Gos show in 1982:

> *As a young girl going into a space where women owned the stage, and
> owned it unapologetically like they were born to be there — to me, it
> represented a moment of
possibility.*
