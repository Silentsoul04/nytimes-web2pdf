# Their Very Own Loving Story

Renee Knake and Wallace B. Jefferson, both lawyers, are grateful to
Mildred Loving and Richard Loving for challenging interracial marriage

Before Renee Newman Knake and Wallace B. Jefferson, both lawyers, became
romantically involved, they met at various work events. The first time
was when Mr. Jefferson delivered a commencement address in 2011 at
Michigan State University College of Law, where Ms. Knake was then a law
professor, though it wasn’t until years later that she was reminded of
that encounter.

The two also worked as volunteers for the American Bar Association, from
2014 to 2016. Ms. Knake, now 46, served as a reporter to the group’s
Commission on the Future of Legal Services. Mr. Jefferson, who is 57 and
has served as chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, was a
commissioner. They spoke on conference calls and attended meetings,
maintaining a platonic and professional connection. But during a dinner
toward the end of the commission’s work, their relationship seemed to
change.

“Something just clicked and all of a sudden this person that I had been
aware of professionally — it was suddenly like, wow,” said Ms. Knake,
who divorced in 2013. “I remember having a conversation with him at one
point and then thinking, ‘I don’t want this conversation to end.’”

In the fall of 2016, Ms. Knake took a job as a law professor at the
University of Houston, about two and a half hours from Austin, Texas,
where Mr. Jefferson was living. The two continued to stay in contact and
met again when Ms. Knake invited Mr. Jefferson to attend her first
public lecture at the university in 2017. She was presenting research
that eventually would be turned into a book published this year,
“Shortlisted: Women in the Shadows of the Supreme Court.”

“He came and sat in the front row of this lecture hall that was filled
with students,” Ms. Knake said. “My parents traveled in and my kids were
there. It was this wonderful alignment of my professional world, and my
family, and this man who I was starting to fall in love with.”

Because the couple resided and worked in different cities, long distance
and commuting became undeniable choices. But both Mr. Jefferson and Ms.
Knake were willing to make it work.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Between traveling together to conferences and visits when Ms.
Knake wasn’t teaching, the couple saw the long distance as an exciting
part of their union, rather than an issue.

In 2019, they solidified plans to live together for the first time. Ms.
Knake accepted a Fulbright scholar position at the Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. Her two children,
James, 15, and Grace, 12, along with Mr. Jefferson joined her for the
six-month stay. Before making the move, Mr. Jefferson proposed on Jan.
1, 2019 in front of her children on a FaceTime call.

“And that was just really a magical time to sort of solidify this new
dimension to our love and our family,” Ms. Knake said. “The kids were
going to Australian schools, they didn’t know anybody. We had to really
rely on each other. And looking back, it was really great preparation
for the four of us being in quarantine together since early March.”

“Blending families sometimes can be a real challenge,” she continued.
“And for us, it has gone so smoothly in part, because of how this
transition evolved over the past couple of years. Being out of the
country together helped us prepare for being quarantined in a very small
condo in Austin and in East Lansing for the past few months.”

Quarantine has involved adopting a puppy, working from home, online
school, and of course, wedding planning. It’s also erupted some very
important and in-depth conversations about race. As a social justice
movement unfolds in America, Ms. Knake admits there is a lot to learn
about her partner’s experience.

“I am learning every single day alongside him, more and more about what
it means to be a Black man in the United States,” she said. “My eyes
were open to this continually before it was really in the headlines, as
it should be deservedly, but being in a relationship with him makes me
more aware.”

Coincidentally, Mr. Jefferson and Ms. Knake, who both had not dated
outside their race before, share birthdays with Mildred Loving and
Richard Loving. In 1967, the Lovings effectively challenged interracial
marriage laws in the United States forever, resulting in the
legalization of interracial marriage. It is because of their legacy that
Mr. Jefferson and Ms. Knake walked down the aisle on July 4 to legally
recognize their
union.

“When we saw their birthdays, we were like, ‘wow,’ it made us feel even
more connected to them,” Ms. Knake said. “Because of that coincidence we
can retell our part of their story in a way that will help people
remember that it wasn’t that long ago in this country that just loving
someone that wasn’t the same race as you could not be made legitimate
through marriage.”

“I can’t imagine what it would be like to be so profoundly and deeply in
love as I am with this man and to have to feel like I was committing a
crime,” Ms. Knake added.

The couple paid homage to the Lovings during their ceremony by sharing
statements dedicated to their fight for interracial marriage, read by
Samuel Jefferson, one of Mr. Jefferson’s three sons.

Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, officiated on the porch of the
governor’s summer residence on Mackinac Island.

Ms. Whitmer is a friend to both Ms. Knake and Mr. Jefferson. When Ms.
Knake first moved to Michigan in 2005, Ms. Whitmer lived across the
street from her. As for Mr. Jefferson, he and the governor are Michigan
State alumni and quickly bonded after meeting through Ms. Knake.

total happiness and joy,” Ms. Knake

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The couple were joined by three of their children, four family friends,
as well as Dr. Marc Mallory, the governor’s husband. Nearly 150 other
guests streamed the ceremony via Zoom. Originally, the wedding was going
to take place inside the same residence on July 4, but coronavirus
precautions pushed the occasion online for guests.

In proper wedding-planning fashion, a rehearsal was held the evening
before. The outdoor lighting, Wi-Fi connection and video camera were all
tested. The celebration was organized by Wedfuly, a virtual wedding
company that partners with Zoom to host online celebrations.

As attendees entered the video conference, “America the Beautiful,” by
Ray Charles, “A Sunday Kind of Love,” by Etta James, and a handful of
other songs chosen by the bride and groom played in the background. A
slide show of photos featuring the couple and their family hovered over
the main screen. Grace Knake, Ms. Knake’s daughter, shared an
Acknowledgment of Country, which pays respect to the traditional
landowners. This was followed by James Knake, Ms. Knake’s son, reading
the poem “Believer’s Hymn for the Republic.”

At about 4:30 p.m., the ceremony took place and was followed by an
intermission, allowing guests to grab a drink for the toast. Seated in
front of a laptop, Mr. Jefferson and Ms. Knake cut the cake and received
seven toasts by friends and family. After, the couple popped into
individual chat rooms to speak with guests by group. Ms. Knake described
the event as far more moving and magical than expected. “It was probably
the only time I ever enjoyed a Zoom call,” she said.

The reception dinner was held outdoors on the patio of the Carriage
House at Iroquois Hotel. Their original plans for a larger reception
were postponed to 2021, including a boat cruise party on Mackinac Island
and a rooftop gathering for family and close friends in Austin.
Additionally, honeymoon festivities have been pushed to “further
notice.” The couple still plans to vacation in southern France once
travel bans are lifted between Europe and American visitors.

“I tell people coronavirus could have canceled pretty much everything in
my life, but it has not canceled my commitment to Wallace,” Ms. Knake
said.

**Where** The outdoor porch of the Michigan governor’s summer residence,
Mackinac Island, Mich.

**Bands, Dresses, and Masks** The couple wore matching platinum bands
from Canturi that were picked while living abroad in Melbourne,

socially distanced, sunset yoga class in East Lansing, the Sunday before
the wedding. Six feet apart and outdoors, the gathering created a safe
and relaxing start to a busy wedding week.
