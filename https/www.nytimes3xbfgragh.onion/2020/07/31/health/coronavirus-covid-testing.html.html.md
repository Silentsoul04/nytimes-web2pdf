# Covid-19 Tests Are in Short Supply. Should You Still Get One?

First, health officials said [you should not get
tested](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/21/coronavirus-testing-strategyshift/)
for the coronavirus unless you had symptoms. Then the message shifted:
[Mass testing was
essential](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-pooled-testing.html)
to trace and contain the pandemic.

Now there is more confusion as [public health officials
warn](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-testing-supply-shortage.html)
of shortages of testing supplies, soaring demand and long wait times for
results, which have [thwarted contact-tracing efforts in places with
heavy
outbreaks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html).
At the same time, politicians in states where cases had fallen have
urged people to get tested, whether they have symptoms or not.

“Go get a test,”[Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said this
month](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-photos-audio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-announces-phase-three-indoor-dining-postponed#).
“It doesn’t cost you anything. It doesn’t hurt.”

And in New Jersey, [Gov. Philip D. Murphy said
during](https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200623b.shtml)
a recent briefing[on the
coronavirus](https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200623b.shtml):
“Getting tested gives you peace of mind that you are not unknowingly
carrying this virus and can spread it among your family and friends. We
just need you to go out and get tested.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What is a conscientious person who already wears a mask and maintains
social distance to do?

## Is there a moral obligation to get a test?

Yes, said [R. Alta Charo](https://law.wisc.edu/profiles/racharo), a
professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

“One of the most important things to keep in mind when discussing public
health is the fact that this is fundamentally a community issue, not
merely an individual health concern,” she said. “We are all in this
together. What I do affects everyone around me, and what they do affects
me.”

If public health experts want people to be tested, they should comply,
especially if the goal is to gather critical information about how many
people are infected at a given point, Professor Charo said.

Epidemiologists can use the data to determine how fast the virus is
spreading and which measures are working, she said.

Taking a test, like wearing a mask, shows “a desire to be a part of the

More testing will help identify these hidden cases, Dr. Rondello said.

But [Candace L.
Upton](https://www.du.edu/ahss/philosophy/faculty_staff/upton_candace.html),
a professor of philosophy at the University of Denver, said people
should not feel duty bound to get a test. It can even be argued that it
is morally wrong to go in for a test if you have no symptoms and are not
at a high risk, she said.

“Until there is no longer a shortage of test kits, it is morally
unjustified to test patients for Covid-19 solely for the purpose of
collecting data,” Professor Upton said. “Because of the deficit, labs
shouldn’t be offering them to people who are just curious.”

The priority should remain testing only those with symptoms or
compromised immune systems, and essential workers and older people, she
said.

Professor Upton added that testing should be done selectively even in
locations where tests are readily available and where results can be
delivered quickly.

“The whole system is unfair,” she said. “And so to take advantage of
surpluses in certain places in the market is to add to the injustice to
people who didn’t have availability in the first place.”

## ‘I don’t want to be the person to bring Covid here.’

The national failure to coordinate testing efforts shouldn’t cause
people with no symptoms to feel conflicted about being tested for the
coronavirus, said Dr. [Andrew
Diamond](https://www.onemedical.com/providers/andrew-diamond/), chief
medical officer at One Medical in San Francisco, a membership-based
primary care practice with offices around the country.

“If there is a way for you to get tested that does not clearly and
directly impair someone who is a priority, then you should get tested
for sure,” he said.

Molly Wallace, 24, who grew up on Martha’s Vineyard, was tested after
she moved back to the island from Boston in March.

She was furloughed from her job as a medical assistant and began
volunteering at a testing site, Test MV, at Martha’s Vineyard Regional
High School, where she went to
school.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Ms. Wallace said that she had never had coronavirus symptoms but that
she had still felt obligated to be tested. “I don’t want to be the
person to bring Covid here,” she said.

All residents and visitors to the island are encouraged to be tested at
Test MV, where volunteers distribute free kits of self-administered
nasal swabs, said Ms. Wallace, who is now the site’s outreach
coordinator.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

During her interview last week, Ms. Wallace said that people typically
got their results within 72 hours, or more quickly if they test positive
for the virus. At the time, Martha’s Vineyard stood in stark contrast to
states like New York and Arizona, where lines for tests have sometimes
[stretched around
blocks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-test-shortage.html)
and [the turnaround
time](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/07/06/slow-covid-19-test-results-have-cascade-effect-public-health/5386582002/)
for results has been days, if not weeks.

On Friday, she said the turnaround time for tests was now around seven
days, because of the shortage.

## Don’t feel guilty if you don’t want to get a test.

Wearing a mask should feel obligatory, Dr. Diamond said, but taking a
test should not.

If tests were widely available and turnaround times for results were
much faster, people would have a stronger sense of obligation to get
tested, he said.

“Under the current circumstance, I would say it’s much more important to
