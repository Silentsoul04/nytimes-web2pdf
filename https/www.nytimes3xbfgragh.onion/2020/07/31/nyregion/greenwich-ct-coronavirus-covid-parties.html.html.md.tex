Cases}\label{in-ultra-wealthy-greenwich-teen-parties-lead-to-jump-in-virus-cases}}

Many of those exposed were seniors who had just finished their final
year at two elite private schools.

On a warm summer weekday in the middle of July in Greenwich, Conn., one
of the wealthiest communities in the country, a group of teenagers
gathered at a house party. Many were seniors who had just finished their
final year at two elite private college-preparatory schools, Greenwich
Academy and the Brunswick School, as well as the local public high
school, Greenwich High School, according to accounts from students and
school officials.

They had endured weeks of lockdown, had time on their hands and now
Connecticut was among the few states in the country where the
coronavirus appeared to be under control. As the weekend approached,
some of the teenagers would attend more get-togethers, according to the
accounts.

But amid the festivities, the virus was quietly spreading.

Two weeks after the parties, Greenwich is experiencing what health
officials called a ``mini surge'' of infections, an outbreak that has
cascaded through the community and underscored how social gatherings
among young people are posing fresh challenges to containing the virus.

More than 20 people between the ages of 16 and 21 have tested positive
for the virus, with more cases expected as testing continues, according
to Greenwich health officials.

``I think it has been a wake up call for a lot of people,'' said Tom
Philip, the head of the Brunswick School.

Some members of the Greenwich High School football team were placed in
quarantine after a player tested positive, school officials said. About
a dozen students did not attend a socially distanced Brunswick School
commencement ceremony on Saturday after acknowledging that they had been
exposed to someone who had tested positive.

A pool at a country club in Greenwich said on Wednesday that it would
shut down for at least two days after a swim coach came into contact
with someone who had tested positive.

While the parties that are believed to have seeded the outbreak have
been widely discussed among students, parents and others in Greenwich,
the conversation on social media has taken place largely on private
accounts and pages.

Greenwich health officials have said that contact tracers have had a
difficult time tracking down teenagers willing to admit having been at
the gatherings.

Several students contacted for this article said they did not feel
comfortable discussing the events. In some cases, students said that
they had been told by their parents not to share information about the
parties.

Still, the outbreak is sowing frustration among some students and
parents who fear that allowing parties to be held showed that some
residents may not be taking the risks seriously and that any rise in
cases could influence plans to reopen schools for in-person learning.

Fred Camillo, the first selectman of Greenwich's board of selectmen,
said the board had scheduled a special meeting on Wednesday to talk how
the town would better enforce rules on social distancing and mask
wearing.

``There's going to be consequences now for people who disobey the
measures,'' he said.

Across the country, officials have sounded similar concerns, targeting
parties involving teenagers and young adults where little or no social
distancing takes place and where drinks and food make consistently
wearing face masks difficult.

In New Jersey,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/nyregion/coronavirus-cases-nj.html}{a
recent increase in cases} has been attributed in part to outbreaks among
young people gathering along the Jersey Shore.

In New York City, as images of young people crowding outside bars and
other venues circulated this month, Mayor Bill de Blasio said there had
been an uptick in infections among people in their 20s.

The governor of Mississippi, Tate Reeves, said last week that his state
had seen ``a tremendous amount of spread in young people.''

``I've been talking for about a week about wanting to do something to
curb the spread among young, drunk, careless folks,'' he said.

And in Connecticut, officials in Darien, another affluent community not
far from Greenwich, raised the alarm last week after five people between
the ages of 10 and 19 tested positive for the virus on one day. Some of
the infections are believed to be linked to parties.

``It's summertime,'' said Jayme Stevenson, the first selectman of
Darien. ``It's beach weather. People are out on boats. They are having
parties. And I think they are beginning to let their guard down. It's
critically important that young people understand that they can get the
virus and they can spread the virus.''

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

The state's governor, Ned Lamont, put out a statement this week warning
about ``outbreak clusters among teens and young adults'' accompanied by
a photo of a densely packed party on a string of boats on a state
waterway.

``A small cluster of cases can turn into hundreds of new infections
within days,'' Mr. Lamont said. ``If you multiply that, we are looking
at major impact to our ability to continue to reopen our economy or even
send children back to school in September for in-person instruction.''

The warnings came as researchers are still trying to understand how the
virus affects children and other young people and how efficiently it
spreads. Public health experts say children under 10 appear far less
likely to transmit the virus than older children.

Despite the outbreaks in local communities, Connecticut has largely
contained the virus.

The caseload in the state has been steady for weeks and, over the last
week, the average has been 188 cases per day, though the data has been
affected by the addition of cases from the state's testing backlog.

Only seven states had a lower per capita case count over the last seven
days, according to a database maintained by The New York Times.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/31/nyregion/31ctvirus-outbreaks/31ctvirus-outbreaks-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Caroline Baisley, the health director for Greenwich, said officials
first realized something was amiss when they began hearing rumors of
large parties around the weekend of July 18. In the following weeks,
they started looking at testing data and noted a trend --- several young
people were testing positive.

``When you start to see multiple 18-year-olds and 17-year-olds, then you
have to start to wonder what's going on here,'' she said.

Mr. Philip at the Brunswick School said at least one student at the
school had been infected at a birthday party for that student's father.

The parties have cast a shadow over the school's preparation for
reopening in the fall, he said, advising that young people avoid large
indoor gatherings, and that parents should forbid them from going.

Mr. Camilo said the kind of socializing that is typical among young
people can make it hard to keep everyone safe.

``One kid goes to a party in Greenwich, next thing you know there's a
little bit of an outbreak,'' he said.

Neil Vigdor contributed reporting.
