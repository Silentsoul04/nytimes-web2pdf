Around 3 a.m. one day this past spring, a math teacher at Mott Haven
Academy was stirred awake by the buzz of a text message. It was from a
student, who wrote that his mother had just died from the coronavirus.

The Bronx charter school, still in the process of switching to remote
learning, sprang into action. The child’s teachers huddled to plan both
for his grieving process and how to soothe his classmates, and the
school helped the family cover funeral costs.

Mott Haven Academy was unusually well prepared to confront a death in
the community — and to help its students weather the coronavirus —
because it was built to handle crises. Mott Haven, which has an
elementary and middle school, reserves most of its roughly 460 seats for
students in the child welfare system and uses an array of social
services to offer them much more than academics.

Now, schools around the nation that serve vulnerable children may have
little choice but to adopt the unconventional measures that those like
Mott Haven and Broome Street Academy, a charter high school in Manhattan
that serves about 300 similarly at-risk students, have used since the
pandemic hit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Doctors affiliated with the two New York schools mailed students
antidepressants or birth control pills, teachers added families who
could no longer pay bills to their personal cellphone plans, and
administrators gave cash grants to parents who had lost jobs.

All of this was in addition to [ensuring schoolwork was adapted for
remote
learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/29/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-schools-remote-learning.html),
underscoring how the challenges facing schools in September include more
than just preparing English and math lessons, and instead encompass
every facet of a student’s life.

Millions of students in large cities and suburban districts will not
physically return to classrooms this fall, and New York’s 1.1 million
public school students will [likely attend school in person only a few
days a
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html).

Black, Hispanic and low-income children who have endured both
devastating health outcomes and serious economic devastation from the
virus need creative solutions when they cannot be in school, said Bill
Baccaglini, chief executive of the New York Foundling, the social
service agency that founded Mott Haven.

“I think the entire system has missed something if they don’t rethink
what the fall semester looks like,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mott Haven’s ties to the Foundling and Broome Street’s to the Door,

service agencies that focus on at-risk
children.

The two schools offer a slew of services for tens of thousands of
children and families each year, including physical and mental health
care, legal assistance and help finding housing.

[Most public schools do not have those
resources](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html)
or the ability to add new services, especially with the significant
budget cuts prompted by the coronavirus crisis.

But schools that serve predominantly low-income children, long tasked
with providing nonacademic help, will have little choice but to redouble
that work whenever a profoundly traumatized class of students reports
back to school.

Melissa Silberman, the principal of Broome Street, started thinking
about how to protect her students and their families weeks before
schools were shuttered.

“We have young people who have a high degree of trauma; even the very
act of shutting abruptly is traumatic for them since they see Broome
Street as a home,” she said. Many of Broome Street’s students came from
some of the worst-performing middle schools in the city.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In March, teachers at the school showed students how to log on to their
online learning portal, had them save their social workers’ cellphone
numbers and created an email hotline for questions from families. Broome
Street distributed over 100 **** laptops for the many students who did
not have computers at home.

“Because we are a school built around a high degree of intervention, we
were able to pivot in a way that has just been shocking,” Ms. Silberman
said.

Still, Broome Street’s staff and students have continued to face
enormous challenges.

Shortly after protests against police brutality erupted in New York
City, a student reached out to the guidance staff, asking for an
emergency appointment. The teenager had recently lost a family member to
the coronavirus and had just left a protest where her brother was
pepper-sprayed by the police.

The school was able to schedule a remote therapy session quickly because
it has five social workers for its roughly 350 students.

In contrast, in 2018, the city’s traditional public schools [had an
average of one guidance
counselor](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-the-help-nyc-schoolkids-need-20200213-pii6zdvyebhhvoladadyacb2gi-story.html)
for roughly every 380 students, and one social worker for every 716
students, [according to a city Department of Education
report](https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/guidance-counselor-report-and-summary-feb-2019.pdf).

About a third of the students at Broome Street receive weekly counseling
— including a transgender teenager in a group home who has to use a pay
phone in a hallway for therapy sessions during the pandemic. Every
student at the school received a weekly wellness check-in via email in
the spring.

Aniyah Stoves, a recent graduate, relied on those meetings. Her stress
mounted after she lost a job she loved at the Guggenheim Museum when the
city shut down, and younger siblings running around the house made it
hard to focus on schoolwork. In the spring, she said, “I got overwhelmed
and felt like I was bearing too much.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio has directed over 100 low-income
schools to add more social services. That started when the city’s
economy was booming, but he cut about $9 million for those so-called
community schools in the latest city budget. That move, activists say,
shows just how unprepared the city is to support its neediest children.

“You have this massive number of kids who will fall through the cracks
because the city didn’t coordinate services for them,” said Eric
Weingartner, the chief executive of the Door.

Mr. Weingartner said Broome Street was able to prevent calamity for its
students and families in the spring because it offered such a variety of
services.

“Whatever crisis kids are going through,” he said, “it’s never just one
thing.”

That is why Jessica Nauiokas, Mott Haven’s principal, spent the first
few weeks of the lockdown figuring out how to get cash and food into the
homes of the school’s most vulnerable children, so that they could
eventually focus on their studies.

Jennifer Curet, a single mother of five who lives in the South Bronx,
said the school helped her manage some of the most difficult months of
her
life.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and

        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“There were a lot of times I wanted to give up because it was too much
for me,” Ms. Curet said. Had it not been for Mott Haven, “I probably
wouldn’t have home-schooled. I probably would have skipped it.”

A social worker helped make school schedules for her four children who
attend Mott Haven, which she then pasted on the walls of her apartment.
Ms. Curet said she received multiple Amazon packages a week filled with
crayons, construction paper and other supplies to keep her children
busy, and had frequent calls with the guidance counselor to talk about
her own anxiety and how to decompress.

“Every day was like Christmas,” she said.

Ms. Nauiokas said dozens of single parents needed help with grocery
shopping, so school staff started making supermarket runs for those
families.

One family that was not eligible for governmental help because of its
immigration status had to close its small hair salon after the virus
hit. The school gave the family a cash grant for rent and sent gift
cards.

Ms. Nauiokas said the trauma and disruption of the pandemic had created
an opportunity to improve public schools drastically for students who
needed them to be their anchor. “It would be a shame if we went back to
the same status-quo system that was underserving kids of color,” she
said.

The Door, which houses Broome Street Academy and provides services for
its students and roughly 11,000 other children each year, also saw its
clients’ lives begin to unravel, and rushed to adapt.

The organization took over part of a Midtown Manhattan hotel and
transformed it into an isolation unit for homeless children with the
coronavirus, complete with youth counselors and medical staff. The
Door’s medical team has sent scores of uninsured teenagers medicine,
eyeglasses and H.I.V. tests. A team of lawyers who handle immigration
cases met with teenagers in parks so they could sign legal documents
while maintaining social distance.

But there was still so much adults could not do for the children they
serve.

Mr. Baccaglini of the Foundling said he sometimes struggled to sleep,
thinking about children in unstable homes who could no longer rely on
their school buildings as safe zones.

“Are we worried that abuse and neglect is higher? Without a doubt,” he
said. “It’s the thing that keeps me up at night. I know what I know, but
what I don’t know is what’s going to hurt.”

Mr. Baccaglini said that the Foundling would pay for tutoring for Mott
Haven’s eighth-grade graduates throughout their high school careers
elsewhere, and that it was mulling other ways to help.

Jardy Santana, a fourth-grade teacher at Mott Haven, said her
experiences teaching during the pandemic so far had left little doubt
that she would need to take a drastically different approach in
September.

Ms. Santana said she spent months trying to keep track of one student
who would for weeks cheerfully respond to calls, only to disappear for
days. And every morning in the spring, Ms. Santana retaught the day’s
lesson by phone with one student who did not have internet access.

Ms. Santana said she had received countless text messages from families,
all with a similar plea: “I need help” — with home-schooling, with food
and money, with anxiety and grief.

“Our students have faced losses of family members. I can’t imagine just
jumping into the school year and saying, ‘Let’s open up this book and
get started,’” Ms. Santana said. “There has to be a place and a time
where we process this together, how it has impacted us, how we have
changed.”
