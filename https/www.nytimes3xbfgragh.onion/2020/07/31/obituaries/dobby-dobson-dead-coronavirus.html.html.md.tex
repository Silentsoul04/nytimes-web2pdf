\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Dobby Dobson, a Jamaican singer and songwriter who had numerous hits ---
most notably the 1967 ballad ``I'm a Loving Pauper,'' which both became
his signature song and gave him his nickname --- died on July 21 in
Coral Springs, Fla. He was 78.

His half sister Yasmin Morais said he died, in a hospital, of
complications of the novel coronavirus.

Mr. Dobson was ``quite a significant figure in the evolution of Jamaican
popular music,''
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/authordavidkatz/}{David Katz}, the
author of ``Solid Foundation: An Oral History of Reggae'' (2003), said
in a phone interview.

Although Mr. Dobson was best known for sentimental ballads and cover
songs, Mr. Katz said, ``If you scratch the surface, you find a diverse
output.''

His early success was in a duo with the singer Chuck Josephs; as Chuck
and Dobby, they recorded for major producers like Duke Reid and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/05/06/arts/coxsone-dodd-72-pioneer-of-the-jamaican-pop-music-scene.html}{Coxsone
Dodd}. Beginning in 1960, the pair released a string of hit singles,
including ``Till the End of Time'' and ``Do Du Wap,'' which mixed
American R\&B and doo-wop with Jamaica's emerging ska sound.

Mr. Dobson went on to sing with groups like the Deltas and the Sheiks.
But his breakthrough came as a solo act with
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZcGDurZrak}{``I'm a Loving
Pauper,''} a song he wrote.

With its laid-back feel and syncopated beat, the song typified the
popular rocksteady sound, a precursor to reggae. And its message of
being poor yet with plenty of love to give resonated with Jamaican
audiences.

Numerous artists, including
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM_m1EJRGjI}{Gregory Isaacs}, UB40
and Dillinger, have covered the song. ``It's become part of the Jamaican
songbook,'' Mr. Katz said.

In 2011, the Jamaican government awarded Mr. Dobson the Order of
Distinction for his contributions to Jamaican culture.

Highland Ralph Dobson was born on July 5, 1942, in Kingston. He later
said that his mother, Maud (Elliott) Morais, who was a single parent
when she raised him, was steadfastly against him singing.

``She was a devout Christian lady and she felt you should spend your
time doing your schoolwork,'' he said
\href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1894441/}{in 2009 in a filmed
interview} with the filmmaker Tony Watt.

Mr. Dobson defied his mother, he told Mr. Watt, because he ``had
experienced a taste of the applause'' while starring in a play at his
primary school with the future actress
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1995/12/23/arts/madge-sinclair-57-tv-and-film-actress.html}{Madge
Sinclair}.

After attending the College of Arts, Science and Technology in Kingston,
where he earned a degree in marketing, Mr. Dobson held a series of day
jobs while pursuing music, including as a proofreader for the Jamaican
newspaper \href{http://jamaica-gleaner.com/}{The Gleaner} and in sales
at Colgate Palmolive.

A versatile singer, Mr. Dobson broadened his repertoire in the '70s to
include pop covers like Tom Jones's ``That Wonderful Sound'' and the
Beatles' ``Carry That Weight.'' He sang with the country artist Skeeter
Davis and later turned to gospel music when he became a born-again
Christian.

Mr. Dobson was also a record producer, working on other artists'
recordings as well as his own. While working at the Federal Records
Studio in the mid-'70s, he discovered the vocal group the Meditations.
In 1978 he produced the group's first album, ``Message From the
Meditations,'' which the website
\href{https://www.allmusic.com/album/message-from-the-meditations-mw0000925754}{AllMusic
called} ``one of the most astounding debuts in Jamaican history.''

In addition to Ms. Morais, his half sister, Mr. Dobson is survived by
five sons, a daughter, two other half sisters and four half brothers.

In 1979 Mr. Dobson moved to New York City, where he lived for many
years, mainly in Brooklyn and the Bronx, before relocating to Florida in
the 2000s. The ``Loving Pauper'' sold real estate.

But he also continued to record, produce and perform for audiences
throughout the United States and the Caribbean, as well as in Toronto
and London. He appeared at reggae festivals, in banquet halls, even as a
featured act on a ``Motion on the Ocean'' cruise that departed from
Queens.
