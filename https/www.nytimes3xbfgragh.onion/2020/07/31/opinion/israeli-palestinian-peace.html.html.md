Let’s play the Israel-Palestine impossibility game. It’s timely because
the two-state peace for which I have long argued is now widely deemed
unattainable. The answer, as one of the most thoughtful observers of the
conflict, [Peter Beinart, has recently
argued](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/opinion/israel-annexation-two-state-solution.html),
must be one state with equal rights for Jews and Palestinians, “a Jewish
home that is not a Jewish state.”

Beinart, the editor at large of Jewish Currents and a longtime two-state
advocate, *changed his mind.* Yes, it’s still possible. He gave up a
core conviction, based on the evidence. I salute that rare capacity in
an America of declaimed certainties, even as I disagree.

The impossibility game goes like this: You list the reasons that a
two-state outcome is impossible, before listing the reasons that a
one-state solution is impossible, and then you decide which of the two
is *less impossible.* As you do so, set aside the fact that history is a
catalog of “impossible” events. Lastly, draw conclusions that reflect
the enigma of personal conviction.

Here we go. A two-state peace is impossible because the 53-year Israeli
occupation of the West Bank has gone too far to be undone; because the
conquest has become so accepted that only a handful of Jewish members of
the Knesset will even use the word “occupation”; because Messianic
Israeli nationalism, with its claim to all the land between the
Mediterranean and Jordan River, has grown inexorably since the
assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin a quarter-century ago;
because President Trump’s United States has given carte blanche to that
nationalism through a so-called peace plan contemptuous of viable
Palestinian statehood; because Israeli annexation of parts of the West
Bank is a growing possibility [invoked regularly by Prime Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-annex-sovereignty.html);
because some 640,000 Jewish settlers now live in the West Bank and East
Jerusalem; because the Palestinians have never been weaker; because the
Palestinians have never been more abandoned by Arab states; because the
Palestinian Authority, a supposedly interim form of self-government, has
become the corrupt, undemocratic agent of Palestinian emasculation;
because the infrastructure and economy of Israeli dominion are
irreversible; because power on the Israeli side corrupts and
powerlessness for Palestinians leads to the chimera of victimhood;
because young Palestinians now prefer the one-state idea; because
Israelis, post-Oslo, have other things on their minds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A one-state peace is impossible, on the other hand, because Jews who for
millenniums dreamed of their own homeland will not suddenly concede this
was misguided and believe, the Holocaust notwithstanding, in the
kindness of strangers; because Jews had a “home” before in places like
the Netherlands, France and Germany, and concluded from the way their
patriotism led to annihilation that a home was not enough; because a
United States of Jews and Palestinians in the Holy Land could never
agree on a school textbook, or the composition of its army, or indeed
the very name of the state; because Lebanon, Syria and Iraq suggest the
limited chances in the Middle East of harmonious existence among
different national and religious groups; because a country whose birth
would be a day of liberation for half the population and for the other
half a day of catastrophe is unworkable; because Palestinians and Jews
singing “Kumbaya” together in the increasingly nationalist and
discriminatory Israel of the Jewish Nation State Law is far-fetched;
because the hatred between Jews and Arabs is more amenable to an
equitable divorce than to forced cohabitation; because many Palestinians
still seek the destruction of Israel and would see one state as the
partial attainment of that goal; because geography and demography
suggest one state would end up as an Arab state in Israel’s stead.

It’s a tough call. I think a two-state peace is less impossible and more
desirable in part because I am sure the only way to something resembling
one state, a confederation for example, is through the establishment of
two states, Israeli and Palestinian, living beside each other in peace
and security for decades.

When France and Germany, after 1945, opted for reconciliation after
repeated wars, they did not abolish their borders; they knitted together
forms of cooperation that ultimately made the borders invisible and
irrelevant.

The [two-state idea is comatose until Trump is
gone](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/07/us/politics/trump-jerusalem-palestinians.html),
and Netanyahu is gone, and Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the
Palestinian Authority, is gone — and then some. But it is no more
“impossible” than was the fall of the Berlin Wall or the disappearance
of the Soviet Union. “There is a distinction between a coma and being
dead,” Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the nonprofit advocacy group J
Street, told me.

But the one-state idea is dead on arrival. It does not add up, a
21st-century fantasy built on the pretense that the 20th century did not
exist.

I mentioned personal conviction. People do not reason in a vacuum. I am
not persuaded, as Beinart seems to be, that one state would guarantee
Jews’ security, the ultimate raison d’être of Israel. Therefore, I
cannot support it.

Here are my convictions, [as I expressed them in a column six years
ago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/07/30/opinion/roger-cohen-zionism-and-israels-war-with-hamas-in-gaza.html).
I have not changed my mind.

> I am a Zionist because the story of my forebears convinces me that
> Jews needed the state voted into existence by United Nations
> Resolution 181 of 1947, calling for the establishment of two states —
> one Jewish, one Arab — in Mandate Palestine. I am a Zionist who

>

This, as a Zionist, I cannot accept. The way out of the impasse is the
less impossible path: two states.
