Re “[Virus Wipes Out 5 Years of Economic
Growth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)”
(front page, July 31):

The Covid-19 virus is global, and the five years of wiped-out economic
growth is solely U.S. economic growth. No other developed country has
seen long-term economic consequences as drastic as we have. As the
article points out, “data from Europe shows what might have been.”
Government responses in Germany have “allowed a much stronger economic
rebound in recent weeks.”

The difference is entirely attributable to the absence of a national
coordinated response to the virus in the United States. A better
headline would have been “Failure of National Leadership to Respond to
Virus Wipes Out 5 Years of Economic Growth.”

Re “[Despite Safeguards, a Misleading Video Goes Viral, With Help From
the
Trumps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/technology/virus-video-trump.html)”
(news article, July 29):

Is it not awful enough that Covid-19 has infected four million Americans
and killed 150,000 of us?

Now, on top of an inept and confused response by the federal government
and the president, such that the United States now leads the world in
total cases, new cases and deaths, comes a disinformation video by
“America’s Frontline Doctors” that promotes ineffective treatments for
the virus. The video argues against the use of masks and undermines the
work of first responders, true front-line care providers and public
health workers who are daily risking their lives to help Americans
infected with this virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even worse: The president and his son tweet out this disinformation
video to everyone who still listens to their sorry accounts.

You would think that the virus is doing its damage effectively right
now, without needing the help of the Trump family to further increase
the suffering and death of people across this country. But I guess that
things can always be made worse.

**To the Editor:**

The Republicans want to, above all else, reopen business. They must know
it is too soon to do that because the virus is not under control. So
they also [want to indemnify
employers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/business/economy/coronavirus-liability-shield.html)
against claims of employees and their families that they were made ill
or died because they were forced to go back to work because they
couldn’t survive without a paycheck until the pandemic was brought
under control.

Were it not for this kind of stupidity, we would have had this virus
under control already as most of the rest of the industrialized world
has done. We would be back at work and at school. Instead, Americans are
still falling ill and dying at alarming rates while a president who is
thrilled that he can pass a basic mental capacity test waged war with
federal storm troopers in Portland and has just now decided to wear a
mask. Sometimes.

We need to pass lifesaving and economy-saving financial aid to families,
lock this country down until this virus is under control, make everybody
wear masks and stop fooling around. Our country is at stake. And
whatever you do, get a mail-in ballot and vote this reckless toddler out
of office before he breaks the greatest democracy in the world.

**To the Editor:**

My wife and I were tested 14 days ago at an urgent care center owned by
a large medical group that has operations spanning several counties just
north of the city. For two weeks, no results and no information as to
when results would be available. Finally, we found out the results:
negative.

The sign advertised results in three to five days. The care center
blamed the lab, of course. Pointless? Methinks so.
