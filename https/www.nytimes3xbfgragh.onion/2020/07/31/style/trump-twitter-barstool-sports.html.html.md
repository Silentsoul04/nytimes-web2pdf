<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — During the Clinton presidency, The New Republic billed
itself as the in-flight magazine of Air Force One. Former President
Obama loved The Atlantic. President Trump prefers Barstool Sports, the
sophomoric, in-your-face sports blog beloved by bros of all stripes.

The president —
who[noted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/trump-nobody-likes-me-walks-out-briefing.html)
this week that “Nobody likes me” — is always looking for a friendly ear
in the media. But unlike Fox News, the frat-boy blog turned media empire
is known more for its dude content — “Man Vs. Wasp Nest - Who Ya Got?”
reads one recent headline — and “Local Smokeshow of the Day” gallery of
babe photos than for its political coverage.

Barstool’s founder, Dave Portnoy, 43, began his first White House
sit-down last week with an appeal. “Your son’s a big fan of our website.
Even before this started, I was trying to get a retweet out of him for
about six months,” he said. He also complained to a sympathetic Mr.
Trump that Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist
currently grappling with [a raging deadly
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
“is on my ‘X’ list, because every time he talks and says the country
should stay inside, my stocks tank.” The interview ended with Mr.
Portnoy dialing up his father for a surprise FaceTime call with the
president.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And so groaned the Walter Cronkite-wannabes in Washington, of whom there
are many.

When Mr. Portnoy arrived at the White House complex, young staffers
clamored to take selfies with him. Eric Trump tweeted out a promo photo
of his father being interviewed, writing: “Two legends\!”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though Mr. Portnoy stated in his interview that he is “apolitical,” he
was ahead of the curve on the Trump movement when, in 2015, he announced
he would vote for the reality TV star. “I don’t care if he’s a joke,’’
[he
wrote](https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/351804/im-officially-voting-for-donald-trump).
“I don’t care if he’s racist. I don’t care if he’s sexist. I don’t care
about any of it. I hope he stays in the race and I hope he wins. Why?
Because I love the fact that he is making other politicians squirm.”

Mr. Trump, in turn, had become familiar with Mr. Portnoy’s signature
pizza reviews and his appearances on Tucker Carlson, where Mr. Portnoy
has expressed uncertainty about Dr. Fauci and decried the overreach of
political
correctness.

Together, both men have a history of ugly remarks on sexual assault [and

and are, to the delight of their respective fanboys, unlikely to ever
apologize. One of those mutual fans is [Elon
Musk](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/style/elon-musk-maureen-dowd.html),
the Tesla magnate and increasingly Trump-aligned brozilla, who tweeted
at Mr. Portnoy in May: “Please run for office. The politicians &
unelected bureaucrats who stole our liberty should be tarred, feathered
& thrown out of town\!”

In March, one of Mr. Portnoy’s colleagues [interviewed the Vice
President’s chief of
staff](https://www.barstoolsports.com/video/2198855/riggs-visits-white-house-grounds-for-coronavirus-interview-with-vp-chief-of-staff-marc-short),
Marc Short. More recently, White House press aides had been kicking
around the idea of a Barstool interview with Mr. Trump — a chat on Air
Force One was one thought — and ultimately settled on last Thursday, the
[opening
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/sports/baseball/mlb-season-coronavirus.html)
of baseball season, before reaching out to Barstool. (Through a
representative, Mr. Portnoy declined to be interviewed for this story.)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As millennials continue to [cord-cut
ESPN](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/14/magazine/spurned-by-espn-barstool-sports-is-staying-on-offense.html)
into irrelevance, Trump aides have correctly identified Barstool Sports
and its network of popular podcasts and social media personalities as a
way to reach younger voters, a demographic [with
which](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/upshot/poll-trump-defectors-2020-election.html)
this president is underwater. It is both a cultural fit and an untapped
resource: A Morning Consult
[poll](https://morningconsult.com/2020/07/24/barstool-sports-trump-interview-polling/)
this week stated that “Barstool sports fans are younger, more Republican
and more politically engaged than the public overall.”

“He’s smart to reach out in that regard, it humanizes you,” said Sig
Rogich, a former media adviser to President George H.W. Bush. In his
time, Mr. Rogich facilitated successful collaborations between Bush I
and the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Sports Illustrated.
“If Trump can create connectivity with the sporting world, it’s a plus
for him. There’s no downside to it,” Mr. Rogich said.

Besides, maybe Washington is just the place for a guy like Mr. Portnoy
after all.

There are so many pink-hued Vineyard Vines shorts here in summer that
14th Street often resembles an Alaska salmon run in May. As Jim Webb,
the Democrat and former senator, once
[said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/11/05/opinion/05brooks.html)
about the town’s defining work of architecture: “Watching the white
phallus that is the Washington Monument piercing the air like a bayonet,
you feel uplifted.” (Speak for yourself, dude\!)

There is something about working in the White House, in particular, that
inspires Greek life-like behavior. Nicholas Syrett, the author of “The
Company He Keeps: A History of White College Fraternities,” said the
similarities stem from “the degree to which it is both insular and
all-consuming in terms of socializing and work, and the degree to which
they would see themselves against either the world or against their
critics.”

With every administration, White House staffers cling to a culture of
conformity.

The idealistic, progressive bros who rode into town on the waves of
Obama’s historic victory were treated as young princes of the city, but
they became wary of a press corps that wanted every little piece of
them. Their modus operandi was to throw house parties, where they could
[do keg
stands](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/05/02/magazine/02obamastaff-t.html)
in peace. When Jon Favreau, then a young Obama speechwriter, and his
buddy Tommy Vietor, then a press aide, played a game of shirtless beer
pong at a Georgetown bar, they got burned when photos circulated.
Politico
[huffed](https://www.politico.com/story/2010/06/are-obama-staffers-overexposed-038374)
that the administration’s critics saw the aides as behaving like two
“frat boys in the midst of two wars and the Gulf oil spill.”

Mr. Vietor said the culture of the Obama White House doesn’t even
compare to what came after it. “I’d argue that the big cultural problem
with this White House is hiring white nationalists like Stephen Miller,”
he said. “Put down the tiki torch and pick up a baseball.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Trump aides, the perils of overexposure are well-known. Mr. Miller
and other senior officials have been scorned or yelled at in
restaurants. Some younger aides choose to go incognito altogether,
inventing alternate identities if they meet someone while out — like one
press wrangler who pretends to be a real estate agent. Others spout the
ultimate D.C. safe words: “I work in fund-raising.”

Spend a Saturday night with young Trump staffers and one hears basic
things like “Alexa, play Top 40\!” Vodka shots are administered in
plastic TRUMP PENCE 2016 campaign cups. Nostalgia rules for the days of
the first scrappy campaign, when victory seemed impossible and everyone
doubted them.

A major Trump White House watering hole is Mission Navy Yard, a bar near
the baseball stadium where the Nationals play. One low-level National
Security Council staffer even moonlit as a bartender there. Another spot
is “The Lot,” across the Potomac, in Arlington, where aides congregate
with buckets of [White
Claw](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/05/style/white-claw-popular-memes.html),
the boozy seltzer drink.

With Ivanka and Melania as the models for women, the understated Tory
Burch flats and tight ponytails are out; in are the knee-high boots,
party dresses and big blowouts. The Trump White House has a Palm Beach
look. Aides keep stilettos in desk drawers, should they be called into
the Oval.

The men may have it worse. The Washington Post
[reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/behind-the-chaos-office-that-vets-trump-appointees-plagued-by-inexperience/2018/03/30/cde31a1a-28a3-11e8-ab19-06a445a08c94_story.html)
that, earlier in the first term, Trump bros vaped and engaged in
“Icing,” in which Smirnoff Ice bottles are hidden and must be
chugged when discovered, a game familiar to anyone who spent the early
2000s in a dorm.

A 2011 [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ggia03nT40) of
Johnny McEntee, then at University of Connecticut and now a high-ranking
Trump official, landing amazing football trickshots is the stuff of bro
legend in this West Wing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But there is an upside to this Barstool-Trump match made in bro-town.
Real Trumpologists will note that Mr. Portnoy’s friendly interview
yielded something ultrarare from this president: a moment of contrition.

In the interview, Mr. Trump allowed that he does often regret his time
on Twitter (a platform on which he has recently suggested,
[incorrectly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-postpone-election.html),
that he can delay November’s election). “It used to be in the old days
before this, you’d write a letter and you’d say, ‘This letter is really
bad.’ You put it on your desk and you go back tomorrow and you say, ‘Oh,
I’m glad I didn’t send it,’” the president said. “But we don’t do that
with Twitter. We put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you
start getting phone calls, ‘Did you really say this?’ I say, ‘What’s
wrong with that?’ And you find a lot of things.

“You know what I find?” said Mr. Trump. “It’s not the tweets. It’s the
retweets that get you in
trouble.”
