# Amazon Wins Without Even Trying

As America’s economy suffers, Big Tech does shockingly
well.

Three months ago, the Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos effectively
declared that his company would try to lose money. Instead, Amazon
declared on Thursday the [largest profit in its
history](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/amazons-earnings-double-as-sales-surge).

It was a bit awkward.

Companies are supposed to make money, for sure. But this comes at a
moment when politicians and the public are wondering if America’s
digital superstars are so powerful — and perhaps, tilt the game to their
advantage — that they simply can’t be beaten.

A company like Amazon planning to lose money and instead making billions
of dollars in profit is a pretty compelling sign of dominance.

This week in technology made me think of [that old
line](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1992/11/06/business/is-gm-fate-still-crucial-to-us.html)
about a once dominant car company: What’s good for the United States was
good for General Motors, and what was good for GM was good for the
country. (There’s a debate about what the GM executive meant by this,
but it’s still a good line. Stay with me.)

The bosses of four of America’s tech giants, [dragged (virtually) in
front of Congress this
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html),
said some version of that old saw. They said that their successes are
uniquely American, and that their companies enrich the country and the
lives of people who live in it.

That’s true. It is, however, hard to ignore that the fortunes of the
country and its leading corporate citizens are currently going in
opposite directions.

We learned on Thursday that the United States [wiped out five years of
economic growth in a matter of
months](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html),
as my colleague Ben Casselman put it. During that period, Amazon, Apple,
Google and Facebook [mostly raked in money hand over
fist](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html).

Mostly, this makes sense. During a pandemic, we have needed the products
and services these companies provide. That does not, however, guarantee
them financial success.

*(Read more: Last year, my colleague Kashmir Hill wrote about* [*trying
and mostly failing*](https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five) *to cut the
five big U.S. technology companies out of her life. Now, Kash is

experiment*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/technology/blocking-the-tech-giants.html)*.)*

Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg said a few months ago that the way his
company makes money — selling ads to a local bakery or an online luggage
maker — [tends to naturally rise and
fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/technology/coronavirus-big-tech-earnings.html)
in tune with the economy. That’s generally true, but not right now. The
economy is tanking at its worst rate in many decades. Facebook’s
advertising sales are fine.

What has been bad for the United States hasn’t yet been bad for Big
Tech. Is, then, what’s good for Big Tech good for the country? I’m not
sure.

There’s an
[axiom](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/gradually-then-suddenly/#:~:text=There's%20a%20passage%20in%20Ernest,happens%20much%20the%20same%20way.)
in technology that change happens gradually, then suddenly. Tech
companies can seem unbeatable until they aren’t — often because of some
rapid evolutionary change. It happened to Nokia and Sun Microsystems —
whose old headquarters was taken over by Facebook in a symbol of one
empire replacing a crumbled one.

So could there be a Fall of Rome moment for today’s tech superpowers?
Yes, in theory, and we might never see it coming. Right now, though,
despite broader economic pains and a growing backlash to their power,
these four American tech superpowers appear to be as close to
invulnerable as you can get.

### Your Take

We’ve spent a lot of time this week talking about the congressional
antitrust hearing and potential abuses of power by Big Tech. We want to
change things up a bit and hear from our readers.

Tell us about one tech invention of the past decade that makes your life
fabulous, or at least easier, and why.

A reader in Allentown, Pa., Arthur Weinrach, inspired us, writing in to
mention the many technological changes that he’s grateful for, including
the E-Z Pass.

## What didn’t get attention at the Big Tech hearing

The antitrust code was written to tackle railroads and steel companies
that grew strong enough to raise their prices at will.

A hot conversation in legal scholarship is whether those laws apply to
Google, Facebook and other companies that offer many products for no
(monetary) cost to us. (My colleague Cecilia Kang [talked about this on
The
Daily.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html))

There are, however, at least a couple of examples in which tech
companies are being accused of behavior that has led to higher sticker
prices for us. In other words, there are conventional,
railroad-baron-type antitrust claims against the tech giants, too.

These instances didn’t get much of an airing during the congressional
hearing this week into tech company power, but they’re worth paying
attention to.

One issue involves Apple’s App Store. A lawsuit that is [winding its way
through U.S.
courts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/13/us/politics/supreme-court-antitrust-apple.html)
claims that Apple’s commission of as much as 30 percent on digital app
transactions makes all iPhone apps more expensive than they would be
without Apple’s monopoly over iPhone app distribution.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another involves Amazon’s marketplace. Some merchants have said that
Amazon [punishes
them](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/19/technology/amazon-sellers.html)
if they list what they sell on Amazon for lower prices on Walmart.com or
other spots. Those sellers claim that Amazon is in essence [pushing up
the
prices](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-05/amazon-is-squeezing-sellers-that-offer-better-prices-on-walmart)
on products on competitor’s shopping sites.

Members of Congress didn’t ask Apple and Amazon about these allegations,
and the companies have previously denied them.

Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School and a [contributing Opinion
writer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/tim-wu) for The New York
Times, told me that he believed those price claims were the strongest
potential antitrust case against Amazon on legal grounds.

He said, though, that there’s a distinction between “technical antitrust
and public opinion antitrust.” Intricate discussions about price setting
are boring in congressional hearings.

## Before we go …

  - **Europe vs. Big Tech:** The European Union and some of its member
    countries have been relatively aggressive in suing America’s tech
    giants and restricting them through new laws. But, as my colleague
    Adam Satariano writes, there’s a belief that those tactics haven’t
    been effective, and now officials in Europe are drafting several new
    laws and regulations that [aim at the heart of how the U.S. digital
    stars
    operate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/europe-new-phase-tech-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html).

  - **Bond with your co-workers by robbing a (virtual) bank:** Bored by
    Zoom calls for work? My colleague David Segal has a [fun
    look](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/business/hey-you-free-on-friday-for-a-meeting-and-a-bank-heist.html)
    at people holding business meetings and work bonding sessions in
    Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto and other video games. Just don’t get
    killed by zombies on your lunch break.

  - **Seven. Billion. Video. Views:** If you have kids, they have
    probably watched the slightly unnerving YouTube videos released by
    CoComelon and Blippi, two giants of children’s entertainment. Both
    are [now part of a single
    empire](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-30/blippi-cocomelon-purchased-by-kids-media-giant-moonbug)
    whose YouTube videos generate more than seven billion views each
    month, Bloomberg News writes. Children’s programming is among the
    most popular destinations on YouTube, which has made some parents
    and children’s advocates uncomfortable.

### Hugs to this

Here is a [cat eating corn on the
cob](https://twitter.com/kwatt/status/1285728300128665601) — rather
elegantly, I think.
