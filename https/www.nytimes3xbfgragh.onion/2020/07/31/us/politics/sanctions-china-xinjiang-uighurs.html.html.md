# U.S. Adds Sanctions Over Internment of Muslims in China

</div>

The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a powerful government
entity that runs companies and farms in the Xinjiang region, where
officials carry out the mass internment of Muslims.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced sanctions Friday on a
powerful government entity and two senior officials who have helped
manage it, citing [systemic human rights
abuses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/us/politics/china-uighurs-arrest.html)
against [predominantly Muslim ethnic
minorities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/18/world/asia/uighur-muslims-china-detainment.html)
in the Xinjiang region in China’s far northwest.

The sanctions, imposed by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control, name the [Xinjiang Production and Construction
Corps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/08/07/world/asia/07xinjiang.html),
an economic and paramilitary organization that plays [a central
role](https://www.andrewerickson.com/2019/11/the-xinjiang-production-construction-corps-key-policy-tool-from-mao-to-xi/)
in the development of the Xinjiang region, and two associated officials,
Peng Jiarui and Sun Jinlong. The order is designed to prevent them from
accessing American property and the financial system, as well as to ban
any economic transactions between them and American companies and
citizens.

“The United States is committed to using the full breadth of its
financial powers to hold human rights abusers accountable in Xinjiang
and across the world,” Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said
in a statement.

The sanctions most likely will have little or no practical impact on Mr.
Peng, the deputy party secretary and commander of the development group,
and Mr. Sun, one of its former political commissars. It was not
immediately clear what effect they would have on trade and international
commerce done by the group, which oversees some state-run companies that
export products such as tomato paste.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The group’s direct exports to the United States were worth $43 million
in 2018, the most recent year for which detailed official data were
available. Much more of its crops and other raw materials may end up
processed by Chinese companies for exports that are not counted under
the group’s
numbers.

In particular, the group is a big cotton grower. Last year, it produced
[two million metric tons of
cotton](http://www.xjbt.gov.cn/c/2020-04-26/7346731.shtml?ad_check=1),
about a third of China’s [total
production](http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/zxfb/201912/t20191217_1718007.html),
according to official statistics. In 2018, its direct imports from the
United States were worth $102 million.

Ties between the United States and China have been fraying as the Trump
administration takes an increasingly hard line on China’s handling of
the initial
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus)
outbreak, its growing repression in Hong Kong, its maritime claims and
miliary expansionism in the South China Sea, its efforts to export 5G
next-generation telecommunications equipment and its systemic abuses of
largely Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.

The Chinese government has carried out a [campaign of mass
detentions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html)
in Xinjiang, placing one million or more members of the Uighur ethnic
group and others into large internment camps that aim to indoctrinate
the detainees with propaganda about the Communist Party and eradicate
core parts of their Muslim and Uighur identities.

From 2018 onward, senior administration officials [debated whether and
how to punish
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/10/world/asia/us-china-sanctions-muslim-camps.html)
for the abuses.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China hawks in the administration blamed Mr. Trump and top economic
advisers, including Mr. Mnuchin, for holding back on sanctions in order
to avoid jeopardizing trade talks with China and to cozy up to Xi
Jinping, the Chinese leader. But now, as the pandemic roils the United
States and endangers the president’s prospects of re-election, Mr. Trump
has begun to sour on maintaining cordial relations with China, and [the
hawks have greater
leeway](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/asia/us-china-trump-xi.html)
to pursue tougher actions on China and to try to set the two nations [on
a long-term course for
confrontation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/podcasts/the-daily/china-trump-foreign-policy.html).

Mr. Trump’s campaign strategists have also urged him to attack China in
an attempt to turn the spotlight away from [the president’s failures on
the pandemic and the
economy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html).

“Today’s designations are the latest U.S. government action in an
ongoing effort to deter human rights abuse in the Xinjiang region,”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the most vocal of the China hawks, said
in a statement on Friday.

The [Xinjiang Production and Construction
Corps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/08/07/world/asia/07xinjiang.html)
was founded in 1954 as a group entwined with the People’s Liberation
Army that would oversee the deployment of large numbers of ethnic Han
citizens, many of them military veterans, to Xinjiang to build farms,
factories and towns that would allow China to consolidate control of the
important border region and the many ethnic minority groups
there.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

As of 2009, the group, which reports directly to Beijing, had an annual
output of goods and services of $7 billion, and the settlements and
entities overseen by the bingtuan, or soldiers corps, included five
cities, 180 farming communities and 1,000 companies. They also run their
own courts, universities and media organizations.

On July 9, the United States [imposed
sanctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/world/asia/trump-china-sanctions-uighurs.html)
on four Chinese officials associated with Xinjiang policy, including
Chen Quanguo, the party chief of the region and a member of the Chinese
Communist Party’s 25-member ruling Politburo. That move was largely
symbolic, but it sent a stronger message than an [October 2019
action](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/08/business/china-human-rights-technology-xinjiang.html)
in which the administration placed 28 Chinese companies and police
departments deemed to be associated with Xinjiang abuses on a blacklist
that forbids American companies from selling technology and other goods
to them without a license. At that time, the State Department also
announced visa restrictions on some Chinese officials.

On July 20, the Trump administration [added 11 new Chinese
entities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/business/economy/china-sanctions-uighurs-labor.html),
including companies supplying major American brands like Apple, Ralph
Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, to the list that restricts them from
purchasing American products, saying the firms were complicit in human
rights violations in Xinjiang. That brought to 48 the total number of
Chinese companies and security units on the U.S. entity list for
violations related to Xinjiang.

On July 1, the administration warned businesses with supply chains that
run through Xinjiang to consider the reputational, economic and legal
risks of doing so.

The Associated Press
[reported](https://apnews.com/fff5fc7925f09916bf6b9d5f79bb4132) on July
3 that agents of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in New York had
seized 13 tons of hair weaves and other beauty products suspected of
having been made by detainees in a Xinjiang internment camp. The
products were worth an estimated $800,000. In May, the agency conducted
a seizure of similar products that were being imported by companies in
Georgia and Texas, to be sold to salons and individuals across the
United States.
