Anger over the closing of the border because of coronavirus fears
triggered demonstrations, and then artillery barrages.

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan --- Some of the most intense border clashes
between Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent years left at least 15
civilians dead on the Afghan side on Thursday, officials said.

Afghanistan accused Pakistani forces of firing heavy artillery into
civilian areas after protests by communities on both sides who were
demanding the reopening of a nearby border crossing that Pakistan had
closed to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Hayatullah Hayat, the governor of Kandahar Province, where the clashes
occurred, said the worst barrage of Pakistani artillery started around 7
p.m. and struck the Spin Boldak area. In addition to the deaths, at
least 80 other civilians were wounded, he said. Afghan security
officials said they had retaliated with rockets. Social media videos
apparently filmed from the Pakistani side showed the dark sky lit up by
intense crossfire.

A delegation from the local Pakistani government in Baluchistan Province
had
\href{https://tribune.com.pk/story/2257539/balochistan-ministers-visit-pak-afghan-border-after-clash-leaves-two-dead}{arrived
at the border} to assess the situation, officials in Pakistan said.

Gen. Yasin Zia, the chief of Afghanistan's army, has ordered the three
army corps stationed along the border areas to be ``fully ready to
retaliate to the Pakistani military in kind'' and put his country's
special forces and air force on the ``highest alert,'' Afghanistan's
Defense Ministry said in a statement. The ministry estimated the number
of dead at nine, including a child.

Movement across the porous border had been restricted by the Pakistani
side in recent months over concern about the pandemic, which has hit
both countries hard. The restrictions particularly affected communities
on two sides of the Chaman crossing, people who rely on easy border
trade, either as laborers or smugglers, for a living.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/31/world/31afghan-pakistan-2/merlin_171328602_cba9ab96-3002-471e-a8cb-f3c423799e5f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

For several weeks, protesters had staged a sit-in on the Pakistani side
of the crossing in Chaman demanding the resumption of normal flow. In
June, Pakistan reopened for commercial trucks, but the crossing remained
shut for travelers and laborers. The border was opened for travelers
stuck on the two sides on Wednesday, but the protest to allow the
routine crossing of laborers had continued.

The situation grew tense on the Pakistani side on Thursday, with reports
of Pakistani forces opening fire on protesters during clashes
and\href{https://tribune.com.pk/story/2257539/balochistan-ministers-visit-pak-afghan-border-after-clash-leaves-two-dead}{killing
at least two people}. The protesters torched a Covid-19 quarantine
facility. When thousands of travelers stuck on the Afghan side rushed
for the crossing in the chaos, they were met by Pakistani fire that also
struck Afghan border police facilities. The situation erupted into
full-on clashes that intensified late into the night, witnesses said.

Adeel Ahmad, a provincial official in Baluchistan, said Pakistani
security forces had denied they targeted civilians and had only fired
shots into the air to disperse protesters and maintain order.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

``The daily wage workers, especially, who work on both sides of the
border are most hard-pressed and have demanded from the government to
lift the restrictions on movement and economic activity,'' Mr. Ahmed
said. ``The locals say that we can no longer tolerate hunger and
unemployment and want a solution to the current impasse. The locals are
also resisting the government's plans to introduce passport and
biometric systems for cross-border movement.''

Afghan officials and residents in Spin Boldak District said heavy
artillery fire from the Pakistani side forced hundreds of families to
flee their homes from border villages last night.

The clashes at the southern border came just a week after Afghan
officials said Pakistani forces had fired dozens of mortar shells into
the Sarkano District of eastern Kunar Province,
\href{https://tolonews.com/afghanistan/8-civilians-killed-pakistani-mortar-attack-kunar-officials}{killing
eight civilians.}

The two countries share a long border, about 1,500 miles, that was drawn
by the British in the 19th century and that left ethnic Pashtun tribes
split. Consecutive Afghan governments have questioned the legitimacy of
the division, known as the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/29/world/asia/in-afghanistan-comment-on-border-brings-tension.html}{Durand
Line}, as an official border. Efforts by Pakistan's government to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/world/asia/pakistan-afghanistan-border-fence.html}{build
reinforced fences and security checkpoints along the border} have
angered Afghan officials and communities in the area.

Taimoor Shah reported from Kandahar and Mujib Mashal from Kabul,
Afghanistan. Reporting was contributed by Salman Masood in Islamabad,
Pakistan, and Fahim Abed in Kabul, Afghanistan.
