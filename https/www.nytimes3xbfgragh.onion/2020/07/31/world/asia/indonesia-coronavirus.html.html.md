First, Indonesia’s agriculture minister promoted wearing a necklace
containing a eucalyptus potion to cure the coronavirus. Not to be
outdone, the governor of Bali, a popular resort island, pushed his own
remedy: inhaling the steam from boiled arak, a traditional alcohol made
from coconuts.

So-called influencers and self-styled experts have also pushed their own
quack cures and misinformation on Indonesian social media, including a
widely spread rumor that popular infrared thermometer guns cause brain
damage.

As Indonesia steadily loses ground to the pandemic, the government has
had difficulty delivering a consistent, science-based message about the
coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19.

Yet even in hard-hit provinces, as many as 70 percent of people go
without masks and ignore social distancing requirements, according to
the government, often crowding into shops and markets and hanging out at
busy cafes and restaurants.

Indonesia is not the only country battling misinformation or whose
leaders have promoted quack remedies. The World Health Organization has
called the ubiquity of hazardous false information an
[“infodemic.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/06/health/coronavirus-misinformation-social-media.html)

In Kenya, the [governor of
Nairobi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html#link-5699a22e)
has pushed cognac as a miracle cure. President Trump has continued to
promote hydroxychloroquine, a drug used for treating malaria, as a
coronavirus remedy despite medical evidence to the contrary. He has even
suggested that an “injection inside” the human body with a disinfectant
like bleach could help combat the virus.

But Indonesia is unique because of its large population, expansive
geography across thousands of islands and mix of cultural identities. It
would be difficult enough for the government to implement a clear and
unified plan for combating the virus, but matters have been made worse
by the promotion of muddled and often dangerous information.

The country’s president, Joko Widodo, had initially downplayed the
pandemic and has delivered mixed messages. He admitted in March that he
had [misled the

about the virus to prevent a panic. After that, he was slow to close
businesses and schools and to limit travel, but was quick to lift
restrictions even as cases continued to
rise.

In May, he said Indonesia should learn to live with the virus. A month

more to bring the pandemic under control.

This month, he called for a national campaign to promote better

In the absence of a unified message from the national government, local
officials and opportunists have filled the gap.

One official who has promoted a questionable remedy is the agriculture
minister, Syahrul Yasin Limpo. He told reporters this month that a
ministry laboratory had developed a potion made from eucalyptus that
when worn on a necklace could kill 80 percent of virus particles in half
an hour.

“From 700 species of eucalyptus, our lab test results showed that one
kind could kill the corona,” he said. “We are certain. We will produce
it next month.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His claim was quickly contradicted by health experts, including the head
of the laboratory that developed the aromatic potion, who said it was
not effective against the coronavirus. But that didn’t stop others from
promoting it.

A popular singer, Iis Dahlia, met with Mr. Joko as he sought to recruit
celebrities to help in his health campaign. Soon after, she informed her
12 million Instagram followers that she was proud to be wearing the
amulet.

“This eucalyptus necklace,” she said, “makes me feel safe and protected
from the virus.”

In Bali, the governor, I Wayan Koster, has promoted a local treatment:
inhaling the steam of boiled arak, a traditional alcoholic beverage. As
if to stay on trend, he too recommends adding a dash of eucalyptus oil.

The governor, who has a Ph.D. in education and described himself as a
former “researcher,” told a news conference last week that nearly 80
percent of those who inhaled the concoction tested negative sooner than
would have been expected.

The treatment has not been subjected to scientific testing, but he said
he hoped that Bali could patent and produce it.

The government’s top coronavirus spokesman, Wiku Adisasmito, urged the
public to follow health guidelines and not to rely on superstition and
half-baked treatments, even when they emanate from public officials and
celebrities.

“At times of emergency, we all need honest, scientifically based, real
facts to bring us hope, calm and clarity,” said Mr. Adisasmito, a
University of Indonesia health policy professor.

Jusuf Kalla, a former vice president who now heads the Indonesian Red
Cross, said the country got off to a slow start in fighting the pandemic
in part because the health minister, Terawan Agus Putranto, minimized
its
severity.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“Until March, Minister Terawan was like Trump, saying, ‘Oh, this is only
a simple flu,’” Mr. Kalla said. “But now, Minister Terawan is very
realistic. Ministers and governors are trying to come up with solutions
in an uncertain situation. It is trial and error.”

Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, and some
citizens and officials have leaned on their faith to promote cures and
guide their understanding of the disease.

On Lombok Island, a top official suggested that niqabs, loose Islamic
veils worn by<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>women, were as
effective in preventing the spread of the virus as snug-fitting medical
face
masks.

Thohir, the regent of Central Lombok, explained in an interview.

Nevertheless, the Covid task force for the province, West Nusa Tenggara,
continues to call for face masks, said Artanto, a police spokesman and
task force member.

“The regent still wears a mask, not a niqab,” said Mr. Artanto, who like
many Indonesians uses one name. “We keep educating people to wear a
mask.”

For many Muslims, the Covid-19 burial protocol of wrapping the body
tightly in plastic and burying it in a designated cemetery has been
difficult to accept. By tradition, Muslim family members wash the body
of the deceased and wrap it in cloth for
burial.

The authorities say there have been many cases around the country of
families rejecting doctors’ warnings and taking Covid-positive bodies
home for burial.

In Mataram, Lombok’s main city, relatives of a woman who died in a
motorcycle accident this month refused to believe doctors who said she
had tested positive.

About 100 men stormed into Mataram’s government hospital to claim the
body. Officers tried to explain the importance of the burial protocols.
But they were badly outnumbered, and the men took the body, put it in a
taxi and drove away.

“It happens all over Indonesia,” Mr. Artanto said. “Their understanding
as people who live in the village is different from those of us who live
in the city.”

Mr. Adisasmito said that Islamic burial traditions were deeply
ingrained, and that it was hard for people to accept that they must
change. He likened it to Americans who refuse to wear a mask because it
obstructs their “pre-pandemic liberty, habits and way of life.”

“We live in a diverse globe,” he said, “and different communities have
distinctive values that they hold on to.”
