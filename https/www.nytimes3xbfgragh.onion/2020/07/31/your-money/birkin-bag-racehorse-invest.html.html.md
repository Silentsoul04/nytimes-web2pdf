# Can’t Afford a Birkin Bag or a Racehorse? You Can Invest in One

Interest in fractional investments has grown as the pandemic has forced
more people to spend time at home, but advisers say the strategy has
risks.

Antonella Carbonaro, a consultant to financial technology companies,
saved up to buy her Birkin bag, a luxury tote made by Hermès that sells
new for tens of thousands of dollars. Since getting her bag in 2018, Ms.
Carbonaro has stored it in her closet, bringing it out only on special
occasions.

But when she heard that there was a marketplace to buy shares in other
Birkins, including more exotic versions that can fetch six figures, she
was in. It is not a lark. Ms. Carbonaro, 30, sees her shares in an
exclusive bag as an alternative investment, no different than stakes in
private equity funds that invest in a basket of companies.

“This is a visual way to participate in different asset classes that
aren’t as accessible,” Ms. Carbonaro said. “Investing in shares of
Birkin bags, even though I have one, is getting more exposure.”

She bought 10 shares in a Bleu Lézard Birkin bag that was valued at
$61,500 in an offering last year. Earlier this year, she bought 25
shares in a gray Himalaya Birkin. It was valued at $140,000 in an
offering in May.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Unlike owning a fractional share of a condominium, she will never be
able to use her investment. Shares are traded until the owner of the
marketplace sells the asset.

Ms. Carbonaro’s first Birkin investment is trading up 6 percent from the
purchase price on Rally Rd., a platform that deals in fractional
investments in collectible items. The other one is still in the lockup
period and its shares cannot be traded yet.

The market for investing in fractions of items otherwise seen as
collectibles — and largely reserved for the wealthiest people — has seen
an uptick in interest during [the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus) as
people spend more time at home.

He said existing investors on the platform had doubled the number of
items they owned shares in. Initial offerings have sold out five times
faster than before the pandemic, as new investors on the platform began
buying up shares more quickly.

To accommodate growing interest, MyRacehorse, which sells shares in
racehorses that are far smaller stakes than those sold by traditional
racing syndicates, has partnered with a top stud farm, Spendthrift, to
extend the length of the investments. Before, its model had been to sell
the horse when it was done racing. Now, investors can participate in the
breeding fees, which can be many times any racetrack winnings.

The fractional movement is not limited to luxury items. Fidelity, the
mutual fund giant, offers “stocks by the slice” where you can buy a
portion of a share starting at $1. And many private equity funds, which
have high minimum investments and long lockup-periods, have created
mutual fund versions of their funds.

Eugene Olmstead, a retired internet technology executive, said he had 1
percent to 1.5 percent in 11 horses, all bought through his
self-directed individual retirement account.

“You’re not going to get a worthwhile return on your investment unless
you have a certain percentage,” said Mr. Olmstead, 58. “I’ve done my
research, and I’m investing in ones that I think in the long run will
give me a decent return.”

Of the 11 horses he has bought shares in, only two are old enough to
race. He said both had average winnings of $12,000 a race. He has
received some dividends from those races, but said the money was not
substantial yet.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“It’s money I don’t need right now,” he said. “It gives me a chance to
wait for those returns.”

Another owner of fractional shares in horses, David Falo, 58, compared
buying stakes in young horses to investing in companies on private
platforms before their initial public offering. “The horse may not do
well, or the horse could get injured,” he said, “but it gives you a
little thrill along the
way.”

There are many caveats. Trading through Rally Rd. and MyRacehorse are
done through apps, which makes buying and selling easier and creates a
community. But the apps turn investing into games, as has happened with
[the stock-trading app
Robinhood](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html).
That can distort the financial consequences of ill-considered
investments.

Compounding the risk, an asset typically bought for personal enjoyment
or bragging rights cannot be analyzed the same way that a private equity
investment would be.

“There could be return potential, but who knows?” said Jack Ablin, chief
investment officer of Cresset Capital. “There’s no liquidity and no
control. When do you get your money back? You don’t know. The other is
the carrying costs could be high.”

In the case of the shares in the racehorses, expenses like training and
boarding are shared just as profits are. “You own full equity in the
horse,” said Michael Behrens, founder of
MyRacehorse.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Another issue is that buying these assets in slices can mean a person is
paying more than she or he might if the person could buy the whole
asset, and that could dampen returns or make it hard to resell the
asset.

“You’re buying an overvalued slice of the whole,” said David Abate,
senior wealth adviser with Strategic Wealth Partners. “If you decide you
want to get out of this investment, you’d better understand how the
secondary market works.”

The fees are disclosed but baked in. With MyRacehorse, 15 percent of the
offering of a horse goes to the company upfront. But each horse is part
of an entity that has been registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

“This is high risk; I’d never tell people otherwise,” Mr. Behrens said.
“We’re not trying to build a platform that says this is going to be a
really good asset class. Many horses have been bought for $1 million and
never made it to the racetrack.”

As with other alternative investments, buyers are restricted from the
selling of these fractions until after the lockup period ends. But when
the asset itself — the bag or the horse — is sold is determined by the
platform, not the individual
investors.

Jimmy Lee, chief executive of the Wealth Consulting Group, a wealth
adviser, questions the notion of buying a passion asset with an eye
toward profit. “When it comes to art, you only see the ones that go up
in value,” he said. “If someone buys a piece of art for $1 million and
it doesn’t go up in value, it’s not going to be sold.”

There are other drawbacks. These marketplaces do offer the possibility
of a return on the investment, but they deprive people of the joy of
owning a painting or a fast car: having it in your possession. (Although
with MyRacehorse, investors can at least go to the track and see their
horses.)

“You lose the intimacy of what it’s meant to be,” Mr. Ablin said. “It’s
normally an asset you can touch, enjoy, ride in, ride on or drink.”

But many investors in shares seem unbothered by this. Ms. Carbonaro said
not being able to touch or hold the bags she had invested in was not an
issue for her. “If I had a Michael Jordan rookie card, I don’t think I’d
want to touch it,” she said.

John Cochran, who works in sales in Baltimore, has invested in shares of
76 different collectibles including a shirt Mr. Jordan wore in a
basketball game, a Muhammad Ali fight contract, a portrait of Abraham
Lincoln and a 2006 Ferrari f430 manual.

He said he was happy receiving a photo and some information on the
object and was unfazed that he could not hold or touch it. “I like the
idea that, just like my stocks, it’s all in an electronic portfolio,” he
said. “I don’t have to have the resources to store these things.”
