** This four-part docuseries looks back on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1985/03/07/world/body-of-us-drug-agent-believed-found-in-mexico.html}{the
1985 torture and murder of Enrique Camarena}, a.k.a. ``Kiki,'' a Drug
Enforcement Administration agent working undercover in Mexico. The
fallout from the incident fueled international outrage, and ultimately
unraveled the Guadalajara cartel,
\href{https://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-gallardo-20170824-story.html}{giving
rise} to the regional drug wars in Mexico today. The series explores the
many layers of the case through interviews with Camarena's widow,
Geneva, and Hector Berrellez, the special agent who led the D.E.A.'s
murder investigation.

\textbf{HOST} (2020) \emph{Stream on}
\href{https://www.shudder.com/}{\emph{Shudder.}} ** A séance over Zoom
gets seriously spooky in this film directed by Rob Savage, which was
shot and produced remotely. Part horror, part commentary on how the
pandemic has changed our world, ``this concise, entertaining spin on the
ghost story proposes that maybe the modern world is a haunted house
now,'' Kyle Turner wrote in his
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/movies/host-review.html}{New
York Times review.}

\textbf{MY DOG STUPID} (2019) \emph{Watch through}

Space.}} ** The real-life couple Yvan Attal and Charlotte Gainsbourg
play a couple in crisis in this film adapted from
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/02/28/books/books-of-the-times-a-truly-famous-unknown-writer.html?searchResultPosition=1}{John
Fante'}s novella, ``West of Rome (My Dog Stupid).'' Attal plays a washed
up writer named Henri, who is forced to confront marital problems with
his wife, Cécile (Gainsbourg), as their four children prepare to leave
the nest. Henri finds solace in a giant dog that winds up on his
property one night. He decides to keep it, much to the disdain of the
rest of his family.

\textbf{SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS} (1941) \emph{Stream on the}
\href{https://www.criterionchannel.com/}{\emph{Criterion Channel.}} **
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1942/01/29/archives/comic-tour-in-sullivans-travels-on-the-paramounts-screen-a-yank-on.html}{This
film}, which was released after the Great Depression and before
America's involvement in World War II, feels oddly relevant at a time
when entertainment escapism can feel both necessary and trivial. Joe
McCrea plays John L. Sullivan, a Hollywood movie director who sets out
to make a serious film about ``the suffering of humanity,'' following
his successful string of comedies. In order to better acquaint himself
with the subject matter, Sullivan goes undercover to experience life as
a vagrant (trailed closely by Hollywood insiders), only to end up truly
destitute, trapped in the grim reality he was hoping his film would
depict.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/04/01/movies/sturgess-travels-a-screwball-tale.html}{Preston
Sturges}'s film cleverly plays with ``the perennial question in
Hollywood of escapism vs. engagement,'' A.O. Scott said in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/arts/1194826561460/critics-picks-sullivan-s-travels.html}{an
episode of the video series Critics' Picks}. ``There are plenty of
movies that do one or the other --- that make us laugh away our troubles
or that make us face our troubles --- but there aren't very many that do
both.''
