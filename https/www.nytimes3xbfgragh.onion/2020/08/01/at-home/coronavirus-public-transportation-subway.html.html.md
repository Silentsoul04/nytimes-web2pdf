In cities across the country, ridership on public transportation has
dropped precipitously as people have stayed home to help prevent the
spread of the coronavirus. But for some, continuing to take mass transit
was never optional. Many essential workers who cannot work remotely or
don’t drive have continued to ride buses, trains and ferries; they are
disproportionately people of color and the earners of lower incomes.

“The pandemic itself has changed the profile of who’s using the services
and what they’re using them for,” said Brian Taylor, a professor of
urban planning and public policy at the University of California, Los
Angeles. “It is mostly riders without other options who are coming back
to public transit so far” — that is, if they ever stopped riding. (The
school’s Institute of Transportation Studies, which Dr. Taylor directs,
is studying the effects of the pandemic on transportation, including on
public transit ridership, operations and finance.)

In some areas, ridership is now rebounding as businesses and workplaces
reopen: Last week in New York, subway ridership [was down
by](https://new.mta.info/coronavirus/ridership) 70 to 80 percent — but
that’s compared with as much as 93 percent in April. And thanks to the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s new cleaning protocols (and
suspended service between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. for sanitizing), the trains
sparkle.

“At the beginning, they were thought of as sort of virus trains,” said
Sarah M. Kaufman, the associate director of the Rudin Center for
Transportation at New York University. That has been largely disproved;
in Paris and Tokyo, for example, the cities’ crowded trains have not
been linked to outbreak clusters. (Transit workers, though, have
suffered a steep toll: In New York, 131 M.T.A. workers
[have](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/26/nyregion/nyc-covid-19-mta-transit-workers.html)
died and more than 4,000 have tested positive for the virus. Some
employees [have
cited](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-mta-subway.html)
a lack of widespread mask-wearing and social distancing early in the
pandemic.)

So as traffic picks up again, on the streets and underground, what are
the best strategies to stay safe while commuting and making essential
trips? Here, a few experts weigh in.

### Choose your method wisely.

If you plan to go somewhere, evaluate which means of transportation
poses the least risk to yourself and others. “The more that you can be
in open air and the farther you can be from other people and the less
likely that other people will be without a mask is the safest way to
go,” said Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York
University focused on occupational and environmental safety. Dr. Gershon
and a team of scientists are working with TWU Local 100, a transit union
in New York that represents roughly 46,000 bus and subway workers, to
study the impact of the outbreak on its members.

Take into account how long you’ll be waiting for your chosen vessel to
arrive, she explained, and whether the terminal or station is inside or
outside. You could get to the ferry dock early, for instance, to ensure
that you get a seat on the upper deck in the open air; even inside,
there’s probably ample air circulation and space to [spread
out](https://twitter.com/vinbarone/status/1270470612071440386). If
you’re riding the bus, try to sit near a window, and keep it open.
Don’t do this on the subway, though: New York’s underground tunnels
are “full of steel dust and asbestos,” Dr. Kaufman explained. Choose the
escalator or stairs over the elevator if you can.

Or travel by bicycle. The use of bike-share programs in New York and
Chicago has
[ballooned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/14/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-bike-commute.html);
by June, Citi Bike had nearly [180,000 active
users](https://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/nyc/June-2020-Citi-Bike-Monthly-Report.pdf?mtime=20200722104600)
— across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Jersey City — and
bikes became [difficult to
buy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/nyregion/bike-shortage-coronavirus.html)
throughout the country. “My bike has been getting a lot more miles than
it ever has before,” said Dr. Mirna Mohanraj, a pulmonary and critical
care specialist at Mount Sinai Morningside, who has been riding all over
Manhattan, including some morning trips to Central Park, and into the
Bronx and Brooklyn.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most important, “if anyone has any symptoms or thinks they’re sick, they
should not take public transportation,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, the
executive director of the American Public Health Association. Instead,
they should stay home and get in touch with their
doctor.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### Pack well, but don’t overdo it.

Don’t leave home without a bottle of hand sanitizer that’s at least 60
percent alcohol and disinfectant wipes to clean your phone, which is a
germ magnet. And anytime you’re in close quarters with other people,
wear your mask, which “protects you from them and them from you,” Dr.
Benjamin said.

Some transportation agencies have made this easier by installing
sanitizer dispensers and offering masks. In San Francisco, Bay Area
Rapid Transit agents have distributed masks to riders [at stations
across the city](https://twitter.com/SFBART/status/1280632009560174592),
and in Portland, Ore., mask dispensers have been added to TriMet buses
and trains. The M.T.A. recently formed a volunteer “mask force” — clad
in unmissable yellow shirts — who roam the subways and buses handing out
free masks.

Don’t bring more than necessary: More than ever, Dr. Gershon said, you
don’t want to leave your bag sitting on the floor, saddling you with yet
another thing you should disinfect.

### Be strategic about your timing.

In Boston, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority has
[introduced](https://www.mbta.com/projects/crowding-information-riders)
a real-time congestion tracker for more than 30 bus lines, with a simple
taxonomy (“not crowded,” “some crowding,” “crowded”), in an effort to
help riders make informed decisions about their travel times. The M.T.A.
is putting in effect a similar program:
[Onbuses](http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-announces-new-real-time-bus-ridership-tracker-web-and-app-0),
sensors count the number of passengers, which is then communicated to
potential riders through the agency’s app.

Regardless of whether your local transit network makes such data
available, you can attempt to avoid typically crowded times. Find out if
your employer will allow for more flexible hours so you can circumvent,
and not contribute to, the rush-hour crush. (During the 1918 flu
pandemic, the health commissioner
[directed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-subway/as-in-1918-new-york-may-use-staggered-work-hours-to-keep-subway-safe-idUSKBN22W1D2)
New York businesses to stagger commutes by just 15 minutes to reduce
crowds on transit and at office buildings.)

Continue to work remotely if you can to reduce crowding for essential
workers and others who are obligated to commute. And if you’re planning
to take public transit to run errands or socialize, or for any other
nonwork-related purpose, travel during off-peak
hours.

### Avoid touching communal surfaces.

Keep your hands off the subway poles and rails to the ferry deck or onto
the bus. Don’t touch the turnstile as you move through it; stay away
from touch screens, keypads and elevator buttons. Make contactless
payments if they’re offered, and skip the paper tickets.

Though surface contamination is
[not](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/health/cdc-coronavirus-touching-surfaces.html)
the main way people contract Covid-19, Dr. Benjamin nevertheless
recommended washing your hands before departing on your journey and
again upon reaching your destination, in addition to sanitizing
frequently throughout. Think, too, about skipping the gloves, which can
pick up germs on one surface and spread them to another.

### Follow the directions.

Take note of the decals on the floor and signs you may see shepherding
you through the station, an effort by some operators — like the Chicago
Transit Authority — to reduce the number of people crossing paths and
decrease crowding. Riders should be “spreading ourselves out still so
we’re not packed in like sardines,” as Dr. Gershon put it, including
spacing out along the subway platform.

If you’re driving onto the ferry, the Washington State Department of
Transportation, which manages the largest ferry system in the United
States, recommends remaining in your car for the duration of your trip.
And if you’re boarding the bus, enter from the rear, to avoid shedding
respiratory droplets on the driver and other passengers. Many bus
systems, including those in Philadelphia and Minneapolis, have been
encouraging passengers to enter from the back for that precise reason.

### Don’t eat, and keep the volume down.

It might already be an unspoken norm on public transit, but it’s a good
public health practice, too: Don’t eat onboard, as eating can carry
particles from a surface to your face. “Once you’ve gotten into a public
setting, no matter how well sanitized you are, we’re touching things,”
Dr. Mohanraj said. “You’re risking putting whatever’s on your hand in
contact with your mouth, your nose, your eyes.” Besides, you’d have to
take off your mask.

Avoid extensive conversations, too; talking, and singing, sprays
aerosolized droplets that can carry virus particles. [In
Tokyo](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/japan-ends-its-covid-19-state-emergency),
many riders were already accustomed to wearing masks and rarely talking;
these practices became universal with the pandemic’s onset.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And most of all, respect your transit operator. Bus drivers, for
example, have been verbally and physically assaulted for enforcing mask
rules. “It’s just unconscionable,” Dr. Gershon said. “Nobody should have
to be afraid to go to work.”
