Carlie Lawrence, 42, a fashion executive and mother of two from
Manhattan, was facing the same fear that seemingly[every
parent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/nyregion/pod-schools-hastings-on-hudson.html)
of school-age children has these days: what if schools don’t open in the
fall?

Luckily for her, Ms. Lawrence and her husband, who works in finance, own
a shingled, four-bedroom house in the Hamptons, where schools, she
figured, may have a better chance at opening.

So they registered their five-year old twin sons at the public
elementary school in East Hampton, and are planning to continue living
in their weekend home full-time. Her sons, she thought, would benefit
from the fresh air, far from the stresses of the pandemic-stricken city.

“The decision is driven by knowing that schools in New York City will
not be able to offer a full-time, in-school option,” Ms. Lawrence said,
“and visualizing what possibly will be a full year of two working
parents, working from home, while being cooped up all day in an
apartment with kids.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The nagging uncertainties facing New York City schools this fall — Will
they open? How crowded will they be? What precautions are being taken?
Will there be a resurgence of coronavirus? — have parents desperately
searching for options. For those wealthy enough to have second homes,
one obvious-seeming option is to take their children out of the city,
and transfer them to schools in the country or near the beach, where
classes tend to be smaller and the air is, in theory, cleaner.

No wonder public and private schools in second-home regions are seeing a
surge in enrollment. The influx is particularly notable in the Hamptons,
a region that usually enjoys a quiet off-season, with relatively few
year-round families with school-age children, according to local school
officials.

Andi O’Hearn, the head of advancement and operations for the [Ross
School](https://www.ross.org/) in East Hampton, an elite K-12 private
school founded by Courtney Sale Ross, the widow of Time Warner chief
[Steven J.
Ross](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1992/12/21/obituaries/the-creator-of-time-warner-steven-j-ross-is-dead-at-65.html),
said administrators there have received a record number of applications
for the fall.

“Due to the fear of Covid, there is a lot of uncertainty, and they’re
trying to make the best decisions for their children,” Ms. O’Hearn said,
referring to anxious parents from the city.

The nonprofit school, whose annual tuition ranges from $22,700 to
$45,000 for day students (boarding students pay $74,000), features a
tennis academy and courses in social entrepreneurship, robotics and
figurative sculpture. More important, it plans to open full-time in the
fall, with 15 tents for outdoor learning on the 63-acre grounds, and
pupils separated into learning pods, organized by grade level or high
school section, to minimize exposure to other students.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So far, registrations for its elementary school grades have doubled, to
93 students from 57 last year, for the fall. “I’m glad we’re able to
accommodate them, although we’re starting to really struggle,” Ms.
O’Hearn said. “We have already gone to waiting lists in six different
grades.”

Affluent parents in the Hamptons are also applying to [Avenues: The
World School](https://www.avenues.org/), a private school based in the
Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan that caters to the children of moguls
and movie stars (Suri Cruise, the daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie
Holmes, was reportedly [a student
there](https://www.businessinsider.com/avenues-world-school-new-york-city-photos-tour-amenities-2019-4)).

It is opening a satellite campus in East Hampton this fall called
[Avenues Studio Hamptons](https://studio.avenues.org/), with room for 60
students, grades 4 through 11, at a cost of $48,000 per year. The school
received a dozen inquiries for every available space, and 45 students
from the Manhattan campus are planning to transfer there this fall,
according to a school spokeswoman.

The exodus of wealthy families from the city comes at a moment that is
fraught socially and politically. The rich have access to multiple
educational options, including at-home [“pandemic
pods”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/parenting/school-pods-coronavirus.html)
with private tutors, or in the case of Avenues, personal mentors and
instruction in 50 languages, including Punjabi and Swahili. Children
from low-income homes, meanwhile, sometimes lack laptops and internet
access needed for remote learning, and may get less funding as the
children of affluent parents abandon the public school system.

And there are no guarantees that the Hamptons and other leafy enclaves
are immune from another coronavirus outbreak that can shut down the
schools.

Schools throughout New York State are still weighing options. Mayor Bill
de Blasio has announced that schools in New York City will open only if
the city sustains a coronavirus test positivity rate [below three
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#link-22c71cd7),
and is advocating a “[blended learning”
model](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html),
combining virtual lessons and classrooms [one to three
days](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html)
a week with staggered schedules to reduce density. City Hall will not
announce [plans for individual
schools](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/nyc-to-ask-state-for-extension-on-specific-back-to-school-plans/2540164/)
until mid-August.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo will have the final say, adding that a decision for
school reopening will come in [early
August](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/nyc-to-ask-state-for-extension-on-specific-back-to-school-plans/2540164/).
“We will not use our children as [guinea
pigs](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/07/13/new-york-gov-cuomo-on-reopening-schools-were-not-going-to-use-our-children-as-guinea-pigs.html),”
Mr. Cuomo said a few weeks ago.

But for some second homeowners, the decision is already made. If the
choice is between a crowded, poorly ventilated classroom in a dense
urban area, and an airy classroom in a bucolic setting, the choice is
clear.

“I think the biggest factor is everyone’s mental well-being,” said Ms.
Lawrence, the fashion executive. In East Hampton, her sons have access
to a backyard, a swimming pool, a tennis court, and a trampoline. “We’re
in our own home, it’s our little haven, and we’re safe. So that relaxed
energy that we have has helped this be an easy time for them.” (The
family is also considering forming a private pandemic pod with other
Hamptons parents, in case schools there do not reopen).

It’s not just private schools that are seeing a surge. Enrollment at the
Amagansett School, a public K-6 school in East Hampton, has reportedly
[doubled](https://www.easthamptonstar.com/education/2020716/amagansett-school-expects-enrollment-to-double)
for the fall to about 150 students, after years of attrition because of
escalating real estate prices, said Peter Van Scoyoc, the town
supervisor of East Hampton.

“The district’s enrollment had been in a steady decline for years, just
because it was getting more expensive for year-round families to live
there,” Mr. Van Scoyoc said. “Now, that’s going the other
way.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While most schools still have capacity for newcomers, Mr. Van Scoyoc
said, it remains to be seen how year-round residents respond to a
potential influx. “There’s already a certain amount of tension every
summer as the population goes from 22,000 to maybe 120,000 on the Fourth
of July weekend,” he said. “And now there’s concern among some
year-rounders, who have to be expecting heavier traffic and more demand
on services.”

More newcomers may be on their way. Cindy Scholz, a real estate agent
for Compass with clients in Manhattan and the Hamptons, said she has
been deluged with requests from young parents from New York City looking
to buy a house on the East End in time to enroll their children into
local schools.

“Their No. 1 priority is school districts, where before, that was never
a consideration,” Ms. Scholz said. “People understand that there might
be a fear of a second wave of coronavirus, and it does feel a lot more
normal outside the city than inside it,” where [deserted office
buildings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-time-life-building.html)and
uncrowded subways are a stark reminder of the pandemic’s
effects.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Schools in the Hudson Valley are also seeing a rise in enrollment.
Administrators at the Rhinebeck Central School District, for example,
have seen a slight uptick in school registration, especially among New
Yorkers with second homes nearby.

And with the start of the school year fast approaching, the question of
where to enroll their children has become a hot topic among parents at
socially distanced backyard barbecues, pool parties and tennis courts
throughout the Hamptons, Hudson Valley, the Catskills and other places
where weekenders have found refuge.

For some of these parents, the choice is so wearying that they have
decided to pull their children out of the school system entirely and
home-school, which is undoubtedly easier when home is not a cramped
apartment, but a weekend house with guest bedrooms, home offices and
lots of outdoor space.

[Noria
Morales](https://www.glamour.com/story/noria-morales-what-it-costs-to-be-me),
a founder of [The Wonder](https://www.thewonder.us/), a club for
families in Manhattan, and her husband, a restaurateur, recently decided
not to plunk down a small fortune for their children’s private school,
Lycée[Francais de New York](https://www.lfny.org/), this fall.

Instead, they moved up to their weekend house on 176 rustic acres near
Elizaville, N.Y. in the Hudson Valley and plan to home-school their
children, using a portion of the money they saved on private school for
a part-time private tutor to help out.

“My kids are in second grade and fourth grade, so there’s nothing I can
really do to set them back academically,” Ms. Morales said. “It’s not
like I have to teach them algebra. Up here, you’re surrounded by trees
and birds, and in my mind, I can encourage curiosity.”

But there are trade-offs, even for the wealthy. At small-town schools in
the Hamptons or the Hudson Valley, children tend to be cut off from the
racial, economic, and cultural diversity of city schools, not to the
mention the museums and other cultural institutions that help round out
their education.

Little surprise, then, that some parents with immense resources are
keeping their options open, while everyone else is waiting to see what
schools will do in the fall.

Alli McCartney, 44, a wealth manager for high-net-worth clients, was
planning to send her two children — Maxwell, 10; and Luca, 8 — to the
Dwight School, a private school in Manhattan, this fall. But since she
and her husband, Scott McCartney, have largely abandoned their West
Village dwelling for their weekend house in Montauk, N.Y., they have
also registered their children at the local public school, in case
Dwight is unable to reopen this fall. (so far, the school plans to).

“Just as I have been doing with clients for years, I am using a
three-pronged approach, asking myself three questions,” Ms. McCartney
said. “What is best for my children? What is best for my business? What
is best for my balance sheet?”

Others are taking a “when life gives you lemons, make Limonata” approach
to the crisis.

Ms. McCartney said some of her Hamptons friends are exploring a form of
schools arbitrage, enrolling their children in public schools in the
Hamptons while waiting for slot to open at elite private schools in
Manhattan this spring.

“They’re using this as a way to upgrade, and get into private schools
they never could get into otherwise,” Ms. McCartney said.
