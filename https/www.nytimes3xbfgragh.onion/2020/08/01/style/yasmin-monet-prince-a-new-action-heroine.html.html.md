**Name:** Yasmin Monet Prince

**Age:** 21

**Hometown:** London

**Now lives:** Ms. Prince lives with her family in a townhouse in
Sydenham, a leafy suburb of London.

**Claim to fame:** Ms. Prince is a rising British actress known for her
role in “[Hanna](https://www.amazon.com/Hanna-Season-2/dp/B087C8X5V2),”
an action drama on Amazon Prime Video that returned for its second
season in July. Her character, Clara, is a super-soldier who escapes
from a secret lab at the end of Season 1 and returns as a leading force
in the show’s story line. Ms. Prince has a history of playing action
roles including her parts in “[Dark
Heart](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Heart-Season-1/dp/B07K2KH636)” a
crime series, and
“[Nocturnal](https://www.amazon.com/Nocturnal-Lashonda-Jones/dp/B07YX84F8M),”
a crime thriller. “I really enjoy the physical and emotional challenge
these roles offer me,” she said.

**Big break:** Ms. Prince was involved in musical theater since 9, and
at 14 landed spots at both the Shakespeare’s Globe youth company and the
BRIT School of Performing Arts. After graduating in 2016, Ms. Prince
starred in “[Ellen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5959320/),” a film
produced by Britain’s Channel 4, about a troubled teenager being raised
in a broken, single-parent home. “It was massive because it was my first
TV project ever, and it was a lead role,” she
said.

**Latest project:** ** The second season of “Hanna” was filmed
throughout Europe, including London, Barcelona, and Paris, which
contributed to both personal and professional growth. While in
Barcelona, the cast and crew found themselves confronted with the [2019
Catalan
protests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/11/world/europe/spain-catalonia-independence.html)
seeking independence from Spain, which shut down production temporarily.
“We were never in any danger, but on the first night it was kind of
scary because of the fires I could see from my hotel room,” Ms. Prince
said. “The whole production side was a roller coaster of fun, pressure —
being stuck in a really big role — and challenges as well.”

**Next thing:** Because of the pandemic, Ms. Prince doesn’t have
anything lined up at the moment. However, she is using her spare time to
stay creative by writing improv scenes for herself. “I’ve discovered
that I like to write,” she said. “I can pretend like I’m in these scenes
and return to acting everyday.”

**Role models:** Ms. Prince is a big fan of [Naomie
Harris](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/25/movies/naomie-harris-black-blue.html)
and [Michaela
Coel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/arts/television/i-may-destroy-you-influences.html)*.*
“Naomie Harris has such range and is such a great actress,” she said. As
for Ms. Coel, she added: “She’s such a brilliant writer, director, and
actress. She’s a genius and I would love to one day be in the same room
as her, to just create something. Anything.”
