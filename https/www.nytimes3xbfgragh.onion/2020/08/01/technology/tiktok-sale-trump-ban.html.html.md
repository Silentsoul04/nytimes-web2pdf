The Trump administration has said the video app poses security concerns

ByteDance, the Chinese internet giant that owns TikTok, has offered to
sell all of the popular video app’s American operations as a way to save
the business from being banned by the Trump administration, a person
with knowledge of the matter said on Saturday.

President Trump had [told reporters on
Friday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/technology/tiktok-microsoft.html)
that he was considering various options for TikTok, including banning
it. White House officials have said the app may pose a national security
threat because of its Chinese ownership. India, one of TikTok’s largest
markets, [banned the
app](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/technology/india-china-tiktok.html)
in June, citing security concerns. That helped prompt the Trump
administration to consider with greater urgency whether TikTok should be
curbed in the United States as well.

ByteDance’s offer to completely divest TikTok’s American operations was
[reported earlier by
Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-bytedance-exclusive-idUSKBN24X3SK).

It was not clear whether the Trump administration would accept the
divestment as a sufficient response to its concerns. ByteDance had
[previously sought to keep a minority
stake](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/dealbook/tiktok-bytedance-investors-trump.html?searchResultPosition=2)in
TikTok’s American operations, but the administration rejected that,
according to the person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.

Microsoft and other companies have been in talks to buy TikTok, but a
deal has not yet been reached, the person added. Many of the parties are
waiting for Mr. Trump to take action, one of the people said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The proposed divestment would not necessarily affect the company’s
operations outside the United States. TikTok has offices and users
around the globe. It has said it has 100 million users in the United
States.

“While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in
the long-term success of TikTok,” a company representative said on
Saturday.

Pressure on TikTok has been building for months. Last fall, the
[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/technology/tiktok-national-security-review.html),
or Cfius, began examining ByteDance’s [2017 purchase of
Musical.ly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/10/business/dealbook/musically-sold-app-video.html),
a video app that was later merged into TikTok. Lawmakers and White House
officials have also expressed concerns that TikTok data could be made
available to the Chinese government, which the company has repeatedly
denied.

Excising TikTok’s U.S. operations from the rest of the company could be
complicated. TikTok has been hiring engineers in the United States, but
engineers in China have been crucial in developing and running the app.
TikTok this year hired a top Disney executive, [Kevin
Mayer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/business/media/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer.html),
as its chief executive as part of an effort to emphasize its autonomy
within ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing.

TikTok has become the first Chinese internet service to win a large
global following. And in the process, ByteDance, which was founded in
2012, has become one of the world’s most valuable start-ups. It was
recently valued at around $100 billion, according to the research firm
PitchBook.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But TikTok’s rise to prominence has coincided with a deepening rift
between the United States and China over technology, trade, human rights
and much else.

In a [video
message](https://twitter.com/tiktok_us/status/1289565422350553091)
posted Saturday morning, Vanessa Pappas, TikTok’s U.S. general manager,
said that TikTok had 1,500 employees in the United States.

“We’re not planning on going anywhere,” Ms. Pappas said.

If Microsoft were to succeed in acquiring TikTok’s U.S. operations, it
would fit a pattern of deal making under the software giant’s chief
executive, Satya Nadella.

Under Mr. Nadella, who became Microsoft’s chief in early 2014, the
company has made three major acquisitions totaling more than $35
billion: Mojang, the creator of popular online video game Minecraft;
LinkedIn, the professional social network; and GitHub, an online network
for software developers. All three are online communities that require
large and sophisticated computing capability to operate — and to scale
up for further growth.

Unlike other potential TikTok acquirers like Facebook and Google,
Microsoft would probably not be stopped by antitrust challenges. Other
than its gaming business, Microsoft is mainly in business technology
markets.

And TikTok may also view Microsoft as a safe landing spot. Mr. Nadella
has allowed Minecraft, LinkedIn and GitHub to keep operating largely
independently. Microsoft, analysts said, has taken a patient stance with
all three, adding resources to each and seeing how they develop rather
than applying management controls from headquarters to seek higher
profits quickly.

Microsoft declined to comment.
