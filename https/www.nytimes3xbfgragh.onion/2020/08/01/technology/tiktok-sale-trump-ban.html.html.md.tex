Operations}\label{bytedance-said-to-offer-to-sell-tiktoks-us-operations}}

The Trump administration has said the video app poses security concerns
because of its Chinese ownership.

ByteDance, the Chinese internet giant that owns TikTok, has offered to
sell all of the popular video app's American operations as a way to save
the business from being banned by the Trump administration, a person
with knowledge of the matter said on Saturday.

President Trump had
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/technology/tiktok-microsoft.html}{told
reporters on Friday} that he was considering various options for TikTok,
including banning it. White House officials have said the app may pose a
national security threat because of its Chinese ownership. India, one of
TikTok's largest markets,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/technology/india-china-tiktok.html}{banned
the app} in June, citing security concerns. That helped prompt the Trump
administration to consider with greater urgency whether TikTok should be
curbed in the United States as well.

ByteDance's offer to completely divest TikTok's American operations was
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-bytedance-exclusive-idUSKBN24X3SK}{reported
earlier by Reuters}.

It was not clear whether the Trump administration would accept the
divestment as a sufficient response to its concerns. ByteDance had
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/dealbook/tiktok-bytedance-investors-trump.html?searchResultPosition=2}{previously
sought to keep a minority stake}in TikTok's American operations, but the
administration rejected that, according to the person with knowledge of
the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the
discussions are confidential.

Microsoft and other companies have been in talks to buy TikTok, but a
deal has not yet been reached, the person added. The proposed divestment
would not necessarily affect the company's operations outside the United
States. TikTok has offices and users around the globe. It has said it
has 100 million users in the United States.

``While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in
the long-term success of TikTok,'' a company representative said on
Saturday.

Pressure on TikTok has been building for months. Last fall, the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/technology/tiktok-national-security-review.html}{Committee
on Foreign Investment in the United States}, or Cfius, began examining
ByteDance's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/10/business/dealbook/musically-sold-app-video.html}{2017
purchase of Musical.ly}, a video app that was later merged into TikTok.
Lawmakers and White House officials have also expressed concerns that
TikTok data could be made available to the Chinese government, which the
company has repeatedly denied.

Excising TikTok's U.S. operations from the rest of the company could be
complicated. TikTok has been hiring engineers in the United States, but
engineers in China have been crucial in developing and running the app.
TikTok this year hired a top Disney executive,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/business/media/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer.html}{Kevin
Mayer}, as its chief executive as part of an effort to emphasize its
autonomy within ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing.

TikTok has become the first Chinese internet service to win a large
global following. And in the process, ByteDance, which was founded in
2012, has become one of the world's most valuable start-ups. It was
recently valued at around \$100 billion, according to the research firm
PitchBook.

But TikTok's rise to prominence has coincided with a deepening rift
between the United States and China over technology, trade, human rights
and much else.

In a
\href{https://twitter.com/tiktok_us/status/1289565422350553091}{video
message} posted Saturday morning, Vanessa Pappas, TikTok's U.S. general
manager, said that TikTok had 1,500 employees in the United States.

``We're not planning on going anywhere,'' Ms. Pappas said.

If Microsoft were to succeed in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations, it
would fit a pattern of deal making under the software giant's chief
executive, Satya Nadella.

Under Mr. Nadella, who became Microsoft's chief in early 2014, the
company has made three major acquisitions totaling more than \$35
billion: Mojang, the creator of popular online video game Minecraft;
LinkedIn, the professional social network; and GitHub, an online network
for software developers. All three are online communities that require
large and sophisticated computing capability to operate --- and to scale
up for further growth.

Unlike other potential TikTok acquirers like Facebook and Google,
Microsoft would probably not be stopped by antitrust challenges. Other
than its gaming business, Microsoft is mainly in business technology
markets.

And TikTok may also view Microsoft as a safe landing spot. Mr. Nadella
has allowed Minecraft, LinkedIn and GitHub to keep operating largely
independently. Microsoft, analysts said, has taken a patient stance with
all three, adding resources to each and seeing how they develop rather
than applying management controls from headquarters to seek higher
profits quickly.

Microsoft declined to comment.
