# Trump’s Approval Rating, Biden V.P. Search: The Latest in the 2020 Race

President Trump’s more sober messaging on the coronavirus crisis didn’t
last long. For Joe Biden, the search for a running mate may last a
little longer.

*Welcome to our weekly analysis of the state of the 2020 campaign.*

## The week in numbers

  - Less than 100 days before the election, President Trump’s approval
    rating is stuck deep in the red. Gallup updated its [approval
    tracker](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203207/trump-job-approval-weekly.aspx)
    this week, showing Trump **15 points down**.

  - His approval rating on the coronavirus is even weaker **(–21)**,
    according to [FiveThirtyEight’s polling
    average](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/).

  - A [Monmouth University
    poll](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_GA_072920/)
    of Georgia, traditionally a red state, showed a dead heat, with
    Trump and Joe Biden each receiving **47 percent** support from
    registered voters.

  - Polls
    [of](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NBC-News_Marist-Poll-AZ-NOS-and-Tables_202007231249.pdf)
    [Arizona](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/07/26/rel1_az.pdf),
    [Florida](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/07/26/rel1_fl.pdf) and
    [North
    Carolina](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7007170/NBC-News-Marist-Poll-NC-Annotated-Questionnaire.pdf)
    showed Biden with an edge in each of those states, all of which
    Trump won four years ago.

<!-- end list -->

  - Biden spent **$11.8 million** on television ads, while Trump spent
    **$4.7 million**. Trump’s campaign pulled its TV ads for six days,
    briefly bringing its spending to $0 nationwide, as the new campaign
    manager, Bill Stepien, conducted a “review” of the ad strategy.

  - On Facebook, Trump again outspent Biden, roughly **$4.2 million** to
    just under **$810,000**.

If last week was billed by White House officials as a new direction for
Mr. Trump — an attempt to stabilize his sinking approval rating by
appearing to take the coronavirus crisis more seriously — this week is
the one we all knew would inevitably follow, when his id took back the
steering wheel.

Gone was the new message about the importance of wearing masks, or any
sustained focus on what he claims is fast progress toward a vaccine. On
Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested for the first time that [the election
could be
delayed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-delay-2020-election.html)
— a move some of his own former advisers described as a feeble attempt
to get ahead of a potential loss in November.

Earlier, Mr. Trump defended his decision to retweet a claim that
hydroxychloroquine was a “cure” for the virus and that masks were
unnecessary.

“They’re very respected doctors,” he said, referring to a woman who has
also promoted videos claiming doctors make medicine using DNA from

tone, just short periods of quiet before the president once again
reveals his baser
instincts.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This week brought the grim reality that few close to the president
wanted to acknowledge: that failing to strictly follow precautions
against the coronavirus, like wearing masks and practicing social
distancing, could have dire personal consequences.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Herman Cain, a former Republican presidential candidate who served as a
chairman of Black Voices for Trump, [died
Thursday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/herman-cain-dead.html)
because of complications from the virus, weeks after attending Mr.
Trump’s indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla. It had been a loaded setting and
date — the weekend of Juneteenth, as protests over the death of George
Floyd spread across the country — and the president needed as many Black
supporters in attendance as he could muster.

Mr. Trump tweeted his condolences, calling Mr. Cain “an American
patriot, and great friend.” Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press
secretary, said in a statement that Mr. Cain “represented the very best
of the American spirit.”

There was no nod to the reality that Mr. Cain may have put himself at
greater risk because he was trying to be a good soldier for Mr. Trump.
Inside the Tulsa arena, Mr. Cain posted selfies showing him sitting with
other Black Trump supporters, none of whom wore masks.

It was an outcome that few in Trumpworld wanted to bear a measure of
responsibility for. One campaign adviser said Thursday he hoped no one
would “politicize” Mr. Cain’s death, and noted that it was impossible to
tell where someone might have contracted the virus. The campaign did not
respond to a request for comment about Mr. Cain’s attendance at the
rally.

Meanwhile, the coronavirus continues to circle Mr. Trump:

  - His national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, became the latest and
    most senior member of the administration [to test positive for the
    coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/us/politics/robert-obrien-virus.html).

  - Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Mr. Trump’s eldest son and a
    top fund-raising official for the re-election campaign, has received
    a clean bill of health since her positive test for the coronavirus
    this month. And she’s already been spotted back at the White
House.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To describe former President Barack Obama’s public statements about his
successor as carefully crafted is an understatement. Each word is
considered, each jab measured exactly, as Mr. Obama balances the weight
of his global prominence with his desire to let the current leaders of
the Democratic Party chart their own course.

On Thursday, however, he leaned all the way in. No more flowery Medium
posts.

Delivering [the
eulogy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/obama-eulogy-john-lewis-full-transcript.html)
for John Lewis, the civil rights giant and Atlanta congressman, Mr.
Obama gave his full treatise on the current political moment, laying out
policy priorities and a searing critique of Mr. Trump without ever
saying his name. It was the type of anti-Trump counterprogramming that
many of Mr. Obama's supporters have wanted to see for years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It also represented a soft evolution from the former president, who
embraced several ideas that he had not endorsed while in the White
House. Consider what he backed, and his history:

  - Mr. Obama made a spirited call for election reforms, including
    making Election Day a national holiday and restoring the Voting
    Rights Act, which was neutered in 2013 by the Supreme Court. During
    his presidency, Mr. Obama at times downplayed the impact of voter
    suppression, focusing more on voter apathy. He has focused more on
    suppression efforts in recent years, as has his party.

  - Mr. Obama called the Senate filibuster a “[Jim Crow
    relic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/obama-filibuster-senate-democrats.html),”
    his strongest comments against the 60-vote procedural threshold that
    has stopped major legislation by both parties. His words contradict
    then-Senator Obama and then-President Obama, who shied from
    filibuster elimination efforts from the party’s progressive base. He
    even gained a new convert: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont
    endorsed filibuster elimination after Mr. Obama’s comments, a
    reversal for the former presidential candidate.

  - On the filibuster, Mr. Obama’s transition subtly mimics Mr. Biden’s.
    As a longtime Delaware senator, Mr. Biden rejected the idea of
    eliminating the filibuster. However, in recent comments at a
    Democratic fund-raiser, he signaled an openness if Republican
    obstruction precluded reforms. The Obama-Biden mind meld continues.

## Veepstakes is finally here (kind of)

At long last, the month is August, and Mr. Biden’s self-imposed time
frame for [a vice-presidential
selection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html)
has arrived. There are only two caveats: All indications are that he is
going to give himself an extension, and we are barely closer to knowing
the selection — or even the finalists — than at the start of July.

Supporters of possible candidates have made public and private cases for
their favorites, and Mr. Biden’s campaign has fueled speculation by
holding events with several contenders. Two candidates have more
recently moved toward the top of Mr. Biden’s list: [Representative Karen
Bass of California and Susan E.
Rice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/joseph-biden-vice-president.html),
the former national security adviser.

Here’s what we know (and what we don’t):

  - **Mr. Biden’s selection will be historic:** Although he made clear
    months ago that he would select a woman, the history-making
    possibility of a female vice president should not be underplayed.
    Given that Mr. Biden might choose a woman of color, the glass
    ceiling could crack two times over.

  - **Mr. Biden wants a governing partner:** So much is made about what
    the selection could mean for the November outcome, but that is
    likely not the most important factor. Mr. Biden saw himself as a
    complementary piece to Mr. Obama’s administration, and will be
    looking for someone with whom he has a personal rapport. Much of his
    decision will come down to things that are hard to quantify in
    strictly political terms. It’s more vibes than science.

  - **Mr. Biden will be shaping future primaries:** It is unclear
    whether Mr. Biden’s choice will shape the race against Mr. Trump,
    but the selection could have an imprint on Democratic presidential
    politics going forward. If Mr. Biden wins, his vice president will
    have a huge national platform to define and expand her political
    brand, much as Mr. Biden did under Mr. Obama. This could put her in
    pole position to dominate the party’s more moderate wing after Mr.
    Biden. Being No. 2 is a low-risk, high-reward position, particularly
    for someone who would be the first woman ever to hold the
office.

  - Ms. Rice once considered running against Senator Susan Collins of
    Maine. Now she’s a candidate to be Mr. Biden’s running mate. If she
    doesn’t get chosen, she’s still open to running for office — [maybe
    even for Senate in Washington, D.C., if it becomes a
    state](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/us/politics/susan-rice-biden-vice-president.html).

  - Mr. Biden released the fourth piece of his “Build Back Better”
    economic proposal, [an effort to show that racial justice is
    integral to his policy
    vision](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/joe-biden-racial-justice-economy-plan.html).
    It promises to “leverage more than $150 billion in new capital and
    opportunities for small businesses that have been structurally
    excluded for generations.”

  - Mr. Trump faces several problems in Michigan, a state he carried in
    2016 by only 10,704 votes. [His campaign has now pulled ads from the
    state’s airwaves almost
    entirely](http://nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/politics/michigan-trump-biden-2020.html).

      - President Trump’s assault on the Postal Service is intersecting
        with his attacks on mail-in voting. [Voting rights groups say it
        is a recipe for
        disaster.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-usps-mail-delays.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&context=storylines_guide)
