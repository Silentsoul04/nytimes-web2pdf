President Trump's more sober messaging on the coronavirus crisis didn't
last long. For Joe Biden, the search for a running mate may last a
little longer.

\emph{Welcome to our weekly analysis of the state of the 2020 campaign.}

\hypertarget{the-week-in-numbers}{%
\subsection{The week in numbers}\label{the-week-in-numbers}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Less than 100 days before the election, President Trump's approval
  rating is stuck deep in the red. Gallup updated its
  \href{https://news.gallup.com/poll/203207/trump-job-approval-weekly.aspx}{approval
  tracker} this week, showing Trump \textbf{15 points down}.
\item
  His approval rating on the coronavirus is even weaker \textbf{(--21)},
  according to
  \href{https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/}{FiveThirtyEight's
  polling average}.
\item
  A
  \href{https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_GA_072920/}{Monmouth
  University poll} of Georgia, traditionally a red state, showed a dead
  heat, with Trump and Joe Biden each receiving \textbf{47 percent}
  support from registered voters.
\item
  Polls

  and
  \href{https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7007170/NBC-News-Marist-Poll-NC-Annotated-Questionnaire.pdf}{North
  Carolina} showed Biden with an edge in each of those states, all of
  which Trump won four years ago.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Biden spent \textbf{\$11.8 million} on television ads, while Trump
  spent \textbf{\$4.7 million}. Trump's campaign pulled its TV ads for
  six days, briefly bringing its spending to \$0 nationwide, as the new
  campaign manager, Bill Stepien, conducted a ``review'' of the ad
  strategy.
\item
  On Facebook, Trump again outspent Biden, roughly \textbf{\$4.2
  million} to just under \textbf{\$810,000}.
\end{itemize}

If last week was billed by White House officials as a new direction for
Mr. Trump --- an attempt to stabilize his sinking approval rating by
appearing to take the coronavirus crisis more seriously --- this week is
the one we all knew would inevitably follow, when his id took back the
steering wheel.

Gone was the new message about the importance of wearing masks, or any
sustained focus on what he claims is fast progress toward a vaccine. On
Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested for the first time that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-delay-2020-election.html}{the
election could be delayed} --- a move some of his own former advisers
described as a feeble attempt to get ahead of a potential loss in
November.

Earlier, Mr. Trump defended his decision to retweet a claim that
hydroxychloroquine was a ``cure'' for the virus and that masks were
unnecessary.

``They're very respected doctors,'' he said, referring to a woman who
has also promoted videos claiming doctors make medicine using DNA from
aliens. ``There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about
it, and she's had tremendous success with it.''

stir up racist fears} about low-income housing and the people who live
there.

In short, it's nearly four years in, and we know there's never a new
tone, just short periods of quiet before the president once again
reveals his baser instincts.

reality}\label{mourning-herman-cain-but-avoiding-reality}}

nomination.Credit...Monica Lopossay for The New York Times

This week brought the grim reality that few close to the president
wanted to acknowledge: that failing to strictly follow precautions
against the coronavirus, like wearing masks and practicing social
distancing, could have dire personal consequences.

Herman Cain, a former Republican presidential candidate who served as a
chairman of Black Voices for Trump,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/herman-cain-dead.html}{died
Thursday} because of complications from the virus, weeks after attending
Mr. Trump's indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla. It had been a loaded setting
and date --- the weekend of Juneteenth, as protests over the death of
George Floyd spread across the country --- and the president needed as
many Black supporters in attendance as he could muster.

Mr. Trump tweeted his condolences, calling Mr. Cain ``an American
patriot, and great friend.'' Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press
secretary, said in a statement that Mr. Cain ``represented the very best
of the American spirit.''

There was no nod to the reality that Mr. Cain may have put himself at
greater risk because he was trying to be a good soldier for Mr. Trump.
Inside the Tulsa arena, Mr. Cain posted selfies showing him sitting with
other Black Trump supporters, none of whom wore masks.

It was an outcome that few in Trumpworld wanted to bear a measure of
responsibility for. One campaign adviser said Thursday he hoped no one
would ``politicize'' Mr. Cain's death, and noted that it was impossible
to tell where someone might have contracted the virus. The campaign did
not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Cain's attendance at the
rally.

Meanwhile, the coronavirus continues to circle Mr. Trump:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  His national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, became the latest and
  most senior member of the administration
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/us/politics/robert-obrien-virus.html}{to
  test positive for the coronavirus}.
\item
  Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Mr. Trump's eldest son and a top
  fund-raising official for the re-election campaign, has received a
  clean bill of health since her positive test for the coronavirus this
  month. And she's already been spotted back at the White House.
\end{itemize}

there}\label{a-rarity-obama-goes-there}}

Atlanta.Credit...Pool photo by Alyssa Pointer

To describe former President Barack Obama's public statements about his
successor as carefully crafted is an understatement. Each word is
considered, each jab measured exactly, as Mr. Obama balances the weight
of his global prominence with his desire to let the current leaders of
the Democratic Party chart their own course.

On Thursday, however, he leaned all the way in. No more flowery Medium
posts.

Delivering
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/obama-eulogy-john-lewis-full-transcript.html}{the
eulogy} for John Lewis, the civil rights giant and Atlanta congressman,
Mr. Obama gave his full treatise on the current political moment, laying
out policy priorities and a searing critique of Mr. Trump without ever
saying his name. It was the type of anti-Trump counterprogramming that
many of Mr. Obama's supporters have wanted to see for years.

It also represented a soft evolution from the former president, who
embraced several ideas that he had not endorsed while in the White
House. Consider what he backed, and his history:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Mr. Obama made a spirited call for election reforms, including making
  Election Day a national holiday and restoring the Voting Rights Act,
  which was neutered in 2013 by the Supreme Court. During his
  presidency, Mr. Obama at times downplayed the impact of voter
  suppression, focusing more on voter apathy. He has focused more on
  suppression efforts in recent years, as has his party.
\item
  Mr. Obama called the Senate filibuster a
  ``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/obama-filibuster-senate-democrats.html}{Jim
  Crow relic},'' his strongest comments against the 60-vote procedural
  threshold that has stopped major legislation by both parties. His
  words contradict then-Senator Obama and then-President Obama, who
  shied from filibuster elimination efforts from the party's progressive
  base. He even gained a new convert: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont
  endorsed filibuster elimination after Mr. Obama's comments, a reversal
  for the former presidential candidate.
\item
  On the filibuster, Mr. Obama's transition subtly mimics Mr. Biden's.
  As a longtime Delaware senator, Mr. Biden rejected the idea of
  eliminating the filibuster. However, in recent comments at a
  Democratic fund-raiser, he signaled an openness if Republican
  obstruction precluded reforms. The Obama-Biden mind meld continues.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{veepstakes-is-finally-here-kind-of}{%
\subsection{Veepstakes is finally here (kind
of)}\label{veepstakes-is-finally-here-kind-of}}

At long last, the month is August, and Mr. Biden's self-imposed time
frame for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html}{a
vice-presidential selection} has arrived. There are only two caveats:
All indications are that he is going to give himself an extension, and
we are barely closer to knowing the selection --- or even the finalists
--- than at the start of July.

Supporters of possible candidates have made public and private cases for
their favorites, and Mr. Biden's campaign has fueled speculation by
holding events with several contenders. Two candidates have more
recently moved toward the top of Mr. Biden's list:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/joseph-biden-vice-president.html}{Representative
Karen Bass of California and Susan E. Rice}, the former national
security adviser.

Here's what we know (and what we don't):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mr. Biden's selection will be historic:} Although he made
  clear months ago that he would select a woman, the history-making
  possibility of a female vice president should not be underplayed.
  Given that Mr. Biden might choose a woman of color, the glass ceiling
  could crack two times over.
\item
  \textbf{Mr. Biden wants a governing partner:} So much is made about
  what the selection could mean for the November outcome, but that is
  likely not the most important factor. Mr. Biden saw himself as a
  complementary piece to Mr. Obama's administration, and will be looking
  for someone with whom he has a personal rapport. Much of his decision
  will come down to things that are hard to quantify in strictly
  political terms. It's more vibes than science.
\item
  \textbf{Mr. Biden will be shaping future primaries:} It is unclear
  whether Mr. Biden's choice will shape the race against Mr. Trump, but
  the selection could have an imprint on Democratic presidential
  politics going forward. If Mr. Biden wins, his vice president will
  have a huge national platform to define and expand her political
  brand, much as Mr. Biden did under Mr. Obama. This could put her in
  pole position to dominate the party's more moderate wing after Mr.
  Biden. Being No. 2 is a low-risk, high-reward position, particularly
  for someone who would be the first woman ever to hold the office.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ms. Rice once considered running against Senator Susan Collins of
  Maine. Now she's a candidate to be Mr. Biden's running mate. If she
  doesn't get chosen, she's still open to running for office ---
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/us/politics/susan-rice-biden-vice-president.html}{maybe
  even for Senate in Washington, D.C., if it becomes a state}.
\item
  Mr. Biden released the fourth piece of his ``Build Back Better''
  economic proposal,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/joe-biden-racial-justice-economy-plan.html}{an
  effort to show that racial justice is integral to his policy vision}.
  It promises to ``leverage more than \$150 billion in new capital and
  opportunities for small businesses that have been structurally
  excluded for generations.''
\item
  Mr. Trump faces several problems in Michigan, a state he carried in
  2016 by only 10,704 votes.
  \href{http://nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/politics/michigan-trump-biden-2020.html}{His
