# Robert Gnaizda, Lawyer Who Fought for Social Justice, Dies at 83

</div>

He challenged redlining banks, employers who discriminated in hiring
and, early in his career, Southern counties that thwarted Black voters.

Robert Gnaizda, a lawyer whose deft powers of persuasion in defending
the civil and economic rights of the poor and minority groups often
rendered messy and costly lawsuits against their adversaries a needless
last resort, died on July 11 in San Francisco. He was 83.

The cause was listed as a heart attack. His son Matthew said he had been
in declining health for some time.

Mr. Gnaizda (pronounced guh-NAYZ-duh) risked his life gathering evidence
in the South in the 1960s to help fight the intimidation that kept Black
citizens from registering and voting. He was also an advocate for farm
workers and the rural poor, fought discrimination in hiring by police
and fire departments, and [successfully challenged
banks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/04/14/business/14prosecute.html)
that victimized Black and Hispanic borrowers.

“Bob Gnaizda was, in my opinion, the most imaginative, creative and
consequential public interest lawyer of his generation in the United
States,” said J. Anthony Kline, presiding justice of the California
Court of Appeal in San Francisco, who, with Mr. Gnaizda and two other
lawyers, formed a pioneering public interest law firm in California in
1971.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The marginalized plaintiffs he represented “were devoted to him because
he incorporated them in strategic decision making and ensured they
received credit for victories,” Justice Kline said by email, and “the
respect he had from many of his adversaries enabled him to negotiate
settlements that became established progressive norms without the need
to engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation.”

Robert Leslie Gnaizda was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 6, 1936, to Sandra
(Ackerman) Gnaizda, the daughter of Russian and Polish immigrants, who
ran a commercial real estate business, and Samuel Gnaizda, a Jewish
immigrant from Russia, who became a pharmacist. He was raised in the
Brownsville section, then a gritty Jewish enclave, where he defended
vulnerable friends against neighborhood bullies and biked to Ebbets
Field to cheer on Jackie Robinson.

“Dodger fans had a reputation for being rude and rowdy,” his son Matt
said. “But 10-year-old Bob observed that the Black fans at the stadium
were extremely polite, well behaved and well dressed — unlike the other
fans. And this made him begin to question the common stereotypes.”

As a teenager he also worked in a job training program for Black
youngsters, Matt Gnaizda said. He added: “These experiences — plus the
discrimination he felt as a Jew — led him to see that there was
injustice in the world. And he wanted to do something about it.”

After graduating from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, Mr. Gnaizda
attended Columbia University, where he was so struck that his classmates
were almost all white and male that he was prompted to write an article
for the Columbia Daily Spectator, the student,

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I asked two questions: One related to women, the other related to Black
students,” he said in an interview with [Columbia College
Today](https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/latest/minds/talking-social-advocacy-robert-gnaizda-57-and-rebecca-kee-05),
an alumni publication, in 2018. “I wondered why a school at the edge of
Harlem had only one Black student per undergraduate class. And because
my own mother was outstanding at everything she did, I wondered why we
didn’t have any women. But the paper wouldn’t print it; they thought it
was too inflammatory.”

Mr. Gnaizda graduated from Columbia in 1957. He considered studying
medicine but decided to apply to law school at Harvard and Yale and
become a lawyer if he was admitted by either. He was accepted by both
and chose Yale. He earned his law degree in 1960.

Asked in the 2018 interview what drove him to abandon corporate law when
he was 28 to pursue a social justice agenda, he replied facetiously: “I
think boredom. I was a tax attorney, and the work didn’t interest me
much. I decided to go to Mississippi in early 1965, and there I realized
that I had some natural talents.”

By cultivating local white civic leaders in conversations that dealt as
much with baseball as with voting, he was able to gather enough evidence
during a public hearing on the disenfranchisement of Black people in
Clay County, Miss., to help propel passage of the 1965 Voting Rights
Act.

Mr. Gnaizda lived in San Francisco. In addition to his son Matthew, he
is survived by his wife, Claudia Viek; another son, Joshua; and a
granddaughter. His first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second,
to Ellen Eatough. (Both his sons are from that marriage.)

He founded California Rural Legal Assistance in 1966 and, five years
later, [Public Advocates](https://www.publicadvocates.org/), a firm that
defended underdogs, with Justice Kline, Sid Wolinsky and Peter Sitkin.
He also helped found the [Greenlining
Institute](https://greenlining.org/) in 1993 to discourage financial
institutions from discriminating against Black and Hispanic home buyers.
He was later general counsel for the [National Asian American
Coalition](https://www.naac.org/) and the [National Diversity
Coalition](https://www.nationaldiversitycoalition.org/).

Through those and other organizations, Mr. Gnaizda accused the Census
Bureau of undercounting Hispanic residents in 1970 and pressured the San
Francisco Police Department to hire more minority recruits in the 1970s.

He fought [redlining by
banks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html)
that refused to lend to residents of minority neighborhoods. He fostered
investment in those communities by leveraging the lenders’ lack of
public-spiritedness against them when they needed government permission
to merge with other banks.

From 1975 to 1976, he was deputy secretary of health and welfare for
Gov. Jerry Brown of California. [But years later, when Mr. Brown was
governor for a second time. Mr. Gnaizda didn’t hesitate to
sue](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/03/15/business/california-sued-over-diversion-of-money-from-national-mortgage-settlement.html)
him for diverting the proceeds the state received from lawsuits relating
to national mortgage fraud settlements. The state was eventually ordered
to repay the money.

Mr. Gnaizda was interviewed for the Oscar-winning documentary[“Inside
Job”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/10/08/movies/08inside.html)
(2010) about his efforts in the mid-2000s to warn the Federal Reserve of
the [impending subprime mortgage

His penchant for representing victims of bullying led him into some
unusual cases. There were, for example, the two 7-year-olds in
California who sued Pacific Bell Telephone in 1985 for failing to inform
them that they would incur a 50-cent charge every time they dialed a
[Santa
Claus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1985/03/28/us/around-the-nation-santa-claus-phone-line-brings-10-million-suit.html)
line. (He also founded a Giraffe Appreciation Society whose directors,
all children, paid tribute to the ruminants “who don’t do any harm and
who stick their necks out.”)

What distinguished Mr. Gnaizda as a zealous public interest lawyer, his
son Matt said, was that he “never saw the other side as evil; he saw
them as people who he disagreed with on certain issues, but could be
convinced to change their behavior.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Gnaizda agreed that many of his lawsuits were successful because he
didn’t force his opponents into a corner. “They were just on a different
side, and when they lost, they would usually keep their word,” he said
in the Columbia College Today interview

Rebecca Kee, who worked with Mr. Gnaizda at the National Diversity
Coalition, put it this way: “Bob will sue you, and somehow you’ll still
like him.”
