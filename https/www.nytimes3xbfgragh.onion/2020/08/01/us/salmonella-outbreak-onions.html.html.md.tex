More than 500 cases and at least 75 hospitalizations have been reported

Red onions grown in California have been traced as the potential source
of a salmonella outbreak that has infected more than 500 people in the
United States and Canada, health officials said.

Confirmed cases have surfaced in 34 states. Those most affected as of
Saturday included Oregon (71); Utah (61) and California (49),

Food and Drug Administration said}.

The Public Health Agency of Canada reported that the country had
\href{https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/public-health-notices/2020/outbreak-salmonella-infections-under-investigation.html}{114
cases of salmonella} and that at least 16 people had been hospitalized.
In the United States,
\href{https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-salmonella-newport-red-onions-july-2020?utm_campaign=OutbreakAlert_SalmonellaOnion_07312020\&utm_medium=email\&utm_source=Eloqua}{396
illnesses and 59 hospitalizations} have been reported, the F.D.A. said.

The administration said it was able to identify Thomson International, a
produce supplier in Bakersfield, Calif., as a likely source of
contaminated red onions.

Thomson said on Saturday that it recalled red, yellow, white and sweet
onions that were shipped since May 1 because of the risk of
contamination.

Onions were distributed to wholesalers, restaurants and retail stores
across the country and in Canada, Thomson said. They were also
distributed in mesh sacks and cartons under the names TII Premium, El
Competitor, Hartley, Onions 52, Imperial Fresh, Utah Onions and Food
Lion.

Health officials recommend that consumers throw away any onions or foods
made with onions supplied by Thomson, and in general throw away onions
if they were unsure of where they came from.

The illness, named salmonellosis, can persist for four to seven days,
the agency said. Children, older adults and people with weaker immune
systems are most at risk to develop severe illness.

Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Those who are
severely ill may also experience a high fever, headaches or a rash.

Salmonella
\href{https://www.fda.gov/food/foodborne-pathogens/salmonella-salmonellosis}{can
be spread} when the hands, surfaces and tools of food handlers are not
clean, and when people eat raw or undercooked food, health officials
said. It can also be spread to people from animals.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/}{estimates} that salmonella causes
about 1.35 million infections and 26,500 hospitalizations in the United
States each year. Although most people can recover without treatment,
more than 400 deaths in the United States each year can be tied to acute
salmonellosis.

Almost 1,000 cases of salmonella in 48 states have already been linked
this year to
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-20/index.html}{contact
with backyard poultry}, including chicks and ducklings, according to the
C.D.C.

At least 151 people have been hospitalized so far this year and one
person in Oklahoma has died. More than a quarter of those who have
become ill are younger than 5 years old.

In 2019,
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/javiana-12-19/index.html}{165 cases
of salmonella} in 14 states were caused by pre-cut fruit, like honeydew
melon, cantaloupe, pineapple and grapes, the C.D.C. said.
