As more schools abandon plans for in-person classes, one that opened in

One of the first school districts in the country to reopen its doors
during the coronavirus pandemic did not even make it a day before being
forced to grapple with the issue facing every system actively trying to
get students into classrooms: What happens when someone comes to school
infected?

Just hours into the first day of classes on Thursday, a call from the
county health department notified Greenfield Central Junior High School
in Indiana that a student who had walked the halls and sat in various
classrooms had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Administrators began an emergency protocol, isolating the student and
ordering everyone who had come into close contact with the person,
including other students, to quarantine for 14 days. It is unclear
whether the student infected anyone else.

“We knew it was a when, not if,” said Harold E. Olin, superintendent of
the Greenfield-Central Community School Corporation, but were “very
shocked it was on Day 1.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To avoid the same scenario, hundreds of districts across the country
that were once planning to reopen their classrooms, many on a part-time
basis, have [reversed
course](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html)
in recent weeks as infections have spiked in many states.

Those [that do still
reopen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html)
are having to prepare for the near-certain likelihood of quarantines and
abrupt shutdowns when students and staff members test positive.

Of the nation’s 25 largest school districts, all but six have announced
they will start remotely, although some in places like Florida and Texas
are hoping to open classrooms after a few weeks if infection rates go
down, [over strong objections from teachers’
unions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/teacher-union-school-reopening-coronavirus.html).

More than 80 percent of California residents live in counties where test
positivity rates and hospitalizations are too high for school buildings
to open under state rules issued last month. And schools in Alexandria,
Va., said on Friday that they would teach remotely, tipping the entire
Washington-Baltimore metro area, with more than one million children,
into virtual learning for the fall.

In March, when schools across America abruptly shuttered, it seemed
unimaginable that educators and students would not return to school come
fall, as they have in many other parts of the world. Now, with the virus
continuing to rage, tens of millions of students will start the year
remotely, and it has become increasingly clear that only a small
percentage of children are likely to see the inside of a school building
before the year ends.

“There’s no good answer,” Mark Henry, superintendent of the
Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District near Houston, [told
trustees](https://www.cfisd.net/en/board-trustees/board-meetings-agendas)
at a recent special meeting in which they voted to postpone the
district’s hybrid reopening until September. “If there was a good
answer, if there were an easy answer,” he said, “we would lay it out for
you and everybody would be happy.”

Anywhere that schools do reopen — outside of a portion of the Northeast
where the virus is largely under control — is likely to see positive
test results quickly, as in Indiana.

[A New York Times analysis
found](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html)
that in many districts in the Sun Belt, at least five people infected
with the coronavirus would be expected to arrive at a school of about
500 students and staff members during the first week if it reopened
today.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

To deal with that likelihood, many schools and some states have enacted
contact tracing and quarantine protocols, with differing thresholds at
which they would close classrooms or buildings.

Because of the low infection rate locally, New York City, the largest
district in the country, [plans to reopen schools on a hybrid model on
Sept. 10](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html),
with students attending in-person classes one to three days a week. Yet
even there, the system might have to quickly close if the citywide
infection rate ticks up even modestly.

On Friday, Mayor Bill de Blasio laid out a [plan for responding to
positive
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-177c5cda)
that would mean many of the city’s 1,800 public schools would most
likely have individual classrooms or even entire buildings closed at
certain points.

One or two confirmed cases in a single classroom would require those
classes to close for 14 days, with all students and staff members
ordered to quarantine. The rest of the school would continue to operate,
but if two or more people in different classrooms in the same school
tested positive, the entire building would close for an investigation,
and might not reopen for two weeks depending on the results.

In California, where schools in two-thirds of the state have been barred
from reopening in person for now, state guidelines call for a school to
close for at least 14 days if more than 5 percent of its students,
faculty and staff test positive over a two-week
period.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Chicago, the nation’s third-largest school district, has proposed a
hybrid system for reopening that would put students into 15-member pods
that can be quarantined if one member tests positive. School buildings
should close if the city averages more than 400 new cases a week or 200
cases a day, the plan states, with other worrying factors like low
hospital capacity or a sudden spike in cases taken into account.

In Indiana, where the middle school student tested positive on Thursday
in Greenfield, an Indianapolis suburb of 23,000 people, the virus began
to spike in mid-June, and the caseload has remained relatively high.
This week, Indianapolis opted to start the school year online.

The Greenfield-Central Community School Corporation, with eight schools
and 4,400 students, gave families [the option of in-person or remote
learning](https://www.gcsc.k12.in.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Greenfield-Central-School-Opening-Procedures-Final-7-8-2020.pdf).
At Greenfield Central Junior High School, which the student with the
positive test attends, about 15 percent of the 700 enrolled students
opted for remote learning, said Mr. Olin, the superintendent.

“It was overwhelming that our families wanted us to return,” he said,
adding that families needed to be responsible and not send students to
school if they were displaying symptoms or awaiting test results.
Students are also required to wear masks except when they are eating or
for physical education outside, he said — and as far as he knew, the
student who tested positive was doing so.

Anyone who was within six feet of the student for more than 15 minutes
on Thursday was instructed to isolate themselves for two weeks, Mr. Olin
said. He would not give a specific number of people who were affected at
the school, but he said no teachers or staff members were identified as
close contacts, and therefore none have been told to quarantine.

“It really doesn’t change my opinion about whether we should start or
not,” Mr. Olin said. “If we get down the road and realize that we need
to make some adjustments, we’re not opposed to that.”

He said that the district did not have a specific threshold for when it
would close a school, but that it would likely do so if absences reached
20 percent. The state has not provided specific guidance to schools on
when they should shut their doors, he said.

Some teachers in the district said the positive case on the first day
confirmed their fears about returning.

“I most definitely felt like we were not ready,” said Russell Wiley, a
history teacher at nearby Greenfield-Central High School. “Really, our
whole state’s not ready. We don’t have the virus under control. It’s
just kind of like pretending like it’s not there.”

One father whose daughter goes to the middle school with the positive
case said he felt conflicted about his three children attending classes
in person. Few people in the community are wearing masks, said the
father, who asked not to be named because he worried that his family
would face backlash.

“I have all these concerns,” the father said. But he has to commute at
least an hour to work every day, so remote learning was not a good
option for his family.

“It’s just a mess,” he said. “I don’t know what the answers are.”
