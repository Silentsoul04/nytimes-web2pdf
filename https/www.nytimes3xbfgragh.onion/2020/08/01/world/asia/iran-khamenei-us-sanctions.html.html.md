# Iran Will Expand Nuclear Program and Won’t Talk to U.S., Ayatollah Says

</div>

In a televised speech, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader,
said that negotiating with Washington over his country’s nuclear program
would only help President Trump get re-elected.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said in a televised
address that Iran will expand its nuclear program and will not negotiate
with the United States, doubling down on his defiance of the Trump
administration’s [“maximum pressure”
policy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/14/us/politics/us-iran.html).

In a Friday speech for the Eid al-Adha holiday, Ayatollah Khamenei said
that entering talks with Washington over Iran’s nuclear program, [as
President Trump has urged Tehran to
do](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear.html),
would only improve Mr. Trump’s chances of being re-elected in November.
That, the ayatollah said, was Mr. Trump’s reason for suggesting such
talks in the first place.

“He is going to benefit from negotiations,” Ayatollah Khamenei said.
“This old man who is in charge in America apparently used negotiations
with North Korea as propaganda,” he added — a reference to [Mr. Trump’s
high-profile nuclear
diplomacy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/19/world/asia/north-korea-denies-nice-note-trump.html)
on another front, which to date has been mostly fruitless.

Ayatollah Khamenei also said that Iran would maintain its close
alliances with [militia groups in the region that it uses as
proxies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/20/world/middleeast/iran-saudi-proxy-war.html),
defying another demand from the Trump administration.

The Iranian leader was not the first to connect the possibility of talks
with the United States to the presidential election. Last month, Mr.
Trump said on Twitter that Iran could make a better deal if it did so
before November. “Don’t wait until after U.S. Election to make the Big
deal,” [he
wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268774841810911232).
“I’m going to win. You’ll make a better deal now\!”

The United States has continued to tighten sanctions on Iran over its
nuclear program, which have had a crippling effect on the Middle Eastern
country’s economy. On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that
the State Department would expand the sanctions to cover 22 materials
believed to be used in Iran’s nuclear, military and ballistic missile
programs.

Ayatollah Khamenei said that Iran would not try to negotiate its way out
of the sanctions and that it would be better off relying on its own
industrial development. He said the Americans were targeting his
country’s economy in the hope that Iranians would rise up against
their government, which the ayatollah dismissed as “pipe dreams.”

Mr. Khamenei said that developing the nuclear program was an absolute
necessity for Iran’s future. He dismissed the 2015 nuclear deal between
Iran and several world powers, which Mr. Trump [abandoned
in 2018](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html),
as “very damaging,” saying that Iran had suffered economic setbacks
because of it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant exclusively for
peaceful purposes, but the United States and other countries believe it
is pursuing the capacity to build a nuclear weapon.

The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who was in charge of the
negotiations for Iran, said as recently as last month in Parliament that
the negotiating team had Ayatollah Khamenei’s full support and blessing
to reach a deal.

The ayatollah, who recently directed his closest economic advisers to
[cement a 25-year military and economic partnership with
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/world/asia/china-iran-trade-military-deal.html),
said in his speech that European countries involved in the nuclear deal
were unreliable, and that [their attempts to salvage the
pact](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/world/europe/europe-iran-nuclear-deal.html)
— such as creating a secure financial channel so that Iran could
maintain a limited amount of trade — were “useless games.”

Some Iranian officials and analysts have said that Iran’s strategy was
to wait out the remainder of Mr. Trump’s term in hopes of a Democratic
victory that could revive the deal, which was reached under President
Barack
Obama.

“Khamenei has always believed that accommodating to one U.S. demand
would bring about another demand and another,” said Sina Azodi, a
nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington. “For him,
every solution would bring about another problem.”

But analysts, entrepreneurs and businessmen inside Iran have warned that
the economy risks collapse if the current situation continues.

Since the United States pulled out of the nuclear deal in May 2018,
Iran’s currency has dropped sharply and inflation has surged. The
government said it faced a budget deficit of nearly 30 percent this
fiscal year. Oil sales have plummeted from 2.5 million barrels a day to
about 300,000, nearly eliminating Iran from the global crude oil market.
