Top officials work to break impasse over jobless benefit.

Hours after unemployment benefits for tens of millions of Americans
lapsed, administration officials arrived on Capitol Hill on Saturday
morning for a rare meeting with top congressional Democrats to discuss a
coronavirus relief package and work to break an impasse over new aid as
the American economy continues to shudder.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who hosted the meeting with Senator
Chuck Schumer of New York in her Capitol Hill suite, emerged after three
hours and said the discussion “was productive in terms of moving us
forward,” but they remained far apart on a number of issues. They
declined to offer specifics, but said that staff would meet on Sunday
and that the principal negotiators would again convene on Monday for
another meeting.

“Here we have this drastic challenge and what they were saying before,
is ‘we’re going to cut your benefit,” Ms. Pelosi said. “That’s, shall we
say, the discussions we’re having.”

“This is not a usual discussion, because the urgency is so great
healthwise, financial health-wise,” she added.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Also in attendance were Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff,
and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. (Mr. Mnuchin observed before
entering Ms. Pelosi’s suite that it was “just another working day in the
Capitol.”)

Among the largest sticking points in the discussion is a $600 weekly
federal jobless benefit that became a lifeline for tens of millions of
unemployed Americans, while also helping prop up the economy. The aid
expired at midnight as officials in Washington failed to agree on a new
relief bill, but Mr. Meadows and Mr. Mnuchin said there were signs that
the two sides could begin to reach common ground, including on reviving
a federal moratorium on evictions and funding for schools and child
care.

“There’s things we agree on. There’s things we don’t agree on,” Mr.
Mnuchin said after the meeting. “We’re trying to narrow down the things
we don’t agree on. Obviously any negotiation is a compromise.”

Joblessness remains at record levels, with some 30 million Americans
receiving unemployment benefits. More than 1.4 million [newly filed for
state unemployment benefits last
week](https://oui.doleta.gov/press/2020/073020.pdf) — the [19th straight
week that the tally had exceeded one
million,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)an
unheard-of figure before the pandemic.

Nearly 11 percent of Americans have said that they live in households
where there is not enough to eat, according to a [recent Census Bureau
survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html?utm_campaign=20200727mspuls1ccdtanl&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery),
and more than a quarter have missed a rent or mortgage payment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The benefit’s expiration will force Louise Francis, who worked as a
banquet cook at the Sheraton Hotel in New Orleans for nearly two decades
before being furloughed last spring,[to get by on just state
unemployment benefits, which for her come to $247 a
week.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)

“With the $600, you could see your way a little bit,” said Ms. Francis,
59. “You could feel a little more comfortable. You could pay three or
four bills and not feel so far behind.”

The aid lapsed as Republicans and Democrats in Washington [remained far
apart on what the next round of virus relief should look
like](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bills-house-senate.html).

Democrats wanted to extend the $600 weekly payments through the end of
the year, as part of an expansive $3 trillion aid package that would
also help state and local governments. Republicans, worried that the
$600 benefit left some people with more money than when they were
working, sought to scale it back to $200 per week as part of a $1
trillion proposal and have begun to push the prospect of doing a
short-term package that deals with just a few issues, including the
unemployment insurance benefit.

“They’ve made clear that there’s a desire on their part to do an entire
package,” Mr. Mnuchin said of Democrats. “We’ve made clear that we’re
really willing to deal with the short-term issues pass something quickly
and come back to the larger issues so we’re at an impasse on that.”

Democrats have rejected a short-term
proposal.

Across the United States, there is a deepening national sense that the
progress made in fighting the pandemic is coming undone and no patch of
the country is safe. Instead, the United States is riding a second wave
of cases, with the seven-day average for new infections hovering around
65,000 for two weeks.

Progress in some states has been mostly offset by growing outbreaks in
parts of the South and the Midwest — and in cities from Mississippi to
Florida to California that believed they had already experienced the
worst of it.

In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker sounded an unusually somber note this
past week as he delivered a warning that reverberated across the state:
Even though residents had battled an early flood of coronavirus
infections and then managed to reduce the virus’s spread, their
successes were fleeting. As of Thursday, the state was averaging more
than 1,400 cases a day, up from about 800 at the start of July.

“We’re at a danger point,” Mr. Pritzker said in Peoria County, where the
total number of cases has doubled in the last month.

Many states have traced new outbreaks to the loosening of the
economically costly restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of the
virus.

In California, which has had more than 500,000 coronavirus cases, more
than any other state, the reopening has proved disastrous. When the
pandemic was ravaging the Northeast in March and April, California kept
its daily case count around 2,000. The state is now averaging 8,500 a
day.

On Friday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease
expert, told Congress he was cautiously optimistic that a safe and
effective coronavirus vaccine would be available by the end of the year
or early 2021, though the federal government’s ability to speedily
immunize most Americans was unclear.

The Rio Grande Valley in Texas is suffering through perhaps the worst
current outbreak in the country, with hundreds of new cases and dozens
of deaths a day. In more than half of states, outbreaks continue to
grow. In Missouri and Oklahoma, cases have grown to alarming levels,
with both states now averaging more than 1,000 each day.

Across the country, deaths from the coronavirus also continue to rise.
The United States was averaging about 500 a day at the start of July.
Over the last week, it has averaged more than 1,000 daily, with many of
those concentrated in Sun Belt states.

Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, has been adjusting to a
new normal where the only thing certain is that nothing is certain.
After cases and hospitalizations seemed to level off and even decrease
in recent days, Harris County on Friday broke a single-day record with
2,100 new cases.

“I think to a certain extent, we saw a spike because people were
fatigued over it,” said Alan Rosen, who leads the Harris County Precinct
One constable’s office. “They were fatigued over hearing about it every
day. They were fatigued about being cooped up in their house and being
away from people.”

An estimated 17,000 Germans packed the heart of Berlin on Saturday,
defying public health requirements to maintain a safe distance from one
another, or cover their noses and faces, before Berlin police moved to
break up the demonstration against the country’s efforts to fight the
spread of coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The protest, under the motto “Day of Freedom” — a title shared by a 1935
Nazi propaganda film by Leni Reifenstahl — was supported by known
neo-Nazi groups and conspiracy theorists, along with Germans who say
they are fed up with the government-imposed restrictions on public life.
Germany enforced a strict lockdown from mid-March that has been lifted
in stages since the end of April, but large public gatherings are still
banned and requirements for wearing masks on public transportation and
in all stores remain.

A majority of Germans support the measures, but public health officials
worry that people are becoming more lax, as the past weeks have seen a
rise in new infections. On Saturday,
[955](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-08-01-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)
new cases were reported, compared with 580 two weeks ago.

Protesters at the demonstration blew whistles, heckled and jeered anyone
wearing a mask, and carried the red, white and black flag of the
19th-century German Empire. They also carried signs equating the
government-imposed restrictions to the Nazis’ forcing Jews to wear
yellow stars. One

One of the most important aspects of curtailing the spread of the virus
is understanding where people are being infected. This week the Maryland
Department of Health released new data from its contact tracing program
that provides an informative — if limited — view of the patterns of
behavior of people who tested positive.

The numbers do not show where virus transmission occurred — only what
activities people had engaged in. After conducting contact-tracing
interviews with people with the virus, the state found:

  - 44 percent had attended a family gathering.

  - 23 percent had attended a house party.

  - 23 percent had dined indoors at a restaurant.

  - 23 percent had dined outdoors at a restaurant.

  - 54 percent worked outside of the home.

  - 25 percent worked in health care.

The health department did not say how many patients were interviewed, or
when people had attended the events.

“I’m really excited to see that they’re putting data on this out,” said
Dr. Crystal Watson, an assistant professor in the department of
environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health. “But it’s a little hard to interpret.”

Dr. Watson said it would help to know if people had worn masks at the
family gatherings and practiced social distancing. She said she was
struck by the fact that only 12 percent of the people interviewed were
workers in the restaurant and food service industry, given the risks of
exposure.

Here are some other developments from around the United States:

  - The death toll in **Florida** surpassed 7,000 on Saturday after a
    surge in deaths in the state over the past week. Florida recorded
    257 deaths on Friday, a single-day record that also represented
    nearly one-fifth of all the deaths reported in the United States
    that day.

  - Three staffers and one player for **the St. Louis Cardinals**
    [tested
    positive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/sports/baseball/coronavirus-cardinals.html)
    for the virus, prompting the team to postpone a game on Saturday
    against the Milwaukee Brewers for the second day in a row. The team
    had announced that two other players tested positive on Friday.

    how rapidly the virus can tear through a small population. The camp
    of 600 people, which became the focus of a study by the Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention, began shutting down after nearly
    half of its campers and staff became infected within a week after it
    opened in June. The camp had observed some C.D.C. guidelines but did
    not require campers to wear masks.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, has tested
positive for the coronavirus three days after isolating because he came
into contact with another lawmaker who had contracted it.

Mr. Grijalva, who has no symptoms, is the 11th lawmaker to test
positive, according to a [tally maintained by
GovTrack](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govtrack.us%2Fcovid-19%23legislators).

It is unclear where he contracted the virus, but Mr. Grijalva has been
in self-isolation since Wednesday, when Representative Louie Gohmert, a
Texas Republican who has frequently spurned wearing a mask during the
pandemic, said [he had tested
positive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/politics/louie-gohmert-positive-coronavirus-mask.html).
Mr. Grijalva said he had had extended contact with Mr. Gohmert during a
congressional hearing held by the Natural Resources Committee, the panel
that he leads.

“While I cannot blame anyone directly for this, this week has shown that
there are some members of Congress who fail to take this crisis
seriously,” Mr. Grijalva, 72, said in a statement on Saturday, in what
appeared to be a veiled reference to Mr. Gohmert. “Numerous Republican
members routinely strut around the Capitol without a mask to selfishly
make a political statement at the expense of their colleagues, staff,
and their families.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokesman for Mr. Grijalva said he would quarantine for two weeks in
Washington, and some of the representative’s staff would also be tested.

Mr. Grijalva’s diagnosis comes as lawmakers — and the many aides and
staff members who shuttle in and out of the Capitol daily — are
grappling with [the lack of consistent
procedures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/gohmert-coronavirus-congress.html)
for protecting one another. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, have so far
rejected enforcing a rapid-test system for Capitol Hill [similar to the
one used at the White
House](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/us/politics/coronavirus-testing-senate-white-house.html),
particularly given testing shortages and delays around the country.

In addition to the lawmakers who have tested positive, the virus has
spread among the workers who quietly power the Capitol. At least 27
Capitol Police employees, 33 contractors on a construction site and 25
employees of the Architect of the Capitol have tested positive, and
dozens more have entered voluntary isolation because of exposure,
according to a tally from Republicans on the House Administration
Committee.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The leader of a secretive religious sect in South Korea was arrested
early on Saturday on charges of embezzling church money and conspiring
to impede efforts to fight the coronavirus.

The rapid spread of the virus this winter among worshipers of the
Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, a city in the southeast, briefly
made South Korea home to the world’s largest coronavirus outbreak
outside China. As of Friday, more than a third of the 14,300 coronavirus
cases known to the government were members of Shincheonji or their
contacts.

Prosecutors say that [Lee
Man-hee,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-shincheonji.html?searchResultPosition=1)
the church’s founder, failed to fully disclose the number of worshipers
and their gathering places. Seven church officials were indicted last
month on the same charge.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Lee, 88, has also been accused of embezzling 5.6 billion won, or
$4.7 million, from church funds to build a luxurious “peace palace”
north of Seoul. The church has broadly denied all the charges against
him. He could face years in prison if convicted.

Intense criticism from the South Korean public [forced Mr. Lee to
apologize](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-shincheonji.html)
in March.

In a statement on Saturday, the church said that Mr. Lee had never
intended to hamper efforts to control the epidemic, and that he had only
expressed concern over the scale of government demands for worshipers’
data.

“He has emphasized the importance of disease control and urged the
church members to cooperate with the authorities,” the church said. “We
will do our best to let the truth be known through trial.”

But parents who accused the church of luring and brainwashing their
children with its unorthodox teachings welcomed his arrest on Saturday,
calling Mr. Lee a “religious con artist.”

Here are some other developments from around the globe:

  - **Kuwait** on Saturday began to resume some commercial flights after
    a five-month suspension. It announced that flights would remain
    suspended from 31 countries, including India, China and Brazil.
    Flights are also still barred from some countries that were once
    major hot spots, such as Spain and Italy, but not the United States,
    which remains a global epicenter. Kuwait, with its relatively small
    population, has one of the highest infection rates in the world. Its
    1,618 cases per 100,000 people is the sixth highest globally,
    according to a New York Times database.

  - Prime Minister Boris Johnson of **Britain** announced that lockdown
    measures that were set to be lifted Saturday would continue for two
    more weeks, as case numbers in the country rise. Restrictions remain
    on indoor performances, casinos, wedding receptions and other
    gatherings, which Mr. Johnson said he knew would come as a “real
    blow” to some people. But it was necessary to apply the “break
    pedal,” he said, in order to stem the spread of the virus.

  - In **Vietnam**, the city of Danang plans to test its entire
    population for the coronavirus, local authorities said, after dozens
    of cases there showed how the disease can stalk even places that
    were thought to have eradicated the virus. As the country went more
    than three months without reporting any local transmission or even a
    single death from the virus, up to 800,000 domestic tourists flocked
    to Danang, a coastal city known for its golden beaches. Vietnam has
    now recorded three deaths and 558 cases, although many are returnees
    in quarantine.

  - As of Saturday morning, **Mexico**’s confirmed death toll **** of
    46,688 was [the world’s third
    highest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/americas/mexico-coronavirus-cases.html)

    fourth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html),
    with 569 fewer deaths. The number of new reported infections in
    Mexico has been climbing since May and topped 8,000 on Friday,
    bringing the country’s caseload to nearly 425,000.

One of the first school districts in the United States to reopen did not

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Preparations for the storm were complicated by the state’s battle with
the coronavirus, which could make evacuating homes and entering
community shelters especially risky. Friday was the third consecutive
day that Florida set its record for the most deaths reported in a single
day, according to a New York Times database.

Mr. DeSantis has said that the division of emergency management had been
working at [its most active
level](https://www.floridadisaster.org/sert/eoc-activation-levels/)
since March, “allowing them to actively plan for hurricane season even
while responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

Early in the pandemic, he added, the division created a reserve of
protective equipment for hurricane season, including 20 million masks,
22 million gloves and 1.6 million face shields.

Forecasters said Saturday that the storm’s projected path had shifted
slightly eastward, and could potentially make landfall over Palm Beach,
Jacksonville and other coastal cities in the hurricane’s possible path.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency offered federal disaster
assistance to the state on Saturday, a move approved by President Trump,
the agency announced in a statement.

Mr. DeSantis [said on
Saturday](https://www.wesh.com/article/florida-state-of-emergency-isaias/33482430)

New York colleges scramble to comply with state quarantine rules.

Colleges and universities across New York are enacting hasty plans to
meet state requirements for students arriving from out of state as the
fall semester nears.

With many schools poised to begin in-person instruction in just one
month, some of the state’s larger institutions have been forced to put
together complex plans to house students from regions currently fighting
major coronavirus outbreaks.

Plans for letting students back on campus revolve around [an order made
by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in
June](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-states-quarantine.html)
requiring travelers to New York from high-risk parts of the United
States to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. As of Saturday, residents
of 36 states and territories would face the mandatory quarantine, based
on trends in infection data.

Cornell, which had previously pledged to provide quarantine
accommodations on campus to students coming from states identified by
the order, [announced on
Thursday](https://covid.cornell.edu/updates/20200730-important-updates.cfm)
that it would no longer offer housing to all students affected. The
announcement said that those who could not meet the requirements should
plan to begin the semester through online classes, but that the
university would assist students for whom making housing arrangements
represented a significant hardship.

Critics said the announcement [would force some
students](https://cornellsun.com/2020/07/31/editorial-cornells-inability-to-quarantine-arriving-students-should-concern-you/)
to find space in hotels or short-term rentals just two weeks before they
were scheduled to arrive.

Most colleges have advised students they will be unable to leave their
rooms during quarantines and will face regular medical screenings.
Columbia University [said](https://roomselection.housing.columbia.edu/)
it would arrange to have meals delivered to dormitories, according to
its website.

Since the list of states identified by the governor’s order is informed
by seven-day rolling averages of new infections, new outbreaks in
previously stable states could still force students to make last-minute
travel and housing arrangements to quarantine before classes begin.

Since the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh closed liquor stores
as part of lockdown restrictions about two weeks ago, at least 10 people
have died after consuming alcohol-based hand sanitizer, the police said.

The Indian government started easing a national lockdown in late May.
But many states have reimposed some restrictions, including Andra
Pradesh, where nearly 50,000 new coronavirus cases [have been reported
in the last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html#cases).

India recorded 57,118 coronavirus infections on Saturday, the country’s
health ministry said, bringing its total to 1.7 million. More than
36,000 people have died.

The police in the state said some people who lost access to legal liquor
started mixing cheap hand sanitizer with water from roadside taps, soft
drinks and milk. The 10 deaths have occurred in the last three days,
mostly among poor residents.

In the town of Kurichedu, a man begging at a temple complained of a
burning sensation in his stomach, and died as he was being taken to a
hospital. Then the number of people complaining of a burning sensation
in their stomach started rising, the police said.

“All of them died after consuming sanitizer,” said Siddharth Kaushal,
the district’s top police officer. “We are wondering who told these
people that a sanitizer can get them high.”

Hundreds die each year in India from consuming poisonous [homemade
alcohol](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/11/world/asia/india-toxic-alcohol.html).
In 2015, [at least 100
people](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33224514) in a
Mumbai-area slum were killed, and in 2008, in one of the largest such

people](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/TN-hooch-tragedy-21-cops-suspended/articleshow/3159848.cms?referral=PM)
died after drinking an illicit home brew in slum areas of Karnataka and
Tamil Nadu.

After India’s strict national lockdown lifted in May, reopened liquor
stores were swamped with so many customers that the [police in some
cities had to control the
crowds](https://news.yahoo.com/chaos-outside-liquor-stores-india-eases-virus-lockdown-112326078.html),
according to Agence France-Presse.

The Food and Drug Administration has authorized the first coronavirus
tests that can give an estimate of the quantity of antibodies present in
a person’s blood, the agency
[announced<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Friday
evening](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-tests-estimate-patients-antibodies-past-sars-cov-2).

Up until now, the so-called serology tests on the market, also known as
antibody tests, only indicate whether [Covid-19 antibodies are present
in the
blood](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/health/coronvirus-antibody-tests.html),
indicating that at some point in the past, the individual had been
exposed to the virus.

Many antibody tests [are
unreliable](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html).
The F.D.A. has had to chase after some manufacturers and distributors to
get them off the market. There is not yet a scientific consensus as to
what level of antibodies are needed to confer immunity, or how long such
immunity might last.

The two new Covid-19 serology tests, the ADVIA Centaur COV2G and
Attelica COV2G, are from Siemens.

Dr. Timothy Stenzel, the director of the F.D.A.’s Office of In Vitro
Diagnostics and Radiological Health, said in a statement, “Being able to
measure a patient’s relative level of antibodies in response to a
previous SARS-CoV-2 infection may be useful as we continue to learn more
about the virus and what the existence of antibodies may mean.”

“There are still many unknowns about what the presence of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies may tell us about potential immunity, but today’s
authorizations give us additional tools to evaluate those antibodies as
we continue to research and study this virus.
