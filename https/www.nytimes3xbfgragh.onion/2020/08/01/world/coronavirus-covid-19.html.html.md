# Infections Swamp the U.S., Which Recorded 42% of All Its Coronavirus Cases in July

</div>

Thousands in Berlin protest Germany’s coronavirus measures. The virus is
picking up speed in the Midwest. A summer camp in Georgia apologizes for
hosting a retreat after hundreds who attended were infected.

## The U.S. reels as July cases more than double the total of any other month.

The United States recorded more than 1.9 million new infections in July,
nearly 42 percent of the more than 4.5 million cases reported nationwide
since the pandemic began and more than double the number documented in
any other month, according to [data compiled by The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#map).
The previous monthly high came in April, when more than 880,000 new
cases were recorded.

The virus is picking up dangerous speed in much of the Midwest — and in
states from Mississippi to Florida to California that thought they had
already seen the worst of it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gone is any sense that the country may soon get ahold of the pandemic.
The seven-day average for daily new infections has hovered around 65,000
for the past two weeks, more than doubling the peak average from the
spring, when the country experienced what was essentially its first
wave.

In many states, distressed government officials are re-tightening
restrictions on residents and businesses, and sounding warnings about a
rise in virus-related hospitalizations.

Across the country, deaths from the virus continued to rise after a
steep drop from the mid-April peaks of about 2,200 a day. At the start
of July, the average death toll was about 500 per day. Over the last
week, it has averaged more than 1,000 daily, with many of those
concentrated in Sun Belt states.

The Northeast, once the virus’s biggest hot spot, has improved
considerably since its peak in April. Yet cases are now increasing
slightly in New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, as residents
move around more freely and gather more frequently in groups.

The picture is similarly distressing overseas, where even governments
that would seem well suited to combating the virus are seeing surges.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New daily infections in Japan, a country with a long tradition of
wearing face masks, rose more than 50 percent in July. Australia, which
can cut itself off from the rest of the world more easily than most, is
battling a wave of infections in and around Melbourne. Hong Kong, Israel
and Spain are also fighting second waves.

None of those places has an infection rate as high as the one in the
United States, which has the most cases and deaths in the
world.

Hours after unemployment benefits for tens of millions of Americans
lapsed, administration officials arrived on Capitol Hill on Saturday
morning for a rare meeting with top congressional Democrats to discuss a
coronavirus relief package and work to break an impasse over new aid as
the American economy continues to shudder.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who hosted the meeting with Senator
Chuck Schumer of New York in her Capitol Hill suite, emerged after three
hours and said the discussion “was productive in terms of moving us
forward,” but they remained far apart on a number of issues. They
declined to offer specifics, but said that staff would meet on Sunday
and that the principal negotiators would again convene on Monday for
another meeting.

“Here we have this drastic challenge and what they were saying before
is, ‘We’re going to cut your benefit,” Ms. Pelosi said. “That’s, shall
we say, the discussions we’re having.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is not a usual discussion, because the urgency is so great
healthwise, financial health-wise,” she added.

Also in attendance were Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff,
and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. (Mr. Mnuchin observed before
entering Ms. Pelosi’s suite that it was “just another working day in the
Capitol.”)

Among the largest sticking points in the discussion is a $600 weekly
federal jobless benefit that became a lifeline for tens of millions of
unemployed Americans, while also helping prop up the economy. The aid
expired at midnight as officials in Washington failed to agree on a new
relief bill, but Mr. Meadows and Mr. Mnuchin said there were signs that
the two sides could begin to reach common ground, including on reviving
a federal moratorium on evictions and funding for schools and child
care.

“There’s things we agree on. There’s things we don’t agree on,” Mr.
Mnuchin said after the meeting. “We’re trying to narrow down the things
we don’t agree on. Obviously any negotiation is a compromise.”

Joblessness remains at record levels, with some 30 million Americans
receiving unemployment benefits. More than 1.4 million [newly filed for
state unemployment benefits last
week](https://oui.doleta.gov/press/2020/073020.pdf) — the [19th straight
week that the tally had exceeded one
million,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)an
unheard-of figure before the pandemic.

Nearly 11 percent of Americans have said that they live in households
where there is not enough to eat, according to a [recent Census Bureau
survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html?utm_campaign=20200727mspuls1ccdtanl&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery),
and more than a quarter have missed a rent or mortgage payment.

The benefit’s expiration will force Louise Francis, who worked as a
banquet cook at the Sheraton Hotel in New Orleans for nearly two decades
before being furloughed last spring,[to get by on just state
unemployment benefits, which for her come to $247 a
week.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“With the $600, you could see your way a little bit,” said Ms. Francis,
59. “You could feel a little more comfortable. You could pay three or
four bills and not feel so far behind.”

The aid lapsed as Republicans and Democrats in Washington [remained far
apart on what the next round of virus relief should look
like](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bills-house-senate.html).

Democrats wanted to extend the $600 weekly payments through the end of
the year, as part of an expansive $3 trillion aid package that would
also help state and local governments. Republicans, worried that the
$600 benefit left some people with more money than when they were
working, sought to scale it back to $200 per week as part of a $1
trillion proposal and have begun to push the prospect of doing a
short-term package that deals with just a few issues, including the
unemployment insurance benefit.

“They’ve made clear that there’s a desire on their part to do an entire
package,” Mr. Mnuchin said of Democrats. “We’ve made clear that we’re
really willing to deal with the short-term issues, pass something
quickly and come back to the larger issues so we’re at an impasse on
that.”

Democrats have rejected a short-term
proposal.

on Sunday in an effort to stem an outbreak that is still raging despite
a lockdown that began four weeks ago.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For six weeks starting Sunday, residents of metropolitan Melbourne will
be under curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. except for purposes of work or
giving and receiving care.

As under the current lockdown, acceptable reasons for leaving the house
include shopping for essential goods and services, medical care and
caregiving, and necessary exercise, work and study. But food shopping is
now limited to one person per household per day and outdoor exercise is
limited to one hour per person per day, both within five kilometers of
home. Public gatherings are limited to two people, including household
members.

In explaining the new measures, Premier Daniel Andrews said that the
high rate of community transmission, including 671 new cases reported in
the state of Victoria on Sunday, suggested the virus was even more
widespread than known.

“You’ve got to err on the side of caution and go further and go harder,”
he said.

Less stringent restrictions are being introduced in the rest of the
state starting at midnight on Wednesday, and further measures regarding
businesses will be announced on Monday.

Victoria has had a total of 11,557 cases, almost all of them in
metropolitan Melbourne, and 123 deaths.

An estimated 17,000 Germans packed the heart of Berlin on Saturday,
defying public health requirements to maintain a safe distance from one
another, or cover their noses and faces, before Berlin police moved to
break up the demonstration against the country’s efforts to fight the
spread of coronavirus.

The protest, under the motto “Day of Freedom” — a title shared by a 1935
Nazi propaganda film by Leni Riefenstahl — was supported by known
neo-Nazi groups and conspiracy theorists, along with Germans who say
they are fed up with the government-imposed restrictions on public life.
Germany enforced a strict lockdown from mid-March that has been lifted
in stages since the end of April, but large public gatherings are still
banned and requirements for wearing masks on public transportation and
in all stores remain.

A majority of Germans support the measures, but public health officials
worry that people are becoming more lax, as the past weeks have seen a
rise in new infections. On Saturday,
[955](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-08-01-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)
new cases were reported, compared with 580 two weeks ago.

Protesters at the demonstration blew whistles, heckled and jeered anyone
wearing a mask, and carried the red, white and black flag of the
19th-century German Empire. They also carried signs equating the
government-imposed restrictions to the Nazis’ forcing Jews to wear
yellow stars. One

emblazoned with images of Chancellor Angela Merkel, her health minister
and leading German public health officials, as well as Bill Gates,
demanded: “Lock Them Up Already\!”

Here are some other developments from around the globe:

  - **South Africa** on Saturday surpassed 500,000 coronavirus
    infections, [according to Johns Hopkins University and
    Medicine](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), fifth most in the
    world. More than 10,100 new cases had been recorded, [South Africa’s
    Department of Health
    said](https://twitter.com/HealthZA/status/1289655436455510016),
    adding virus-related deaths had risen to 8,153. South Africa in
    March quickly became[Africa’s first
    epicenter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus.html)
    and the first country on the continent to impose a severe lockdown,
    restricting travel between provinces.

  - **Belgium** on Saturday
    [announced](https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/news/the-number-of-confirmed-cases-of-covid-19-has-doubled-in-one-week/)
    that its number of confirmed coronavirus infections had doubled in
    one week. On average about 448 people per day tested positive from
    July 22 to July 28, the Belgian health authorities said. The city of
    Antwerp was of particular concern, officials said.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Kuwait** on Saturday began to resume some commercial flights after
    a five-month suspension. It announced that flights would remain
    suspended from 31 countries, including India, China and Brazil.
    Flights are also still barred from some countries that were once
    major hot spots, such as Spain and Italy, but not the United States,
    which remains a global epicenter. Kuwait, with its relatively small
    population, has one of the highest infection rates in the world. Its
    1,618 cases per 100,000 people is the sixth highest globally,
    according to a New York Times database.

  - Prime Minister Boris Johnson of **Britain** announced that lockdown
    measures that were set to be lifted Saturday would continue for two
    more weeks, as case numbers in the country rise. Restrictions remain
    on indoor performances, casinos, wedding receptions and other
    gatherings, which Mr. Johnson said he knew would come as a “real
    blow” to some people. But it was necessary to apply the “brake
    pedal,” he said, in order to stem the spread of the virus.

  - In **Vietnam**, the city of Danang plans to test its entire
    population for the coronavirus, the local authorities said, after
    dozens of cases there showed how the disease can stalk even places
    that were thought to have eradicated the virus. As the country went
    more than three months without reporting any local transmission or
    even a single death from the virus, up to 800,000 domestic tourists
    flocked to Danang, a coastal city known for its golden beaches.
    Vietnam has now recorded three deaths and almost 600 cases, although
    many are returnees in quarantine.

  - As of Saturday night, **Mexico**’s confirmed death toll **** of
    47,472 was [the world’s third
    highest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/americas/mexico-coronavirus-cases.html)
    behind the United States and Brazil. [Britain ranked
    fourth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html),
    with 495 fewer deaths. The number of new reported infections in
    Mexico has been climbing since May and topped 9,000 for the first
    time on Saturday, bringing the country’s caseload to nearly 435,000.

<!-- end list -->

  - Officials in **Poland** are considering new lockdown restrictions
    after the country reported record numbers of new coronavirus cases
    for three days in a row. The health minister [told a local radio
    station](https://news.yahoo.com/poland-reports-record-rise-virus-090641415.html)
    this could include reducing the number of people allowed to attend
    weddings, according to Reuters. The country [has reported 46,346
    total cases and 3,650
    deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries).

  - Thirty-six crew members aboard **a Norwegian cruise ship** tested
    positive for the virus, Hurtigruten, the ship’s operator, [said in a
    statement over the
    weekend](https://presse.hurtigruten.no/pressreleases/33-hurtigruten-crew-members-tested-positive-for-covid-19-3024215).
    None of those who tested positive showed any symptoms, the statement
    said. According to the company, 387 guests who may have been exposed
    to infected crew members during two trips on the ship in July will
    self-quarantine in accordance with Norway’s public health
    regulations.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, has tested
positive for the coronavirus three days after isolating because he came
into contact with another lawmaker who had contracted it.

Mr. Grijalva, who has no symptoms, is the 11th lawmaker to test
positive, according to a [tally maintained by
GovTrack](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govtrack.us%2Fcovid-19%23legislators).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is unclear where he contracted the virus, but Mr. Grijalva has been
in self-isolation since Wednesday, when Representative Louie Gohmert, a
Texas Republican who has frequently spurned wearing a mask during the
pandemic, said [he had tested
positive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/politics/louie-gohmert-positive-coronavirus-mask.html).
Mr. Grijalva said he had had extended contact with Mr. Gohmert during a
congressional hearing held by the Natural Resources Committee, the panel
that he leads.

“While I cannot blame anyone directly for this, this week has shown that
there are some members of Congress who fail to take this crisis
seriously,” Mr. Grijalva, 72, said in a statement on Saturday, in what
appeared to be a veiled reference to Mr. Gohmert. “Numerous Republican
members routinely strut around the Capitol without a mask to selfishly
make a political statement at the expense of their colleagues, staff,
and their families.”

A spokesman for Mr. Grijalva said he would quarantine for two weeks in
Washington, and some of the representative’s staff would also be tested.

Mr. Grijalva’s diagnosis comes as lawmakers — and the many aides and
staff members who shuttle in and out of the Capitol daily — are
grappling with [the lack of consistent
procedures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/gohmert-coronavirus-congress.html)
for protecting one another. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, have so far
rejected enforcing a rapid-test system for Capitol Hill [similar to the
one used at the White
House](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/us/politics/coronavirus-testing-senate-white-house.html),
particularly given testing shortages and delays around the country.

In addition to the lawmakers who have tested positive, the virus has
spread among the workers who quietly power the Capitol. At least 27
Capitol Police employees, 33 contractors on a construction site and 25
employees of the Architect of the Capitol have tested positive, and
dozens more have entered voluntary isolation because of exposure,
according to a tally from Republicans on the House Administration
Committee.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The state’s battle with the virus could make evacuating homes and
entering community shelters especially risky. Friday was the third
consecutive day that Florida broke its record for the most deaths
reported in a single day, according to a New York Times database.

Floridians spent Saturday preparing for wind gusts up to 80 miles per
hour and dangerous coastal surf.

The storm was downgraded from a Category 1 hurricane to a tropical
storm, after it [raked parts of Puerto
Rico](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/hurricane-isaias.html)
and the Dominican Republic and battered the Bahamas. State officials
said Isaias would probably regain its strength as the evening
progressed. “Don’t be fooled by the downgrade,” warned Gov. Ron DeSantis
at a news conference.

Mr. DeSantis said that the division of emergency management had been
working at [its most active
level](https://www.floridadisaster.org/sert/eoc-activation-levels/)
since March, “allowing them to actively plan for hurricane season even
while responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

Early in the pandemic, he added, the division created a reserve of
protective equipment for hurricane season, including 20 million masks,
22 million gloves and 1.6 million face shields.

Forecasters said Saturday that the storm’s projected path had shifted
slightly eastward, and that the storm could potentially make landfall
over Palm Beach, Jacksonville and other coastal cities.

Up the coast, officials in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina —
states where there has been a dramatic rise in new reported coronavirus
cases since mid-June — were closely monitoring the storm.

Branden Grace wasn’t feeling well on Friday night, after the second
round of the Barracuda Championship in Truckee, Calif., so he contacted
PGA Tour officials and arranged to be tested for the coronavirus on
Saturday morning.

When the test came back positive, Grace had to withdraw from the
tournament while he was tied for second place.

“Given my position on the leaderboard it was a difficult decision, but
nonetheless, the correct one for my fellow competitors & the
volunteers,” Grace, a 32-year-old South African who has won one event
in his career on the tour, wrote in a statement [he posted on

withdraw](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/sports/golf/pga-golfer-positive-tests.html)

positive.

The disruption, however, has not been nearly as broad as the one in

which on Saturday announced four more positive tests among members of

members — and postponed the team’s weekend series with the Milwaukee
Brewers.

The Cardinals, who also had two players receive positive tests on
Friday, now have six positives in their traveling party and have become
the second team, after the Miami Marlins, to experience an outbreak less
than two weeks into the truncated M.L.B. season. The Marlins have had 20
people, including 18 players, test positive since last Sunday.

And the Boston Red Sox announced that starting pitcher Eduardo
Rodriguez, 27, who had been infected before the start of the season,
will not play this year after developing myocarditis, or inflammation of

## The YMCA in Georgia apologizes for hosting a summer camp after hundreds who attended were infected.

The hosts of a summer camp in Georgia said over the weekend that they
regretted hosting the lakeside retreat in June, after health officials
said more than three-quarters of tested campers and staffers had been
infected.

The virus [quickly spread
through](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/health/coronavirus-children-camp.html)
Camp High Harbour, which is run by the YMCA of Metropolitan Atlanta, in
June, after a teenage counselor got chills and later tested positive.
The camp began sending children home the next day, and shut down not
long after, but at that point, about 260 campers and staff members had
already been infected, according to a[report issued
Friday](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6931e1.htm?s_cid=mm6931e1_w)
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report said that
the C.D.C. had data for 344 campers and staffers who were tested, and
that there were about 250 more whose data the C.D.C. did not have.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.D.C. did not name the camp, but the YMCA of Metropolitan Atlanta
soon acknowledged that it was Camp High Harbour, which is held in
northern Georgia.

Parrish Underwood, the YMCA branch’s chief advancement officer, said the
YMCA had hosted the camp at the request of some parents who hoped it
would allow for “normalcy” in their children’s lives.

“This weighed heavily in our decision to open, a decision in retrospect
we now regret,” Mr. Underwood said in a statement.

All campers passed screenings of some kind, he said, and the counselor

One of the most important aspects of curtailing the spread of the virus
is understanding where people are being infected. This week the Maryland
Department of Health released new data from its contact-tracing program
that provides an informative — if limited — view of the patterns of
behavior of people who tested positive.

The numbers do not show where virus transmission occurred — only what
activities people had engaged in. After conducting contact-tracing
interviews with people with the virus, the state found:

  - 44 percent had attended a family gathering.

  - 23 percent had attended a house party.

  - 23 percent had dined indoors at a restaurant.

  - 23 percent had dined outdoors at a restaurant.

  - 54 percent worked outside the home.

  - 25 percent worked in health care.

The health department did not say how many patients were interviewed, or
when people had attended the events.

“I’m really excited to see that they’re putting data on this out,” said
Dr. Crystal Watson, an assistant professor in the department of
environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health. “But it’s a little hard to interpret.”

Dr. Watson said it would help to know if people had worn masks at the
family gatherings and practiced social distancing. She said she was
struck by the fact that only 12 percent of the people interviewed were
workers in the restaurant and food service industry, given the risks of
exposure.

Here are some other developments from around the United States:

  - The cumulative death toll in **Florida** surpassed 7,000 on Saturday
    after a surge in deaths in the state over the past week. Florida
    recorded 257 deaths on Friday, a single-day record that also
    represented nearly one-fifth of all the deaths reported in the
    United States that day.

  - Three staffers and one player for **the St. Louis Cardinals**
    [tested
    positive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/sports/baseball/coronavirus-cardinals.html)
    for the virus, prompting the team to postpone a game on Saturday
    against the Milwaukee Brewers for the second day in a row. The team
    had announced that two other players tested positive on Friday.

  - Single-day records for cases were reported in Oklahoma and Puerto
    Rico, each with over 1,000.

  - The Navajo Nation Council [passed a $651 million
    bill](https://apnews.com/d8322c62b4f30f5c92ad234bb1f575e0https://apnews.com/d8322c62b4f30f5c92ad234bb1f575e0)
    responding to the economic crisis created by the pandemic. The bill
    includes funding for water projects, power lines, broadband and
    casino employees who have been laid off. The funding for the bill
    comes from the Navajo Nation’s share of $8 billion in federal
    coronavirus relief funding that was designated for tribes. [The
    situation has been stark in the Navajo
    Nation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-navajo-nation.html),
    where high infection rates have created a crisis in the largest
    reservation in the United
States.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Mr. Poonawalla’s vaccine assembly lines are being readied to crank out
500 doses a minute, and his phone rings endlessly.

National health ministers, prime ministers and other heads of state (he
wouldn’t say who) and friends he hasn’t heard from in years have been
calling him, he said, begging for the first batches.

“I’ve had to explain to them that, ‘Look I can’t just give it to you
like this,’” he said.

The Serum Institute finds itself in the middle of an extremely
competitive and murky endeavor. To get the vaccine out as soon as
possible, vaccine developers say they need Serum’s mammoth assembly
lines — each year, it churns out 1.5 billion doses of other vaccines,
mostly for poor countries, more than any other company.

Half of the world’s children have been vaccinated with Serum’s products.
Scale is its specialty. Just the other day, Mr. Poonawalla received a
shipment of 600 million glass vials.

But right now it’s not entirely clear how much of the coronavirus
vaccine that Serum will mass-produce will be kept by India or who will
fund its
production.

The leader of a secretive religious sect in South Korea was arrested
early on Saturday on charges of embezzling church money and conspiring
to impede efforts to fight the coronavirus.

The rapid spread of the virus this winter among worshipers of the
Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, a city in the southeast, briefly
made South Korea home to the world’s largest coronavirus outbreak
outside China. As of Friday, more than a third of the 14,300 coronavirus
cases known to the government were members of Shincheonji or their
contacts.

Prosecutors say that [Lee
Man-hee,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-shincheonji.html?searchResultPosition=1)
the church’s founder, failed to fully disclose the number of worshipers
and their gathering places. Seven church officials were indicted last
month on the same charge.

Mr. Lee, 88, has also been accused of embezzling 5.6 billion won, or
$4.7 million, from church funds to build a luxurious “peace palace”
north of Seoul. The church has broadly denied all the charges against
him. He could face years in prison if convicted.

Intense criticism from the South Korean public [forced Mr. Lee to
apologize](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-shincheonji.html)
in March.

In a statement on Saturday, the church said that Mr. Lee had never
intended to hamper efforts to control the epidemic, and that he had only
expressed concern over the scale of government demands for worshipers’
data.

“He has emphasized the importance of disease control and urged the
church members to cooperate with the authorities,” the church said. “We
will do our best to let the truth be known through trial.”

artist.”

Europe has a bad reputation with investors. For years, asset managers
and bank strategists have characterized the region by its [anemic growth
rate](https://qz.com/1544961/the-euro-zone-economy-is-back-on-familiar-ground-slow-grinding-growth/)
and shaky political union.

Now a crisis has turned into an unlikely investment opportunity, as the
region appears to have handled the pandemic better than some other parts
of the world. In the past few months, [European assets have staged a
comeback](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/europes-markets-are-having-a-moment.html).

The euro this week rose to its highest level in more than two years
against the U.S. dollar, and the region’s benchmark index, the Stoxx
600, is set for a second straight month of gains greater than those of
the S\&P 500 index, in dollar terms, according to data from FactSet.

The most important reason for this upswing, analysts say, is that Europe
is recording far fewer new cases of the coronavirus. There are still
occasional spikes in Europe, and there are some early signs that the
infection rate is starting to level off in the United States. But there
are [about 65,000 new cases each
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?campaign_id=154&emc=edit_cb_20200728&instance_id=20725&nl=coronavirus-briefing&regi_id=137662381&segment_id=34584&te=1&user_id=72eee90673e6857ae5a6e83e1981a59a)
in the United States, compared with [fewer
than 10,000](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea) across

One of the first school districts in the United States to reopen did not

had tested positive.

Administrators began an emergency protocol, isolating the student and
ordering everyone who had come into close contact with the person,

## New York colleges scramble to comply with state quarantine rules.

Colleges and universities across New York are enacting hasty plans to
meet state requirements for students arriving from out of state as the
fall semester nears.

With many schools poised to begin in-person instruction in just one
month, some of the state’s larger institutions have been forced to put

major coronavirus outbreaks.

requiring travelers to New York from high-risk parts of the United
States to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. As of Saturday, residents
of 36 states and territories would face the mandatory quarantine, based
on trends in infection data.

Cornell, which had previously pledged to provide quarantine
accommodations on campus to students coming from states identified by
the order, [announced on
Thursday](https://covid.cornell.edu/updates/20200730-important-updates.cfm)
that it would no longer offer housing to all students affected. The
announcement said that those who could not meet the requirements should
plan to begin the semester through online classes, but that the
university would assist students for whom making housing arrangements
represented a significant hardship.

Critics said the announcement [would force some
students](https://cornellsun.com/2020/07/31/editorial-cornells-inability-to-quarantine-arriving-students-should-concern-you/)
to find space in hotels or short-term rentals just two weeks before they
were scheduled to arrive.

Most colleges have advised students they will be unable to leave their
rooms during quarantines and will face regular medical screenings.
Columbia University [said](https://roomselection.housing.columbia.edu/)
it would arrange to have meals delivered to dormitories, according to
its website.

Since the list of states identified by the governor’s order is informed
by seven-day rolling averages of new infections, new outbreaks in
previously stable states could still force students to make last-minute
travel and housing arrangements to quarantine before classes
begin.

Since the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh closed liquor stores
as part of lockdown restrictions about two weeks ago, at least 10 people
have died after consuming alcohol-based hand sanitizer, the police said.

The Indian government started easing a national lockdown in late May.
But many states have reimposed some restrictions, including Andhra
Pradesh, where nearly 50,000 new coronavirus cases [have been reported
in the last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html#cases).

India reported 54,735 coronavirus infections on Sunday, the country’s
health ministry said, bringing its total to 1.75 million. More than
37,000 people have died.

The police in the state said some people who lost access to legal liquor
started mixing cheap hand sanitizer with water from roadside taps, soft
drinks and milk. The 10 deaths have occurred in the last three days,
mostly among poor residents.

In the town of Kurichedu, a man begging at a temple complained of a
burning sensation in his stomach, and died as he was being taken to a
hospital. Then the number of people complaining of a burning sensation
in their stomach started rising, the police said.

“All of them died after consuming sanitizer,” said Siddharth Kaushal,
the district’s top police officer. “We are wondering who told these
people that a sanitizer can get them high.”

Hundreds die each year in India from consuming poisonous [homemade
alcohol](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/11/world/asia/india-toxic-alcohol.html).
In 2015, [at least 100
people](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33224514) in a
Mumbai-area slum were killed, and in 2008, in one of the largest such
episodes in recent decades, [more than 170
people](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/TN-hooch-tragedy-21-cops-suspended/articleshow/3159848.cms?referral=PM)
died after drinking an illicit home brew in slum areas of Karnataka and
Tamil Nadu.

After India’s strict national lockdown lifted in May, reopened liquor
stores were swamped with so many customers that the [police in some
cities had to control the
crowds](https://news.yahoo.com/chaos-outside-liquor-stores-india-eases-virus-lockdown-112326078.html),
according to Agence
France-Presse.

The Food and Drug Administration has authorized the first coronavirus
tests that can give an estimate of the quantity of antibodies present in
a person’s blood, the agency [announced Friday
evening](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-tests-estimate-patients-antibodies-past-sars-cov-2).

Up until now, the so-called serology tests on the market, also known as
antibody tests, only indicate whether [Covid-19 antibodies are present
in the
blood](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/health/coronvirus-antibody-tests.html),
indicating that at some point in the past, the individual had been
exposed to the virus.

Many antibody tests [are
unreliable](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html).
The F.D.A. has had to chase after some manufacturers and distributors to
get them off the market. There is not yet a scientific consensus as to
what level of antibodies are needed to confer immunity, or how long such
immunity might last.

The two new Covid-19 serology tests, the ADVIA Centaur COV2G and
Attelica COV2G, are from Siemens.

Dr. Timothy Stenzel, the director of the F.D.A.’s Office of In Vitro
Diagnostics and Radiological Health, said in a statement, “Being able to
measure a patient’s relative level of antibodies in response to a
previous SARS-CoV-2 infection may be useful as we continue to learn more
about the virus and what the existence of antibodies may mean.

“There are still many unknowns about what the presence of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies may tell us about potential immunity, but today’s
authorizations give us additional tools to evaluate those antibodies as
we continue to research and study this virus.”

## Controlling screen time in the face of a pandemic.

With remote work, remote school, remote camp and everything else remote,
screens are dominating our lives. Here are some ways of thinking about
it, whether you want to cut back or simply come to terms with the
increased usage.
