# ‘Cocktails and Masks Don’t Really Go Together’

</div>

Young Russians are partying again, seeking a return to normal life and
willing to risk a coronavirus surge. “We are people, not robots, and
want to have a life,” said a bar patron (and doctor).

MOSCOW — When Nest, a cramped Moscow cocktail lounge, reopened for
business in late June after more than two months of lockdown, it offered
free masks and antiseptic lotion at the entrance to help calm any fears
drinkers might have about sitting just inches from each other around
tiny round tables.

It needn’t have bothered.

“Nobody could care less so we quickly stopped offering,” said Roman R.
Pometkov, the head bartender and a coronavirus survivor. He became
infected soon after the pandemic first hit the Russian capital with full
force in March and now, after recuperating in isolation at home for 28
days, is back at work.

Like everyone else in his packed bar on a recent evening, Mr. Pometkov
was not wearing a face mask. “Everyone just wants to get back to a
normal life,” he said. “Cocktails and masks don’t really go together.”

Following a path taken by many people in Florida, Texas and other parts
of the United States in early summer, Moscow and most of Russia in
recent weeks have thrown caution to the wind.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even restrictions that technically remain in force, like mandatory mask-
and glove-wearing in the Moscow subway and on city buses, are mostly
ignored. The authorities are making little effort to enforce them,
though a few random people have been fined.

“That’s not my department,” answered a gruff turnstile guard on Monday
when asked what the rules are.

The Moscow city government led the way in sounding the alarm over the
pandemic in Russia and imposed draconian controls in late March, which
were largely observed, at least at the start.

Muscovites were ordered to stay at home except to buy food and medicine
or to walk their dogs within 100 yards of home. All restaurants and bars
were shut down, and masks and gloves were mandatory for anyone venturing
out, a rule the police enforced with vigor.

But on July 24, the city hosted a party in Gorky Park for recently
graduated high school students. More than 10,000 young people attended,
virtually all without masks, for a long night of dancing, hugging and
boisterous close-quarters
celebration.

Schools across Russia have been told to reopen for the new school year
on Sept 1. Traffic on the Moscow subway, which plunged by 85 percent at
the peak of the crisis, has bounced back to near normal levels, with
more than 5.4 million passengers riding trains on Tuesday, a
post-lockdown record.

Unlike [the Sun Belt in the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html),
however, Russia has so far seen no surge in new cases, at least
according to official statistics. The daily infection rate nationwide
has hovered between 5,000 and 6,000 cases ever since President Vladimir
V. Putin last month declared the battle against the pandemic won.

Mr. Putin pressed ahead with [a huge, mask-free military
parade](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-parade.html)
in Red Square on June 24, and seven days of nationwide voting through
July 1 on constitutional amendments that [allow him to stay in power
until 2036](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/world/europe/putin-referendum-vote-russia.html).

Kremlin critics say the figures are being massaged to avoid exposing Mr.
Putin’s confidence as premature. And there are some small signs, even in
the official numbers, of possible trouble ahead.

The daily number of new infections in Moscow, after falling steadily to
530 in mid July, has started inching up, rising to 695 on Friday. This
is a big improvement on the more than 6,000 cases reported each day in
the Russian capital at the peak of the outbreak in May — and a far cry
from the more than 50,000 new cases reported each day this week in the
United States — but the upward trend in Moscow, if it continues and
accelerates, could quickly undo progress.

The Moscow city government on Friday warned of stiff fines for not
wearing masks on public transport and in shops.

But others are more sanguine, and in a country long accustomed to
calamity, any worries Russians have of an American-style fiasco have
been far outweighed by delight at the end of restrictions.

Recent reports of a rash of infections among celebrities prompted more
jokes than cries of alarm. Eljay, a popular rap musician, described his
own infection with the coronavirus over the weekend with a gleeful
[message to his more than four million followers on
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sayonaraboy/): “I have a corona so
I am the king. And if I am king we have a future.”

While not politicized as it has been in the United States, mask-wearing
is seen as seriously uncool among young people and by many older men,
whose often reckless disregard for health warnings, public health
experts agree, is reflected in their average life expectancy of 67
years. Some hip restaurants popular with youth have even started banning
masks.

When Kristina Orbakaite, a Russian pop star, posted a photograph of
herself wearing a designer mask on Instagram, she incited a storm of
protest from fans who accused her, variously, of spreading panic, empty
virtue signaling and pandering to the “herd instinct of Russian show
business.”

The criticism became so vicious that Ms. Orbakaite, whose mother, Alla
Pugacheva, is an elderly but still hugely popular Russian singer,
[posted an audio
message](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CCHJPXkpV72/?utm_source=ig_embed)
to her “dear subscribers and haters.” In it, she expressed dismay that
her fashion statement in favor of good hygiene had prompted “such a
violent reaction” and explained that wearing a mask might not save the
wearer but does protect others from infection.

even President Trump in shunning the face mask. The only time he has

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Polina Fedotova, a 27-year-old customer at the Nest cocktail bar, said
she has many friends in the United States, so is well aware of what she
called the “hellish” situation there. While not entirely confident
Russia won’t end up in the same place, she has decided that the benefits
of having a normal life far outweigh any potential risks.

“It is better to get out and live normally and perhaps even get sick
than to stay at home forever doing nothing,” she said.

Ms. Fedotova’s companion for an evening of cocktails was a 28-year-old
doctor who works at a large Moscow hospital and who contracted the
virus, but barely had any symptoms and has now recovered.

“It was not so bad,” said the doctor, who declined to give her last
name. “We are people, not robots, and want to have a
life.”

Younger Russians, often highly skeptical of all official claims, have
been the most eager to embrace the idea that the danger has passed or at
least that, whatever the risks, they are worth taking.

Yuri Kravchenko, the manager of Pod Mukhoi, a popular basement bar in
central Moscow, said “people are frightened deep down but the desire for
a normal life is just too strong.”

He wears a mask himself and has had all his serving staff tested for the
virus, one of whom found out that he had had the virus without knowing
it.

None of his customers on a recent weekend, packed on stools at the
crowded wooden bar and huddled shoulder-to-shoulder around tables in the
dining area, had a mask.

Among them was a group of students from the Plekhanov Russian University
of Economics. They were celebrating the end of their course work, done
mostly online for the past three months, and the chance to meet
face-to-face for the first time since early spring.

Elizaveta Kolesnik, 21, said she had been in France when the pandemic
arrived in Europe and been so frightened that she rushed back to Moscow
just before Russia closed its borders. After more than two months cooped
up at home in Moscow, however, she has put aside her earlier fear,
deciding that “fate will decide what happens now” and “if you are afraid
you only lose what life has to give.”

Francesco Spatola, an Italian-Russian classmate, said he has no faith at
all in official statistics but is happy to go along with the
authorities’ rosy story line. He also sees no point in trying to
resist the forces of nature.
