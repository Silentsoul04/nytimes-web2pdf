emerges. Meanwhile, the moment of truth arrives for Emily and Sister
Alice.

\subsection{Season 1, Episode 7: `Chapter
Seven'}\label{season-1-episode-7-chapter-seven}}

``I am fighting --- for a woman's life!'' Perry Mason yells at his
friend and partner Pete Strickland. ``I can't lose, Pete! I can't
{[}expletive{]} this up like \ldots{} ''

He hardly needs to finish the sentence. Perry's life up to this point
has been one long series of screw-ups: a failed marriage, a dishonorable
discharge, a family farm bought right out from under him by the woman
he's been dating --- and now, a rupture in his relationship with his
closest associate. Let Paul Drake, the well-meaning beat cop, do the
investigating from now on, Pete tells Perry; Pete is getting out of the
Perry Mason business.

The decision comes at a key moment for Mason. Sure, he has every right
to be mad at Pete for failing to successfully tail the crooked Radiant
Assembly of God elder Eric Seidel --- and if he had known of Seidel's
subsequent fate, he would have been even angrier. Thanks to the
investigative efforts of Pete, Perry and Paul, Mason is on the verge of
a breakthrough that could clear his client, Emily Dodson, of the murder
of her infant son Charlie. But with Easter Sunday looming, and Sister
Alice's promise to raise Charlie from the dead with it, the clock is
ticking --- and, by episode's end, it runs out.

At least the contours of the scheme that got poor Charlie killed are now
in clearer focus. Elder Seidel, desperate to keep the church afloat
after disastrous financial mismanagement and real-estate boondoggles,
uses George Gannon, the church's accountant and cooker of books, and
Sgt. Ennis, Seidel's old acquaintance from his union-busting days, to
pull off Charlie's kidnapping and hold him for ransom. He knows that the
baby's paternal grandfather, the fellow church elder Herman Baggerly, is
good for it.

But when the baby won't stop crying while in his kidnappers' clutches,
Ennis enlists a lactating Chinese-American sex worker to breastfeed the
boy. Tragically, the heroin in her bloodstream winds up killing the poor
child. Stitching open the baby's eyes was a trick to make him look alive
for the ransom handoff.

Pretty much everything Ennis has done since has been to cover his
tracks, notably murdering all of his co-conspirators. The wet nurse,
having outlived her usefulness to Ennis, appears to have been given a
hot shot and overdosed. Seidel is brutally stabbed to death this week in
one of the show's most vicious scenes to date. And it would have worked,
too, if it weren't for that pesky Perry Mason, who announces his
intention to break Ennis on the stand. Raymond Burr would be proud of
that promised maneuver; heck, he would probably be plenty chuffed to see
Mason using Hicks's testimony to reveal the church's money woes in the
first place.

One hundred thousand dollars in debt? The very same amount demanded by
the kidnappers? That should be some food for the jury's thought.

But even as the truth of the Charlie Dodson case becomes plain for
perhaps the first time, ``Perry Mason'' finds time for other plotlines,
other emotional tones. Personally, I can't stop thinking of Sister Alice
in this episode, as this week's episode both begins and ends with scenes
that center on her.

In the first, we see her as a teenager, walking through a field of
flowers as her mother attends to their car, which is out of gas. When an
ostensible good Samaritan reveals his true colors by wordlessly
demanding sexual access to Alice in exchange for his help with getting
them to the next town, Mother Birdy acquiesces. If this was the first
time that Alice the human being was exploited so that Sister Alice the
prophet could live on, it was certainly not the last.

Case in point: the Easter Sunday debacle at Charlie Dodson's grave.
Still hearing the voices in her head that have been with her at least as
early as that opening flashback, Sister Alice does her thing over the
tiny exhumed coffin; the struggle to open it that ensues is our first
indication that all will not go according to plan. Sure enough, a near
riot breaks out when the coffin is opened \ldots{} and revealed to be
empty. Perry and Della race a devastated Emily Dodson, who now wants
only to join her baby in death, to safety. But Birdy and Alice take off
in another direction, which Birdy quickly re-routs on an obviously
preplanned detour.

There, in the middle of the street, onlookers have found a living baby,
one Birdy claims is Charlie Dodson returned to life.

What follows is admirably ambiguous. Bloodied from the chaos at the
grave site, Sister Alice watches her mother proclaim Alice's success in
resurrecting the baby --- and runs away, by herself, blood streaming
from her broken nose, silk garments catching the wind behind her. Is she
smiling in the episode's final shot? Is it a smile of triumph or, more
likely, one of bitter recognition of her mother's skulduggery in
producing a fake miracle in lieu of a real one?

\textbf{From the case files:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When Perry infiltrates the Chinese brothel where Ennis did his
  recruiting, he's on the verge of getting beaten down by the place's
  muscle when Paul intervenes to save him with a gun. I'm a big Pete
  Strickland fan, but it's hard to imagine him pulling off a similar
  rescue.
\end{itemize}

  Here's one to file away for later: Like his friend Della Street, the
  deputy district attorney Hamilton Burger is secretly gay. Given that
  he played the role of Perry's primary antagonist in the old ``Perry
  Mason'' series, you have to wonder how this will play out in the 2020s
  reboot.
