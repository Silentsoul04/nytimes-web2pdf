Jesse Eisenberg’s audio drama, “When You Finish Saving the World,” is
coming to Audible ahead of a film adaptation with Julianne Moore.

If you’re missing the chilly joy of ducking into a movie theater on a
sweltering day, welcome to the club.

Ditto for attending concerts, plays, sporting events and awkward variety
shows on the last day of summer camp. Our usual forms of entertainment
are scarce right now, but here’s a fresh alternative: Jesse Eisenberg’s
[Audible
Original](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/06/books/curtis-sittenfeld-audible-original.html),
“When You Finish Saving the World.”

The idea for the five-hour, 17-minute audio drama, available on Tuesday,
grew out of a conversation between Eisenberg — the star of movies such
as “The Social Network” as well as an
[author](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/06/books/review/jesse-eisenberg-by-the-book.html)
and
[playwright](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/03/theater/review-the-spoils-stars-jesse-eisenberg-as-narcissist.html)
— and a friend who confessed that he had no emotional connection to his
newborn daughter.

“He was mortified and felt terribly guilty. I thought this was an
interesting dynamic to explore,” Eisenberg said in a phone interview.
“Then I met these great producers who told me about a new format which
is fiction created exclusively for audio. The internal struggle of a
character who is emotionally a bit stifled seemed perfect for that
medium.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“When You Finish Saving the World” tells the story of the Katz family
over 30 years. First, we hear from Nathan (voiced by Eisenberg), a young
father struggling to connect with his newborn son; then Ziggy ([Finn
Wolfhard](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/28/style/stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-rough-trade-vinyl.html)),
that same baby, now grown into a 15-year-old blundering through
adolescent angst in 2032, which makes the present look downright
blissful; and, finally, Rachel ([Kaitlyn
Dever](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/19/movies/kaitlyn-dever-talks-about-men-women-children.html)),
a wide-eyed, well-intentioned student trying to get her bearings at
Indiana University in 2002. Her path is about to make a zigzag that will
lead her to become Nathan’s wife and Ziggy’s mother.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Each character takes shape through his or her own series of audio files.
Nathan’s are intended for a couples’ therapist and Ziggy’s for a
futuristic bot therapist he has been “sentenced” to see. Rachel’s
cassette tapes are intended for her high school boyfriend, who is
awaiting deployment to Afghanistan.

These dispatches are whispered and wept from a variety of locations,
including a guest room, a bathroom and a Subway sandwich shop. They give
you the forbidden thrill of reading someone else’s mail, with the added
bonus of being able to hear the sender’s voice. The experience is
reminiscent of watching a play — the intimacy and urgency of “[Dear Evan
Hansen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/04/theater/dear-evan-hansen-review.html)”
come to mind — to the extent that brief pauses between sections are as
jarring as the house lights coming up in a hushed theater.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rachel Ghiazza, the head of U.S. content at Audible, said Eisenberg’s
approach is “genre-bending” and “pushes the boundaries of what audio
storytelling can do.” This podcast-weary walker would have to agree.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One might wonder about the logistics of producing anything during a
pandemic, let alone a three-part drama with music and sound effects such
as a baby crying, a party raging, a button clicking on an old-fashioned
tape recorder. (Keen-eared Subway enthusiasts may question the crinkly
noise of a sandwich being unwrapped — it sounds like it may be the wrong
paper.)

Here’s how it all came together. Eisenberg spent several months writing
the script, even meeting with veterans to find the right military base
for Rachel’s story. “When a friend who was stationed in [Karshi-Khanabad
in
Uzbekistan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/07/31/world/uzbeks-order-us-from-base-in-refugee-rift.html)
told me about his experiences, I knew I had the right location,”
Eisenberg said. “All of the military stories are based on friends’
experiences, and I lined them up on the same timeline as U.S. politics
in 2002, so Rachel would have to struggle to navigate two opposing
worlds: a boyfriend stationed overseas and an antiwar, liberal college
campus.”

In the early weeks of 2020, Eisenberg recorded his part in a Newark
studio, then traveled to Vancouver’s Gastown neighborhood to record with
Wolfhard in a studio owned by the singer-songwriter [Bryan
Adams](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1994/03/08/arts/review-pop-bryan-adams-more-mr-nice-guy.html).
Wolfhard’s section happens to include singing and a slew of made-up
slang delivered with a fluency only an actual teenager could muster.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Wolfhard, 17 and best known as Mike Wheeler on the Netflix series
“Stranger Things,” said: “It was therapeutic. I got to be kind of a
brat for a change. Hopefully I’m not as much of one in real life.”

Of his invention of the hipster lexicon of the future, Eisenberg said,
“Ziggy is one of these pretentious kids who adopts something before
general society agrees that it’s palatable. My only inconvenience was,
anytime I came up with a new word, I would immediately search in [Urban
Dictionary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/07/05/magazine/05FOB-medium-t.html)
and discover that it meant something that was horribly sexually
perverse.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Wolfhard put Eisenberg in touch with Dever (a Golden Globe nominee for
“[Unbelievable](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/13/arts/television/review-netflix-unbelievable.html)”)
and, in March, she and Eisenberg met up at a Los Angeles coffee shop,
Joan’s on Third, to discuss the project. “Jesse was the last person I
shared a cookie with in the real world,” Dever said.

“It was classic chocolate chip,” Eisenberg recalled. “Had I known the
world was about to change, I would have gotten something else.”

With California on lockdown, logistics presented a challenge. “Where the
suspense came in was figuring out how to record Kaitlyn’s part of the
story,” Ghiazza said. The team at Audible put together a kit containing
“everything she needed to turn her home into a professional recording
studio” — including a microphone, audio interface, monitor, Bluetooth
mouse, pop filter, microphone stand, headphones and cabling.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dever said she could hear Eisenberg in her headphones, but otherwise she
was on her own in a bedroom closet. “There was something about being in
the comfort of my own home that made everything more relaxed and casual.
It took the pressure off,” she said.

“When You Finish Saving the World” is also being made into a movie, with
some adjustments — like taking place in the present day. Other details
will remain the same: [Julianne
Moore](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/06/movies/julianne-moore-gloria-bell.html),
who plays Ziggy’s mother, runs a shelter for victims of domestic
violence in the film, just as Rachel does in the audio version.

“She’s a mother who is a hero to thousands of people but feels less
comfortable as a mother to one,” Eisenberg said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As for what listeners take away from “When You Finish Saving the World,”
Eisenberg hopes it is empathy. “In stories that take place from multiple
characters’ perspectives, where you see the same world through different
eyes, I think there’s a macro message that the world is full of
complicated people, not heroes and villains,” he said. “Everybody’s
trying their best. If you try to understand their intentions, you might
understand their behavior better.”

***Correction: Aug. 2, 2020***  
*An earlier version of this article misstated where Jesse Eisenberg
recorded his part of “When You Finish Saving the World.” It was Newark,
not Jersey City.*
