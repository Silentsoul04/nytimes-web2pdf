# Lord & Taylor Files for Bankruptcy as Retail Collapses Pile Up

</div>

The department store, which traces its roots to 1826, was struggling
before the coronavirus hit. Its owner, the clothing rental start-up Le
Tote, also filed for bankruptcy.

Lord & Taylor, the floundering department store company that traces its
roots to 1826, on Sunday became the latest retailer to file for
bankruptcy protection as the coronavirus outbreak accelerates the
[demise of
chains](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/business/coronavirus-department-stores-neiman-marcus.html)
that were already teetering.

The chain was [acquired last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/28/business/lord-taylor-sold-le-tote.html)
by the clothing rental start-up Le Tote in an unusual $100 million deal.
Now Le Tote and Lord & Taylor are both seeking Chapter 11 protection
from their creditors in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia.

The companies said in a filing on Sunday that they operated 38
locations, which had been temporarily closed since March 2020. A
representative for Le Tote and Lord & Taylor did not immediately respond
to a request for comment.

Lord & Taylor’s [origins date
back](http://www.hbcheritage.ca/history/acquisitions/lord-and-taylor-historical-timeline)to
1826, when Samuel Lord and George Washington Taylor, both English
immigrants, founded a dry goods store in Manhattan’s Lower East Side
neighborhood. It opened its second store in 1853 and a third in 1860.
The famed flagship location on Fifth Avenue in New York opened in 1914
and had a concert hall with a built-in pipe organ and several dining
rooms.

But in recent years the chain, which was previously owned by Hudson's
Bay, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, had been struggling. The chief
executive of Hudson’s Bay had said that the chain was in the fraught
“middle” space among retailers — neither high-end luxury nor discount
apparel.

Hudson’s Bay [had sold
the](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/24/business/lord-taylor-wework.html)
chain’s iconic New York flagship building to WeWork, and at one point
even started selling its goods on Walmart’s website.

Then came the Le Tote deal, which was an unexpected gamble from a San
Francisco tech startup. Le Tote agreed to pay $100 million in cash for
Lord & Taylor’s brand and inventory and take control of 38 stores and
the chain’s online operation. But Hudson’s Bay would continue to own
Lord & Taylor’s real estate and cover Le Tote’s rent at those properties
for three years. The deal closed last November.

Le Tote [envisioned
reviving](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/11/style/lord-taylor-return-pop-up-le-tote.html)
Lord & Taylor and expanding its own fortunes by persuading its
30-something, city-dwelling customers to visit the chain’s stores, and
getting the core Lord & Taylor target customer, a suburban woman around
the age of 50, to try Le Tote.

But that plan was complicated by the coronavirus outbreak, which has had
an outsized effect on brick-and-mortar retailers, particularly those
which were forced to shut stores as part of state and city lockdowns.
