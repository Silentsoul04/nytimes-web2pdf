## What’s Up? (July 26-Aug. 1)

### A Long Fall

Appalling new data shows just how badly the pandemic has devastated the
United States economy: Gross domestic product shrank 9.5 percent, or
32.9 percent at an adjusted annual rate, in the second quarter of this
year, [according to a report from the Commerce
Department](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html).
It’s the most severe collapse in the 70-plus years that G.D.P.
statistics have been compiled, and wiped away nearly five years of
economic growth. If the virus were now under control, the dive could
prove to be temporary. But with cases surging in many states, a quick
comeback is looking less and less
likely.

### No Mask, No Service

The science is clear that masks [help slow the spread of the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html)
and allow people to shop and go out in public more safely. That’s why
many big businesses, [most recently
McDonald’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/which-stores-require-masks.html),
are requiring customers to wear them. But there’s a wrinkle:
[Enforcement is
tricky](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/coronavirus-masks-stores-walmart.html).
Stores like Walmart have appointed “health ambassadors” to remind
customers to put on masks before entering, but if someone refuses, what
is the employee going to do? Confront the person and get breathed on? No
thanks. Many businesses are struggling to contend with this loophole,
which affects the safety of other customers as well as employees.

### On the Spot

The chief executives of the tech industry’s “Big Four” — Amazon, Apple,
Facebook and Google — faced a [blistering round of
questions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html)
(via video, awkwardly) from a congressional antitrust panel on
Wednesday. The hearing was a culmination of a yearlong investigation
into monopolies in the digital market, and those in the hot seat — Jeff
Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai — [struggled to
defend](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/big-tech-ceos.html)
claims that their companies had broken antitrust laws by exploiting
their size to consolidate power and thwart rivals. Lawmakers vowed to
tighten regulations, but how they’ll do that remains to be seen. And the
companies continue to [rake in
money](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html)
as the pandemic makes consumers more reliant on digital services. Apple,
Amazon and Facebook all reported blockbuster revenue this past week, and
Google reported better earnings than
expected.

## What’s Next? (Aug. 2-8)

### Not So Fast

Congress may talk a big game about reining in big tech, but European
Union leaders are actually doing it. In the past, European officials
have been notoriously aggressive about trying to hit American tech
companies where it hurts — with [higher
taxes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/23/business/tech-taxes-debate.html)
and [business
restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/18/technology/google-eu-android-fine.html)
— with varying success. Now, they are [pursuing a handful of new
laws](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/europe-new-phase-tech-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html)
that would narrow the scope of what digital businesses can do and sell.
One would make it illegal for Amazon and Apple to steer customers toward
their own products instead of those made by rivals. Another would
establish stricter rules against hate speech on social networks. If any
of these proposed laws come to fruition, they could push the platforms
to change their behaviors worldwide.

### Deadlocked

Millions of workers ([roughly one in
five](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/business/how-many-are-collecting-unemployment-benefits-its-hard-to-say.html))
are still out of work in the United States, and they’re about to get
desperate. Until the end of July, they were receiving supplementary
unemployment benefits ([an extra $600 a
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html))
from the federal government as part of the CARES Act that was passed in
March. But that provision [expired on
Friday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html),
and efforts to extend or replace parts of it stalled in Washington this
past week when President Trump [put the kibosh on negotiations for a
broad relief
package](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/virus-aid-trump.html).
(His chief of staff summed things up: “We’re nowhere near a deal.”)
Lawmakers are now scrambling to find a quick Band-Aid, like another
round of direct payments to Americans, many of whom are [facing the
threat of
eviction](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus.html).

### Where Are the Jobs?

The July employment report comes out this Friday, and analysts are split
on where things stand. Most economists expect the numbers to show
another increase in payrolls for the [third consecutive
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/business/economy/jobs-unemployment-coronavirus.html)
(good\!), but say that it will be modest — after all, several big states
have paused and even reversed their reopenings as the number of virus
cases increases (bad). Others think payrolls [may have even
declined](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/24/business/stock-market-updates-coronavirus/state-jobless-filings-started-to-head-back-up-last-week).
One thing we do know for sure: The number of new jobless claims is on
the rise again for the second week in a row, which doesn’t paint a
promising picture.

Herman Cain, the businessman, pizza chain executive and one-time
presidential hopeful, [died after being hospitalized with the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/herman-cain-dead.html).
Neiman Marcus, the upscale department store that [filed for bankruptcy
in
May](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/business/coronavirus-retail-bankruptcies-private-equity.html),
plans to [close a number of its stores this
fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/24/business/stock-market-updates-coronavirus/neiman-marcus-will-close-its-store-in-new-yorks-hudson-yards),
including its glittery new flagship at Hudson Yards in Manhattan. And
the Federal Reserve pledged to [keep interest rates near
zero](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates.html)
while the economy continues to flail.
