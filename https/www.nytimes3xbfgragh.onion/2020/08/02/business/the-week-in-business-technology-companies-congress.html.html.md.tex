Welcome to August, everyone. I'm on vacation next week, escaping the

here's what you need to know in business and tech for the week ahead.

\subsubsection{A Long Fall}\label{a-long-fall}}

Appalling new data shows just how badly the pandemic has devastated the
United States economy: Gross domestic product shrank 9.5 percent, or
32.9 percent at an adjusted annual rate, in the second quarter of this
year,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html}{according
to a report from the Commerce Department}. It's the most severe collapse
in the 70-plus years that G.D.P. statistics have been compiled, and
wiped away nearly five years of economic growth. If the virus were now
under control, the dive could prove to be temporary. But with cases
surging in many states, a quick comeback is looking less and less
likely.

\hypertarget{no-mask-no-service}{%
\subsubsection{No Mask, No Service}\label{no-mask-no-service}}

The science is clear that masks
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html}{help
slow the spread of the coronavirus} and allow people to shop and go out
in public more safely. That's why many big businesses,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/which-stores-require-masks.html}{most
recently McDonald's}, are requiring customers to wear them. But there's
a wrinkle:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/coronavirus-masks-stores-walmart.html}{Enforcement
is tricky}. Stores like Walmart have appointed ``health ambassadors'' to
remind customers to put on masks before entering, but if someone
refuses, what is the employee going to do? Confront the person and get
breathed on? No thanks. Many businesses are struggling to contend with
this loophole, which affects the safety of other customers as well as
employees.

\hypertarget{on-the-spot}{%
\subsubsection{On the Spot}\label{on-the-spot}}

The chief executives of the tech industry's ``Big Four'' --- Amazon,
Apple, Facebook and Google --- faced a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html}{blistering
round of questions} (via video, awkwardly) from a congressional
antitrust panel on Wednesday. The hearing was a culmination of a
yearlong investigation into monopolies in the digital market, and those
in the hot seat --- Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar
Pichai ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/big-tech-ceos.html}{struggled
to defend} claims that their companies had broken antitrust laws by
exploiting their size to consolidate power and thwart rivals. Lawmakers
vowed to tighten regulations, but how they'll do that remains to be
seen. And the companies continue to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html}{rake
in money} as the pandemic makes consumers more reliant on digital
services. Apple, Amazon and Facebook all reported blockbuster revenue
this past week, and Google reported better earnings than expected.

\hypertarget{not-so-fast}{%
\subsubsection{Not So Fast}\label{not-so-fast}}

Congress may talk a big game about reining in big tech, but European
Union leaders are actually doing it. In the past, European officials
have been notoriously aggressive about trying to hit American tech
companies where it hurts --- with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/23/business/tech-taxes-debate.html}{higher
taxes} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/18/technology/google-eu-android-fine.html}{business
restrictions} --- with varying success. Now, they are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/europe-new-phase-tech-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html}{pursuing
a handful of new laws} that would narrow the scope of what digital
businesses can do and sell. One would make it illegal for Amazon and
Apple to steer customers toward their own products instead of those made
by rivals. Another would establish stricter rules against hate speech on
social networks. If any of these proposed laws come to fruition, they
could push the platforms to change their behaviors worldwide.

\subsubsection{Deadlocked}\label{deadlocked}}

Millions of workers
(\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/business/how-many-are-collecting-unemployment-benefits-its-hard-to-say.html}{roughly
one in five}) are still out of work in the United States, and they're
about to get desperate. Until the end of July, they were receiving
supplementary unemployment benefits
(\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html}{an
extra \$600 a week}) from the federal government as part of the CARES
Act that was passed in March. But that provision
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html}{expired
on Friday}, and efforts to extend or replace parts of it stalled in
Washington this past week when President Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/virus-aid-trump.html}{put
the kibosh on negotiations for a broad relief package}. (His chief of
staff summed things up: ``We're nowhere near a deal.'') Lawmakers are
now scrambling to find a quick Band-Aid, like another round of direct
payments to Americans, many of whom are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus.html}{facing
the threat of eviction}.

\hypertarget{where-are-the-jobs}{%
\subsubsection{Where Are the Jobs?}\label{where-are-the-jobs}}

The July employment report comes out this Friday, and analysts are split
on where things stand. Most economists expect the numbers to show
another increase in payrolls for the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/business/economy/jobs-unemployment-coronavirus.html}{third
consecutive month} (good!), but say that it will be modest --- after
all, several big states have paused and even reversed their reopenings
as the number of virus cases increases (bad). Others think payrolls
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/24/business/stock-market-updates-coronavirus/state-jobless-filings-started-to-head-back-up-last-week}{may
have even declined}. One thing we do know for sure: The number of new
jobless claims is on the rise again for the second week in a row, which
doesn't paint a promising picture.

\hypertarget{what-else}{%
\subsection{What Else?}\label{what-else}}

Herman Cain, the businessman, pizza chain executive and one-time
presidential hopeful,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/herman-cain-dead.html}{died
after being hospitalized with the coronavirus}. Neiman Marcus, the
upscale department store that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/business/coronavirus-retail-bankruptcies-private-equity.html}{filed
for bankruptcy in May}, plans to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/24/business/stock-market-updates-coronavirus/neiman-marcus-will-close-its-store-in-new-yorks-hudson-yards}{close
a number of its stores this fall}, including its glittery new flagship
at Hudson Yards in Manhattan. And the Federal Reserve pledged to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates.html}{keep
interest rates near zero} while the economy continues to flail.
