Good morning. Life during the pandemic offers its pleasures only
fitfully, but there’s a good tomato getting ready for harvest on my
solitary compound-bucketed plant and I’ve been looking forward to it all
week. I’m planning on eating it sun-warm and cut into shingles between
slices of toast, with a little salt and a bunch of mayonnaise. That’s
summer’s greatest sandwich. I can almost taste it now.

Later I’ll turn to [fried
fish](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1014786-outdoor-fish-fry),
which if you’re lucky you can cook outside, in a cast-iron pan on the
grill, then eat it with hot sauce, [quick-pickled
okra](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021260-quick-pickled-okra)
and a thatch of
[coleslaw](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1014788-simple-slaw).
There’ll be Jennifer Steinhauer’s [Field Day
poundcake](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/12194-field-day-poundcake)
(above) for dessert, because one of the kids is working her way through
[all our poundcake
recipes](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/search?q=poundcake) and
today is Jenny’s turn.

It’s shaping up to be an excellent Sunday. I hope that proves true for
you as well.

On Monday, speaking just for myself but always in service to you, I’ll
look to a [white bean caprese
salad](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021273-white-bean-caprese-salad),
if I don’t make [baked tofu with peanut sauce and coconut lime
rice](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020530-baked-tofu-with-peanut-sauce-and-coconut-lime-rice)
yet again. That’s a rut I don’t mind occupying, to cook that meal so
much.

Tuesday might bring [roasted chicken thighs with peaches, basil and
ginger](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1012681-roasted-chicken-thighs-with-peaches-basil-and-ginger),
if I can find good peaches, and [stew
chicken](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1017778-stew-chicken)
if I can’t. (Stew chicken makes for excellent leftovers.)

[Tomato
risotto](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020378-tomato-risotto)
on Wednesday sounds good, even if I have to use store-bought tomatoes to
save my crop for lunches.

For Thursday, maybe we could all take a run at [pork
meatballs](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019764-pork-meatballs-with-ginger-and-fish-sauce)
with ginger and fish sauce? Or [spaghetti
carbonara](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/12965-spaghetti-carbonara)?
Depending on the weather, it could be time for [ice-cold
schav](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1018801-ice-cold-schav),
a righteous thing to eat in the heat.

And then to finish the week, I’m thinking my pal Pong’s favorite recipe,
for [miso-glazed
fish](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1015115-miso-glazed-fish).
I like that dish with
[rice](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/49-how-to-make-rice)
and greens sautéed with plenty of garlic and ginger.

There are thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week on [NYT
Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/). Yes, you need a
subscription to access all of them, and to use all the features of our
site and apps. That makes sense. We’re a subscription business.
Subscriptions support our work and allow it to continue. If you haven’t

Now, will you take a look at our latest video offering on YouTube, where
Aaron Hutcherson takes up the [Cook My
Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ybS5epdjZk) challenge?

It’s nothing to do with skirt steaks or patty pan squash, but you will
not regret watching [this video of the skateboarder Isamu
Yamamoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ici7djACc&t=15s) at work.

Nor will you be annoyed that I urged you to read Janet Maslin on [“The
Essential Tana
French](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/books/the-essential-tana-french.html).[”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/books/the-essential-tana-french.html)
There’s your summer reading list, done.

Here’s [Stephen Marche in the Literary Review of
Canada](https://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2020/07/the-passport/), writing
about the Canadian passport, but really about Canada itself, “nurturing
and oppressive with the same gesture, safe and claustrophobic in its
enclosure.” (Related: [Megan Specia in The
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/world/europe/american-passport-privilege-coronavirus.html),
on the erosion of American passport privilege.)

Finally, Sunday music to play us off, Khruangbin,
“[Pelota](https://youtu.be/UULIfPLMuDw).” I’ll be back on Monday.
