Good morning. Life during the pandemic offers its pleasures only
fitfully, but there's a good tomato getting ready for harvest on my
solitary compound-bucketed plant and I've been looking forward to it all
week. I'm planning on eating it sun-warm and cut into shingles between
slices of toast, with a little salt and a bunch of mayonnaise. That's
summer's greatest sandwich. I can almost taste it now.

Later I'll turn to
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1014786-outdoor-fish-fry}{fried
fish}, which if you're lucky you can cook outside, in a cast-iron pan on
the grill, then eat it with hot sauce,
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021260-quick-pickled-okra}{quick-pickled
okra} and a thatch of
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1014788-simple-slaw}{coleslaw}.
There'll be Jennifer Steinhauer's
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/12194-field-day-poundcake}{Field
Day poundcake} (above) for dessert, because one of the kids is working
her way through
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/search?q=poundcake}{all our
poundcake recipes} and today is Jenny's turn.

It's shaping up to be an excellent Sunday. I hope that proves true for
you as well.

On Monday, speaking just for myself but always in service to you, I'll
look to a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021273-white-bean-caprese-salad}{white
bean caprese salad}, if I don't make
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020530-baked-tofu-with-peanut-sauce-and-coconut-lime-rice}{baked
tofu with peanut sauce and coconut lime rice} yet again. That's a rut I
don't mind occupying, to cook that meal so much.

Tuesday might bring
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1012681-roasted-chicken-thighs-with-peaches-basil-and-ginger}{roasted
chicken thighs with peaches, basil and ginger}, if I can find good
peaches, and
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1017778-stew-chicken}{stew
chicken} if I can't. (Stew chicken makes for excellent leftovers.)

\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020378-tomato-risotto}{Tomato
risotto} on Wednesday sounds good, even if I have to use store-bought
tomatoes to save my crop for lunches.

For Thursday, maybe we could all take a run at
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019764-pork-meatballs-with-ginger-and-fish-sauce}{pork
meatballs} with ginger and fish sauce? Or
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/12965-spaghetti-carbonara}{spaghetti
carbonara}? Depending on the weather, it could be time for
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1018801-ice-cold-schav}{ice-cold
schav}, a righteous thing to eat in the heat.

And then to finish the week, I'm thinking my pal Pong's favorite recipe,
for
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1015115-miso-glazed-fish}{miso-glazed
fish}. I like that dish with
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/49-how-to-make-rice}{rice}
and greens sautéed with plenty of garlic and ginger.

There are thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week on
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/}{NYT Cooking}. Yes, you
need a subscription to access all of them, and to use all the features
of our site and apps. That makes sense. We're a subscription business.
Subscriptions support our work and allow it to continue. If you haven't
already, will you please
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/subscription/cooking.html?campaignId=6XQHR}{subscribe
today}?

We'll be standing by to help if something goes wrong along the way,
either with your cooking or our technology. Just write us:
\href{mailto:cookingcare@NYTimes.com}{\nolinkurl{cookingcare@NYTimes.com}}.
Someone will get back to you.

Now, will you take a look at our latest video offering on YouTube, where
Aaron Hutcherson takes up the
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ybS5epdjZk}{Cook My Life}
challenge?

It's nothing to do with skirt steaks or patty pan squash, but you will
not regret watching
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3ici7djACc\&t=15s}{this video of
the skateboarder Isamu Yamamoto} at work.

Nor will you be annoyed that I urged you to read Janet Maslin on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/books/the-essential-tana-french.html}{``The
Essential Tana
French}.\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/books/the-essential-tana-french.html}{''}
There's your summer reading list, done.

Here's
\href{https://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2020/07/the-passport/}{Stephen
Marche in the Literary Review of Canada}, writing about the Canadian
passport, but really about Canada itself, ``nurturing and oppressive
with the same gesture, safe and claustrophobic in its enclosure.''
(Related:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/world/europe/american-passport-privilege-coronavirus.html}{Megan
Specia in The Times}, on the erosion of American passport privilege.)

Finally, Sunday music to play us off, Khruangbin,
``\href{https://youtu.be/UULIfPLMuDw}{Pelota}.'' I'll be back on Monday.
