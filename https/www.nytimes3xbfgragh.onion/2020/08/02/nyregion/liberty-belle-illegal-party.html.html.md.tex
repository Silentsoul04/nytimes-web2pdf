N.Y.C.}\label{arrests-over-illicit-party-boat-with-170-guests-cruising-around-nyc}}

It was yet another symbol of reckless socializing during the pandemic:
The Liberty Belle was dinged for violating distancing rules, and its
owners were accused of running an unlicensed bar, the authorities said.

The Liberty Belle, a riverboat with four bars, three outdoor decks and
space for 600 guests, has been touted by its operators as a ``favorite
venue'' of New Yorkers who hold parties, fund-raisers and other trendy
events on the water.

But now it has become yet another symbol of reckless socializing during
the pandemic: The boat was used on Saturday to host a party with more
than 170 guests, violating state and local social-distancing rules,
according to the New York Sheriff's Office.

Even though the outbreak is mostly under control in New York, city and
state officials are expressing growing alarm about the dangers posed by
social gatherings where people violate the public health rules imposed
to slow the transmission of the coronavirus.

Events with high drink or ticket prices --- like a recent
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/nyregion/hamptons-chainsmokers-concert-social-distancing.html}{charity
concert in the Hamptons} featuring D.J. performances from the chief
executive of Goldman Sachs and the Chainsmokers --- have drawn harsh
criticism as examples of careless behavior from the wealthy, who have
largely escaped the worst of the outbreak as the virus has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/nyregion/bronx-coronavirus-outbreak.html}{ravaged
poorer communities}.

It was unclear what kind of party was held on the Liberty Belle and how
much organizers might have charged for admission. The authorities
received a complaint about a party boat departing Pier 36 on Manhattan's
Lower East Side around 8:30 p.m., and deputies intercepted and boarded
the boat when it returned around 11:30 p.m.

Two owners of the boat, Ronny Vargas and Alex Suazo, were arrested on
Saturday night and accused of violating several provisions of state law,
including operating an unlicensed bar and bottle club, the Sheriff's
Office said.

The boat's captain, who was not named, was issued a summons for not
properly displaying its identification number, the Sheriff's Office
said.

``I want the business in New York to do well,'' said Gale A. Brewer, the
Manhattan borough president, whose office received the complaint about
the illegal party that led to the arrests. ``But you have to follow the
rules in terms of safety and health.''

Mr. Vargas and Mr. Suazo could not immediately be reached for comment.
The company that operates the Liberty Belle, Empire Cruises, did not
respond to a request for comment.

In an \href{https://empirecruises.com/covid19/}{undated statement on its
website}, Empire Cruises said that it had been ``forced to cease our
operations until further notice'' because of the pandemic. The company
said it was following all public health measures.

It was not clear if Empire Cruises was officially operating again.

Trever Holland, the president of the resident association at Two Bridges
Tower, an apartment building near the pier, said that on Saturday
evening
\href{https://twitter.com/twobridgestower/status/1289717659030786048}{he
noticed the Liberty Belle} from the window of his 19th-floor apartment.
It appeared that people were gathering without masks, he said, and that
they were not social distancing.

Mr. Holland said that before the pandemic, residents of the neighborhood
often saw large boat parties on the East River. As the weather had
gotten warmer, he had noticed smaller tour boats in the water, but the
crowds on the Liberty Belle ``just caught us by surprise,'' he said.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for

``It's obviously a threat to the neighborhood and against everything
we're trying to do as a city,'' he added.

Mr. Holland took a picture of the riverboat and posted it on Twitter,
alerting Ms. Brewer. She responded, saying that she had contacted state
and local authorities.

State officials in recent weeks have increasingly cracked down on bars
and other businesses that violate social-distancing and other safety
measures. Dozens of businesses have had their liquor licenses suspended.

Last week,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/nyregion/nello-liquor-license-suspended.html}{state
officials suspended the liquor license of Nello}, an Italian restaurant
and celebrity hot spot on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, after they
said at least eight people were served indoors in violation of public
health measures.
