The government blames the pandemic. More likely, it was afraid to lose.

HONG KONG — And now, it’s election fraud.

The Chinese Communist Party’s onslaught against the rights and the
freedoms of the Hong Kong people continues. On June 30, it imposed on
the city a new [national security
law](https://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20202448e/egn2020244872.pdf).
Within hours the police arrested people simply for possessing banners
that said “[Hong Kong
Independence](https://twitter.com/hkpoliceforce/status/1278201222457987073).”

On Thursday, the Hong Kong authorities [disqualified 12 candidates from
the pro-democracy
camp](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/world/asia/hong-kong-arrests-security-law.html),
including four sitting legislators, from running in the election for the
Legislative Council, known as LegCo, scheduled for early September: They
questioned the candidates’ sincerity in pledging allegiance to the
government.

An official government statement listed “[expressing an objection in
principle](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/30/P2020073000481.htm)”
to the new national security law as one of the grounds for
disqualification — adding, “There is no question of any political
censorship, restriction of the freedom of speech or deprivation of the
right to stand for elections as alleged by some members of the
community.”

And then on Friday, the Hong Kong authorities announced that the LegCo
election [would be delayed by a
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/world/asia/hong-kong-election-delayed.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They cited the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse, but the truth is that
they are afraid their camp would lose the race.

Why else postpone the election so early before voting day? Or for so
long? Over the past few months, elections were successfully held in
[South
Korea](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/world/asia/south-korea-election.html),
[Tokyo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/05/world/asia/tokyo-governor-election.html)
and
[Singapore](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/world/asia/singapore-election-results.html)
in the middle of coronavirus outbreaks.

The pro-government camp was humiliated in district council elections in
November, when the opposition won [86 percent of contested
seats.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/24/world/asia/hong-kong-election-results.html)
In mid-July more than 600,000 people turned up for[informal primaries
for the opposition
camp](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/14/serious-provocation-beijing-blasts-hong-kong-democrat-primaries-after-initial-results-reveal/)
— which Beijing’s representatives in the city later called “a serious
provocation to the current election system.” Not wanting to lose another
election, the pro-government forces have, in effect, canceled it.

And now this postponed election creates a dangerous legislative void —
as well as a gutting dilemma for some of us who are pro-democracy
members of LegCo.

Hong Kong’s election cycle is fixed: Under [the Basic
Law](https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/images/basiclaw_full_text_en.pdf),
the city’s mini-constitution, legislative elections are to be held every
four years in September. The embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, has
conceded that this delay does not conform to the law — and so she [is
deferring to the Chinese government in
Beijing](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/31/P2020073101081.htm?fontSize=1)
to decide how a provisional Legislature here should operate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is not known whether that body will function as LegCo usually does,
or if it will meet only in emergency situations. Even if LegCo’s current
session is simply extended, its composition is now unclear: Will the
sitting legislators who were disqualified from contesting the next
election be allowed to continue to serve?

I am one of the 24 members of LegCo from the pro-democracy camp, out of
a total of 70 legislators.

Throughout the years, our camp — which comprises different parties with
different views, though all committed to democratic rights and freedoms
— has received a majority of the popular vote for the seats decided by
direct suffrage. But the Legislature’s design, which reserves [35 seats
for special interest groups](https://www.reo.gov.hk/en/voter/FC.htm) —
many by now dominated or co-opted by pro-Beijing parties — has ensured
that nonetheless we are a minority.

During LegCo’s current term, the government had already disqualified [a
total](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/08/world/asia/china-hong-kong-sixtus-leung-yau-wai-ching.html)
of [six elected pro-democracy
legislators](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/14/world/asia/hong-kong-court-pro-democracy-lawmakers.html),
essentially arguing that their allegiance to the idea that Hong Kong is
an integral part of China was in doubt.

If four more pro-democracy members of LegCo are ousted from the
provisional Legislature, we will be reduced to less than one-third of
the seats — the threshold for vetoing major bills, such as changes in
the election system or decisions to impeach legislators.

So what should pro-democracy legislators do?

Do we boycott the interim Legislature in protest or in anticipation that
if we participate, we will be run roughshod over — and adding our
unwilling imprimatur to laws we oppose?

Or do we participate in a sham and do our best to stand our ground,
knowing that if we don’t, grievous laws will be passed for sure?

In the lead-up to Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China in 1997, a
provisional Legislature was established to transition away from
colonial-era institutions. Many saw it as
[undemocratic](https://www.hrw.org/legacy/press/pro-legi.htm) — its
[members were selected by a Beijing-appointed
committee](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2012978/explained-how-hong-kongs-legislative-council-has)
— and the pro-democracy camp at the time [refused to take
par](http://www.ipsnews.net/1996/12/hong-kong-two-legislatures-one-in-hong-kong-one-in-shenzhen/)t.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Within a year and a half, that provisional LegCo had passed laws that
[restricted freedom of
assembly](https://www.justicecentre.org.hk/framework/uploads/2018/11/HKUPR-Coalition-Fact-Sheet-Freedom-of-Assembly-Rights-and-Public-Order-Ordinance.pdf)
and [freedom of
association](https://hongkongfp.com/2018/07/19/explainer-hong-kong-seeking-ban-pro-independence-party-using-existing-national-security-laws/),
and it had [repealed a law granting collective bargaining powers to
trade
unions](https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr98-99/chinese/hc/papers/hc2711-m1-ec.pdf).
In 1997, it also passed [the Legislative Council
Ordinance](https://www.legco.gov.hk/general/chinese/procedur/companion/chapter_3/mcp-part1-ch3-n11-ce.pdf),
which helped create the unfair structural design of LegCo today.

What more evils will this next provisional Legislature do to Hong Kong?
How can the Chinese Communist Party be prevented from passing laws to
manipulate future elections here — perhaps even allowing people on the
mainland to vote in them?

Beijing’s overarching intentions with Hong Kong are clear, and it’s also
clear by now that the Hong Kong government is doing nothing but
Beijing’s bidding.

Last week, the police arrested four students, ages 16 to 21, [from a
disbanded pro-independence
group](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3095240/least-three-core-members-hong-kong-pro-independence);
under the new national security law, they could face a life sentence. On
Friday, the Hong Kong authorities [issued arrest warrants for six
activists
abroad](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/07/31/world/asia/31reuters-hongkong-security-exiles.html?searchResultPosition=9),
including one American citizen.

Academics affiliated with the democracy movement are [being
sacked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/world/asia/benny-tai-hong-kong-university.html?campaign_id=7&emc=edit_MBAE_p_20200728&instance_id=20720&nl=morning-briefing&regi_id=65413713&section=whatElse&segment_id=34578&te=1&user_id=bd32fbf008e5183a7928ed61)
by [their
universities](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3046632/occupy-ringleader-shiu-ka-chun-accuses-hong-kong-university).
[Independent
media](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3092957/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-and-12-others-face)
outlets are hounded. A popular satirical TV show produced by Hong Kong’s
public broadcaster [was terminated for mocking the
police](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/05/19/hong-kong-public-broadcaster-axes-satirical-show-hours-after-govt-demands-apology-for-insulting-police/).

Officials are talking about [revising the management of schools and the
curriculum](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3095434/hong-kong-national-security-law-schools-get-new-teaching)
to promote patriotism and a sense of national identity.

Every way I turn, I see red lines being drawn. Anyone who dares to step
over one will be heavily punished.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Chinese Communist Party is well aware of [the international
outcry](https://www.state.gov/on-the-postponement-of-hong-kongs-legislative-council-elections/)
over what it is doing to Hong Kong. No matter; it presses on. Is that
about saving face? Is China truly insecure about its national security?
Does it want to change the world order? I can’t tell.

Whatever the motives, Hong Kong has become a battlefield for a contest
between much larger forces, and the immediate casualties are the rule of
law here and the rightful freedoms of the city’s people.

But all this only gives Hong Kongers more reason, and more conviction,
to fight on, and defeat vested interests by defending our values.

Fernando Cheung is a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council from
