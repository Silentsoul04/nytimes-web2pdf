**To the Editor:**

In “[Perpetuating Segregation With
‘Pods’](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/opinion/pandemic-pods-schools.html?searchResultPosition=1)”
(Op-Ed, July 23), Clara Totenberg Green warns about the worsening of
inequities as schools remain closed and parents with the means to do so
organize small learning groups for their children.

No schooling plans in the time of the coronavirus are going to solve
racism or the disparity between rich and poor. Alluding to white
supremacy won’t help either.

All parents will do what is best for their own children, especially in a
crisis. As poor — and, therefore, many minority — parents have fewer
resources to help their children, the state should come in to address
the inequity. Providing computers, internet access and money for day
care would help, since we failed to address the Covid-19 virus in time
for school to reopen.

Facing the systematic racism in society means changing laws and policies
that disadvantage minority groups. Help addicts and young people rather
than lock them up. Train the police to defuse situations rather than
threaten violence. Ensure fair elections. Provide health care for the
sick and working poor. And so on.

**To the Editor:**

I share the concerns noted in your Op-Ed. My 45 years’ experience as an
educator convinces me that every time more children with greater needs
end up concentrated in the same learning environments, educational
progress suffers.

But let’s use this special moment in our history to have some necessary,
tough conversations and build some critical community bridges. As far as
the learning pods are concerned, perhaps principals and teachers can
make proactive calls today to those parents forming such pods and ask if
they are willing to add some low-income kids, even if their parents
can’t contribute much. Find low-income parents willing to participate
in this arrangement.

Don’t be afraid to try something bold; these children need you to be
strong. Even if only one pod takes you up on your request, it will have
been worth the effort.

**To the Editor:**

I am a public elementary schoolteacher in Minnesota. Last spring, I
struggled to connect with my students online; it was so hard for them to
get the help they needed. They don’t yet have the skills to reach out
electronically when they don’t understand.

This fall, I plan to keep my Zoom room open all the time during school
hours. I’m going to encourage kids to stay there with me, with cameras
and audio off maybe, but just a click away from expert help.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Parents who have the resources to form pods but don’t want to perpetuate
racism can reach out to their schools and volunteer to be a “go to” in
such a virtual space. They could be the encouragers/tech support/problem
explainers that a lot of kids were missing when they were trying to
learn from home. (It would be a great thing for college students looking
for a way to make a difference, too.)

Are there still other problems? Sure. But this would be one way for
people of privilege and means to support the success of all students
while still supporting their students.

**To the Editor:**

Education must be part of the discussion on racial justice.

We need to rethink schooling that isn’t based on an agricultural era
calendar, an industrial era delivery system, inadequate teacher training
and a skimpy curriculum that no longer addresses the whole child living
in today’s multiracial, multicultural world.

The Covid virus has forced us to appreciate how important public
education is to our democracy and our economic success. Shouldn’t we
respond with an education system that is in tune with the times?
