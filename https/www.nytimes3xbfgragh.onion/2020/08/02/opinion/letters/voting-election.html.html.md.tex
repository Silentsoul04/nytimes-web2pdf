Re
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/opinion/sunday/joe-biden-2020.html}{The
Battle for Biden,}'' by Michelle Cottle (Sunday Review, July 26), about
how Joe Biden's ``governing vision is shaping up'' and all the people
looking to influence the candidate's agenda:

The biggest election battle is likely to be over a fair, open,
conflict-free process. Who's safeguarding the ability of the Postal
Service to deliver absentee ballot applications in a timely manner, and
to return the completed ballots likewise? Who is safeguarding the
electorate against intimidation at the polls?

Should we expect uninvited armed militia at our polling stations? Who is
working to guarantee a free flow of information unmuddied by meddlers
intent on retaining the status quo?

As Ms. Cottle writes, ``Joe is gonna be Joe.'' It's up to us to do
everything necessary for the nation to freely make an educated,
unadulterated election choice.

\textbf{To the Editor:}

In
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/opinion/trump-germany.html}{American
Catastrophe Through German Eyes}'' (column, July 25), Roger Cohen
rightly raises the alarm about the prospect that President Trump will
concoct a pretext for invoking a ```state of emergency' if he does not
like the November election result.''

Mr. Trump has been utterly unsubtle about suggesting that if he's
defeated at the polls he'll not step aside, on the notion fully
fabricated in advance that he has been the victim of voter fraud. The
Democrats need to say here and now that so transparently a self-serving
claim of that kind cannot be credited. Now. Not after the fact.

The president and his enablers have to be made to understand that their
attempts at the subversion of democratic processes will be exposed
before they can be implemented. Because after the fact there will be no
turning back.
