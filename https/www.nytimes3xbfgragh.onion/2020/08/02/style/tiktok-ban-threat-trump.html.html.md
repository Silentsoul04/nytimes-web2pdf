# TikTok Ban? Creators and Fans Are Big Mad

</div>

The uncertainty over the future of the wildly popular video app has
brought chaos to its user community — and to the entertainment and
advertising industries as well.

It was a weekend of chaos on TikTok — unleashed on Friday night when
President Trump said, while aboard Air Force One, that he might ban the
video app.

The surprise announcement sent influencers in droves onto livestreams to
give possibly premature [teary and heartfelt
goodbyes](https://twitter.com/iamaliceophelia/status/1289402462957273088)
to their fans, asking them to join them on apps like Instagram, YouTube
and Triller. For agencies that manage talent on the platform, it was a
long weekend of hand-holding and downloading TikTok archives for
posterity.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Some users, in a
last-hurrah bid for virality, reposted TikToks they said had previously
been removed by the service for violating nudity or profanity
guidelines.

Others tried to make light of the situation. Addison Easterling, 19, a
TikTok star who dropped out of Louisiana State University to pursue a
full-time influencer career, [posted a video of
herself](https://vm.tiktok.com/J2T9X8K/) pretending to knock on the
college’s doors to let her back in. “Me at LSU tomorrow,” she captioned
it.

TikTok is known mostly for dance videos and comedic skits, but that
silliness can obscure two facts: TikTok has become a powerhouse in the
entertainment industry and the primary platform that music executives
and talent agents use to scout the next big act. And, at the same time,
especially as the election nears, the app has become an information and
organizing hub for Gen Z activists and politically-minded young people.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TikTok has had a fraught relationship with the United States government
for some time. Several administration officials, including the
president, fear the app is a security risk because its parent company,
ByteDance, is Chinese, potentially giving the Chinese government access
to American user data. TikTok and ByteDance have vehemently denied any
relationship with the Chinese government.

The president’s comments suggesting he would shut down TikTok in the
United States stalled ByteDance’s negotiations to sell the app to
Microsoft as a way to address the security concerns. On Sunday,
[Microsoft said that it had resumed
talks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html)
after consulting with the president, giving some hope to users that the
app would survive.

Young users say TikTok is a crucial outlet for education about climate
change, systemic racism and the Black Lives Matter movement. The talk of
a ban only politicized them further, with many TikTokers believing Mr.
Trump’s threats were a direct response to their campaigns against him.

“TikTok is to Black Lives Matter what Twitter was to the Arab Spring,”
said Kareem Rahma, 34, a TikTok creator with nearly 400,000 followers on
the app. Mr. Rahma’s TikToks from the Black Lives Matter protests in
Minneapolis garnered tens of millions of views. “I saw a lot of youth on
the ground TikToking the protests as opposed to livestreaming, tweeting
or Instagramming,” he said. “The conversations these kids are having
with each other are essential.”

In June, teenage TikTok users [claimed responsibility for inflating
attendance
expectations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html),
leading to rows upon rows of empty seats, for Mr. Trump’s rally in
Tulsa, Okla., after thousands of them registered for tickets to the
event that they had no plans to redeem.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TikTok users have also waged coordinated campaigns to rate Mr. Trump’s
businesses poorly on Google, to spam online surveys aimed at Trump
supporters with useless information and to damage the Trump campaign’s
e-commerce store by collecting in their shopping baskets items they
never intend to buy.

Ellie Zeiler, 16, who has 6.3 million followers on TikTok, said that Mr.
Trump’s threat to ban the app may even sway more [young people to vote
against
him](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-s-threatened-tiktok-ban-could-motivate-young-users-vote-n1235587).
“I think that a lot of people didn’t like Trump before, and this has
driven people to not like him even more,” she said.

“For many kids, politics feel very distant,” said Eitan Bernath, 18, who
has 1.2 million followers on TikTok. “This might be the first time it
hits home for a lot of kids.”

On Sunday, nine TikTok creators with a collective 54 million followers,
including Brittany Broski, Hope Schwing and Mitchell Crawford, published
an open letter addressed to Mr. Trump on
[Medium](https://medium.com/@whoismax/dear-president-trump-an-open-letter-from-the-tiktok-creator-community-e56b21c682fb).

“TikTok has enabled the kinds of interactions that could never take
place on the likes of Facebook and Instagram,” they
[wrote](https://medium.com/@whoismax/dear-president-trump-an-open-letter-from-the-tiktok-creator-community-e56b21c682fb).
“Our generation has grown up on the internet, but our vision of the
internet is going to require more than two gatekeepers. Why not use this
as an opportunity to level the playing field?” they urged.

Vanessa Pappas, the general manager of TikTok North America, attempted
to quell concerns on Saturday. “We’re not planning on going anywhere,”
she said in a [statement released on the
app](https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1289579919358545920).

The TikTok creator Curtis Newbill, 24, is one of thousands of young
creators who has found fame through the app.

When he walked into a friend’s house in Los Angeles on Friday night, his
stomach sank. He was there for a gathering with fellow TikTok stars
known as the Sway Boys. “They were like, ‘Did you hear about TikTok?
It’s getting banned,’” Mr. Newbill said.

Mr. Newbill’s next few hours were a blur. He remained at the gathering
and tried not to think about the situation, but a pit in his stomach
grew throughout the night. He went live on the app, telling his [4.3
million followers](https://www.tiktok.com/@curtisnewbill) to follow him
on Instagram.

All night, Mr. Newbill fielded a barrage of texts from concerned family
and friends. He stayed up until 6:30 a.m., waiting for any information
about his future.

Like thousands of other entertainers who have made the pilgrimage to Los
Angeles in the [most recent West Coast entertainment gold
rush](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html),
Mr. Newbill relies solely on income from TikTok to make a living. “I
live song deal to song deal,” he said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The loss of TikTok would upend large swaths of the entertainment
industry that have just been completely reoriented around the app.

TikTok has rewritten the pop charts, becoming a new default for how
labels and aspiring artists promote their songs. And TikTok is where
major brands like American Eagle, Chipotle and others spend millions to
reach the next generation of consumers.

“I’ve lost brand deals in the past week,” Ms. Zeiler said. “They’re
saying, ‘We don’t want to do this anymore.’ They’re worried if TikTok
gets taken down, they’re not going to get their full potential on the
deal.”

Management teams worked all night on Friday to back up their clients’
videos using [FYP. RIP,](https://www.fyp.rip/) a tool that downloads
users' TikTok videos and emails them copies. Several managers held
conference calls with skittish brands that were seeking to cancel deals.
“We’re preparing for the worst,” said Mario Ayuso, an influencer
manager.

“A lot of the newer talent I work with began their career on TikTok and
it has been the foundation for everything they know today,” said Keith
Dorsey, another talent manager. “They are concerned, worried and
somewhat freaked out. One of them actually planned on quitting his job
tomorrow to take his TikTok career to the next level. Our group chats
are on fire right now.”

## Emerging platforms and competitors see a moment

If the app’s potential shutdown or instability around a sudden sale has
any silver lining, it’s a flood of new users to smaller platforms.
[Clash](https://create.clashapp.co/appstore), a new short-form video app
founded by Brendon McNerney, a former Vine star, became available on
Friday night after the news and shot up the app store rankings on
Saturday. Byte and Dubsmash, two other short form video apps, have also
begun actively recruiting TikTok stars.

Last Wednesday, Triller, an app that functions similarly to TikTok,
announced it had [hired the 18-year-old TikTok star Josh
Richards](https://www.businessinsider.com/triller-names-tiktok-star-josh-richards-strategy-head-seeks-funding-2020-7)
as the platform’s chief strategy officer, and successfully wooed Mr.
Richards along with two other large TikTok stars, Griffin Johnson, 21,
and Noah Beck, 19, to join the platform as investors.

Instagram is also offering TikTok creators deals of hundreds of
thousands of dollars to create content on Reels, its new product with
similarities, according to [The Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600?mod=hp_lead_pos3).

Perez Hilton, a longtime celebrity news chronicler who has
[amassed 850,000 followers on
TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@perezhilton), said he hoped that just
the threat of a ban would serve as a note of caution for the young
talent on the app. “These influencers on TikTok can’t have all their
eggs in one basket,” he said. “You have to be everywhere,” he said, if
you want to stay famous.

“You need to hustle,” he said. “A lot of the TikTokers that are just
pretty, those are the ones that are really going to struggle. Pretty
doesn’t age well and it doesn’t translate. The ones that are willing to
work on and off TikTok and other platforms, they’re the ones that will
be able to continue to thrive.”
