Tropical Storm Isaias scrapes the Florida coast.

Floridians along the state’s Atlantic coast hunkered down on Sunday as
Tropical Storm Isaias plowed northward just offshore, whipping the state
with high winds, rain and the threat of flash floods as it went.

At 11 p.m. Eastern time, the center of the storm was about 50 miles off
the Central Florida coast, near Cape Canaveral, and was moving
north-northwest at about nine miles an hour, according to the [National
Hurricane
Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/020856.shtml?).
It had strengthened slightly from earlier in the day, with sustained
winds of 70 m.p.h., only 4 m.p.h. below hurricane strength.

Isaias — (which is written Isaías in Spanish and pronounced
ees-ah-EE-ahs) — clobbered the Bahamas with hurricane conditions on
Saturday and early Sunday after hitting parts of Puerto Rico and the
Dominican Republic. It weakened to a tropical storm Saturday
evening.

Flooding from the storm’s heavy rains led to the death of at least one
person in Puerto Rico, the island’s Department of Public Safety said on
Saturday in a statement. A woman who had been missing since Thursday
drowned near Rincón, in the northwest portion of the island.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The center of the storm skirted the coast of Florida on Sunday without
making landfall, and the southern part of the coast was left largely
unscathed, aside from scattered power outages. Only about 200 people in
Palm Beach County stayed at public shelters, out of a population of
[almost 1.5
million](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscover.pbcgov.org%2Fpages%2Fpbc_facts.aspx),
according to Bill Johnson, the county director of emergency management.

“We are blessed that Hurricane Isaías spared us of significant damage,”
Mr. Johnson said at a news conference Sunday. “I am pleased that this
was more of an exercise than a real event — something we should all be
grateful of.”

Forecasters said the storm would track northward and could fluctuate a
bit in strength before coming ashore in the Carolinas on Monday.
Hurricane watches were posted from South Santee River, S.C., north to
Surf City, N.C., and tropical storm watches are posted all the way to
Rhode Island. Forecasters said the storm had the potential to spawn
tornadoes in the Carolinas on Monday.

Complicating the emergency response to the storm, reported coronavirus
cases continue to rise sharply in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas,
and health officials have warned that their health care systems could be
strained beyond capacity with the influx of new patients. The situation
would worsen if the storm knocks out power across wide areas or forces
evacuations of hospitals and nursing homes.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two long-haul travelers taking a red-eye flight from the International
Space Station arrived in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida panhandle on
Sunday, working their way around Isaias’ rough weather.

Robert L. Behnken and Douglas G. Hurley, the astronauts who blasted off
to the space station in May in the Crew Dragon capsule built and
operated by SpaceX, the rocket company started by Elon Musk, pushed off
from the orbiting outpost on Saturday night.

Suspended under four giant billowing orange-and-white parachutes, the
Crew Dragon settled into calm waters near Pensacola, Fla. at a gentle
pace of 15 miles per hour on Sunday afternoon. Two small SpaceX boats
arrived quickly to begin the operation to prepare the capsule to be
pulled out by the main recovery ship, where crews will tend to the
spacecraft’s passengers.

It was the first water landing by NASA since 1975, when the agency’s
crews were still flying in the Apollo modules used for the historic
American moon missions.

NASA and SpaceX selected seven potential sites in the Atlantic Ocean and
Gulf of Mexico where the capsule and its passengers could splash down.
But the track of Isaias ruled out the three in the Atlantic, so they
chose the site near Pensacola.

At the splashdown site, winds must be less than 10 miles an hour, and
there are additional constraints on waves and rain. In addition,
helicopters that take part in the recovery of the capsule must be able
to fly and land safely.

South Carolina’s popular tourist destinations had their fingers crossed
on Sunday, hoping the storm would continue to be less fearsome than
forecast, as it has so far in Florida.

The [National Weather Service is
predicting](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/NWSCharlestonSC) storm
surges of 2 to 4 feet, some flooding and perhaps a tornado in the
Charleston area Sunday night and Monday as the storm moves north
offshore, toward an expected landfall farther up the coast. City
officials have opened four elevated garages where residents can[park

in case of flooding.

Some business owners are worried that a one-two punch of the virus and a
powerful storm could push their establishments over the edge. The[Two
Meeting Street Inn](https://www.twomeetingstreetinn.com/), a waterfront
bed and breakfast in Charleston, was shut down in March over virus
concerns and hoped to reopen Aug. 15, but may now have to wait until
September.

“It’s been devastating for us,” said Julie Spell Roberts, whose family
has owned the inn since 1946. “Our biggest season is March, April and
May. Pretty much that’s when the money is made to keep you afloat for
the rest of the year.”

Extreme weather is a threat the family has experience with. Ms. Spell
Roberts’ mother remained at the inn during Hurricane Hugo, a
[Category 4](https://www.weather.gov/chs/Hugo-30thAnniversary) storm
that ravaged the city in 1989.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To prepare, the family has taken the furniture off the porch and cleared
the property of anything that might smash a wall or window. “What we
have learned over time is that you’re foolish if you don’t think that
Mother Nature is a formidable foe, because she is,” Ms. Spell Roberts
said.

Farther north, Myrtle Beach is preparing for a “lower to moderate
threat” to arrive Monday night, said Steve Pfaff, a National Weather
Service meteorologist, with sustained winds around 50 to 60 miles an
hour and gusts up to 70. Four to six inches of rain could lead to flash
flooding in places with drainage problems, and some areas may get more.

For businesses away from the shoreline, “it’s a wait and see game,” said
Jay Slevin, general manager of Mellow Mushroom, a pizzeria a mile and a
half from the ocean in Myrtle Beach. “We’re not boarding anything up,”
he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent weeks as the coronavirus has been resurgent in many parts of
the country, experts and politicians alike have implored people to
protect themselves and others by always wearing a face mask in public.

Does that apply when you have to be out in the gusting wind and driving
rain? Our health columnist Tara Parker-Pope says probably not: Face
masks [aren’t as
effective](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/infection-control/the-effectiveness-of-surgical-face-masks-what-the-literature-shows-30-09-2003/)
when they are wet.

For one thing, it’s much harder to breathe through a wet mask than a dry
one, Ms. Parker-Pope notes. And on top of that, a moist or wet mask
doesn’t filter as well as a dry mask. The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, which recommends mask-wearing in general, says they
[should not be worn when doing things that may get the mask
wet.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It doesn’t take a tropical storm to drench a mask, of course. They can
become soaked with condensation from your breath or sweat from your
face, and some people think of wetting them deliberately to cool off in
hot weather. But the harm done is the same, wherever the moisture comes
from.

A paper surgical mask that gets soaked should probably be discarded, Ms.
Parker-Pope advises, but a cloth mask can be washed, dried and re-used.

If rain is coming down in buckets, social distancing is not likely to be
a problem, and any viral particles exhaled by an infected person
probably would be quickly diluted by gusting wind and rain. So there is
little need to wear a mask out in a rainstorm, Ms. Parker-Pope notes:
“In fact, you should take it off and keep it dry, so if you need to
duck into a store to wait out the storm, you have a dry mask to wear
indoors.”

While Isaias’ gusting winds remain capable of significant damage, its
heavy rains may be the biggest punch the storm packs. Much of the East
Coast of the United States will get a soaking, forecasters say.

With 3 to 6 inches expected across the eastern Carolinas and Virginia
and isolated areas getting up to 8 inches, significant flash floods and
urban flooding is can be expected through the middle of the week, and
widespread minor to moderate river flooding is possible in the region.

Southeastern New York and New England can expect almost as much rain
when the storm reaches there Tuesday and Wednesday, while northeast
Florida and coastal Georgia are likely to get 1 to 3 inches before
Isaias moves away north, forecasters said.

in some areas. Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on Friday.

“With the right protection and sheltering, we can keep people safe from
the storm while at the same time trying to avoid making the pandemic
worse,” Mr. Cooper said on Twitter. “A hurricane during a pandemic is
double trouble. But the state has been carefully preparing for this
scenario.”

A number of inland counties in North Carolina have been hit twice in
recent years by river flooding — [by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and
Hurricane Florence

Justin Harrington, a manager of a Big Blue hardware store in inland
Kinston, N.C., said customers had started stocking up on generators,
flashlights and gas cans. So far, the store is planning to stay open,
“as long as it’s not as bad as past storms.”

Summer in Florida, with its routine thunderstorms, sweaty nights and

bureau chief,
writes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/florida-hurricane-isaias-coronavirus.html).

A public health crisis. An economic calamity, with more than a million
[Floridians out of

and an unemployment payment system that was one of the slowest in the

that the inevitable convergence of the pandemic and the weather is
likely to play out again, and perhaps much more seriously than this
relatively mild storm, before this nightmare season ends.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It should be too early to worry much about storms in Florida, Ms. Mazzei
writes, but this annus horribilis would not have it any other way.

“It’s just kind of been the way 2020’s gone so far,” said Howard Tipton,
the administrator for St. Lucie County, on Florida’s Treasure Coast.
“But we roll with it, right? We don’t get to determine the cards that
we’re dealt.”

Kevin Cho, 31, a Florida National Guard captain and a nurse practitioner
who treats Covid-19 patients in the intensive care units of several
Miami public hospitals, said the approach of the storm was “really
stretching our limits.”

Many poor people contracting the disease “are losing their jobs, and now
they’re faced with a hurricane,” he added. “How could they prepare for a
hurricane when they have been exhausted of every resource they have?
This hurricane is only going to make things worse.”

Isaias blew away from the Bahamas on Sunday after pummeling the
low-lying islands with heavy rain and high winds for most of the
weekend. The storm left parts of Grand Bahama drenched with more than a
foot of rain, and other islands in the archipelago were suffering from
minor flooding and downed trees and power lines.

No storm-related deaths have been reported in the country, where
memories are still raw from Hurricane Dorian, which ravaged Abaco and
Grand Bahama last year and left at least 74 people dead. Many residents
of the islands are still living in tents or in unrepaired houses that
were damaged during Dorian. According to a report in May by the
International Organization for Migration, the islands also lack an
adequate supply of hurricane shelters.

The coronavirus pandemic has made rebuilding more difficult, and
weakened the country’s tourism-dependent economy, leaving the Bahamas
particularly vulnerable this hurricane season.

The country locked down in March after recording its first few
coronavirus infections, and it seemed to have the outbreak under
control, with just 104 cases by July 1, when it reopened for
international travel. Soon after that, though, cases began to surge,
with Grand Bahama emerging as a hot spot. The island was in the midst of
a new two-week lockdown when tropical storm warnings were posted on
Thursday.

The prime minister, Hubert Minnis, temporarily relaxed the restrictions
to allow residents to prepare, but fear of the virus remained a
significant obstacle. Some people were hesitant to venture out for
supplies, and many were afraid to seek refuge in shelters where there
was no clear pan for social distancing.

Another storm may lurk behind Isaias, but on a less dangerous track.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are tracking another
potential tropical cyclone that could develop in the western Atlantic in
the next five days.

But so far, they say, the odds of it becoming even a tropical
depression, with sustained winds up to 38 miles an hour, are only 60
percent. And its path would probably be well west and north of the major
islands of the Caribbean and the Bahamas, far from the continental
shore.

It would have to strengthen further still, to sustained winds of 39
m.p.h. or greater, to qualify as a named storm. Right now, it’s just
“Disturbance 1” — the only other system on the center’s Atlantic map
besides Isaias.
