<div class="css-53u6y8">

This month, many colleges around the country plan to welcome back
thousands of students into something they hope will resemble normal
campus life. But they face challenges unlike any other American
institution — containing the coronavirus among a young, impulsive
population that not only studies together, but lives together, parties
together, and, if decades of history are any guide, sleeps together.

It will be a hugely complex and costly endeavor requiring far more than
just the reconfiguring of dorm rooms and cafeterias and the construction
of annexes and tent classrooms to increase social distancing. It also
crucially involves the creation of testing programs capable of serving
communities the size of small cities and the enforcement of codes of
conduct among students not eager to be policed.

Who will be tested for the coronavirus and how quickly can they get
results? Will mask wearing be mandated? And what will happen to
tailgating, keg parties and sneaking into your partner’s dorm room?
Colleges are mapping strategies as varied as the contrasting Covid
regulations enacted by the states, reflecting the culture and leadership
of their schools.

Syracuse is vowing to play the strict parent, requiring students to sign
codes of conduct with penalties for violating Covid-19 rules more severe
than the punishment for smoking marijuana. But the University of
Kentucky is presenting a more lenient front, adopting existing honor
codes that urge students to “promote personal responsibility and peer
accountability.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the University of Texas-Austin has prohibited students from holding
parties on or off campus, banned overnight guests in dorm rooms and
warned students that they can be disciplined for “purposefully invading
the personal space of others,” at least without a face mask on.

All of these efforts are coming at great cost, potentially adding more
than $70 billion to the budgets of the nation’s 5,000 colleges. Yet
college administrators say giving their constituents — students and
their families — at least a taste of college life is worth it, if done
in the safest possible way. Whether those constituents agree is an open
question, and complaints about tuition have led a growing number of
schools to offer rebates.

It is still possible that the frantic planning will come to naught.
Almost daily, universities that had released detailed plans for
in-person classes this semester have reversed themselves and said they
will go almost entirely online. On Friday, the University of
Pennsylvania became the latest, announcing that almost all undergraduate
classes would be taught online and that undergraduates returning to
Philadelphia, regardless of whether they were living on or off campus,
would have to take a minimum of two Covid tests to participate in any
Penn activities this fall.

“We have learned how to close safely,” Hiram Chodosh, president of
Claremont McKenna College, a liberal arts school in Claremont, Calif.,
said. “But the big question now is, can we open safely?”

Testing capacity, a problem in communities throughout the country,
varies widely among schools and could play a major role in whether they
can remain open during an outbreak.

Big schools, from Syracuse University to the University of California,
San Diego, that have connections to labs, health programs or medical
schools say they are capable of processing large numbers of Covid tests
in 24 to 48
hours.

In a typical big-school plan, the University of California, Berkeley,
will test all residential **** students within 24 hours of their
arrival, for free, using either a standard nasal swab or[a saliva
test](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/06/30/uc-berkeley-launches-trial-of-saliva-test-for-covid-19/)
being developed by an internationally renowned genomics research lab on
campus. Students will subsequently be sequestered for 7 to 10 days,
leaving their single dorm rooms only to go (masked) to the bathroom or
to pick up a meal from a central location in the building or outside,
then retested. If they test positive, they’ll be isolated in a special
dorm. (Some schools hope to create supportive communities, along the
lines of an old-fashioned TB sanitarium, for students who test
positive.) After that, everyone living on campus will be tested
regularly, twice a month, if the spit test proves to be accurate enough.

But little Cornell College in Iowa, with only 1,000 students, is not
doing universal testing on arrival, believing that it would give a false
sense of security because of the incubation period. The school will be
doing randomized rapid testing of 3 percent of its asymptomatic students
per week through its health center, which will take just a few minutes
to get results. It will reserve the more sophisticated testing, with the
help of the county health department, for students who show symptoms.
Other small schools in similar situations are finding themselves at the
mercy of private labs that can take days to deliver results, making
results almost meaningless.

But even some big schools are worried about testing backlogs. “If we
have to wait days for a result,” said Michael Haynie, Syracuse’s vice
chancellor of Strategic Initiatives and Innovation, “the quarantine
requirements will overwhelm us before we even get started.”

Alison Byerly, president of Lafayette College, in Easton, Pa., cited
worries about testing supplies as a reason to shift all classes online,
and to ask most students to study from home.

  
Cost is an issue. Delaware State University, an historically black
college, is among several that have enlisted the nonprofit Testing for
America and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, among others, to help
finance its testing program.

So is personal freedom. Despite Florida’s high infection rate, the
University of Florida has declined to force students to be tested,
worrying some local officials and residents in Gainesville who fear that
students could cause an outbreak in the city. Although Florida has among
[the highest per
capita](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
rates of infection in the country, the university is mandating testing
only for athletes, those who report Covid-19 symptoms and a few other
exceptions. “The Gator Nation will not be deterred,” says the school’s
[reopening
plan](https://coronavirus.ufl.edu/media/coronavirusufledu/Reopening-Plan.pdf).

“We’re a public institution, so constitutional considerations come into
play in terms of what we require — and how we will be able to enforce
that requirement,” said Ken Garcia, a campus spokesman, in an email. And
testing backlogs are a major issue, university officials said in a
[university
webcast](https://mediasite.video.ufl.edu/Mediasite/Play/175687a86d7f49069f03f9e60e3ed70b1d).

Equally daunting is the task of regulating the behavior of an age group
known for its risk-taking behavior.

Many schools have adopted social compacts and behavior codes. Masks are
a key part of almost every code, to be worn except in situations like
brushing teeth, walking alone outside, or being alone in a dorm room.

Most ban partying or socializing outside “social pods” — the small
groups of students that some colleges are assigning students to, usually
based on their dorms. Penalties for code violations range from being
kicked out of class and counseled, to eviction from campus housing and
expulsion.

The word “sex” is not mentioned in the typical behavior code. Some
colleges may try to prohibit overnight visits in dorms, and many are
stressing the obvious risks intimate contact poses of spreading the
virus. But most administrators seem to believe that a rule banning sex
is unrealistic, and are quietly hoping that students will use common
sense and refrain from, say, having it with people outside their
pod.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“I think at some point, if you treat young people like adults, they are
going to act like adults,” Gordon Gee, the president of West Virginia
University, said. “In the end, we’re not going to patrol every aspect of
their lives.”

Or, as one official at another college, put it: “Could there be love in
the pod? I guess so.”

The behavior codes generally apply both on and off campus, though they
are clearly harder to enforce off-campus, and some students say that
they immediately began looking for off-campus housing when they realized
where rules would be strictly supervised.

The rules of local governments also apply.

“In Berkeley, indoor gatherings which would constitute a party or are
outside of your social pod are forbidden,” Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for
the university, said. “So we are and are going to remain consistent with
what the city’s rules are, and we have to run everything through them.”

But students say social pods, especially when assigned by
administrators, could quickly fracture if one or two students have a
falling out.

West Virginia University has persuaded the governor to shut down bars
serving students at its Morgantown campus after a Covid outbreak in the
area, Mr. Gee said. It has been in effect for about two weeks, and he
would like to renew it.

“Bars get people together in small places, and they cause these kids to
really really, really get too damn close to each other,” Mr. Gee
said.

Travel restrictions are also common. In an email to students at the
University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School two weeks ago, before the
school went mainly online, Maryellen Reilly, deputy vice dean, said that
students would be expected to limit all unnecessary travel.

“Does this mean that if your spouse or partner lives in D.C. or N.Y.
that you can’t go visit for the weekend?,” her email said.
“Unfortunately, yes. The risk of bringing germs back and forth is too
great — this also means we ask that you don’t have visitors who could be
traveling with the virus.”

Already some students are pushing back against codes of conduct and
choosing either to skip the semester or live off-campus, where they can
control their own environment.

Maria Gray, a junior at Bates College in Maine, was horrified when she
paged through enrollment documents and found that she was being asked to
sign a legal document with her digital PIN. “I acknowledge and agree
that by committing to attend Bates College as an on-campus residential
student, I am voluntarily assuming any and all risks,” the statement
said, ending with a warning that the outcome of getting sick with
Covid-19 could be “disability, or even death.”

That document was scary enough. But then on Friday, the school sent her
an email saying that students could have to evacuate campus within 24-48
hours if there were an outbreak, and to bring only what they could
easily pack. That made a closing seem inevitable.

“I have faith in people to be responsible and understand the stakes,”
said Ms. Gray, who now plans to study online at her home in Portland,
Ore. “But also, this shouldn’t be a life or death thing. The stakes just
got really high really fast.”
