# Scientists Worry About Political Influence Over Coronavirus Vaccine Project

Operation Warp Speed has moved along at a rapid clip. But some people

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In April, with hospitals overwhelmed and much of the United States in
lockdown, the Department of Health and Human Services produced a
presentation for the White House arguing that rapid development of a
[coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
was the best hope to control the pandemic.

“DEADLINE: Enable broad access to the public by October 2020**,**” the
first slide read, with the date in bold.

Given that it typically takes years to develop a vaccine, the timetable
for the initiative, called [Operation Warp
Speed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-operation-warp-speed.html),
was incredibly ambitious. With tens of thousands dying and tens of
millions out of work, the crisis demanded an all-out public-private
response, with the government supplying billions of dollars to
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, providing logistical support
and cutting through red tape.

It escaped no one that the proposed deadline also intersected nicely
with President Trump’s need to curb the virus before the election in
November.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The ensuing race for a vaccine — in the middle of a campaign in which
the president’s handling of the pandemic is the key issue after he has
spent his time in office [undermining
science](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/climate/trump-coronavirus-climate-science.html)
and [the expertise of the federal
bureaucracy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/climate/trump-hurricane-dorian-noaa.html)
— is now testing the system set up to ensure safe and effective drugs to
a degree never before seen.

Under constant pressure from a White House anxious for good news and a
public desperate for a silver bullet to end the crisis, the government’s
researchers are fearful of political intervention in the coming months
and are struggling to ensure that the government maintains the right
balance between speed and rigorous regulation, according to interviews
with administration officials, federal scientists and outside experts.

Even in a less politically charged environment, there would be a fraught
debate about how much to accelerate the process of trials and approval.
The longer that vaccines are tested before being released, the likelier
they are to be safe and effective.

But with 1,000 people dying each day in the United States, [schools
finding it difficult to
reopen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html)
and the [deep
recession](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)
inflicting economic pain across the country, the desire to find a way to
return to normal life is powerful and transcends partisan politics and
borders. On Sunday, Russia
[announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/world/europe/russia-trials-vaccine-October.html)
that it planned to start a nationwide inoculation campaign in October
with a vaccine that had yet to complete clinical trials, the latest
evidence of the global potential for cutting corners.

Despite concerted efforts by the Trump administration and a bevy of
pharmaceutical companies it is working with, the original October target
has slipped, with the administration now pushing to have hundreds of
millions of doses available by the end of the year or early 2021.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But experts inside and outside the government still say they fear the
White House will push the Food and Drug Administration to overlook
insufficient data and give at least limited emergency approval to a
vaccine, perhaps for use by specific groups like front-line health care
workers, before the vote on Nov. 3.

“There are a lot of people on the inside of this process who are very
nervous about whether the administration is going to reach their hand
into the Warp Speed bucket, pull out one or two or three vaccines, and
say, ‘We’ve tested it on a few thousand people, it looks safe, and now
we are going to roll it out,’” said Dr. Paul A. Offit of the University
of Pennsylvania, who is a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s
vaccine advisory committee.

“They are really worried about that,” he added. “And they should be.”

Mr. Trump relentlessly touts progress toward a vaccine, raising hopes of
quick approval. [Touring a North Carolina biotechnology
lab](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/us/100000007258794/trump-boasts-vaccine-progress-north-carolina.html)
last week, he vowed to “deliver a vaccine in record time.” In [a
tweet](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1283566319405797378)
last month, he explicitly tied vaccines to his re-election hopes.

“We expect to have a vaccine available very, very early before the end
of the year, far ahead of schedule,” he said. “We’re very close to
having that finalized.”

The president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who is
helping to steer the re-election campaign from the White House, is a
regular participant in meetings of a board formed to oversee the vaccine
effort.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While White House officials do not specifically mention the election
during the board’s discussions, people familiar with the conversations
say they ask regularly about October, a date that hangs over the effort.
Trump campaign advisers privately call a pre-election vaccine “the holy
grail.”

The Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a new vaccine is
typically an exhaustive process, where agency employees meticulously go
through data from clinical trials to review whether the vaccine is both
safe and effective. The threshold for approving vaccines is typically
higher than it is for therapeutic drugs because they will be used in
millions of otherwise healthy people, meaning that even rare side
effects could affect many more people than a drug that treats a specific
illness.

An independent advisory panel of outside experts also weighs in, and
while the agency has the power to make its own decision, it typically
follows the advice of its outside panels. The Food and Drug
Administration’s senior regulator has the power to approve or deny
vaccines for emergency use, but that decision could be overridden by the
agency’s top leaders, or by the secretary of health and human services.

White House officials said that Mr. Trump would not distort the vaccine
review process to help his campaign. “The rapid research, development,
trials and eventual distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine is emblematic of
President Trump’s highest priority: the health and safety of the
American people,” said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. “It has
nothing to do with politics.”

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers on Friday that he remained
“cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this
year and as we go into 2021.”

Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration,
has not ruled out emergency approval of a vaccine.

“We would consider using an emergency use authorization if we felt that
the risks associated with the vaccine were much lower than the risks of
not having a vaccine,” he told The Journal of the American Medical
Association in an [online
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdmaU2-C_wE&amp;feature=youtu.be).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He also said regulators would certify that any vaccine would meet the
agency’s rigorous standards, adding, “My job as commissioner is to make
sure to the fullest extent possible that any pressure that comes to the
agency is not reflected downward” onto regulators and scientists
studying the vaccines.

At the same time, a senior administration official refused to promise
that any emergency approval of a vaccine would be vetted through the
Food and Drug Administration’s outside advisory panel of experts,
scheduled to meet on Oct. 22.

[Operation Warp Speed got its start in
April](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-operation-warp-speed.html),
the brainchild of Dr. Peter Marks, a pencil-thin, bespectacled physician
who leads the regulatory unit at the Food and Drug Administration that
approves vaccines and therapies.

A “Star Trek” fan, Dr. Marks named the initiative Warp Speed and pitched
it in an April 10 phone call to Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health
and human services, who quickly embraced it. In a follow-up phone call a
few days later, according to a person familiar with the discussions,
several health officials said the October deadline was unrealistic; over
the next few months, officials began publicly citing the end of the year
or early 2021 as a target.

[With his job on the
line](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-azar.html),
Mr. Azar, the target of Mr. Trump’s wrath over the
virus[,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-azar.html)
was especially eager to prove his worth to the White House. He teamed up
with Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, whose department has long
experience with vaccine development and distribution to protect troops.
An expert in complex logistics, Gen. Gustave F. Perna, became the
operation’s chief operating officer.

Mr. Kushner, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus
coordinator, and others interviewed Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a pharmaceutical
industry veteran, and orchestrated his appointment as chief scientific
adviser despite concerns within the Food and Drug Administration about
[conflicts of
interest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/politics/vaccine-Slaoui-coronavirus-trump.html)
because of his financial ties to two companies that are developing a
vaccine. Rather than being bothered by the conflict, Mr. Kushner and
others reasoned that it took someone with such industry experience to
oversee the
effort.

Dr. Slaoui resigned from the board of Moderna, which has received nearly
$1 billion in federal support to develop a vaccine. But as of May he
still had nearly $10 million of stock in GlaxoSmithKline, a partner with
the French drugmaker Sanofi, which last week signed a $2.1 billion
agreement to produce 100 million doses. Dr. Slaoui, who is working on a
$1 contract, cleared an ethics review by the Department of Health and
Human Services and has said [he is determined to avoid any
conflict](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shortly after Dr. Slaoui’s appointment, Dr. Marks resigned from the
project he conceived and returned full-time to his post as a senior
regulator at the Food and Drug Administration, where he will be the key
decision maker on whether a vaccine merits approval.

The administration has conducted the vaccine hunt with a focus lacking
in much of the rest of its pandemic response. Contracts have been
executed at a brisk pace. Mobile trailers have been speedily delivered
for experimental doses to be administered. When a company was short on
needles, the Pentagon dispatched planes to deliver supplies within 48
hours.

The pharmaceutical companies are reporting the results of their trials
at regular intervals, accelerating the review process. With the
government paying much of the cost, the companies are beginning the
process of manufacturing millions of doses of vaccine essentially on
spec so that they can be distributed quickly if they secure approval.

The process has [moved at a remarkable
clip](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/health/cornavirus-vaccine-moderna.html).
Two vaccine candidates, one developed by Moderna in conjunction with Dr.
Fauci’s institute and another by Pfizer, last week [began Phase 3

the final stage of clinical experimentation. Others are expected soon.

In Mr. Azar’s conference room at the Department of Health and Human
Services headquarters, Mr. Kushner and Dr. Birx join meetings with Mr.
Azar, Mr. Esper and others. Mr. Kushner repeatedly pushes the group to
move faster and has deputized two close associates, Brad Smith and Adam
Boehler, to press the case.

The team has sought to ensure that a variety of different types of
potential vaccines are being pursued to increase the chances that at
least one will work. Dr. Birx has been interested in what is known as a
subunit protein vaccine, and at one point called executives at the
biotechnology company Genentech and asked what they could do. (Warp

pursuing that type of vaccine.)

Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, also talks with
pharmaceutical executives. People briefed on the discussions say the
White House has also pushed for progress by the fall on therapeutics —
drugs to treat people who fall ill to the disease — including the
possibility of an emergency use authorization for one or more of those
drugs. Late last month, Mr. Trump called the chief executive of
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to check on the progress of a potential
antibody
treatment.

Career officials have assured Dr. Hahn that they would stand behind him
to head off any vaccine decision not based on science. But Dr. Hahn
already lost a measure of credibility with the scientific community for
approving the emergency use of [hydroxychloroquine and
chloroquine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trial.html),
two anti-malaria drugs [promoted by the
president](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
as treatments for the coronavirus over the objections of his public
health advisers. The Food and Drug Administration later [revoked the
authorization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html),
concluding the risks outweighed the benefits.

Scientists have argued that it would be unwise to cut corners on a
vaccine that is to be injected into some 300 million Americans, adding
that a failed effort would [fuel public distrust of vaccines
generally](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-anti-vaccine.html).

But a senior White House official, who discussed the matter on the
condition of anonymity, said that it would also be unethical to withhold
an effective vaccine for an extra three or four months while more people
died just to check the boxes of a more routine trial process.

Michael R. Caputo, a spokesman for Mr. Azar, said October was not the
goal.

“Everybody at H.H.S. hopes Operation Warp Speed will achieve 300 million
doses of a safe and effective Covid vaccine for Americans by January
2021,” he said. “We know that’s optimistic. I have never heard mention
of any other timeline, and certainly not from the secretary.”

“Careless talk about career F.D.A. regulators somehow approving an
unsafe and ineffective vaccine just for politics only undermines
confidence in the public health system,” he added.

It is not clear that a vaccine approval shortly before the election
would be an “October surprise” sufficient to alter the outcome of the
vote. An announcement could give Americans hope that the end is in
sight. But some Republican strategists said that it might not help Mr.
Trump because his opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
the presumptive Democratic nominee, would surely continue the vaccine
process if elected.

“Does it turn everything around for him politically? I don’t know,” said
Sarah Longwell, a conservative strategist and prominent Republican
opponent of Mr. Trump who regularly conducts focus groups and has found
that public attention is more focused on government relief checks and
school reopenings.

“If the vaccine is an October surprise, there’s a lot of other things
that are cutting against” it as a game-changer, she said.

The drug companies find themselves caught in the middle. While eager to
bring products to market as quickly as possible, they face risks in
moving too quickly in order to fit an election calendar, analysts said.

“They are acutely aware of the political dynamic here,” said Rob Smith,
the director of Capital Alpha Partners, a research firm. A vaccine that
flopped would jeopardize their broader business, he said, and it would
not make sense “to take a huge reputational risk not just for your
vaccine but for all the products across your portfolio to benefit the
president politically.”

Dr. Fauci has expressed confidence that the system will hold.

“Historically, the F.D.A. has based their decisions on science,” he told
a House committee last week. “They will do so this time also, I am
certain.”
