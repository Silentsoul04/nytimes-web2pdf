WASHINGTON — President Trump has blamed China for the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus) and
the ensuing [economic
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html),
but as the White House looks to stabilize small businesses in the United
States, the rescue effort has had an unintended beneficiary: Chinese
companies.

Millions of dollars of American taxpayer money have flowed to China from
the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program that was created in March
to be a lifeline for struggling small businesses in the United States.
But because the economic relief legislation allowed American
subsidiaries of foreign firms to receive the loans, a substantial chunk
of the money went to America’s biggest economic rival, a new analysis
shows.

According to [a
review](https://www.horizonadvisory.org/paycheckprotection) of [publicly
available loan
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/us/ppp-small-business-loans.html)
by the strategy consulting firm Horizon Advisory, $192 million to $419
million has gone to more than 125 companies that Chinese entities own or
invest in. Many of the loans were quite sizable; at least 32 Chinese
companies received loans worth more than $1 million, with those totaling
as much as $180 million.

“The extent and nature of P.R.C.-owned, -invested and -connected
entities among the P.P.P. loan recipients indicate that without
appropriate policy guardrails, U.S. tax dollars intended for relief,
recovery and growth of the U.S. economy — and small businesses in
particular — risk supporting foreign competitors, namely China,” wrote
Emily de La Bruyère and Nathan Picarsic, the co-founders of Horizon
Advisory, referring to the People’s Republic of China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The report acknowledges that the participation of these companies in the
lending program most likely saved an unspecified number of jobs based in
the United States, but it also suggests that many of the businesses
probably had access to other forms of capital from public or private
markets to support their American operations. The Treasury Department
has estimated that the overall program has kept 50 million workers
employed in the United States.

The revelation that Chinese-backed companies were helped by American tax
dollars shows the deep ties that remain between American and Chinese
businesses even as [relations between the countries have
deteriorated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/asia/us-china-trump-xi.html)
in recent months. Mr. Trump has regularly vented his anger at China and
accused it of spreading a virus that has left the once-thriving United
States economy in tatters.

“It’s China’s fault,” he said on Friday. “China should be paying for it,
and maybe they will.”

The virus has emboldened the administration’s hawks in their calls for
both punishing China and decoupling the world’s two largest economies,
saying Beijing poses a national security threat. The administration in
recent weeks has [sanctioned Chinese
officials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/sanctions-china-xinjiang-uighurs.html)
accused of facilitating human rights violations in the Xinjiang region
and [banned more Chinese technology
companies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/business/economy/china-sanctions-uighurs-labor.html)
from buying American technology and
components.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the administration’s aggressive approach to China did not stop
companies with ties to Beijing from benefiting from one of the main
programs intended to prop up the United States economy.

The Paycheck Protection Program, which was created as part of a $2.2
trillion relief package signed in March, was devised to help small
businesses with fewer than 500 workers cover payrolls and overhead
expenses while much of the economy was shuttered. When big publicly
traded companies that had access to other forms of capital took out
P.P.P. loans, the Trump administration publicly shamed them and Treasury
Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged them to repay the money, saying they
could [face criminal
liability](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/us/politics/coronavirus-treasury-payment-protection-program.html)
if they did not qualify for the loans.

But the rules of the program also allowed American subsidiaries of
foreign-owned companies to apply for and receive loans.

The Horizon Advisory report, which analyzed public filings and loan data
that was released by the Treasury Department in June, does not claim to
be an exhaustive account of the more than five million loans that were
initiated through the program. The data released by the Treasury
Department, for instance, shared loan amounts in ranges only for
businesses that borrowed more than $150,000, and information for private
firms that took smaller loans was released only in aggregate.

Among the companies highlighted in the report were Continental Aerospace
Technologies, which received a loan of up to $10 million, and Aviage
Systems, which received a loan of up to $350,000. The companies are
owned by Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a state-owned
conglomerate that the Department of Defense classified this year as a
Chinese military
company.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

HNA Group North America LLC and HNA Training Center NY, subsidiaries of
China’s HNA Group, both received loans of up to $1 million. HNA Group
specializes in real estate, aviation and financial services transactions
and is part of the Fortune Global 500.

And BGI Americas Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the Chinese
gene-testing giant BGI Group, took a loan of up to $1 million. The
company, which is building a gene bank in Xinjiang, did return the
money, however, after [Axios reported on the
loan](https://www.axios.com/chinese-biotech-us-subsidiary-ppp-loan-8134a863-3779-46c4-9190-ceca54ba00ca.html).

Larger loans went to businesses that spanned critical sectors such as
pharmaceuticals, defense, advanced manufacturing, electric cars and
information technology. In each case, the United States was indirectly
funding the kinds of corporations whose owners the Trump administration
regularly accuses of intellectual property theft.

For example, Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, a California-based biotech
company, received a loan worth $5 million to $10 million. It is owned by
Nanjing Xinbai, a Chinese state-invested company whose controlling
shareholder has close ties to the Communist Party.

Money from the Paycheck Protection Program has also made its way to the
financial technology sector. Citcon USA LLC, a Silicon Valley mobile
payments firm, received $150,000 to $350,000 in loan money. ZhenFund is
a major investor; the company connects American companies to Chinese
payment platforms such as Alipay and WeChat, which [could also face
restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/technology/tiktok-washington-lobbyist.html)
from the Trump administration.

Lawmakers and the Trump administration are in the process of negotiating
how to recalibrate the small business lending program in an upcoming
economic relief package. A provision of the bill proposed last week by
Senate Republicans would make businesses that are partially owned by
Chinese companies or that have a Chinese resident on the board of
directors ineligible for the next round of loan money. It is uncertain
whether such a provision might make it to a final bill.

A Treasury spokeswoman noted that the Small Business Administration
might review any of the loans administered through the program and deny
forgiveness if it turned out that the borrower was not eligible or
misrepresented their business in the loan application.

The White House had no comment on the loans.
