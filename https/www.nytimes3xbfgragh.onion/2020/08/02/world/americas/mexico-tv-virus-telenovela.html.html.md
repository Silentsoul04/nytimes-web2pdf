MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s love affair with melodrama was over.

After decades of reigning supreme over prime time slots, telenovelas,
the country’s iconic soap operas, were losing viewers. Industry
executives declared them obsolete, too corny and simplistic to compete
with higher-brow, higher-budget shows.

Now, thanks partly to the pandemic, the telenovela is roaring back.

Confined to their homes, millions of Mexicans have devoted their
evenings to the traditional melodramas and other kitschy classics,
finding in the familiar faces and guaranteed happy endings a balm for
anxieties raised by a health crisis that has left at least 43,000 dead
and millions unemployed.

“There’s no fear, no horror, no misery,” said Enrique Millán, 75, of the
telenovelas that claimed his undivided attention after the pandemic put
soccer on pause. “I can imagine what’s going to happen at the end of
each episode. There’s no stress.”

Ratings for the shows have soared in recent months, reviving a genre
that shaped generations of Mexicans and became one of the nation’s most
important cultural exports.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The onset of a global economic downturn has made such programming more
attractive by default. Telenovelas air on broadcast channels, making
them more accessible than Netflix or premium channels for the average
Mexican family.

But their draw also comes from a specific brand of uncomplicated
storytelling that eases the boredom of life in quarantine while calming
fears and delivering the emotional intimacy that daily interactions have
lost to the virus.

“I turn on the television, time goes by and you don’t feel like you’re
doing nothing,” said Minerva Becerril, who watches telenovelas and other
melodramas every evening with her 90-year-old mother in her house on the
outskirts of Mexico City. “It brings a moment of calm and you watch love
scenes, which I like because I’m a romantic.”

Ms. Becerril began her evenings with “Te Doy La Vida” (“I Give You
Life”), a novella that features a love triangle, and then turned to
“La Rosa de Guadalupe” (“The Rose of Guadalupe”), a drama with
religious undertones. She sometimes tunes into “Destilando Amor”
(“Distilling Love”),<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>but
doesn’t like “Rubí,” a reboot of a 2004 soap based on a short story she
read in a comic book from the 1960s. “The version in the magazine was
better,” she said.

During the second quarter, 6.6 million people watched Televisa’s
flagship channel during prime time each evening, when telenovelas and
other melodramas air, up from around five million during the same period
in 2019, according to the network. Ratings for the channel increased
twice as much as overall TV viewership in Mexico from May to June.

Based on Nielsen ratings, Televisa estimates that more than 10 million
people watched the finale of “Te Doy La Vida,"

“Suddenly the ratings are going up,” said Isaac Lee, a former executive
at Televisa and Univision. “Nobody knows if this is a moment, a flick, a
trend or if the telenovela is back.”

When Mr. Lee became head of content at Televisa in 2017, the network was
in crisis. Incomes had been rising and internet access spreading across
Mexico for decades, luring people away from the signature melodramas
that had been Televisa’s bread and butter for half a century.

Industry executives wanted more action, more violence and bigger budgets
— the ingredients that seemed to explain the success of dramas about
drug traffickers on Telemundo and series like “Narcos” on Netflix.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Lee began binge-watching all of its programming and soon realized
what should have been obvious: He wasn’t the target audience. And
neither were the other company executives who had been making decisions
about the shows.

“I decided not to watch the content,” he said, “because I knew that I
would screw it
up.”

After many conversations with viewers, it became clear that melodrama
just needed a makeover, he said. Televisa began to modernize its
telenovelas, toning down the face slapping and operatic baritones in
favor of characters who talked in normal voices about real problems.

Their North Star was “La Rosa de Guadalupe," a decade-old Televisa drama
that had long been underestimated by the network’s own executives.

“La Rosa de Guadalupe” is not a telenovela, with established characters
and conflicts, but it is the pinnacle of melodrama. Each hourlong
episode tells a self-contained story that always follows the same arc:
People encounter problems and pray for help to the Virgin of Guadalupe.
A white rose appears, a saintly wind blows over their faces and soon
their troubles are over.

What the show had that the network’s soaps did not was cultural
currency. The themes “La Rosa de Guadalupe” addresses are often ripped
from the headlines, like the episode devoted to a family separated by
deportation from the United States, or the one about teenagers who were
consuming liquor by [pouring it into their eye
sockets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009175/) — a
dangerous prank that was making the rounds on social media.

The drama was also attracting a surprising following among young
Mexicans — though many swore that they, unlike their grandmothers, were
watching ironically, to make fun of the far-fetched story lines. TikTok,
Twitter and YouTube are full of memes and videos ridiculing the show.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are

      - Employers have to provide [a safe

        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Of course, many of the haters turn out to be loyal viewers. “La Rosa de
Guadalupe” has seen huge growth in its younger audience in recent
months, especially among male viewers aged 13-31, whose numbers have
increased by about 40 percent compared with last year.

It is unclear, even to Televisa executives, whether the success can last
through a pandemic that has taken physical displays of affection out of
the contact sport that is a telenovela.

“There are no kisses, no hugs, no caresses, no scenes in bed,” said
Miguel Ángel Herros, the executive producer of “La Rosa de Guadalupe.”

Any touching is “hands only, and conversations happen at this distance,”
he said, gesturing at the roughly 10 feet between his desk and his
assistant.

Mr. Herros, 80, is filming for shorter periods, in locations that leave
ample space for his crew. Actors have their temperatures taken when they
arrive on set and rehearse with masks and face shields. And the network
already had to send one actress, from the soap “Te Doy La Vida,” into
quarantine after she tested positive for
coronavirus.

But Mr. Herros doesn’t view the epidemic as a threat. “La Rosa de
Guadalupe" stopped filming only briefly during the pandemic, on the
orders of the city government, but quickly picked back up.

“I come to the office every day,” said Mr. Herros, sitting in an office
adorned with religious iconography in the middle of Televisa’s expansive
headquarters in San Ángel, just south of Mexico City’s center. “We
haven’t stopped since March.”

For the time being, at least, Televisa has some advantages over
streamers in Mexico. The company occupies more than a million square
feet in Mexico City, where actors and crews can be kept in tightly
controlled environments to contain the spread of the virus.

And when it comes to dishing comfort food to an anxious audience,
there’s no match for the old-fashioned melodrama.

“Unlike Netflix, we give people certainty,” said Carlos Mercado, the
show’s creator and head writer. “You know what you’re going to see on
“La Rosa de Guadalupe,” even if you want to make fun of it.”
