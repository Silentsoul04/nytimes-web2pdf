HONG KONG — When Tian Feilong first arrived in Hong Kong as demands for
free elections were on the rise, he said he felt sympathetic toward a
society that seemed to reflect the liberal political ideas he had
studied as a graduate student in Beijing.

Then, as the calls escalated into protests across Hong Kong in 2014, he
increasingly embraced Chinese warnings that freedom could go too far,
threatening national unity. He became an ardent critic of the
demonstrations, and six years later he is a staunch defender of the
[sweeping national security
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/world/asia/china-critics-security-law-hong-kong.html)that
China has imposed on the former British colony.

Mr. Tian has joined a tide of Chinese scholars who have turned against
Western-inspired ideas that once flowed in China’s universities, instead
promoting the proudly authoritarian worldview ascendant under Xi
Jinping, the Communist Party leader. This cadre of Chinese intellectuals
serve as champions, even official advisers, defending and honing the
party’s hardening policies, including the [rollout of the security
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-china.html)
in Hong Kong.

“Back when I was weak, I had to totally play by your rules. Now I’m
strong and have confidence, so why can’t I lay down my own rules and
values and ideas?” Mr. Tian, 37, said in an interview, explaining the
prevailing outlook in China. Witnessing the tumult as a visiting scholar
in Hong Kong in 2014, Mr. Tian said, he “rethought the relationship
between individual freedom and state authority.”

“Hong Kong is, after all, China’s Hong Kong,” he said. “It’s up to the
Communist Party to clean up this mess.”

While China’s Communist Party has long nurtured legions of academics to
defend its agenda, these authoritarian thinkers stand out for their
unabashed, often flashily erudite advocacy of one-party rule and
assertive sovereignty, and their turn against the liberal ideas that
many of them once embraced.

They argue that China must reclaim its status as a world power, even as

A number of these scholars, sometimes[called
“statists](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326028916_The_Specter_of_Leviathan_A_Critique_of_Chinese_Statism_since_2000),”
have worked on policy toward Hong Kong, the sole territory under Chinese
rule that has been a stubborn enclave for pro-democracy defiance of
Beijing. Their proposals have fed into China’s increasingly
uncompromising line, including the security law, which has swiftly
[curbed
protests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-china.html)
and [political
debate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/world/asia/hong-kong-security-china-media.html).

“We ignore these voices at our own risk,” said [Timothy
Cheek](https://history.ubc.ca/profile/timothy-cheek/), a historian at
the University of British Columbia who helps run [Reading the China
Dream](https://www.readingthechinadream.com/), a website that translates
works by Chinese thinkers. “They give voice to a stream of Chinese
political thought that is probably more influential than liberal
thought.”

As well as earnestly citing Mr. Xi’s speeches, these academics [draw on
ancient Chinese
thinkers](http://www.ccps.gov.cn/bkjd/xzglgg/xzglgg2019_08/201909/t20190923_134457.shtml)
who counseled stern rulership, along with Western critics of liberal
political traditions. Traditional Marxism is rarely cited; they are
proponents of order, not
revolution.

Many of them make respectful nods in their papers to Carl Schmitt, the
German legal theorist who supplied rightist leaders in the 1930s and the
emerging Nazi regime with arguments for extreme executive power in times
of crisis, [Ryan
Mitchell](https://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/app/people/prof-ryan-mitchell/),
an assistant professor of law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong,
[documented in a recent
paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3400946).

“They’ve provided the reasoning and justification,” Fu Hualing, a
[professor of
law](https://www.law.hku.hk/academic_staff/professor-fu-hualing/) at the
University of Hong Kong, said of China’s new authoritarian scholars. “In
a way, it’s the Carl Schmitt moment here.”

China’s ideological landscape was more varied a decade ago, when Mr.
Tian was a graduate student at Peking University, a traditionally more
liberal campus. Censorship was lighter, and universities tolerated
guarded discussion of liberal ideas in classrooms.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many scholars, including Mr. Tian’s dissertation adviser, Zhang Qianfan,
[argued that Hong
Kong](http://www.calaw.cn/article/default.asp?id=1238), with its robust
judicial independence, could inspire similar steps in mainland China. “I
had also been nurtured by liberal scholars.” Mr. Tian said.

Such ideas have gone into sharp retreat since Mr. Xi took power in 2012.
He [began a
drive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/08/20/world/asia/chinas-new-leadership-takes-hard-line-in-secret-memo.html)to
discredit ideas like universal human rights, separation of powers and
other liberal concepts.

Dissenting academics are maligned in the party-run news media and risk
professional ruin. Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University
in Beijing, was [detained in
July](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/12/world/asia/xu-zhangrun-china-xi.html)
and [dismissed from his
job](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2020/07/xi-critic-xu-zhangrun-released-from-detention-fired-from-tsinghua-university/)
after writing a stream of essays condemning the party’s direction under
Mr.
Xi.

The education authorities generously fund pro-party scholars for topics
[such as](http://news.sohu.com/20150720/n417161554.shtml)how to
introduce security laws in Hong Kong. Chinese and foreign foundations
that once supported less orthodox Chinese scholars [have
retrenched](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/29/world/asia/china-foreign-ngo.html)because
of tightening official restrictions.

More than fear and career rewards have driven this resurgence of
authoritarian ideas in China. The global financial crisis of 2007, and
the United States’ floundering response to the coronavirus pandemic,
have reinforced Chinese views that liberal democracies are decaying,
while China has prospered, defying predictions of the collapse of
one-party rule.

“China is actually also following a path that the United States took,
seizing opportunities, developing outward, creating a new world,” Mr.
Tian said. “There is even a fervent hope that we’ll overtake the West in
another 30 years.”

China’s authoritarian academics have [proposed
policies](https://jamestown.org/program/toward-a-second-generation-of-ethnic-policies/)to
assimilate ethnic minorities thoroughly. They have defended Mr. Xi’s
[abolition of a term
limit](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/11/world/asia/china-xi-constitution-term-limits.html)
on the presidency, opening the way for him to stay in power
indefinitely. They have argued that Chinese-style “rule by law” is
[inseparable from rule](http://www.aisixiang.com/data/77230.html) by the
Communist Party. And more recently they have served as intellectual
warriors in Beijing’s efforts to subdue protest in Hong Kong.

“For them, law becomes a weapon, but it’s law that’s subordinated to
politics,” said Sebastian Veg, a professor at the School of Advanced
Studies in Social Sciences in Paris who has studied the[rise of China’s
statist
thinkers](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/702687).
“We’ve seen that at work in China, and now it seems to me we’re
seeing it come to Hong Kong.”

For Hong Kong, these scholars have supplied arguments advancing
Beijing’s drive for greater central control.

Under the legal framework that defined Hong Kong’s semi-autonomy after
its return to China in 1997, many in the territory assumed that it would
mostly manage its own affairs for decades. Many believed that Hong Kong
lawmakers and leaders would be left to develop national security
legislation, which was required by that framework.

But Mr. Xi’s government has pushed back, demanding greater influence.
The authoritarian scholars, familiar with both Mr. Xi’s agenda and Hong
Kong law, have distilled those demands into elaborate legal arguments.

Several Beijing law professors earlier served as advisers to the Chinese
government’s office in Hong Kong, including Jiang Shigong and Chen
Duanhong, both of Peking University. They declined to be
interviewed.

A [Chinese government
paper](http://english.www.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2014/08/23/content_281474982986578.htm)
in 2014, which Professor Jiang is [widely
credited](https://tocqueville21.com/le-club/the-restructuring-of-hong-kong-and-the-rise-of-neostatism/)
with helping write, asserted that Beijing had “comprehensive
jurisdiction” over Hong Kong, dismissing the idea that China should stay
hands off. The framework that defined Hong Kong’s status was written in
the 1980s, when China was still weak and under the sway of foreign
liberal ideas, [he later
said](https://www.dwnews.com/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/59790413/%E5%BC%BA%E4%B8%96%E5%8A%9F%E4%B8%80%E5%9B%BD%E4%B8%A4%E5%88%B6%E4%BA%9F%E9%A1%BB%E8%B5%B0%E5%87%BA%E9%82%93%E5%B0%8F%E5%B9%B3%E6%97%B6%E4%BB%A3?itm_source=universal_search&itm_campaign=universal_search&itm_content=%E5%BC%BA%E4%B8%96%E5%8A%9F&itm_medium=web).

“They treat Hong Kong as if it were part of the West, and they treat the
West as if it were the entire world.” Professor Jiang [recently
said](http://hk.zijing.org/2020/0602/819565.shtml) of Hong Kong’s
protesters. “China’s rise has not, as some imagined, drawn Hong Kong
society to trust the central authorities.”

After protesters occupied Hong Kong streets in 2014, he and other
scholars [pressed the
case](https://opinion.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJGSZs) that China had
the power to impose national security legislation there, rejecting the
idea that such legislation should be left in the hands of the reluctant
Hong Kong authorities.

“The survival of the state comes first, and constitutional law must
serve this fundamental objective,” Professor Chen, the Peking University
academic, [wrote in 2018](http://hk.zijing.org/2018/0122/750657.shtml),
citing Mr. Schmitt, the authoritarian German jurist, to make the case
for a security law in Hong Kong.

“When the state is in dire peril,” Professor Chen wrote, leaders could
set aside the usual constitutional norms, “in particular provisions for
civic rights, and take all necessary measures.”

Professor Chen submitted an internal study to the party’s policymakers
on introducing security legislation for Hong Kong, according to a
[Peking University
report](http://www.publiclaw.cn/static/upfile/201807251034548539.pdf) in
2018, over a year before the party publicly [announced
plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/31/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-china.html)
for such a law.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since China’s legislature [passed the security
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html)
in late June, he, Mr. Tian and allied Chinese scholars have
energetically defended it in dozens of articles, interviews and news
conferences. Chinese intellectuals, Mr. Tian suggested, will next
confront worsening relations with the United States.

“We have to choose what side we’re on, including us scholars, right?” he
said. “Sorry, the goal now is not Westernization; it’s the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”
