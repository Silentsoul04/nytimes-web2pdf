## Birx urges Americans in hot spots to consider wearing a mask at home if they live with someone who is especially vulnerable.

Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration’s coronavirus coordinator,
said on the CNN program “State of the Union” on Sunday that the country
is in a “new phase” of the coronavirus pandemic, and that it is much
more extensive than the spring outbreaks in major cities like New York
and Seattle.

She recommended that people living in communities where cases are
surging consider wearing a mask at home if they live with someone who is
especially vulnerable because of age or underlying medical conditions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is
extraordinarily widespread,” Dr. Birx said, adding that rural areas have
not been spared. “So everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not
immune.”

She emphasized the significance of asymptomatic transmission. “If you
have an outbreak in your rural area or in your city, you need to really
consider wearing a mask at home, assuming that you’re positive if you
have individuals in your household with co-morbidities,” she said.

Both she and Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary at the Department
of Health and Human Services, emphasized the importance of mask wearing,
hand washing and avoiding crowds. On the NBC program “Meet the Press,”
Admiral Giroir said some of the efforts seemed to be helping in recent
weeks to reduce the number of cases in Arizona and some other states
that have been hard hit this summer.

He repeatedly returned to mask wearing as perhaps the most effective
preventive measure in communities experiencing an outbreak. “Wearing a
mask is incredibly important, but we have to have like 85 or 90 percent
of individuals wearing a mask and avoiding crowds,” he said. Those
percentages, he said, give “you the same outcome as a complete
shutdown.”

Asked if he was recommending a national mask mandate, Admiral Giroir
said, “The public health message is we’ve got to have mask wearing.” He
added: “If we don’t do that, and if we don’t limit the indoor crowded
spaces, the virus will continue to run.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute,
said on CNN that in many areas where cases are surging, the availability
of tests was badly lagging. “In 18, 20 states, the number of tests being
done is actually falling and falling because our testing system is under
such strain that we just can’t even deliver the test today that we were
doing two weeks ago. That’s very concerning because when cases are
rising, and your number of tests are falling, that’s a recipe for
disaster,” he said.

Admiral Giroir defended the nation’s testing program, noting it has been
increased exponentially in recent months. He said that both testing and
[contact
tracing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/health/covid-contact-tracing-tests.html)
were crucial responses, but not particularly helpful in large,
communitywide outbreaks.

He was also asked about the president’s endorsement [of the
anti-malarial drug
hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/technology/virus-video-trump.html)
as a treatment for the virus. He discounted its utility, citing results
from several recent clinical trials that showed no benefit.

“At this point in time we don’t recommend that as a treatment,” he said.
“There’s no evidence to show that it
is.”

In April, with hospitals overwhelmed and much of the United States in
lockdown, the Department of Health and Human Services produced a
presentation for the White House arguing that rapid development of a
[coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
was the best hope to control the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“DEADLINE: Enable broad access to the public by October 2020,” the first
slide read, with the date in bold.

Given that it typically takes years to develop a vaccine, the timetable
for the initiative, called [Operation Warp
Speed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-operation-warp-speed.html),
was incredibly ambitious. With tens of thousands dying and tens of
millions out of work, the crisis demanded an all-out public-private
response, with the government supplying billions of dollars to
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, providing logistical support
and cutting through red tape.

It escaped no one that the proposed deadline also intersected nicely
with President Trump’s need to curb the virus before the election in
November.

The ensuing race for a vaccine — in the middle of a campaign in which
the president’s handling of the pandemic is the key issue after he has
spent his time in office [undermining
science](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/climate/trump-coronavirus-climate-science.html)
and [the expertise of the federal
bureaucracy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/climate/trump-hurricane-dorian-noaa.html)
— is now testing the system set up to ensure safe and effective drugs to
a degree never before seen.

Under [constant pressure from a White House anxious for good
news](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html)
and a public desperate for a silver bullet to end the crisis, the
government’s researchers are fearful of political intervention in the
coming months and are struggling to ensure that the government maintains
the right balance between speed and rigorous regulation, according to
interviews with administration officials, federal scientists and outside
experts.

Colleges are mapping strategies as varied as the contrasting Covid
regulations enacted by the states, and the efforts could add more than
$70 billion to the budgets of the nation’s 5,000 colleges.

Yet administrators say giving students at least a taste of college life
is worth it, if done in a safe way. Whether those constituents agree is
an open question, and complaints about tuition have led a growing number
of schools to offer rebates.

In one of the more elaborate plans, the University of California,
Berkeley, will test all residential **** students within 24 hours of
their arrival. After that, everyone living on campus will be tested
twice a month if its test proves accurate enough.

But Cornell College in Iowa, with only 1,000 students, is counting on
its humble health center and county health department to do its testing.
Small schools in similar situations are finding themselves at the mercy
of private labs that can take two weeks to deliver results, making
results almost meaningless.

It is still possible that the frantic planning will come to
naught.

President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines on Sunday ordered Manila
and nearby suburban areas to re-enter lockdown for two weeks as the
health department reported 5,032 new cases.

Group gatherings were prohibited, and the population was advised to stay
home. Public transportation was halted, domestic flights and
inter-island ferries remained suspended, and the government encouraged
biking. Schools will remain shut.

Infections spiked after the government eased lockdown rules and
gradually opened up in an effort to jump start the economy. But instead
of managing the numbers, it has resulted in grim results, with hospitals
overwhelmed and doctors warning they were reaching a breaking point. In
an appeal to the government on Saturday, the Philippine College of
Physicians, the country’s main organization of doctors, warned that the
health system “has been overwhelmed.”

This came shortly after Manila’s city government ordered the temporary
closure of its two hospitals, citing the growing number of health care
staff members who have been infected. It said that the city’s health
care workers are burned out “with the seemingly endless number of
patients trooping to our hospitals for emergency care and admission.”

Total cases in the country now stand at 103,185, with 2,059 deaths.

Mr. Duterte told officials to “strictly enforce the quarantine,
especially the lockdown.”

“I have heard the call of different groups from the medical community
for a two-week enhanced community quarantine in mega Manila,” he said.
“I fully understand why your health workers would like to ask for such
a timeout period. They have been in the front lines for months and are
exhausted.”

Officials in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, announced
stricter measures on Sunday in an effort to stem a coronavirus outbreak
that is raging despite a lockdown that began four weeks ago.

For six weeks starting on Sunday, residents of metropolitan Melbourne
will be under curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. except for purposes of work
or giving and receiving care.

As under the current lockdown, permitted reasons for leaving the house
include: shopping for essential goods and services; medical care and
caregiving; and necessary exercise, work and study. Food shopping is
limited to one person per household per day, and outdoor exercise is
limited to one hour per person per day, both within about three miles of
home. Public gatherings are limited to two people, including household
members.

In explaining the new measures, Premier Daniel Andrews said the high
rate of community transmission, including 671 new cases reported in the
state of Victoria on Sunday, suggested that the virus was more
widespread than had been known.

“You’ve got to err on the side of caution and go further and go harder,”
he said.

Victoria has had 11,557 confirmed cases, almost all of them in
metropolitan Melbourne, and 123 deaths.

Here is what else is happening around the world:

  - **Kosovo**’s prime minister Avdullah Hoti said on Sunday he has
    contracted Covid-19 and will self-isolate at home for two weeks,
    [Reuters
    reports](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-kosovo-primeminist/kosovo-prime-minister-says-he-has-covid-19-idUSKBN24Y0ON).
    “I have no signs, except a very easy cough,” [he wrote on
    Facebook](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/avdullah.hoti/posts/3508635622531100).
    He said he will be “in isolation” for two weeks and “fulfill my
    obligations from home.”

  - Many **Ethiopians** who found work in other parts of Africa or in
    the Persian Gulf before the pandemic are [heading home unemployed
    and possibly
    infected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/world/africa/ethiopian-migrant-workers-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
    with the virus, representing a major strain on Ethiopia’s fragile
    health system. More than 30,000 laborers have re-entered Ethiopia
    since mid-March. Of those, at least 927 had the virus, according to
    the government, though that figure has not been updated in over a
    month and is almost certainly an undercount.

  - India’s biggest film star, **Amitabh Bachchan**, was discharged from
    the hospital on Sunday after recovering from Covid-19, and the
    country’s powerful home minister, Amit Shah, announced that he
    tested positive. Mr. Bachchan, 77, was hospitalized for three weeks.
    His son, Abhishek Bachchan, also a movie star, remains in the
    hospital. Mr. Shah announced on Twitter on Sunday he tested
    positive. The announcement came one day after his government allowed
    the reopening of hotels and weekly markets in New Delhi, one of the
    worst-hit regions in the
country.

## Lawmakers and White House officials remain at an impasse on a new relief package.

With coronavirus cases soaring across the United States, the debate in
Washington over a [new relief
package](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bills-house-senate.html)
to help people and businesses weather the crisis is set to take center
stage in the coming week, and negotiators were meeting over the weekend
in hopes of making progress on a deal.

“The president’s determined to spend what we need to spend,” said Steven
Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, speaking on the ABC program “This
Week.” “We’re acting very quickly now.”

Unemployment benefits lapsed this week for tens of millions of people,
but officials have struggled to agree over new aid. Mr. Mnuchin’s
remarks came after he and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff,
met with top congressional Democrats in a rare Saturday meeting on
Capitol Hill.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who hosted the meeting with Senator Chuck Schumer
of New York, said that staff members would meet on Sunday and that the
main negotiators would convene again on Monday. They called the
discussion on Saturday productive but said that the sides remained far
apart on several matters.

“We must defeat this virus, and that’s one of the points that we still
have not come to any agreement on,” Ms. Pelosi said, speaking on [“This
Week.”](https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/speaker-house-nancy-pelosi-72130729)
(Mr. Mnuchin, appearing afterward, refuted the suggestion that the
administration is not invested in defeating the virus.)

At issue is [the gap between the latest relief
packages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bills-house-senate.html)
put forward by Democrats and Republicans.

A $1 trillion proposal issued by Senate Republicans and administration
officials last week includes cutting by two-thirds the $600-per-week
unemployment payments that workers had received since April and
providing tax cuts and liability protections for businesses.

A $3 trillion relief package approved by House Democrats in May includes
an extension of the jobless aid, nearly $200 billion for rental
assistance and mortgage relief, $3.6 billion to bolster election
security and additional aid for food assistance.

Virus-battered Florida is confronting a new challenge: Tropical Storm
Isaias, which is whipping the coast with high winds and creating the
risk of flash flooding as it makes its way up the East Coast.

At 2 p.m. Eastern time, the center of the storm was about 30 miles
offshore, east of Port St. Lucie, Fla., and was moving north-northwest
at about eight miles an hour, according to the [National Hurricane
Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/020856.shtml?).

Isaias — which is written Isaías in Spanish and pronounced ees-ah-EE-ahs
— had clobbered the Bahamas with hurricane conditions on Saturday after
hitting parts of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. As it advances
northward, the center of the storm is skirting close to the coast of
Florida without making landfall so far, but its track is likely to bring
it ashore in the Carolinas early in the week.

Complicating the emergency response to the storm, reported coronavirus
cases continue to rise sharply in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas,
and health officials have warned that their health care systems could be
strained beyond capacity. To avoid virus exposure in shelters, the first
choice is for coastal residents in homes vulnerable to flooding to stay
with relatives or friends farther inland, being careful to wear masks
and remain socially distant.

“Because of Covid, we feel that you are safer at home,” said Bill
Johnson, the emergency management director for Palm Beach County.
“Shelters should be considered your last resort.”

A top economic official and the governor of Arkansas used appearances on
the Sunday talk shows to discuss the financial toll of the virus as it
rages through much of the country.

Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,
argued that it would be better for the economy if the United States
instituted strict lockdown policies for a month to six weeks to stop the
spread of the virus.

If the country cannot control the spread, “we’re going to have
flare-ups, lockdowns and a very halting recovery with many more job
losses and many more bankruptcies,” Mr. Kashkari said on the CBS program
“Face the Nation” on Sunday.

“If we were to lock down hard for a month or six weeks, we could get the
case count down, so that our testing and our contact tracing was
actually enough to control it,” he said. “If we don’t do that, and we
have this raging virus spreading throughout the country with flare-ups
and local lockdowns for the next year or two, which is entirely
possible, we’re going to see many, many more business bankruptcies.”

He also said that given the low cost of issuing debt, the government has
room to spend to support the American economy.

“Congress should use this opportunity to support the American people,
and the American economy,” he said. “If we get the economy growing, we
will be able to pay off the debt.”

His argument for a longer shutdown stands in contrast to others’ views.
On the CNN program “State of the Union,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas
defended his decision not to impose a statewide stay-at-home order
earlier this year. Mr. Hutchinson emphasized the economic ramifications
of extended
shutdowns.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Amid a slow but steady stream of new coronavirus cases, the Major League
Baseball season becoming more precarious seemingly by the day.

Then on Saturday the league’s commissioner issued a rallying cry. “We
are playing,” Rob Manfred told ESPN. “The players need to be better, but
I am not a quitter in general and there is no reason to quit now. We
have had to be fluid, but it is manageable.”

Players on many teams have been spotted high-fiving or spitting or
getting too close too often in the dugout — all in violation of the
manual.

And already, 20 cases among the Miami Marlins and six among the St.
Louis Cardinals less than two weeks into the season have wreaked havoc
on the schedules of eight teams. It also raised questions about M.L.B.’s
protocols.

In saying the games would go on, Manfred thrust the onus on the players.

Kathleen Bachynski, an assistant professor of public health at
Muhlenberg College, [took
issue](https://twitter.com/bachyns/status/1289665507117772800) with
Manfred’s comments, writing on Twitter that the virus thrives “when
people insist on sticking with a poor plan to the bitter end.”

In a phone interview, Dr. Bachynski said “the responsibility has to be
on the league to provide safe conditions to play in.”

Four players announced they would not play this season since the
Marlin’s outbreak; a dozen players opted out of the season before
opening day.

On Sunday, Mets outfielder [Yoenis Cespedes opted
out](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/sports/baseball/Yoenis-cespedes-opt-out-rule.html)
of the rest of the 2020 Major League Baseball season for “Covid-related”
reasons, Brodie Van Wagenen, the team’s general manager, announced
Sunday afternoon. The announcement came after Cespedes had failed to
show up on Sunday for the Mets’ game in Atlanta against the
Braves.

The minister of health, Mikhail Murashko, said Saturday that the plan
was to begin by vaccinating teachers and health care workers. He also
[told the RIA](https://ria.ru/20200801/1575248763.html) state news
agency that amid accelerated testing, the laboratory that developed the
vaccine was already seeking regulatory approval for it.

Russia is one of a number of countries rushing to develop and administer
a vaccine, and it is determined to get there first.

Not only would a vaccine help alleviate a worldwide health crisis that
has killed more than 680,000 people and badly wounded the global
economy, it would also become a symbol of national pride and a valuable
propaganda tool for the country that produces it. It could be a
lucrative commodity, as well.

“I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the
vaccine before they are administering the vaccine to anyone,” Dr.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in the United States, warned a congressional hearing
on Friday.

A Russian regulatory agency is expected to approve that vaccine for the
October campaign by mid-August, far earlier than timelines suggested by
Western regulators, who have often said a vaccine would become available
no sooner than the end of the year.

But with limited transparency in the Russian program, separating the
science from the politics and propaganda could prove impossible. Critics
have already drawn attention to Russia’s tradition of cutting corners in
research on other pharmaceutical products and accusations of
intellectual property
theft.

As the coronavirus has resurged in many parts of the country in recent
weeks, experts and politicians alike have implored people to protect
themselves and others by wearing a face mask in public.

Does that apply when you have to be out in the gusting wind and driving
rain of a tropical storm like Isaias? Our health columnist Tara
Parker-Pope says, probably not: Face masks [aren’t as
effective](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/infection-control/the-effectiveness-of-surgical-face-masks-what-the-literature-shows-30-09-2003/)
when they are wet.

For one thing, it’s much harder to breathe through a wet mask than a dry
one, Ms. Parker-Pope notes. And on top of that, a moist or wet mask
doesn’t filter as well as a dry mask. The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, which recommends mask-wearing in general, says they
[should not be worn when doing things that may get the mask
wet.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html)

It doesn’t take a tropical storm to drench a mask, of course. They can
become soaked with condensation from your breath or sweat from your
face, and some people think of wetting them deliberately to cool off in
hot weather. But the harm done is the same, wherever the moisture comes
from.

A paper surgical mask that gets soaked should probably be discarded, Ms.
Parker-Pope advises, but a cloth mask can be washed, dried and reused.

If rain is coming down in buckets, social distancing is not likely to be
a problem, and any viral particles exhaled by an infected person
probably would be quickly diluted by gusting wind and rain. So there is
little need to wear a mask out in a rainstorm, Ms. Parker-Pope notes:
“In fact, you should take it off and keep it dry, so if you need to
duck into a store to wait out the storm, you have a dry mask to wear
indoors.”

## Scientists study whether people with the virus can infect bats and other wildlife.

Could humans pass the coronavirus to wildlife, specifically North
American bats?

It may seem like a minor worry — far down the list from concerns like
getting sick, losing a loved one or staying employed. But as the
pandemic has made clear, the more careful people are about viruses
passing among species, the better.

The scientific consensus is that the coronavirus originated in bats in
China or neighboring countries. A recent paper tracing the genetic
lineage of the virus [found evidence that it probably evolved in bats
into its current
form](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0771-4). The
researchers also concluded that either this coronavirus or others that
could make the jump to humans may be present in bat populations.

So why worry about infecting more bats with the current virus?

The U.S. government considers it a legitimate concern both for bat
populations, which have been devastated by a fungal disease called
white-nose syndrome, and for humans, given potential problems down the
road. If the virus can pass easily between species, it could potentially
spill back over to humans.

Another concern is how readily the coronavirus may spread from bats to
other kinds of wildlife or domestic animals, including pets. Much
attention has been paid to the small number of pets that have been
infected, but public health authorities like the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have said that, although information is limited,
[the risk of pets spreading the virus to
people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/pets.html)
is low.

They do recommend that any person who has Covid-19 take the same
precautions with their pets that they would with human family
members.

## Viewers flock to Mexico’s flagging telenovelas, seeking the familiar in a time of distress.

Mexico’s love affair with melodrama appeared to be over. Now, thanks
partly to the pandemic, the telenovela is roaring back.

Confined to their homes, millions of Mexicans have devoted their
evenings to the traditional melodramas and other kitschy classics,
finding in the familiar faces and happy endings a balm for anxieties
raised by a health crisis that has left at least 43,000 dead and
millions unemployed in the country.

The resurgence has been a boon to Televisa, a onetime media monopoly
that had taken a beating from streaming services. During the second
quarter, 6.6 million people watched Televisa’s flagship channel during
prime time each evening, when telenovelas and other melodramas air.
Viewership was around five million in that period last year, according
to the network.

Miguel Ángel Herros, the executive producer of the melodrama “La Rosa de
Guadalupe,” has been filming for shorter periods, in locations that
leave ample space for his crew. Actors have their temperatures taken
when they arrive on set, and rehearse with masks and face shields.

It is unclear whether the success will last through a pandemic that has
forced physical displays of affection out of telenovelas.

“There are no kisses, no hugs, no caresses, no scenes in bed,” Mr.
Herros said.
