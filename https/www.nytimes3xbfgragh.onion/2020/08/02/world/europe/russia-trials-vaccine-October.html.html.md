MOSCOW — Russia plans to launch a nationwide vaccination campaign in
October with a coronavirus vaccine that has yet to complete clinical
trials, raising international concern about the methods the country is
using to compete in the global race to inoculate the public.

The minister of health, Mikhail Murashko, said Saturday that the plan
was to begin by vaccinating teachers and health care workers. He also
[told the RIA](https://ria.ru/20200801/1575248763.html) state news
agency that amid accelerated testing, the laboratory that developed the
vaccine was already seeking regulatory approval for it.

Russia is one of a number of countries rushing to develop and administer
a vaccine. Not only would such a vaccine help alleviate a worldwide
health crisis that has killed more than 680,000 people and badly wounded
the global economy, it would also become a symbol of national pride. And
Russia has used the race as a propaganda tool, even in the absence of
published scientific evidence to support its claim as a front-runner.

“I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the
vaccine before they are administering the vaccine to anyone,” Dr.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in the United States, warned a congressional hearing
on Friday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

State television in Russia has for several months now promoted the idea
of Russia leading the competition. In May, a government report claimed
that the first person in the world to be vaccinated against the virus
was a Russian researcher who had injected himself with a vaccine early
in the development process.

Russia will start Phase III trials of the vaccine in early August, said
Kirill Dmitriev, a senior official with Russia Direct Investment Fund, a
government-controlled investor in the country’s vaccination effort. A
Phase III trial is the only way to determine if a vaccine is effective.

The World Health Organization maintains a [comprehensive list of
worldwide vaccine
trials](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines).
But there is no Russian Phase III trial on the list.

Still, a Russian regulatory agency is expected to approve the vaccine
this month, Mr. Dmitriev said. That is [far earlier than timelines
suggested by Western
regulators](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html),
who have often said a vaccine would become available no sooner than the
end of the year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We believe it will be one of the first vaccines with regulatory
approval,” Mr. Dmitriev said.

But with limited transparency in the Russian program, separating the
science from the politics and propaganda could prove impossible. Critics
have already drawn attention to Russia’s tradition of cutting corners in
research on other pharmaceutical products and accusations of
intellectual property theft.

Russia was once at the forefront in virology and vaccinations. In the
Soviet era, its doctors led the world in some areas of research, but
spending has shriveled in recent decades. Medicines are sometimes
approved with limited or no testing.

Russian researchers have continued to advance a range of vaccines since
the beginning of the pandemic. The candidate to be given in October is
similar to a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.

The Russian vaccine was developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow.
It uses two strains of adenovirus that typically cause mild colds in
humans. Adenovirus vaccines are in trials in various countries. They are
genetically modified to cause infected cells to make proteins from the
spike of the new coronavirus.

The Gamaleya Institute tested its vaccine on soldiers, raising ethical
questions about consent, though the defense ministry said all of the
soldiers had volunteered. The institute’s director, Aleksandr Gintsberg,
went [on television in
May](https://www.1tv.ru/shows/zhit-zdorovo/syuzhety/est-vakcina-ot-koronavirusa-zhit-zdorovo-fragment-vypuska-ot-25-05-2020)
to say he tried the vaccine on himself before announcing the completion
of trials in monkeys.

“There is an escalation in the geopolitics of vaccine research,” said
Cliff Kupchan, chairman of Eurasia Group, a risk consulting firm. But
“what remains of the vast scientific complex of the Soviet period is a
shadow of what it was,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Countries with vaccine production capacity — abundant in Russia and
[India](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
— could wind up inoculating their populations by copying a successful
vaccine, even if they did not in fact develop it. In April, the Serum
Institute in India announced that it had plans to [mass-produce a
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html),
with permission from the developer, before clinical trials had ended.

“In all likelihood, the country producing on their soil will be the
first to get it, even if they don’t own it,” Mr. Kupchan said. “I don’t
know how much international law and patent protection will apply here.
People are pretty desperate.”

Mr. Dmitriev, of the Russia Direct Investment Fund, has attributed
Russia’s research success to the Soviet Union’s once-formidable
scientific study of viruses.

“We have this very significant legacy of Russia being a leader of
vaccines in the Soviet time and today,” he said. “We don’t have to
create many things from scratch.”

He contrasted that history with Trump administration’s Operation Warp
Speed program, which is financing experimental research by Pfizer and
Moderna for a genetic
vaccine.

“In the last 20 years, the world took a turn toward molecular biology,”
said Aydar A. Ishmukhametov, the director of the Chumakov Institute, a
Russian vaccine maker. “The Russian school has preserved virology.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Russia also has an advantage, Mr. Ishmukhametov said, in its vast,
Soviet-era industrial base for growing viruses for vaccines. In the
pandemic, the country has turned to a secretive laboratory in Siberia
with roots in the Soviet Union’s biological weapons program, which
included the study of anthrax to target humans and plant pathogens that
would destroy American crops.

The laboratory, Vektor, is now testing whether viruses that cause
influenza, measles or vascular stomatitis — a livestock disease — can be
put to use for a coronavirus
vaccine.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The science of mass producing vaccines has deep roots here. Aleksei
Chumakov, a virologist and son of the founder of the Chumakov Institute,
recalled a summer job he held as a teenager chopping up kidneys
harvested from African green monkeys. Even though the monkeys had been
slaughtered, Mr. Chumakov said, their kidney cells lived on for many
months, used to grow the polio virus in large, rotating glass cylinders.

“You kept stirring it and gradually the clumps came apart,” he said.

As scientists gained proficiency in growing so-called immortal cell
lines — human or animal cells that are modified to divide indefinitely —
they replaced cultures from fresh monkey kidneys.

The Chumakov Institute has used an immortal monkey kidney cell line from
1962 to grow coronavirus for a proposed vaccine using whole, inactivated
viruses, which may be used as an alternative if the vaccine targeting
just [the spike
protein](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-mutation-spike-treatment.html?action=click&module=Latest&pgtype=Homepage)
fails.

The Gamaleya Institute developed its vaccine using a human cell line
first cultured in 1973, known as Hek293 — the same line used in the
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Like a number of other cell lines used in
medical research, Hek293 began with cells taken from an aborted fetus,
raising objections from abortion opponents, including [Roman Catholic
clerics](https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Canada-COVID-19%20Vaccine%20letter%20May%2021st%202020_updated%20%28002%29.pdf).

The first human cell line was derived from the cancer that killed
[Henrietta
Lacks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/08/08/science/after-decades-of-research-henrietta-lacks-family-is-asked-for-consent.html)in
1951. HeLa, as it was known, made its way into Soviet laboratories
during the Cold War. Viktor Zuyev, an 91-year-old emeritus professor of
virology at the Gamaleya Institute, recalled using it to cultivate flu
virus.

He was unbothered by the question of ethics.

“Why not?” he said. “It is very humane to the next generation” to use a
dying person’s tissue for scientific experimentation. “If it can benefit
humanity,” he said, “of course it is
ethical.”
