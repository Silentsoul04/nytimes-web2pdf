# What Is It Like to Watch Live Dance Again? Amazing

</div>

Kaatsbaan hosts a welcome summer festival in the Hudson Valley, where
nature and dancers join forces to put on a show.

TIVOLI, N.Y. — It didn’t bode well that the first live dance I was going
to see since mid-March was one I had seen many times before. “Sunshine,”
a Larry Keigwin war horse set to the Bill Withers’s classic “Ain’t No
Sunshine,” can give a dancer the opportunity to really *feel* the music
in all the worst ways. It’s treacly stuff.

So I’m happy to say that as soon as Melvin Lawovi began to move, my
chest tightened; I even sensed — the horror — some tears. Lately, for
self-preservation, I’ve been talking myself into believing that I can
live without watching dance in person, and while that is true, I clearly
miss it. A lot. “Sunshine,” which opened the outdoor [Kaatsbaan Summer
Festival](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/arts/dance/kaatsbaan-dance-festival-stella-abrera.html)
under beautiful blue skies on Saturday, worked out just fine.

That was also to the credit of Mr. Lawovi, a recent addition to American
Ballet Theater, who never delivered a treacly moment as he traversed the
stage with the lightest touch. Instead of dwelling on the lyrics or
giving into angst, he danced with an unparalleled polish, as if his body
were clearing the air.

But repertory alone doesn’t seem the be all end all of this summer
festival, the first of its kind in Kaatsbaan’s 30 years as a cultural
park. From the performances to Brandon Stirling Baker’s light-and-sound
installation in a rustic barn to the peace of being surrounded by so
much open space and air, the festival is not only about live dance. It’s
a package. The best choreographic moments came in the dancers’ simple
yet courtly walks across the grass to the stage.

Kaatsbaan’s artistic director, Stella Abrera, and its executive
director, Sonja Kostich, aren’t messing around when it comes to safety,
and that was comforting, too, at this socially distanced performance.
The experience included frantically filling out the health check survey
in the car while thinking hard about the questions: *Was* that a touch
of a sore throat this morning?

I loved the elegant firmness of the handwritten signs telling us to wear
masks; the raised stage that seemed like it was dropped from the sky
onto a field; and the optional post-performance walk, on the grounds of
what was originally a farm, with live music (instead of a meandering or
self-congratulatory post-performance
talk).

In honor of the Black Lives Matter movement, the festival has been
curated by three respected Black dance artists: [Calvin Royal III, a
soloist at Ballet
Theater](https://www.abt.org/people/calvin-royal/?type=performer&gclid=Cj0KCQjwyJn5BRDrARIsADZ9ykGukwgjIfy5GS0uVFO0vpgqra8aXLyIqvL8ApaOarDXLchnTxIYBTMaAqtmEALw_wcB),
who programmed the first weekend; Alicia Graf Mack, who leads the dance
division of the Juilliard School; and Lloyd Knight, of the Martha Graham
Dance Company.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For the first program, the selections were brief and unassuming — less
about innovative choreography than watching bodies in motion. (Programs
are short: 20 to 30 minutes, and feature solos and duets.) At the start
of the tap solo “Laying the Ground,” Leonardo Sandoval, accompanied by
the bassist Greg Richardson, used his body as an instrument, contrasting
soft taps of his feet with gentle slaps on his thighs and chest as he
made his way to a wooden platform on the stage. His footwork was hushed
— an articulate, musical whisper — as he somehow managed to convey the
idea that he was gliding just above his feet.

“The Dividing Line,” a premiere by Mr. Royal set to Gershwin, wavered
between sensations — abutting stillness and alienation were glimpses of
hope. Mr. Royal, cutting a figure both introspective and heroic, stood
with his back to us at first, his arms bound from behind until he
suddenly released them and skittered across the stage with quick
backward
steps.

That feeling of push and pull continued throughout this dance, in which
Mr. Royal, in stops and starts, unleashed his body in space. While
personal and poetic, its power might have been amplified had certain
gestures — the reach of an arm, the somber bow of the head — been toned
down, more accidental.

The 30-minute program ended with another solo by Mr. Royal, “The Dream
Continues,” set to excerpts from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s
“I Have a Dream” speech, and danced by the elegant Courtney Lavine,
Mr. Royal’s Ballet Theater colleague. During the transition between the
solos, Mr. Royal’s voice was heard reciting [Langston Hughes’s poem
“Harlem”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46548/harlem) as he
slowly moved across the stage: “What happens to a dream deferred? Does
it dry up like a raisin in the
sun?”

He hopped off, in essence handing the space to Ms. Lavine — and to
King’s words, which beamed into the air with extra clarity. Ms.
Lavine, in a purple leotard and skirt that danced around her knees, used
her luxurious arms and expansiveness to spin seemingly out of control
then stop on a dime as she held still, giving beauty and breadth to
King’s message. Her capacity to move clearly isn’t suffering under
quarantine, but at the same time, it wasn’t about the steps: She was a
spirit, clearly dancing for something bigger than herself.
