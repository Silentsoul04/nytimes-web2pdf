# Sotheby’s Reports $2.5 Billion in Sales

</div>

The auction house says that figure reflects a “resilient” market amid
the coronavirus. But it represents a 25 percent decrease in auction
sales, analysts say.

Sotheby’s, the international auction house bought in 2019 by the
telecommunications magnate [Patrick
Drahi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/17/business/sothebys-patrick-drahi-bidfair.html),
reported Monday that it has sold $2.5 billion of art and collectibles so
far this year.

The figures include more than $285 million from online-only auctions and
$575 million in private sales. “The art and luxury markets have proven
to be incredibly resilient, and demand for quality across categories is
unabated,” Charles F. Stewart, Sotheby’s chief executive, said in the
statement, acknowledging the challenge of selling
[high-end](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/your-money/auctions-wealth-coronavirus.html)inventory
during the coronavirus pandemic.

As a privately held company — like its rival international auction
houses Christie’s, Phillips and Bonhams — Sotheby’s is under no
obligation to release sales figures. It did not divulge in its official
release **** how these figures compared to the same seven-month period
**** last year, nor what profit or loss the company made.

According to data independently compiled by [Pi-eX](https://pi-ex.co/),
a London-based art market analytics company, Sotheby’s sales from
relatively low-value online-only auctions from January through July were
up 540 percent this year, but [live
auctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/arts/design/sothebys-remote-auctions-coronavirus.html)
of $1.6 billion were down 42 percent, resulting in an overall fall of 25
percent in auction sales. Christie’s equivalent [online and
live](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/arts/design/christies-auction.html)
sales declined by 53 percent, according to Pi-eX.

“Auction houses release detailed sales information to remind, at times
like this, buyers and consignors that the art market is open for
business,” said Doug Woodham, a former Christie’s president of the
Americas who is now a managing partner of the New York-based company Art
Fiduciary Advisors. “It’s impressive how Sotheby’s has been able to
scrabble together so many sales. Because they’re owned by a telecoms
magnate, they seemed to innovate faster than their competitors.”

The art market, like so much of the global economy, has been profoundly
affected by the Covid-19 crisis. Numerous art fairs and auctions have
been either canceled or converted to an online-only format. So far this
year, Sotheby’s has held more than 180 online auctions, including the
single-lot sale in May of a pair of Michael Jordan’s [game-worn Nike
sneakers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/sports/air-jordan-sneakers-auction-record.html),
which sold for $560,000, more than three times the pre-sale
estimate.

“Sotheby’s has been the major innovator in applying digital technologies
into the auction space,” said Daniel Langer, the chief executive of the
luxury strategy consultancy Équité.

In recent years, live evening auctions of high-value Impressionist,
modern and contemporary art have been the prime revenue generators for
international auction houses. Sotheby’s canceled its marquee May evening
sales in New York, which last year grossed $692 million. These were
replaced in June by a new high-tech hybrid “[multicamera global
livestream”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/arts/design/sothebys-online-auction.html)
auction that took in $363.2 million.

“The growth of online sales is impressive, but the key issue for
Sotheby’s as well as the other auction houses is the drop in revenue
from live auctions,” said Christine Bouron, the chief executive of
Pi-eX. “Online sales on average still bring much lower revenue.”

Mr. Drahi’s BidFair USA acquired Sotheby’s last year in a leveraged
buyout for $3.7 billion, [borrowing $1.1
billion](https://www.gazette-drouot.com/article/the-new-sotheby-s-is-coming/11785)
to finance the acquisition. Before the pandemic reduced turnover from
live sales, the 276-year-old auction house had a net [loss of $71.2
million](https://www.sothebys.com/content/dam/sothebys/PDFs/Sothebys-Annual-Report-12.31.2019.pdf)
last year. Mr. Drahi, who has a reputation for cost-cutting, reassured
investors he would reach at least [$66 million in
savings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/billionaire-s-light-touch-approach-at-sotheby-s-faces-first-test),
Bloomberg News has reported.

“Every major auction house has huge infrastructure costs associated with
running their business,” said Mr. Woodham, the former Christie’s
executive. “Because so many of these costs are fixed in the short term,
when revenue declines, say 30 percent, profits plummet much more.”
