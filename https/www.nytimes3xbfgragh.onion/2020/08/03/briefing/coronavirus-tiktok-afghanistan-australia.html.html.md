## TikTok gets a dose of geopolitical reality

President [Trump gave the go-ahead on Monday for
Microsoft](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
to hold negotiations on a potential blockbuster deal to purchase the
Chinese-owned video app’s operations in the U.S.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in the U.S. because of the app’s
Chinese ownership, which he has called a possible threat to national
security.

**Tech on notice:** ByteDance, the Chinese social media giant behind
TikTok, took ample precautions in its drive to become a global company.
TikTok was made unavailable in China so that the app’s users wouldn’t be
subject to the Communist Party’s censorship requirements. User data was
stored in Virginia and Singapore.

But suspicion never dissipated that TikTok might be unable to withstand
pressure from Beijing. Similar doubts hang over many other Chinese tech
companies. TikTok’s sudden change of fortunes [could force them to
re-evaluate their own international
ambitions.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-bytedance-us-china.html)

**Related:** A tide of [Chinese scholars have turned against
Western-inspired
ideas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/world/asia/china-hong-kong-national-security-law.html)
that once flowed in China’s universities, instead promoting the proudly
authoritarian worldview ascendant under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party
leader.

“A number of vaccines are now in Phase 3 clinical trials and we all hope
to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from
infection,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general,
said on Monday. “However, there’s no silver bullet at the moment and
there might never be.”

Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the U.S., last week
said he was “cautiously optimistic” that a vaccine could be developed by
the end of this year. The comments by Dr. Tedros seemed intended to
guard against countries moving away from measures to slow the spread of
the virus.

Here are the [latest
updates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu)
and
[maps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
of the pandemic.

In other developments:

  - A team of W.H.O. experts has concluded a three-week visit to China
    to begin investigating the source of the virus — the first step in
    what is likely to be a monthslong inquiry.

  - President Rodrigo Duterte of the Phlippines has ordered Manila and
    its suburbs to re-enter lockdown for two weeks after the health
    department reported 5,032 new cases.

  - As the pandemic consumes global health resources, tuberculosis — the
    biggest infectious-disease killer worldwide — as well as H.I.V. and
    malaria are [making a
    comeback](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html).

## Mass jailbreak in Afghanistan

At least [21 people were killed and hundreds of inmates escaped from a
prison](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/world/asia/afghanistan-prison-isis-taliban.html)
in Jalalabad after it came under attack late Sunday. A fierce gun battle
raged until midafternoon Monday between the militants and security
forces.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Loyalists to the Islamic State took responsibility for the attack. About
a third of the prison’s 1,500 inmates were linked to ISIS, with the rest
split among Taliban prisoners and common criminals. A Taliban spokesman
denied any involvement in the attack.

**The ISIS factor:** The murky identity of the ISIS branch in the
country has made it a spoiler threat to the peace process. While the
Taliban and ISIS have fought turf wars in the east, Afghan officials
have long claimed that the two groups have overlapped, sharing networks
and resources for urban
attacks.

social gatherings and cause rising
unemployment.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

To understand why, our Sydney bureau chief decided to take the plunge in
the hunt for wild food. He found that “spearfishing has become an
increasingly popular escape for people seeking calm, control and
sustenance far from the anxieties of land.” The “spearos,” as they are
called, “all [find something for their stomachs and

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

### And now for the Back Story on …

## The next best thing to traveling

*When travel restrictions began to lock people in place all around the
world, our editors on the Travel desk launched a new visual series
called* [*The World Through a
Lens*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/the-world-through-a-lens)*.
The idea was to showcase beautiful and intriguing places, and to
introduce readers to aspects of global culture. Here’s an excerpt from*
[*what the editors told Times Insider about the
project*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/insider/letting-their-cameras-transport-you.html)*.*

Our goal with this series is slightly different from that of our typical
Travel fare. Instead of inspiring travel among our readers or describing
the travels of our contributors, we’re aiming to *approximate* elements
of travel itself — to provide a kind of virtual travel substitute that
soothes, transports and
distracts.

But escapism isn’t the only objective. At its best, travel can transform
us: It can awaken us to the restorative power of nature; it can broaden
our ability to understand and appreciate dissimilar cultures; it can
help us become more empathetic to people whose lives fall outside the
scope of our day-to-day routines. These, too, are things we hope the
series can provide, especially at a time when such transformations
aren’t available to many of us via direct experience.

To achieve all that, we’ve tried to create immersive visual experiences;
every story in the series is driven by images. (Instead of assigning
photographers to shoot new work, we are relying on photojournalists with
previously shot, and unpublished, portfolios.)

We’ve also tried to create a more intuitive and symbiotic relationship
between images and text. (In most cases, the journalist who took the
pictures is also the one who wrote the copy.) And as a general rule,
we’ve avoided “service” information: no hotel plugs or restaurant
reviews, no recommended itineraries. The focus is on the people and the
places themselves, as seen and captured by some of the best
photojournalists in the world.
