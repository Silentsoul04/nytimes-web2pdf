gave the go-ahead on Monday for Microsoft} to hold negotiations on a
potential blockbuster deal to purchase the Chinese-owned video app's
operations in the U.S.

Mr. Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in the U.S. because of the app's
Chinese ownership, which he has called a possible threat to national
security.

\textbf{Tech on notice:} ByteDance, the Chinese social media giant
behind TikTok, took ample precautions in its drive to become a global
company. TikTok was made unavailable in China so that the app's users
wouldn't be subject to the Communist Party's censorship requirements.
User data was stored in Virginia and Singapore.

But suspicion never dissipated that TikTok might be unable to withstand
pressure from Beijing. Similar doubts hang over many other Chinese tech
companies. TikTok's sudden change of fortunes
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-bytedance-us-china.html}{could
force them to re-evaluate their own international ambitions.}

worldview ascendant under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader.

``A number of vaccines are now in Phase 3 clinical trials and we all
hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people
from infection,'' Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director
general, said on Monday. ``However, there's no silver bullet at the
moment and there might never be.''

Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the U.S., last week
said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that a vaccine could be developed
by the end of this year. The comments by Dr. Tedros seemed intended to
guard against countries moving away from measures to slow the spread of
the virus.

  suburbs to re-enter lockdown for two weeks after the health department
  reported 5,032 new cases.

people were killed and hundreds of inmates escaped from a prison} in
Jalalabad after it came under attack late Sunday. A fierce gun battle
raged until midafternoon Monday between the militants and security
forces.

Loyalists to the Islamic State took responsibility for the attack. About
a third of the prison's 1,500 inmates were linked to ISIS, with the rest
split among Taliban prisoners and common criminals. A Taliban spokesman
denied any involvement in the attack.

\textbf{The ISIS factor:} The murky identity of the ISIS branch in the
country has made it a spoiler threat to the peace process. While the
Taliban and ISIS have fought turf wars in the east, Afghan officials
have long claimed that the two groups have overlapped, sharing networks
and resources for urban attacks.

Spear gear has been selling out at dive shops up and down Australia's
east coast since March, when the coronavirus pandemic began to restrict
social gatherings and cause rising unemployment.

To understand why, our Sydney bureau chief decided to take the plunge in
the hunt for wild food. He found that ``spearfishing has become an
increasingly popular escape for people seeking calm, control and
sustenance far from the anxieties of land.'' The ``spearos,'' as they
are called, ``all
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/world/australia/spearfishing-sydney-coronavirus.html}{find
something for their stomachs and souls} in an act that is ancient and

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

\emph{When travel restrictions began to lock people in place all around
the world, our editors on the Travel desk launched a new visual series
called}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/the-world-through-a-lens}{\emph{The
World Through a Lens}}\emph{. The idea was to showcase beautiful and
intriguing places, and to introduce readers to aspects of global
culture. Here's an excerpt from}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/insider/letting-their-cameras-transport-you.html}{\emph{what
the editors told Times Insider about the project}}\emph{.}

Our goal with this series is slightly different from that of our typical
Travel fare. Instead of inspiring travel among our readers or describing
the travels of our contributors, we're aiming to \emph{approximate}
elements of travel itself --- to provide a kind of virtual travel
substitute that soothes, transports and distracts.

But escapism isn't the only objective. At its best, travel can transform
us: It can awaken us to the restorative power of nature; it can broaden
our ability to understand and appreciate dissimilar cultures; it can
help us become more empathetic to people whose lives fall outside the
scope of our day-to-day routines. These, too, are things we hope the
series can provide, especially at a time when such transformations
aren't available to many of us via direct experience.

To achieve all that, we've tried to create immersive visual experiences;
every story in the series is driven by images. (Instead of assigning
photographers to shoot new work, we are relying on photojournalists with
previously shot, and unpublished, portfolios.)

We've also tried to create a more intuitive and symbiotic relationship
between images and text. (In most cases, the journalist who took the
pictures is also the one who wrote the copy.) And as a general rule,
we've avoided ``service'' information: no hotel plugs or restaurant
reviews, no recommended itineraries. The focus is on the people and the
places themselves, as seen and captured by some of the best
photojournalists in the world.
