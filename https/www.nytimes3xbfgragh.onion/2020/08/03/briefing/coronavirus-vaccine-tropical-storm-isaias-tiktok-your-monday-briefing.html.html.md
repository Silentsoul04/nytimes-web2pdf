Want to get The Morning by email? [Here’s the
sign-up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/morning-briefing).

## Good morning. Microsoft talked to President Trump about buying TikTok. Several countries are rushing their coronavirus vaccine efforts. Let’s start with a look at the growing adoption of police reforms.

In Washington, the efforts to reform policing have stalled. Congress
can’t agree on a bill and has largely stopped debating the issue.

But changes are happening in cities across the country.

In the more than two months since the killing of George Floyd, 31 of
America’s 100 largest cities have enacted policies restricting officers’
use of chokeholds, according to an analysis by Campaign Zero, a group
that advocates against police violence. In all, 62 of the 100 largest
cities now have such policies in place, including New York and
Minneapolis, where Floyd died after an officer knelt on his neck for
nearly nine minutes.

Atlanta, San Diego and 67 other cities now require officers to intervene
when a fellow officer uses excessive force, up from 51 before Floyd’s
death. And five cities — including Denver and St. Louis — have adopted
[the suite of eight reforms that Campaign Zero
advocates](https://8cantwait.org/), up from two cities earlier this
year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Several [outside](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/218583.pdf)
[studies](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5425b9f0e4b0d66352331e0e/t/58e6a753ff7c50ebbad126f8/1491511130661/Ninth+Systemic+Assessment--Use+of+Force--FINAL.pdf)
have suggested that those eight policies are likely to be effective in
reducing police violence — without increasing crime.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But police unions have generally opposed limiting the use of force,
saying it inhibits officers’ ability to fight crime. And some
progressive critics of Campaign Zero argue that these reforms have been
tried before and put too much faith in officers to abide by new rules. A
better approach, they say, is [shrinking police
budgets](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ep4xy7/what-does-defund-and-abolish-the-police-mean).

“If you don’t have the standards, you can’t enforce them,” said Samuel
Sinyangwe, a data scientist and co-founder of Campaign Zero. “One of the
key challenges moving forward will be, now that these standards have
been raised, how are we making sure officers who violate them are held
accountable?”

President Trump has also opposed most restrictions on policing. [Joe
Biden](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/10/biden-root-out-systemic-racism-not-just-divisive-trump-talk-column/5327631002/)
and many congressional Democrats favor a bill that would condition
federal funding on localities’ banning chokeholds and strangleholds.

**In other policing developments:**

  - Dermot Shea, New York City’s police commissioner, has criticized
    reform proposals, [prompting calls for his
    resignation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/police-shea-de-blasio-nyc.html).

  - As federal agents withdraw from Portland, Ore., the protesters there
    [have refocused on the original
    target](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/portland-protests-.html):
    local police.

### **THREE MORE BIG STORIES**

## 1\. Cutting corners in the vaccine race

The White House’s ambitious initiative to speed production of a
coronavirus vaccine, Operation Warp Speed, has provided billions of
dollars in funding and cut through red tape. But it’s also [endangering
the system set up to ensure safe
drugs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html),
experts say. Some worry that the administration will push regulators to
give emergency approval to a vaccine before the November election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The U.S. isn’t the only country trying to hurry the process.
[Russia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/world/europe/russia-trials-vaccine-October.html)
plans to begin a nationwide vaccination campaign in October, despite not
yet completing clinical trials. And [in
India](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html),
one drugmaker said it would begin producing hundreds of millions of
doses of a vaccine candidate that is still in clinical trials.

**In other virus developments:**

  - How do you contain the virus among an impulsive, young population
    that lives together? It’s a challenge that colleges are trying to
    figure out [before students arrive in the coming
    weeks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/covid-college-reopening.html).

  - “It’s not safe. There’s no way it can be safe,” Jeff Gregorich, a
    superintendent in Arizona, [told The Washington
    Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/01/schools-reopening-coronavirus-arizona-superintendent/?arc404=true)
    about reopening his schools in the fall. “If you think anything
    else, I’m sorry, but it’s a fantasy. Kids will get sick, or worse.
    Family members will die. Teachers will die.”

  - As the pandemic consumes global health resources, [tuberculosis,
    H.I.V. and malaria are making a
    comeback](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html).
    “The public health officials and advocates I spoke to are distraught
    over this,” Apoorva Mandavilli, a reporter on The Times’s Science
    desk, told us. “They’re watching as years, even decades, of progress
    are being washed away by this
pandemic.”

[Tropical Storm
Isaias](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/tropical-storm-isaias-florida-carolina.html)
brushed Florida’s eastern edge yesterday, dousing the state with heavy
rainfall but failing to deliver the devastating punch that officials had
feared. It now appears to be headed toward the Carolinas, where it could
bring flash floods, storm surges along the coast and possible tornadoes
by tonight.

Much of the East Coast will get a soaking this week, forecasters say, as
the storm moves north. New York and New England are expected to be hit
Tuesday and Wednesday.

## 3\. Microsoft confirms talks to buy TikTok

Microsoft is pressing forward on a possible deal to [purchase the social
media app
TikTok](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html),
the company said last night. The effort took on a new urgency over the
weekend after Trump threatened to ban the app, which is owned by a
Chinese company.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president’s plans appeared to change after he spoke with Satya
Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft.

**On the app:** The threat of a ban unleashed chaos this weekend, as
influencers issued teary — and perhaps premature — goodbyes to their
fans, [The Times’s Taylor Lorenz
reports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/style/tiktok-ban-threat-trump.html).

### **IDEA OF THE DAY: Make indoor spaces safer**

In Friday’s newsletter, we listed [innovative ways Times readers have
moved meetings, ceremonies and other gatherings
outdoors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/briefing/move-everything-outdoors-our-readers-respond.html),
where it’s harder for the coronavirus to spread.

But what about activities that *can’t* be moved outside? [Mounting
evidence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/health/virus-aerosols-who.html)
suggests that small airborne particles called aerosols can linger in
stagnant air for hours, helping transmit the virus indoors. Here are
ways to make inside spaces safer:

  - **Open windows and doors**, advises Linsey Marr, who studies how
    viruses spread through the air. “Ventilation counts,” [she wrote in
    a Times
    Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/opinion/coronavirus-aerosols.html).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Run portable HEPA filters** in restaurants, classrooms and indoor
    spaces where opening windows is impractical. These filters, which
    often retail for a few hundred dollars, can trap small virus
    particles, [Zeynep Tufekci explains in The
    Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Remember the basics.** Even with other protective measures, the
    same general rules for staying safe apply indoors: practice social
    distancing, wear a mask, avoid crowds and face away from people when
    you talk, [NPR’s Pien Huang has
    written](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/07/11/889716534/coronavirus-faq-how-do-i-protect-myself-if-the-coronavirus-can-linger-in-the-air).

## Read an ‘instant American classic’

In her latest book, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,” the
journalist and author Isabel Wilkerson offers a searing study of how
race in America functions as an immutable caste system, a “ranking of
human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the
presumed inferiority of other groups.”

The book is an instant classic, [the Times critic Dwight Garner writes
in his
review](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/books/review-caste-isabel-wilkerson-origins-of-our-discontents.html).

Some anglerfish are terribly clingy boyfriends, physically fusing onto
females up to 60 times their size. The mating ritual, called sexual
parasitism, has long mystified scientists. Two genetically distinct
animals sharing flesh would normally set off a major immune response,
for the same reason transplanted organs in humans are often rejected by
a recipient’s body.

But a new study says the fish have evolved to largely ditch a key part
of their immune systems, a change that hasn’t yet been documented in any
other species. [Read more about the freaky fish
