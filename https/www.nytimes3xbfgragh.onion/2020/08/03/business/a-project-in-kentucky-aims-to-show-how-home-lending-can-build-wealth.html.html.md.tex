Homeownership is a crucial part of a family's ability to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/your-money/race-income-equality.html}{build
wealth}: A home is the largest asset for most American families, and the
value it can gain over decades can be tapped during retirement or left
to the next generation.

But the share of Black households that own homes has only inched upward
over the past 50 years, and the continuing homeownership gap is one of
the
\href{https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/}{main
reasons} the net worth of white households far exceeds that of Black
families. One reason for the gap: the dearth of mortgages in communities
where home prices are so low that most banks and lenders will not bother
writing mortgages for them.

Now
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/mortgages-affordable-housing.html}{a
new program in Louisville, Ky.,} called the MicroMortgage Marketplace
project, which officially
\href{https://www.newswire.com/news/micromortgage-marketplace-launches-in-support-of-small-dollar-home-21180593}{started
two weeks ago}, hopes to demonstrate how to increase the availability of
small-dollar mortgages. Coordinated by the Urban Institute, a Washington
think tank, the program hopes to become a demonstration project that can
be replicated in other cities where modest homes are plentiful but the
mortgages to buy them are in short supply.
