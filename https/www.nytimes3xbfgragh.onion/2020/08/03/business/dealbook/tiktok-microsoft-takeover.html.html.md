## That escalated quickly

At the end of last week, it seemed that TikTok’s days in the U.S. were
numbered. “As far as TikTok is concerned, we’re banning them from the
United States,” President Trump said on Friday of the hugely popular
social network, which his administration considers a national security
risk because of its Chinese ownership.

But behind the scenes, Microsoft was exploring a takeover bid for
TikTok’s American operations, which gained traction thanks to lobbying
from some of the president’s top advisers and Republican lawmakers.

**Satya Nadella and Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday**, and it appears that the
phone conversation bought the Microsoft chief time to flesh out [the
potential
acquisition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html),
The Times’s Mike Isaac, Ana Swanson and Maggie Haberman report. The
president had dismissed rumors of Microsoft’s interest in a deal as a
way to avoid shutting down TikTok, saying, “We are not an M\&A country.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Now, Microsoft has six weeks to seal a deal** for TikTok, which says
it has 100 million users in the U.S. In a
[statement](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/),
Microsoft said it would “move quickly” to pursue a deal with TikTok’s
parent, Beijing-based ByteDance, aiming to wrap it up by Sept. 15.
Microsoft will conduct “a complete security review” of the company, it
said, and pledged to keep all American users’ data within the U.S. and
sever any connections to systems abroad.

• Over the weekend, top White House advisers like Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the chief of the National Economic
Council, argued the merits of a purchase by Microsoft to Mr. Trump, and
enlisted lawmakers like the Republican Senators John Cornyn, Lindsey
Graham and Marco Rubio to weigh in. The risk of angering TikTok’s young
user base with a shutdown in the run-up to the election [was another
consideration](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/style/tiktok-ban-threat-trump.html).

• On the other side, Peter Navarro, the White House’s top trade adviser,
pushed for a TikTok ban as a means to punish China in the escalating
[tech cold
war](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/business/dealbook/china-us-rivalry.html)
between Washington and Beijing.

**How much will it cost?** Last week, a group of investors, including
Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, floated a $50 billion bid for
TikTok, [according to
Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive/exclusive-bytedance-investors-value-tiktok-at-50-billion-in-takeover-bid-sources-idUSKCN24U1M9).
Microsoft is interested only in TikTok’s businesses in the U.S.,
Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and may invite other “American
investors” to take minority stakes.

• The time pressure, and alternative of a shut down, may give Microsoft
the upper hand in negotiations with ByteDance. But the Chinese company
does not seem resigned to a forced sale: In [a letter to
employees](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/bytedance-ceo-letter-working-overtime-on-u-s-tiktok-solution)
today, ByteDance’s C.E.O., Zhang Yiming, said he disagreed with the
order to sell its American operations and stressed that no decisions
about TikTok’s fate had been made. “The attention of the outside world
and rumors around TikTok might last for a while,” he wrote.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

• What is certain is that TikTok’s valuation is many times higher than
the $1 billion it cost in 2017 to buy its predecessor, Musical.ly. At
the end of June, Microsoft had just over $136 billion in cash.

**What’s in it for Microsoft?** “The fickle infatuation of tweens,” The
Times’s Karen Weise
[writes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-microsoft-tweens.html).
More seriously, taking over TikTok would give the tech giant “control of
one of the largest and most influential social networks in the country.”
If a deal gets done, it could go a few different ways:

• A transformative Microsoft-TikTok tie up could create meaningful
competition for Facebook and Google, leveraging other Microsoft brands
like LinkedIn, Minecraft and Xbox. But at a time when Big Tech is under
attack for its market dominance, it is surprising to see the White House
push TikTok — inadvertently or not — into the arms of one of the largest
companies in the world. Slack recently accused Microsoft of
[anticompetitive
behavior](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/technology/slack-microsoft-antitrust.html).

• Microsoft’s experience with consumer businesses is mixed, so the
successful stewardship of TikTok is not assured — think of the search
engine Bing or the ill-fated takeover of Nokia’s smartphone business.
And in June, Microsoft said it was shutting down Mixer, a
video-game-streaming platform, and closing all of its retail stores.

• The biggest risk, perhaps, is for the rest of Microsoft. Will the
company’s management need to devote so much attention to TikTok and its
attendant political issues that it distracts from its [very
profitable](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/microsoft-msft-earnings-q4-2020.html)
core of serving business customers?

## Here’s what is happening

**More than 100 current and former C.E.O.s called for more aid to small
businesses in the U.S.** [The
letter](https://www.howardschultz.com/lettertocongress/), sent to
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday morning, was organized by
the former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz with the support of Senators
Michael Bennet and Todd Young, a Democrat and a Republican,
respectively. It is signed by the likes of the Walmart C.E.O. Doug
McMillon, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai and Disney’s Bob Chapek. The letter
calls for “federally guaranteed loans, at favorable terms, that will
enable small businesses to transform and sustain themselves through 2020
and well into 2021.”

**The NASA astronauts in a SpaceX capsule have returned to Earth.**
After a [64-day
trip](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/science/spacex-nasa-return.html)
to orbit — the first crewed mission by a private company — the capsule
splashed safely into the Gulf of Mexico yesterday. “We are entering a
new era of human spaceflight,” Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator,
said at a news conference.

**HSBC reported a bigger-than-expected drop in profits**, with loan
losses and low interest rates [weighing on its
results](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53633550). It also upped its
forecast for bad debts and said it would resume a restructuring that
involves 35,000 job cuts, part of a plan to shrink its U.S. and European
operations that was put on pause during the pandemic.

## The week ahead

🤝 American lawmakers are haggling over a **new stimulus bill**, with the
shape of supplemental jobless benefits — which expired last week — [the
biggest sticking
point](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-jobless-aid.html).
Democrats are pushing for a $3 trillion package that extends many of the
previous measures, while Republicans have aimed for a narrower bill
worth around $1 trillion.

🗣 It’s another busy week for earnings, with more than 100 S\&P 500
companies reporting their latest quarterly results. The highlights
include **BP**, **Diageo**, **Disney** and **KKR** on Tuesday; **CVS**
and **Moderna** on Wednesday; **Uber** on Thursday; and **Berkshire
Hathaway** on Saturday.

📱 Today, **Google** is expected to unveil its [latest Pixel
smartphone](https://9to5google.com/2020/08/02/google-pixel-5g-teaser-leak/).
On Wednesday, **Samsung** announces its latest line of [phones, tablets
and
watches](https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-20-rumor-roundup-leaks-before-samsung-unpacked/).
Most of these gadgets will be able to connect to 5G networks, if only
more of those were available.

📈 A crucial **U.S. jobs report** on Friday will reveal whether
improvements in hiring in May and June continued in July. Weekly data on
unemployment claims [haven’t been
encouraging](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus.html),
but economists still predict that the economy added around 1.6 million
jobs last month (on average, with huge variations in forecasts).

**🗓 From The TimesMachine:** On Aug. 3, 1981, the U.S. air traffic
controllers’ union [called a nationwide
strike](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1981/08/03/217361.html?pageNumber=1)
after talks faltered with the federal government over pay, hours and
working conditions. More than 10,000 workers walked out, despite the
Reagan administration’s threat of “no amnesty” for strikers. Two days
later, the president summarily fired all who refused to return to work,
[a watershed
moment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/11/06/business/collision-course-looks-at-reagan-vs-patco.html)
that significantly altered the balance of power between employers and
workers.

## Venture fund-raising is alive and (relatively) well

The coronavirus has made it more difficult for entrepreneurs to raise
money. But for many companies — from established businesses to smaller
start-ups — the pandemic hasn’t prevented them from finding investors
willing to open their wallets.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**TransferWise recently raised $319 million in a secondary deal,** in
which existing shareholders will sell some of their holdings in the
European fintech company. [The
transaction](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/)
values TransferWise at about $5 billion, a [nearly 43 percent
bump](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2019/05/22/transferwise-valued-at-35-billion-as-founders-sell-stake/)
from last year. Kristo Kaarmann, the company’s C.E.O., told Michael that
TransferWise, which was founded in 2011, didn’t *need* to raise money,
since it has been profitable for three years now. But it saw an
opportunity for older investors and long-tenured employees to sell some
of their stakes.

**Smaller companies aren’t afraid to embark on fund-raising either**,
even if the pandemic has changed the way they court potential investors.

•
[Ro](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/27/ro-raises-200-million-at-1point5-billion-valuation-250-million-sales.html),
a telehealth start-up, said last week that it had raised $200 million in
new funding.

• [Gro Intelligence](https://gro-intelligence.com/), which uses
artificial intelligence to gather agricultural data, is in the process
of raising an “opportunistic” Series B round with a target of $50
million, its founder and C.E.O., Sara Menker, told Michael.

• [Shield AI](http://shield.ai/), which makes A.I. software and
autonomous drones for the military and law enforcement, recently kicked
off its latest round of fund-raising.

**It has taken time for investors to get comfortable, well, investing.**
Venture deals in the second quarter in the U.S., Europe and Asia were
all down from the same time last year, but up from the previous quarter,
[according to PwC and CB
Insights](https://t.yesware.com/tt/e001b3127892bff3127c5684106b4fface2be613/6d096e53b8a44a013ebee1131ad0c628/67276689dfad2ab3eddda9aeeb223346/www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-capital-q2-2020/).
“There’s obviously a lot more gun-shyness,” Ms. Menker of Gro
Intelligence said, with many venture capitalists initially focused on
protecting existing portfolio companies rather than striking new
deals.

**They are now more willing to put money to work**, said Ryan Tseng, a
co-founder and the C.E.O. of Shield AI. That came with acceptance that
Zoom calls, virtual due diligence and other pandemic-era practices are
here to stay.

**Existing relationships with investors don’t hurt.** TransferWise’s
round was co-led by a current backer, Lone Pine Capital, and Mr.
Kaarmann said his company had formed relationships with new investors in
the round, D1 and Vulcan. Ms. Menker said that Gro Intelligence had
already signed commitments from its existing investors, including TPG
and GGV. For companies without these connections, it will be harder to
build the relationships that lead to funding, but perhaps not as hard as
it was a few months ago.
