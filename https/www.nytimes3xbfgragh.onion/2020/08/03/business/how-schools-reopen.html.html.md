# The United States Is Reopening Many of the Wrong Schools

</div>

When it is safe enough to return to school, young children would benefit
the most. Yet financial pressures are pushing colleges to reopen most
rapidly, an economist says.

With [coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus)
spiking in [dozens of
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/09/us/coronavirus-cases-reopening-trends.html),
the prospect of anything resembling a normal school year is fading fast.

[Schools can’t safely
reopen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/school-closing-coronavirus.html)
if infections are [exploding in the
communities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html)
they serve.

But in regions where the pandemic appears to be under control, it is
most important to get the youngest children back into school buildings,
to stop the alarming slide in their learning. Older students, especially
those in college, are better equipped to cope with the difficulties of
online education.

That is the broad consensus among experts on back-to-school priorities.
But, as things stand now, much of the United States is preparing to do
exactly the opposite.

In many towns, college students are more likely than kindergartners to
return to school for in-person instruction. An example is my home of Ann
Arbor, Mich., where schoolchildren will be learning completely online
and university students will be attending at least some classes in
person.

Fifteen of the [20 largest school
districts](https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/school-districts-reopening-plans-a-snapshot.html)
are expected to be teaching fully online in the fall, according to data
collected by Education Week, a trade publication focused on education.
By contrast, among colleges, the pattern is reversed.
[Just 128](https://collegecrisis.shinyapps.io/dashboard/) — roughly 4
percent — of the nation’s thousands of colleges have announced plans to
hold classes solely online, according to data gathered by Davidson
College.

There are plenty of exceptions. At the elementary and secondary levels,
major school districts like [Hillsborough, Fla. (which includes Tampa)
and
Dallas](https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/school-districts-reopening-plans-a-snapshot.html)
are planning to have students attend classes in person. New York City,
which has the nation’s largest school system, is trying to [have it both
ways](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020/welcome-to-the-2020-2021-school-year),
by having students split their learning between the classroom and the
home.

The Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts plans to [shift
classes completely
online](https://www.masslive.com/news/2020/07/here-are-the-fall-reopening-plans-for-the-25-largest-colleges-in-mass.html),
as do several of Harvard’s graduate programs. But most colleges are
welcoming students back to campus this fall, while enormous public
school districts like [Los Angeles
Unified](https://achieve.lausd.net/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=4466&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=91406&PageID=1)
and [Philadelphia](https://www.philasd.org/coronavirus/schoolstart2020/)
are expected to have no children in their
buildings.

A broad group of educators and health experts argues that young children
should be the first back in classrooms, partly because if a child
doesn’t learn to read, write and handle numbers early in primary
school, she or he may struggle for the rest of her or his life. And as a
practical matter, many young children can’t log themselves onto a
computer and learn independently, as university students can.

The educational needs of young children have economic implications. When
children learn at home, they need adults nearby to assist them. Affluent
families can afford to hire a nanny to supervise their children during
the school day, but most people cannot.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sometimes older siblings will help younger ones, which can interrupt
their own learning. But a lot of parents will have no option but to give
up work to watch their kids, which will hamper the economic recovery and
aggravate inequality in wealth and income. The economic case for getting
young children back to school first is therefore very strong.

But just because something makes sense, doesn’t mean it automatically
happens.

For colleges, competition for tuition dollars is pushing them to take
outsize risks to get students back on campus, while for public school
districts, inadequate funding — combined with the failure of government
to curb the coronavirus — is keeping them from getting children safely
back into school buildings.

Consider the plight of some American colleges. Most rely on tuition to
survive, though some schools have other revenue streams: Public
institutions get financial support [from their
states](https://research.collegeboard.org/trends/college-pricing/figures-tables/total-and-student-state-and-local-funding-and-public-enrollment-over-time)
and a [relatively small
number](https://research.collegeboard.org/pdf/2019-trendsincp-fig-19.pdf)
of private schools have enormous endowments that generate substantial
income.

Colleges without deep pockets — those that rely most heavily on tuition
— are at the greatest risk of extinction in this pandemic.

Many college administrators rightly fear they will lose students to
their competitors if they don’t hold out the promise of in-person
classes — which means opening their campuses. This creates what, in
economics, we call an immense coordination problem. The first colleges
to announce that they are teaching entirely online will risk a plunge in
enrollment and tuition revenue, so relatively few have been willing to
do so.

The colleges that have bucked this trend tend not to face strong
competitive pressures. In California, the chancellor of the large,
statewide community college system recommended in May that these schools
should [go
online](https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/california/california-community-college-chancellor-endorses-going-online-only-this-fall/509-bab87578-c4be-4f25-bce7-58bdecf57c90).
This was a logical move, from an economic standpoint, because students
tend to choose the community college closest to their home, and that
reduces competition: Each college has market power in its area. A
community college in San Diego doesn’t worry about its students
decamping to a school in San Francisco.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two community colleges in Los Angeles might compete with each other,
however. But because the community colleges are part of a unified
system, [they can act in
concert](https://edsource.org/2020/some-california-colleges-decide-to-offer-all-fall-classes-online/630660)
and are not driven to risk the public health in order to compete for
students who prefer learning in person.

In contrast, the elite University of California campuses like Berkeley
and [Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) operate in a highly competitive
environment, vying with each other (and with top private colleges) for
the best students in the world.

Perhaps that’s why the University of California schools held out the
prospect of in-person classes [long after the community
colleges](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article244116777.html).
The University of California, Berkeley only [announced in late
July](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/07/21/uc-berkeley-online-covid-19-fall-semester)
that it would be operating completely online, while U.C.L.A. [revealed
in
mid-June](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/preparations-for-the-2020-21-academic-year)
that it was planning to teach just about one-fifth of its classes in
person or in a hybrid format.

If competition for students is preventing many colleges from making
choices that would benefit the public, constrained public revenue
streams are behind the existential challenge for schools that educate
younger students.

Because of the crisis, budgets are being slashed just as costs are
rising. Schools that hope to reopen safely need a steady supply of masks
and sanitizer; upgraded ventilation systems; more school buses and
drivers; a robust system of testing and tracing; and lots of extra real
estate for social distancing. But the tax revenues that fund schools are
drying up in the economic downturn. Elementary and secondary schools
typically [eat up 22
percent](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/07/pandemic-budget-crunch-could-force-states-to-slash-social-services-education-police-budgets-and-more)
of state and local budgets. Across the United States, state and local
governments could face shortfalls this year [estimated to total more
than $700
billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizfarmer/2020/07/14/trump-cant-withhold-education-funding-but-schools-could-face-a-funding-crisis-anyway/#_blank).
And [nearly every state has a balanced budget
requirement](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/07/pandemic-budget-crunch-could-force-states-to-slash-social-services-education-police-budgets-and-more)
that precludes using borrowing to get through this crunch.

Without extensive investment in safety measures, virus outbreaks will
most likely close any school that opens its doors. And with Congress
headed toward its August vacation, it’s unlikely that fresh funds will
start flowing to local schools soon. In this environment, it is not
surprising that many districts are deciding not to reopen classrooms,
and that many teachers are [protesting when asked to
return](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/teacher-union-school-reopening-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=1).

The decisions of schools reverberate beyond the classroom, affecting the
broader economy. And, like the pandemic itself, the effects spill across
city and state lines, with the choices in one place constraining the
ability of businesses in another to survive. A pandemic is exactly the
type of interstate, multisector challenge that an active federal
government is built for.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By now, in many places, it’s already too late to undertake the enormous
preparation needed to open classrooms to young children this fall. That
could change in the unlikely event of a big and immediate infusion of
federal funding.

This assumes, of course, that the government has succeeded in
suppressing the pandemic *outside* of schools. If the coronavirus is
raging unchecked through a region, no amount of funding can make it safe
for children to be in school.
