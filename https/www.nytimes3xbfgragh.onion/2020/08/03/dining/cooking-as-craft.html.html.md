Good morning. “Manual competence” is the ideal Matthew Crawford speaks
up for in his excellent 2010 book, “[Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry
Into the Value of
Work](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/301618/shop-class-as-soulcraft-by-matthew-b-crawford/).”
Crawford’s a mechanic and a philosopher. He has no truck with
craftsmanship or artistry. He speaks instead for the importance of trade
work — “work that is meaningful because it is genuinely useful,” he
writes. He finds that work engaging intellectually, and he finds in it
an argument that celebrates responsibility and personal agency. (He’s a
philosopher, remember.)

I think that’s right, and I think it’s right about cooking especially.
The work that we do in the kitchen is at its best an exhibition of
manual competence — making bread dough or flipping omelets or dicing
carrots — and a salute to the responsibility we take on in feeding
ourselves and our families. There’s no question it’s good to be able to
work with your hands to make something useful like dinner. And it is
meaningful, too, both for you and those you serve.

So practice and learn, if you haven’t already. [Learn to roast
chicken](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/11-how-to-roast-chicken).
Learn [how to make
pancakes](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/24-how-to-make-pancakes)
and [how to make perfect
rice](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/49-how-to-make-rice).
[Learn how to
grill](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/7-how-to-grill).
Manual competence in the kitchen will pay dividends for the rest of your
life.

And if you’re a scratch cook already? Cook something new. I like this
[ginger-lime
chicken](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021294-ginger-lime-chicken)
number, for instance. And this [tomato and peach salad with whipped goat
cheese](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020367-tomato-and-peach-salad-with-whipped-goat-cheese)
(above) as well. Make [pork schnitzel with quick
pickles](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1016866-pork-schnitzel-with-quick-pickles),
and you’ll end up schnitzeling everything, pickling everything, too.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I hope you’ll make [shakshuka with
feta](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1014721-shakshuka-with-feta)
at some point soon, and [wild salmon with green
sauce](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1014868-wild-salmon-with-green-sauce)
as well. Take those zucchinis from the farmers’ market, make them into
[olive oil zucchini
bread](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1017522-olive-oil-zucchini-bread).
Take the early corn and make [shrimp linguine with herbs, corn and
arugula](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020354-shrimp-linguine-with-herbs-corn-and-arugula).

This is all labor, but still some distance from digging ditches. You can
even have a cocktail while you work, as with this recipe [for pasta with
chickpeas and a
Negroni](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020019-pasta-with-chickpeas-and-a-negroni).

[Baked spinach-artichoke
pasta](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020080-baked-spinach-artichoke-pasta)?
[Mayo-marinated chicken with
chimichurri](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020543-mayo-marinated-chicken-with-chimichurri)?
There are thousands and thousands of recipes to work on waiting for you
on [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/). It’s true you
need a subscription to access them all, and to use the features of our
site and apps. Subscriptions support our work. They allow it to
continue. If you haven’t already, will you please [subscribe
today](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/subscription/cooking.html?campaignId=6XQHR)?

And we’ll be standing by in case something goes sideways with your
cooking or our code. Just reach out to us at <cookingcare@NYTimes.com>.
Someone will get back to you, promise.

Now, it’s nothing to do with preserving peaches or grilling tautog, but
Joe Coscarelli’s latest “[Diary of a
Song](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/arts/music/phoebe-bridgers-kyoto.html),”
featuring Phoebe Bridgers and
“[Kyoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw0zYd0eIlk),” is a master
class in new-format journalism, and really fascinating to boot. And
while you’re at it, here’s “[I Know the
End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ9-xN6dCW4),” which features the
primal scream Bridgers talks about in Joe’s story.

Also in The Times, Malia Wollan has the inside scoop on [how to stop
biting your
nails](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/magazine/how-to-stop-biting-your-nails.html).

You bet I’m going to read Natasha Trethewey’s new memoir, “[Memorial
Drive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/books/review-memorial-drive-memoir-natasha-trethewey.html).”

Finally, to end where we started, of course [Matthew Crawford has a TED
Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdGky1JZovg). It’s about making
things and fixing things. You might take that in as well. And I’ll see
you on Wednesday.
