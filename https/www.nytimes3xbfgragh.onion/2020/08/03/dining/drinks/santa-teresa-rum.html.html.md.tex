Santa Teresa, an elegant rum estate established not far from Caracas,
Venezuela, in 1796, is still going strong. Its Santa Teresa 1796 Solera
Rum --- processed using
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/01/dining/drinks/wine-school-manzanilla-sherry.html}{the
solera method}, like sherry, and aged in bourbon oak barrels, whiskey
oak barrels and French limousin oak barrels --- has a dark, brooding

and pineapple}. During the pandemic, Geoff Robinson, a company manager,
enlisted bartenders to participate in designing a new ``Crafted Together
Limited Edition'' label for the rum. The label is royal blue and gold
with a subtle mosaic of images selected by about 25 bartenders in
exquisite corpse fashion, with each participant nominating the next, and
so forth. The company also donated \$10,000 to the Bartender Emergency
Assistance Program by the nonprofit United States Bartenders' Guild.
