The chef Marcus Samuelsson's Streetbird flies again. His closed Harlem
restaurant specialized in fried chicken, and the dish is now available
for delivery nationwide. All it requires is a quick reheat. In the kit,
which serves four, you get four battered, golden-brown back-quarters
(legs and thighs) with cornbread waffles, pickles and hot honey for
drizzling (a desirable enhancement) and a mixed vegetable succotash.

Marcus' Hot Honey Chicken and Cornbread Waffles Kit, \$99 including
shipping,
