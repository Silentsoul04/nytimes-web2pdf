THE NAVAJO NATION — When Summer Brown lived in Phoenix, she had no
problem finding fresh produce. If the Sprouts supermarket near her home
didn’t have what she was looking for, she would just drive somewhere
else.

This winter, Ms. Brown, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, moved
back to her childhood home in Cornfields, Ariz., to start a [small
business](https://www.lotusandlayneleather.com/) as a leatherworker.
Now, healthy food is harder to find for her two children, Paisley, 6,
and Landon, 7. The entire Nation, which stretches 27,000 square miles
across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, has fewer than 15 grocery stores.

“The pickings are kind of slim here,” said Ms. Brown, 31. “It’s a lot of
processed foods, and I try not to feed my family that.”

Even before the coronavirus pandemic [dealt an exceptionally brutal blow
to the
Navajo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/us/coronavirus-native-americans-indian-country.html)
— who call themselves the Diné, which means “the People” — Ms. Brown
wanted to grow her own food. She spent last winter collecting seeds from
Indigenous seed banks and researching Indigenous methods. Her small
garden is already feeding her family, and she is looking forward to the
fall harvest.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Her backyard garden isn’t meant just to replace a trip to the grocery
store. Ms. Brown is part of a movement for food sovereignty, [a global
effort to give people control of their food supply and
nutrition](https://foodsecurecanada.org/who-we-are/what-food-sovereignty).
It is a public health endeavor, an economic reclamation, an
environmental protest and for many, a spiritual quest. Gardeners aim to
grow [healthy
foods](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/dining/native-americans-coronavirus.html)
that are connected to their traditions, and to revive old methods of
cultivation.

“I want to show the whole Navajo Nation, and even off the reservation,
that you can live with the earth and you don’t have to rely so much on
the outside to feed yourself,” Ms. Brown said. “We have all this land.
We should be able to just go outside and get our food.”

The small gardens and cornfields rising across the Nation (which the
Diné call the Dinétah) are attempts to correct legacies of historical
wrongs. Once, the Diné were prosperous gardeners, hunters and stewards
of the land. Then the United States government [colonized the land and
displaced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/opinion/sunday/navajo-nation-coronavirus.html)
the Diné in the mid-1800s, during what is now known as [the Long
Walk](https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/navajo/long-walk/long-walk.cshtml),
to an internment camp at Fort Sumner, N.M. Livestock were killed off.
Fields were trampled. And some orchards were lost forever.

Those and other attempts to [divorce the Diné from their land and
ancestral
foodways](https://www.firstnations.org/wp-content/uploads/publication-attachments/Dine_Policy_Institute_Food_Sovereignty_Report.pdf)
have also left them vulnerable to the pandemic. Across the United
States, Indigenous nations have suffered outbreaks that often appear to
be more devastating than those in surrounding cities. But [data gaps,
population fluidity and under-testing make the scope of infections hard
to
quantify](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/native-americans-coronavirus-data.html).

The Diné have weathered
[curfews](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-navajo/facing-arizona-surge-navajos-reimpose-virus-curfew-idUSKBN23O3R4)
and high rates of infection. The Nation is one of the hardest hit areas
in the United States: 9,019 people have tested positive and 454 have
died of Covid-19, as of July 30, according to [the Navajo Department of
Health](https://www.ndoh.navajo-nsn.gov/COVID-19).

Many households do not have running water, at a time when hand washing
is critical. Many multigenerational families live together in compounds,
which makes social distancing impossible. And for the Diné and many
other Indigenous nations, the public health crises caused by food
inequality are generations old.

“This virus has really shown how fragile and even unreliable the system
really is, and how quickly everything can collapse,” said Nate Etsitty,
40, a food sovereignty advocate who has been helping Ms. Brown with her
garden. “That’s what is driving more people to be partially more
self-sustained.”

After seeing food shortages during the pandemic, many Diné have started
gardens. Normally, they would work communally, but social distancing has
required some innovations. This year, Mx. Etsitty (who uses
gender-neutral pronouns and titles) has been helping first-time
gardeners through the complex processes from afar. Other experienced
gardeners, inundated with requests for help, are recording videos.

Felix Earle, 43, one of Mx. Etsitty’s closest friends, has been advising
gardeners growing Indigenous seeds. In 2015, he found a handful of white
corn kernels in a jar, 35 years after his grandmother hid them for
safekeeping. He named the strain “Grandma Helen’s Corn.” Its kernels
look like little white teeth, perfect and round.

This year, Mr. Earle, a fashion designer, planted his biggest crop ever.
Across his property, stalks of corn are rising, almost 1,000 in all. He
turned his discovery into a business, Red Earth Gardens, and gives
kernels to interested members of the Nation. This year, for the first
time, he ran out.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A global Indigenous food sovereignty movement began well before the
pandemic. Some point to 2002 as a transitional moment, when
representatives from Indigenous nations in 28 countries gathered at Lake
Atitlán, in Panajachel, Guatemala, to write [a declaration of the right
to
food](https://www.iitc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FINAL_Atitlan-Declaration-Food-Security_Apr25_ENGL.pdf).

“We know that food is medicine, but it can also make us more sick,” said
Denisa Livingston, a leading Diné community health advocate and the Slow
Food International Indigenous Councilor of the Global North. “It can
contaminate our health and well-being.”

With limited sources of income to pay for the gasoline for long trips to
faraway stores, families buy cheap bulk foods with a long shelf life,
instead of fresh produce. Today, the Diné have high rates of diabetes,
heart disease and obesity, conditions that pose a higher risk of
complications or death from Covid-19.

Many Diné also receive [federal food
benefits](https://gardenwarriorsgoodseeds.com/2020/05/03/native-food-systems-in-the-time-of-covid-19/).
“You’ve got to stretch those funds, and the cheapest out there is junk
food,” said Artie Yazzie, a community gardener, who grows produce for
his
neighbors.

Some programs are working to get fresh produce to Diné children. The
[Community Outreach and Patient
Empowerment](https://www.copeprogram.org/) program, a nonprofit health
partnership, provides vouchers for families with young children that are
good for buying only fruits, vegetables and traditional foods. The
amount, depending on family size, can go up to $35 a
week.

But when children turn 5, they are usually no longer eligible for
vouchers. Dr. Lydia Kim, a pediatrician with the Indian Health Services,
sees the damage that unreliable access to food and water can wreak on
her patients. Some who struggle with obesity drink five or six sodas a
day.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_3_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

With help from community partners, Dr. Kim started the Shiprock Area
Food Access Coalition in 2018 to increase access to healthy food and
water. She asked managers of a local grocery to move produce to the
front of the store, so more shoppers might see and buy them. The
managers told her their hands were tied, she said, because soft-drink
companies owned the displays near the entrance. (The store manager did
not respond to multiple texts seeking comment.)

Dr. Kim said she has seen many more sugary-drink displays in grocery
stores in Shiprock, N.M., than in those outside the reservation.
“There’s predatory targeting and a complete lack of choice.”

Ms. Livingston and members of the [Diné Community Advocacy
Alliance](https://dineadvocacy.org/?fbclid=IwAR17Oomqz5BgHuhAVh693s1hPGHkWJIrRUMzaej_G393ohQe-Y2O5gCvqH0)
lobbied the Navajo Nation government to pass the [Healthy Diné Nation
Act
of 2014](https://www.tax.navajo-nsn.gov/Navajo%20Taxes/Regulations/Junk%20Food%20Tax%20Regulations%20%201-14-15.pdf).
It lead to an elimination of a tax on healthy foods, while imposing a 2
percent tax on unhealthy foods, like
soda.

The tax revenues help fund community wellness and food sovereignty
projects like the Teesto Community Garden, in the Arizona section of the
Nation. Last year, Mr. Yazzie, 39, the community gardener who oversaw
the garden as a seasonal employee, would borrow the municipal pickup
truck to fill an 1,800-gallon tank with water and irrigate the garden.
In the summer, he goes through about 3,000 gallons each week.

For much of this year’s planting season, the truck was tied up
delivering emergency provisions to families in need. But for Mr. Yazzie,
planting was still a priority.

At first, he recruited his cousin to help fill a 300-gallon barrel each
week. They contributed part of their federal stimulus checks to repair a
600-gallon water tank and trailer, burning through expensive gas as they
drove back and
forth.
