Biltong is South African beef jerky, succulent and less stringy than the
American kind, and this new West Village food store specializes in it.
The house biltong is made from traditional grass-fed or aged beef, among
other options, and thin little slices often have a richness that's
worthy of a platter or cheese board. The owners of the shop, Camran St.
Luce and Brittney Brothers, also sell meat pies, sausages, chutneys,
South African beers and ciders, and other goods. Everything except beer
and cider is available nationwide on the website. The shop opens Aug. 4.

New York Biltong, 22 Greenwich Avenue (West 10th Street), 917-261-6104,
