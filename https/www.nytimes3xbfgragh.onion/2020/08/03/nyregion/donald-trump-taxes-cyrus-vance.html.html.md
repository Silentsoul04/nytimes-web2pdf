<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Manhattan district attorney’s office suggested on Monday that it had
been investigating President Trump and his company for possible bank and
insurance fraud, a significantly broader inquiry than the prosecutors
have acknowledged in the past.

The suggestion by the office of the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance
Jr., came in a new federal court filing arguing that Mr. Trump’s
accountants should have to comply with a grand jury subpoena seeking
eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. Mr. Trump has
asked a judge to declare the subpoena invalid.

Until now, the district attorney’s inquiry had appeared largely focused
on hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 presidential
election to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.

In the new filing, the prosecutors did not explicitly identify the
matters under scrutiny in the grand jury inquiry, which by law is
conducted in secret. But they said that “undisputed” assertions in
earlier court papers and several news reports about Mr. Trump’s business
practices showed that the office had a wide legal basis for the
subpoena.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“In light of these public reports of possibly extensive and protracted
criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,” there was nothing improper
or even unusual about the subpoena, the filing said.

The prosecutors cited newspaper reports, including [one that concluded
the president may have illegally inflated his net worth and the value of
his properties to lenders and
insurers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/politics/trump-statements-of-financial-condition/).
They also included [an article on the congressional testimony of his
former lawyer and fixer, Michael D.
Cohen](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cohen-to-say-trump-knew-about-wikileaks-talks-engaged-in-criminal-conduct-while-in-office-11551249532),
who told lawmakers last year that the president had committed insurance
fraud. Lawyers for the president have denied wrongdoing.

The suggestion that the investigation, which has gone on for nearly two
years, was broader than Mr. Vance’s office had previously acknowledged
could raise the stakes for Mr. Trump, his company and its executives, if
the inquiry were ever to lead to charges of bank or insurance fraud,
which are
felonies.

The inquiry into the hush-money payments seemed to center on a less
serious crime, the filing of false business records.

A spokesman for Mr. Vance’s office declined to comment. Lawyers for Mr.
Trump did not reply to requests for comment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Asked about the investigation at a White House briefing, Mr. Trump
called it a “continuation of the worst witch hunt in American history.”

“It’s a terrible thing that they do,” Mr. Trump said, referring to
Democrats. “It’s really a terrible thing.”

Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance have been locked in battle [over the subpoena
for almost a year in a case that already has gone to the Supreme
Court](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html).
The district attorney’s office has said that fight has slowed the
investigation, and it remains unclear how much work prosecutors have
been able to do in the interim or whether charges are likely to result.

It is also unknown whether prosecutors are investigating other possible
crimes that were not suggested in the new filing.

Rebecca Roiphe, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan who
now teaches at New York Law School, said Mr. Vance’s decision to cite
public accusations of wrongdoing allowed his office to defend its
subpoena without revealing the actual focus of its investigation.

“They could be going on a totally different tangent,” Professor Roiphe
said. “The prosecutor is just doing what he has to do in order to
suggest this is a broad white-collar investigation, which generally
justifies fairly broad subpoenas to financial institutions.”

Mr. Vance, a Democrat, [subpoenaed Mr. Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars
USA, in August 2019 for the tax
returns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/16/nyregion/trump-tax-returns-cy-vance.html)
and other financial records dating to 2011. Mr. Trump tried to block the
subpoena almost immediately, initially arguing that as a sitting
president, [he was immune from state criminal
investigation.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/19/nyregion/trump-tax-returns-lawsuit.html)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The case wound its way through the federal courts until last month, when
the Supreme Court soundly rejected that argument in a major ruling on
the limits of presidential power. The decision cleared the way for
prosecutors to seek Mr. Trump’s financial records, but the court also
said Mr. Trump could return to the lower court in Manhattan, where he
first sued to stop the subpoena, and raise new objections.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers argued last week that [the subpoena was overbroad
and politically
motivated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html),
asking the federal judge, Victor Marrero, to block it and declare it
unenforceable.

Mr. Vance’s office responded with the filing on Monday, contending that
Mr. Trump’s argument “rests on the false premise that the grand jury’s
investigation is limited to so-called ‘hush-money’ payments” made by Mr.
Cohen in 2016.

“This court is already aware that this assertion is fatally undermined
by undisputed information in the public record,” the prosecutors wrote,
before citing the media accounts.

Mr. Cohen had arranged payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels
and another woman, Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model. Mr. Vance’s
office has been looking into whether any New York State laws were broken
when those payments were made.

Mr. Cohen, [who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations
for his role in the
payments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-russia-mueller.html),
is [serving a three-year prison sentence in home confinement in his
apartment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-book.html)
in Manhattan. [Federal prosectors concluded their
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/17/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-investigation.html)
into the matter last year and have not charged anyone else.

In a recent federal court hearing, Mr. Vance’s office accused [Mr. Trump
of dragging out the legal fight in order to effectively shield himself
from criminal
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“What the president’s lawyers are seeking here is delay,” Carey R.
Dunne, a lawyer in Mr. Vance’s office, told Judge Marrero.

Mr. Dunne said that the longer Mr. Trump fought the case, the greater
the chance that the statute of limitations would expire for any
potential crimes that might have been committed, effectively granting
the president immunity.

“Let’s not let delay kill this case,” Mr. Dunne argued.

Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, denied after the hearing that
Mr. Trump’s lawyers were pursing a strategy of delay. “Our strategy
seeks due process,” Mr. Sekulow said in an email at the time.

If Mr. Vance succeeds in eventually obtaining Mr. Trump’s records, they
are unlikely to become public anytime soon because they will be shielded
by grand jury secrecy rules. The records might only emerge later if
criminal charges are brought and the records are introduced in a
trial.
