Election officials in New York City widely distributed mail-in ballots
for the primary on June 23, which featured dozens of hard-fought races.
The officials had hoped to make voting much easier, but they did not
seem prepared for the response: more than 10 times the number of
absentee ballots received in recent elections in the city.

Now, nearly six weeks later, two closely watched congressional races
remain undecided, and major delays in counting a deluge of 400,000
[mail-in
ballots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/trump-mail-in-voting.html)
and other problems are being cited as examples of the challenges facing
the nation as it looks toward conducting the November general election
during the pandemic.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other officials are trading blame for the
botched counting in the city, and the Postal Service is coming under
criticism over whether it is equipped to handle the sharp increase in
absentee ballots.

Election lawyers said one area of concern in New York City was that
mail-in ballots have prepaid return envelopes. The Postal Service
apparently had difficulty processing some of them correctly and, as a
result, an unknown number of votes — perhaps thousands — may have been
wrongfully disqualified because of a lack of a postmark.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Thousands more ballots in the city were discarded by election officials
for minor errors, or not even sent to voters until the day before the
primary, making it all but impossible for the ballots to be returned in
time.

In recent days, President Trump has also jumped into the fray,
repeatedly citing the primary in New York City for his unfounded claims
that mail-in voting is susceptible to fraud. There is no evidence that
the primary results were tainted by criminal malfeasance, according to a
wide array of election officials and representatives of campaigns.

Still, candidates and political analysts are warning that government
officials at all levels need to take urgent action to avoid a nightmare
in November.

“This election is a canary in the coal mine,” said Suraj Patel, a
Democrat running for Congress in a district that includes parts of
Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, who has filed a federal lawsuit over the
primary.

Mr. Patel trails the incumbent, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, by
some 3,700 votes, though more than 12,000 ballots have been
disqualified, including about 1,200 that were missing postmarks, he
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He is among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in July that is asking a
federal court to order election officials to count disqualified ballots.
The lawsuit included testimony that election officials had mailed out
more than 34,000 ballots one day before the June 23
primary.

A winner has also not been declared in a congressional district in the
Bronx, where Ritchie Torres, a Democratic city councilman, holds a
comfortable lead over several other contenders.

Other states and localities had vote-by-mail primaries during the
pandemic, with some scattered reports of problems — though nothing on
the scale of New York City’s weekslong process. Even before the
outbreak, the city’s Board of Elections had a reputation as a troubled
agency that ran elections [rife with
problems](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/07/nyregion/voting-problems-nyc-.html).

New York City election officials insisted last week that [they were
doing their
best](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/nyregion/election-absentee-ballots-primary.html)
under the extraordinary circumstances.

They pointed out the difficulties in protecting election workers from
the coronavirus, and cited [state
laws](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/ELN/9-209) requiring the
disqualification of ballots for various small errors — including missing
signatures on ballot envelopes or envelopes sealed with tape — for
contributing to the high number of invalidated ballots.

Election officials also said the changing plans for the state’s
presidential primary — it was [initially
canceled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/us/politics/democratic-primary-canceled-coronavirus.html)
before being reinstated by the courts — had delayed the process of
sending out absentee ballots.

The city’s Board of Elections is not expected to certify the vote until
Tuesday. Thirteen weeks later, on Nov. 3, the state and city could face
another crush of absentee ballots.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Frederic M. Umane, the board’s secretary, defended the handling of the
election, calling the ballot-counting process “slow, but accurate and
open.”

He said the board’s operation was greatly affected by the outbreak.

“Our staff was decimated by Covid,” Mr. Umane said, noting the board had
about 350 permanent workers and other temporary workers, many of whom
were sick and could not work before the primary.

Mr. Umane said the board might need hundreds more workers for the
November election.

Primaries were conducted across the state, but New York City seemed to
encounter the biggest problems, in part because it had many closely
contested races and substantial voter participation.

Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, acknowledged last week that the
primary was flawed, likening mail-in voting to other “systems that we
were working on but were not ready,” such as remote learning and
telemedicine, and suggesting the problem lay at a local level.

“We did have — not we — boards of elections had operational issues, some
better, some worse, and they have to learn from them,” Mr. Cuomo said.
“And we want to get the lessons and make the system better and make it
better for November.”

A person familiar with the internal operation of the city’s Board of
Elections, but not authorized to speak on the record, said that having
to increase the number of mail-in ballots had caused enormous struggles
at the agency.

“Imagine saying, ‘I’m having a dinner party for 10 people,’ and then
they say, ‘No, it’s 100 people,’” the person said. “It’s a very deep
learning curve.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The person added that the board made missteps along the way, including
not hiring enough people to count the absentee ballots. Even the vendors
hired to produce the ballots seemed overwhelmed.

In comments on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said his administration had offered
help to local election boards, including “personnel to do counting,”
though no boards seemed to take the state up on its offer. He also noted
that some boards did not start counting ballots until the second week of
July. “Well, what was that?” he said.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly referred to the New York primary over the last
two weeks, warning that the “same thing would happen, but on massive
scale” across the country on Nov. 3.

The president returned to the topic on Thursday as means of justifying
his suggestion that the general election might need to be postponed, a
trial balloon that was [widely panned by even his fellow
Republicans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-tweet-democracy.html).

New York State lawmakers said they had responded to the problems last
month by approving a roster of fixes [to the vote-by-mail
system](https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-majority-advances-automatic-voter-registration-system-strengthens),
though it was not clear if Mr. Cuomo would sign the bills. Among other
changes, the legislation would allow the counting of ballots received
shortly after the election [without
postmarks](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8799/amendment/a)
and would require officials to [notify voters of small
errors](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8370/amendment/b)
in their ballot envelopes.

Election experts pointed to an array of causes for the issues in the
primary: In late April, as the toll from the coronavirus mounted, [Mr.
Cuomo ordered a wide expansion of absentee
voting](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-issues-executive-order-make-sure-every-new-yorker),
sending every New Yorker eligible to vote in the primary an application
for an absentee ballot.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the intention may have been to encourage voting, the
infrastructure lagged: Until a wave of changes approved in 2019, New
York [had been behind other states in adopting measures like early
voting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/10/nyregion/voting-reform-election-ny.html).

“The state has long had some of the strictest rules when it comes to
being able to cast an absentee ballot, and it wasn’t built to support
the increased volume,” said Lawrence Norden, director of the Election
Reform Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.

The counting of absentee ballots is more labor intensive than machine
counts of in-person votes, which in the past had made up more than 90
percent of New York’s election returns. Jerry H. Goldfeder, a veteran
election lawyer, said the board did not have enough money to hire
workers to process absentee ballots.

“They could have asked for money and hired more staff, because they knew
in advance they were going to get an avalanche of absentee ballots,” Mr.
Goldfeder said. “There’s nothing magical about that.”

In all, the New York City Board of Elections sent more than 750,000
ballots with prepaid return envelopes, and some 400,000 were mailed
back. Postage on prepaid envelopes costs less than a stamp and is
charged to the payer only if used.

Prepaid envelopes are not typically postmarked by the post office’s
sorting systems, though the Postal Service recommends that ballot
envelopes use a special bar code to help identify them. Officials say
they make every effort to identify ballots and assure a postmark, a
critical element in determining if ballots were sent by the Election Day
deadline.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That means going so far as to use human “gatekeepers” to backstop the
Postal Service’s massive computerized sorting systems, who pull ballot
envelopes out, one at a time, and feed them through a cancellation
machine to assure a
postmark.

But it was far from foolproof: Michael Calabrese, a manager at the
Postal Service’s [Manhattan processing
plant](https://www.uspsoig.gov/document/new-york-morgan-processing-and-distribution-center-efficiency),
could only confirm that extra gatekeepers were on hand to locate stray
ballots on Election Day itself.

Even so, some unmarked ballots got through.

“It’s not a 100 percent process,” he said, under questioning from Judge
Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan. “It’s not
something we could normally do, but in order to capture and read those
ballots, we did that.”

The postal agency defended its performance, but also acknowledged that
“some ballots may not have been postmarked.” It said it would take
“action to resolve the issue going forward.”

“We continue to work with the secretary of state and all New York boards
of election and look forward to a successful general election,” Xavier
C. Hernandez, a Postal Service spokesman, said.

Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant, said the state and city
needed to drastically increase election staff for November. “This is
logistics,” Mr. Gyory said. “It isn’t rocket science.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He added that such steps could make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to
cite problems in New York to dispute the results of the general
election.

“He is trying to create doubt,” Mr. Gyory said. “Because he knows he’s
going to lose the election if things don’t change.”
