Not many people are riding the subway these days --- being cooped up
with strangers in a subway car must surely be among the riskiest
activities possible during the coronavirus pandemic.

But that may not be entirely true. Even as riders have returned in
greater numbers to public transit in Europe and Asia, there has been a
lack of corresponding superspreader events,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/nyregion/nyc-subway-coronavirus-safety.html}{my
colleague Christina Goldbaum reported}. A superspreader is an infected
person who transmits the virus to many others.

So while experts say riding the subway is probably riskier than walking
outdoors, it is also probably safer than dining indoors.

Here are some takeaways from her article:

\textbf{In countries where the outbreak has waned, there have been no
notable superspreader events linked to mass transit.}

In Beijing, subway ridership has risen to about 60 percent of
pre-pandemic levels; in Berlin, ridership on buses and subways is 60 to
70 percent of normal rates; and in Paris, ridership on the MÃ©tro has
returned to 45 percent of usual levels.

Superspreader events, however, have not emerged.

\textbf{Still, public health experts warn that the evidence so far
should be met with caution.}

Even in cities where ridership is up, it has not reached pre-pandemic
levels. A full return, with jam-packed subway cars, still poses a
danger.

There are also other factors that may affect whether outbreaks occur.
They include the quality of ventilation systems used to filter air, and
the level to which a city has reduced its overall infection rate.

As a result, tracking clusters of coronavirus cases to public transit is
difficult: The chances that infected people would remember the precise
train car they rode in is unlikely, and reaching those who were in that
same car is nearly impossible.

Even looking back at the worst months in New York City, officials are
not clear on the degree to which mass transit contributed to a surge
that killed more than 20,000 people.

\textbf{New York officials are now focused on how to draw riders back
while avoiding crowding at rush hour.}

Subway ridership in the city is still at about 20 percent of
pre-pandemic levels. For the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the
agency that runs the city's subway and buses and that relies on fare
revenue for 40 percent of its operating budget, that's a problem.

But there are things that can lessen the risk of riding the subway.

In the months since the height of the outbreak in New York, the
authority has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the daily
disinfection of train cars, distributed over a million masks to riders
and started public service campaigns encouraging riders to maintain
social distance.

New York transit officials say that a recent observational study of more
than 220,000 riders found that over 90 percent were wearing masks.

In New York's subway trains, transit officials say, the air that
circulates through a car is replaced with fresh, filtered air at least
18 times an hour, much higher than the recommended air-exchange rates in
restaurants or in offices.

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

The United States recorded more than 1.9 million new coronavirus
infections last month, more than double any previous monthly total. In
New York, the city is opening up but taking protective measures.

To help us all understand the recent events and what the future might
hold, we recently asked you to send in your questions about the effects
of the virus on daily life. Readers of The Times's California Today
newsletter, for example, asked

massage therapists were adapting} to the pandemic and what people should
know before
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/california-parks-coronavirus.html}{visiting
state and national parks}.

We're curious about everything --- what do you want to know about the
economy, health care, the environment, the arts, dating, traveling and
more? How are you experiencing life during the pandemic, and how can we
help you make sense of those changes?

Dear Diary:

As I left the No. 6 train station at Bleecker Street, I noticed two
young men on the corner. One was holding a map, and they both had
puzzled looks on their faces as they scanned the nearby street signs.

I asked whether they needed help.

The one with the map said he knew where they were but couldn't find the
spot on the map.

I pointed out Houston Street a block away, and then showed them where it
was on the map. They thanked me.

As I started to walk away, the second man reached out his hand --- not
to shake mine, but to give me a \$1 bill.

It was the only time I'd been offered a tip for giving directions.
