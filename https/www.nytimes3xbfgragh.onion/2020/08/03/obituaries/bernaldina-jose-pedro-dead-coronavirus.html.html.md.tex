\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Bernaldina José Pedro possessed a wealth of knowledge about the songs,
dances, crafts, medicines and prayers of the Macuxi Indigenous people
who live in northernmost Brazil. She was also considered a respected
voice in the struggle to establish a 4 million-acre Indigenous
territory, where her people live, on the border with Guyana.

But what was especially satisfying to her was a 2018 trip to Rome to
meet Pope Francis, because it showed the world a woman could be an
Indigenous leader.

``It made a great impression on her,'' said her son, Jaider Esbell. ``It
was the first time she left Brazil and she was proud to be performing
what would usually be a man's role, usually something a chief would
do.''

Ms. Pedro died on June 24 at a hospital in Boa Vista, the capital of
Roraima state in Brazil. She was 75. Mr. Esbell said the cause was
Covid-19.

Better known as Vovó Bernaldina (Grandma Bernaldina, her Portuguese
name), Ms. Pedro was Catholic and a big fan of the pope even without
renouncing her traditional beliefs --- a common practice in the region.
During the short meeting, in a general audience in St. Peter's Square,
she gave Francis a letter warning that the government might try to
reclaim the reservation and asking for his help.

The
\href{https://www.ecoamazonia.org.br/2018/11/indigenas-macuxi-recebidos-papa-francisco/}{meeting}was
captured in the 2020 documentary ``Amazonian Cosmos,'' by Daniel
Schweizer, which recounted her son's efforts to raise awareness about
his people.

Ms. Pedro was born Koko Meriná Eremunkon on March 25, 1945 to Samuel
José de Souza and Marina José in the Indigenous village of Pedra Preta,
in Guyana, where they hunted, farmed and fished for a living. In her
20s, she married Marcelo Pedro and moved to his village, Mataruca, just
across the border in Brazil.

Her husband's family were tribal leaders and she rose through marriage
but she commanded respect on her own for the traditional wisdom,
charisma and the guidance she offered while the Macuxi fought off court
challenges, squatters and often violent attacks, until the reservation
where they live, the Raposa Serra do Sol, was officially established in
2009.

In 2019, she published a book, ``Chants and Enchantment --- Meriná
Eremunkon,'' with Devair Fiorotti.

Aside from Mr. Esbell, Ms. Pedro is survived by her children Marcilio,
Benjamin, Aguinês, Jorge, Eldina and Charles. Her sons Jaime and Horacio
died earlier. She had 15 grandchildren.

When Covid-19 first appeared in her village, Ms. Pedro was the one whom
people called on to fight the new disease. She would perform a
shamanistic ritual which involved filling the hut of an ailing person
with smoke, chanting and dance. That was how she may have become
infected, her son said.

``She died doing what she liked to do,'' Mr. Esbell explained, adding
that Ms. Pedro imparted much of her traditional knowledge to her
daughter Eldina, who will now assume her role
