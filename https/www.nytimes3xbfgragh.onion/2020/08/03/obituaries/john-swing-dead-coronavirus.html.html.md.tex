48.}\label{john-eric-swing-a-filipino-american-community-builder-dies-at-48}}

Mr. Swing was a catalyst in the Historic Filipinotown neighborhood of
Los Angeles, a new center of food start-ups. He died of complications of
the coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

When Food \& Wine magazine declared last year that
``\href{https://www.foodandwine.com/travel/restaurants/historic-filipinotown-restaurants-los-angeles}{Historic
Filipinotown is L.A.'s Next Great Dining Neighborhood},'' an unseen
player in this rise was neither a chef nor a restaurateur.

John Eric Swing spent the last five years helping restaurants and other
small businesses in the community through a nonprofit called
\href{https://sipacares.org/}{Search to Involve Pilipino Americans}, or
SIPA. In April he became the organization's executive director.

``John basically got me started,'' said Justin Foronda, a registered
nurse who in 2017 decided he wanted to start a restaurant. ``I didn't
know anything about finance or running a business. But I'm passionate
about my neighborhood, and passionate about food. He was a master
connector. Any question you asked, the answer was always `Yes.'''

After Mr. Foronda opened \href{https://www.hifi-kitchen.com/}{HiFi
Kitchen} in February, he had at least one stream of steady customers:
Mr. Swing's weekly entrepreneurship class.

Mr. Swing got to enjoy the restaurant, and to see a protégé turn a dream
into a working business, before the pandemic surged in Los Angeles. He
contracted the novel coronavirus and died on June 28 in a hospital in
Fountain Valley, Calif. The immediate cause was pneumonia and an
ischemic stroke, according to a
\href{https://www.gofundme.com/f/john-eric039s-fight-with-covid}{statement}
from his family. He was 48.

An online memorial for Mr. Swing drew speakers including Los Angeles
Mayor Eric Garcetti and the filmmaker Ava DuVernay.

``We've lost a community builder, at a time when we need community
builders,'' said city \href{https://cd13.lacity.org/}{Councilmember
Mitch O'Farrell}. The Council adjourned for a day in honor of Mr. Swing.

``He was such a bright presence, full of optimism. I wouldn't even know
what his face would look like not smiling,'' Mr. O'Farrell said.

Mr. Swing was born in Los Angeles on May 2, 1972, the oldest of three
children of Filipino immigrants. His father, Ellis D. Swing, is a
political consultant and businessman; his mother, Aurora S. Swing, is a
retired clinical laboratory scientist.

He earned a bachelor's degree in ethnic studies from the University of
California, Riverside, in 1995, and spent six years in the Marine Corps
Reserves, serving as a personnel and administrative clerk, the family
said.

After a stint as a probation corrections officer in Riverside County, he
worked as an education and health consultant for programs in Costa Rica,
Vietnam and the Philippines. Returning to Los Angeles, he worked at
several Filipino-American cultural and business organizations before
joining SIPA.

Along with his parents, he is survived by his wife, Ellen
Rodriguez-Swing, children Zachary, Joshua, Chloe and Mackenzie,
stepchildren Sasha and Nicco, sister Karen Bromley and brother PJ Swing.

He died with plans unrealized, including a workshop to address
anti-Black stereotypes among Filipinos. He also took part in community
efforts, like a nearly \$500,000
\href{https://www.theeastsiderla.com/neighborhoods/historic_filipinotown/plans-unveiled-for-452-000-gateway-to-historic-filipinotown/article_096736f6-ad28-11ea-8a45-d34c6d8d6822.html\#:~:text=\%22Historic\%20Filipinotown\%20will\%20have\%20a,\%2C\%22\%20O'Farrell\%20said.\&text=Designed\%20by\%20Filipino\%20artist\%20Eliseo,Gabay\%3A\%20Our\%20Guiding\%20Star.\%E2\%80\%9D}{project},
led by Councilman Mitch O'Farrell, to build a gateway arch and columns
marking the entrance to Historic Filipinotown, which crosses the
neighborhoods of Echo Park and Silver Lake.

Next up was a plan to redevelop SIPA's headquarters to include 64 units
of affordable housing. Its small business center will bear Mr. Swing's
name.

``He always said he believed he worked in the culture of changing
lives,'' said \href{https://sipacares.org/about/board/}{Jessica del
Mundo}, executive secretary of the board at SIPA. ``That to him was what
the nonprofit world meant. It wasn't just about uplifting Filipinos.''
