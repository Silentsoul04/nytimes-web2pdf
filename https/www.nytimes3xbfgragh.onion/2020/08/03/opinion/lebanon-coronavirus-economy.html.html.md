The myth of their resilience helped the Lebanese function despite a

BEIRUT — Anyone who knows Lebanon has heard this: The Lebanese are
resilient. A reputation earned by weathering an outsize list of
challenges over the years: a 15-year civil war, political tensions with
Syria, wars with Israel and a collapsing public service infrastructure.

Economic collapse, exacerbated by a coronavirus lockdown in March, is
the latest disaster to befall the Lebanese people. Years of financial
maneuvering and debt mismanagement by the government, the banks and the
central bank led to a depletion of the country’s foreign currency
reserves, which caused depreciation of the Lebanese pound — long pegged
to the dollar — by [more than 80
percent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/07/09/lebanons-currency-crisis-paves-the-way-to-a-new-future/#5ae751526a17)
since October.

People have [lost their life savings
overnight](https://en.annahar.com/article/1187657-lebanons-banking-crisis-risks-wiping-life-savings-of-thousands),
and prices of food and basic goods **** have inflated [over 50 percent
for the third
month](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emerging-inflation-graphic/lebanon-follows-venezuela-into-hyperinflation-wilderness-idUSKCN24O20J)
in a row.

Lebanon’s economy is based on services; the country produces little and
imports a lot. The plummeting value of the Lebanese lira and the lack of
access to dollars means many stores can’t afford to remain open.
Salaries that haven’t been slashed outright have lost their spending
power. Tourism, once one of the pillars of the economy, has been
severely hit in recent months from the worsening political and economic
situation and the enforced pandemic lockdown.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nearly 1,000 restaurants have been forced to close, and 25,000 people
have [lost their
jobs](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/lebanons-restaurants-sinking-coronavirus-lockdown-200506095822226.html)
in the restaurant sector alone. Remittances, which once brought enough
dollars into the country to help offset the budget deficit, have been on
the wane for some years now because of lower oil prices in the Gulf,
where many Lebanese work. Data for 2020 is still not in, but remittances
are [set to dwindle
more](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-egypt-lebanon-jordan-remittance-economy)
as a lack of trust in the banks and travel restrictions mean money
cannot find its way into the country either through bank or in-person
transfers.

The cumulative effect of these factors is that much of the middle class
— about [3.25 million
people](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/21/lebanon-coronavirus-middle-class-poverty/),
or 65 percent of the country — has
[slipped](https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/82348) into poverty. The poor
are now destitute, near starvation. Once again, people must scramble to
find solutions for the government’s ills.

Facebook [barter
groups](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/12/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-economic-crisis.html)
have sprung up, with people seeking to exchange whatever they have, in
order to secure what they so desperately need: fancy dresses for baby
formula; a set of drinking glasses for a bag of rice. One man held up a
pharmacy for diapers. Another mugged someone at knife point only to
return, [sobbing and
apologizing](https://www.france24.com/en/20200715-hunger-crimes-on-the-rise-in-crisis-hit-lebanon)
that he is unable to feed his family, that he’s only doing this to
survive.

While the mass protests that erupted on Oct. 17, 2019 — against the
corruption of the ruling elite and the sectarian system they uphold —
succeeded in toppling the government, the new government appointed in
its place has done little to alleviate or address worsening living
conditions.

Misery is now palpable across the country, in the rows of shuttered
shops, in the garbage piling up in different neighborhoods as basic
services are disrupted, and in the [darkness of the nighttime
streets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/lebanons-rising-power-cuts-add-to-gloom-of-economic-crisis/2020/07/07/95498db4-c05f-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html)
of Beirut as electricity cuts soar to 20 hours a day.

It is hard to imagine that this is the same Beirut that has seen so many
[odes to the unparalleled revelry of its bar
scene](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/11748872/War-is-a-million-miles-away-when-the-Lebanese-begin-to-party.html)
— the favorite subject and haunt of many a Western journalist — written
in every major newspaper.

Those articles repeatedly peddled the same myth that we are so eager to
believe about ourselves: The Lebanese know how to dance while the
bullets fly, how to repurpose even [war bunkers into
nightclubs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/interior-designer-sarah-a-abdallah-brings-a-global-perspective-to-hotel-lobbies-and-restaurants/2018/02/09/8ef88344-f72a-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html),
how to find a way around every shortage, because the Lebanese are
resourceful and resilient. It is an idea that has served both as
consolation for difficult living conditions and a point of pride for how
efficiently we manage them.

But now it has become clear that there is nothing truly resilient about
Lebanon except its politicians and ancient warlords, who refuse to step
down, even after their profiteering has bankrupted the country and its
people. And while Lebanese banks have long been [deemed resilient by
economists](https://www.worldfinance.com/strategy/a-resilient-banking-sector-is-allowing-lebanons-economy-to-endure-regional-strife),
the current situation reveals that this designation belongs only to the
bankers themselves.

Even the International Monetary Fund, the so-called “lender of last
resort,” cannot bring the banks to agree on [the audit of financial
losses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-25/lebanon-tallies-up-its-debt-problem-give-or-take-a-few-billion)
required to unlock a loan. Two high-ranking officials have so far
resigned over the stalled negotiations. One of them, Alain Bifani, a
former director general of the Finance Ministry, revealed that bankers
smuggled close to [$6 billion
outside](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lebanons-ex-finance-chief-says-banks-smuggled-%246bln-out-report-2020-07-13)
the country while preventing small depositors from withdrawing so much
as $100.

Christine Tohme is the curator and founder of [Ashkal
Alwan](https://ashkalalwan.org/), an organization that supports local
art and cultural production. She started operating it out of her car in
1993, two years after the end of the civil war. Over the last 27 years,
despite a lack of state funding, the organization ran a prestigious art
study program that sees applicants from across the world. This year, the
program was forced to end early when funds meant for students were
seized by the banks. “We all worked so hard to make things better, and
look where we are now,” said Ms. Tohme. “I am so sad about not being
able to dream or see into a future. I am exhausted.”

That exhaustion is heavy in the voices and faces of everyone I
encounter. Perhaps resilience has always been the lie we have been fed
and that we continue to tell ourselves in order to keep functioning
under a state so corrupt it cannot provide a bare minimum of public or
social services.

A state that thinks so little of its people that it bickered over the
pittance of financial aid it promised to hungry families during the
pandemic until devaluation reduced the worth of the aid that each family
was getting from $180 to about $50. And then it was never distributed.

But the protests late last year were evidence that refusing to accept
resilience is also a refusal to accept the conditions that made it
necessary for us to rely on the idea in the first place. A refusal to
find private solutions to problems that should rightfully be solved by
the state. If things seem bleak now, at least there is this: We have
finally come to recognize that a myth is poor consolation for a
half-lived life, no matter how attractive that myth might be.
