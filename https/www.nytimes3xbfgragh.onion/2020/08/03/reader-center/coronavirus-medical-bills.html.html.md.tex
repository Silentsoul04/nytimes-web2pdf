As we explore how the pandemic is changing U.S. health care, you can
help by showing what you're being charged for testing and treatment.

Americans have been battling surprise coronavirus bills for nearly as
long as they've been fighting the disease itself.

I know this because I'm a reporter who has been writing articles about
those bills since mid-February. My
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/29/upshot/coronavirus-surprise-medical-bills.html}{first}
focused on an American man and his 3-year-old daughter who faced more
than \$3,900 in bills for care received during a government-mandated
quarantine.

Since then, my colleagues and I have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/upshot/coronavirus-test-cost-varies-widely.html}{written
about} \$2,315 coronavirus tests and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/14/nyregion/coronavirus-billing-nyc.html}{\$401,886
bills} for treatment. We've discovered that the price of a coronavirus
test
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/upshot/coronavirus-tests-unpredictable-prices.html}{can
vary by 2,700 percent within the same emergency room}.

We want to tell more of these stories --- and to do that, we need your
help. As we explore how the pandemic is reshaping health care in the
United States, we invite you to show us what you're being charged for
testing and treatment of Covid-19, and other medical costs that you have
incurred related to it.

We are examining how Americans are grappling with the costs of health
care during the Covid-19 pandemic.

I've run similar projects that have inspired
\href{https://www.vox.com/2019/4/24/18514240/california-surprise-er-bills-zuckerberg}{legislation}
and demystified American medical billing. Because health care providers
keep their prices secret, your bills play a critical role in helping us
understand how Americans are grappling with medical costs during the
pandemic.

We're also interested in hearing about how your access to care has
changed. For instance, has it become harder to get an in-person
appointment with your doctor? Or have you seen a provider who has
imposed additional fees because of the pandemic? We welcome submissions
from readers who haven't had Covid-19 but have seen changes to their
doctor's offices, hospitals or other providers.

If you're a health provider, how, if at all, have you changed things? We
want to hear from you, too. Please
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/reader-center/healthcare-workers-coronavirus-care.html}{share
your story here}.

In addition to drawing on your experiences to inform my stories, we hope
to connect with you later, possibly with email updates or online
gatherings, to talk about how the coronavirus is changing health care.

Your information will not be shared with anyone. A reporter or editor
may contact you to learn more. If you prefer to share anonymously, you
