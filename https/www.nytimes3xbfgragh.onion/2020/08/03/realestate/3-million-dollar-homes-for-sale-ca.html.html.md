## Coronado | $2.975 Million

### **A 1935 Spanish-style house with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, on a 0.2-acre lot**

Coronado, which sits on a peninsula in San Diego Bay, is known for its
historic homes and resorts like the Hotel del Coronado, about five
minutes by car from this property. The house, designed in the Spanish
Colonial Revival style, is listed on the city’s register of [Historic
Resources](https://www.coronado.ca.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_746006/File/government/departments/comm%20dev/Coronado%20Register%20tri-fold_May%202016.pdf)
and has a number of intact original features.

The Coronado Ferry Landing is a 15-minute walk, and downtown San Diego
is about a 15-minute drive over the Coronado Bridge. Also nearby is the
North Island Naval Air Station, one of the U.S. Navy’s largest aircraft
bases.

**Size:** 2,845 square feet

**Price per square foot:** $1,046

**Indoors:** The front door opens into a Spanish-tiled foyer and faces a
door to the courtyard that the house is built around.

To the right is the living room, which also has a tile floor. The
wood-beamed ceilings are original, as is the white-brick fireplace in
the far corner. Like virtually every room in the house, this space has
access to the courtyard.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Off the living room is a guest room with space for a queen-size bed and
an en suite bathroom with a new wooden vanity and a walk-in shower. The
doors leading to the closet and the bathroom are wood with decorative
iron hardware.

A short hallway connects the guest room to the master suite, where two
ceiling fans were recently added. The master bathroom has two porcelain
pedestal sinks and a spacious walk-in shower; a laundry room with a sink
is just off the bathroom.

To the left of the front door is the dining room, which also has vaulted
wood ceilings and a tile floor. Beyond is the kitchen, updated with
stone countertops and a stainless steel Wolf range. A small storage room
connects the kitchen to another guest room with its own bathroom.

**Outdoor space:** The courtyard at the center of the house is
landscaped with grass; the brick patio is trimmed with succulents. There
is a side yard that is also landscaped with grass, and a brick path
leads from there to the detached garage, which has space for two cars.

**Taxes:** $31,238 (estimated, but the home is eligible for reduced
property taxes based on the [Mills
Act](http://www.ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21412))

## Piedmont | $2.995 Million

### **A 1965 midcentury-modern house with four bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, on a 0.4-acre lot**

Known as the Spaulding House, this is the only home that Edward
Killingsworth, a well-known midcentury architect, designed outside of
Southern California. The original owners were fans of his work, and
convinced him to take on a commission in Northern California.

Nestled in the hills of Piedmont, the house is about 20 minutes from the
heart of Berkeley and a 10-minute drive from three large nature
preserves.

**Size:** 2,194 square feet

**Price per square foot:** $1,365

**Indoors:** A winding driveway leads from the street to the home’s
lower level, which has its own entrance. A set of stairs from the base
of the driveway leads to the main entrance, where high double doors open
to the center of the house.

To the right is a living room with floor-to-ceiling windows that flood
the space with natural light, an original marble fireplace and a wet bar
hidden by wood pocket doors. Sliding-glass doors open to a side
courtyard.

This space flows into the dining area, where three walls of windows
bring the landscaping indoors. The dining room connects to the kitchen,
also accessible from the foyer. The kitchen floors are parquet; the
cabinets were custom-designed by Mr. Killingsworth.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To the left of the entry is an office with a built-in Murphy bed and
access to a street-facing deck. Off this space is a half bathroom with
palm-frond-printed wallpaper.

Behind the office is a master bedroom with more floor-to-ceiling
windows, built-in cabinets and an en suite bathroom.

An open staircase at the center of the house leads to the lower level,
where a hallway connects two additional bedrooms and a bathroom with a
double vanity and a combination tub and shower.

**Outdoor space:** A wooden deck on the main level faces the street,
with space for a cafe table and chairs. The large lawn is relatively
flat, with plenty of space for outdoor play, plus a dedicated area for a
barbecue. A side patio off the living room has a decorative water
feature. The attached garage has space for two cars.

**Taxes:** $35,041 (estimated)

## Los Angeles | $2.999 Million

### **A 1953 house remodeled in 2012, with three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, on a 0.3-acre lot**

This house is in the Crestwood Hills section of Brentwood, the Los
Angeles neighborhood that is home to the Getty Center. For many years,
it was owned by Christopher Lawford, the son of Peter Lawford, a member
of the Rat Pack, and Patricia Kennedy, a sister of President John F.
Kennedy. Mr. Lawford also owned a home in Hawaii, and was inspired by
tropical landscapes during his extensive remodel of the property.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Crestwood Hills Park is about half a mile from this house, and hiking
trails in Sullivan and Mandeville Canyons are about 15 minutes away by
car. An entrance to the 405 freeway, which runs south to Los Angeles
International Airport and north to Studio City, is 10 minutes away.

**Size:** 1,850 square feet

**Price per square foot:** $1,621

**Indoors:** A gated driveway slopes down to the home’s entry courtyard,
where a water feature faces the front door.

Inside, a wood-paneled foyer opens to the main living area, oriented
around three sets of floor-to-ceiling glass doors that face the
backyard. Along one wall is a fireplace with a white marble surround.

Hardwood floors run into the open dining area, where glass doors face a
side patio. This space flows into the kitchen, which has a farmhouse
sink and stainless steel appliances, including a Wolf range. A door
leads from the kitchen to an outdoor cooking area with a built-in
barbecue and mini-fridge.

Off the living room is a room currently used as a study, with built-in
bookcases, midcentury-inspired wallpaper and doors opening to the
outdoor cooking patio. There is also a half bathroom accessible from the
foyer.

A hallway leads from the right side of the living room to two bedrooms:
A guest room with an en suite bathroom and a master suite with a
fireplace, built-in bookshelves and access to the deck and backyard; the
en suite bathroom, connected through a closet, has a soaking tub and a
double vanity topped with marble.

**Outdoor space:** The backyard is divided by a row of low hedges into
two sections, each with its own wood deck offering views of Century City
and the Pacific Ocean. On the living room side is a covered deck with
space for outdoor furniture; on the master bedroom side is an area
landscaped with artificial grass. Another patio, paved in concrete and
framed by tall bamboo plants, has a hot tub and a cold-plunge pool, plus
an outdoor sauna. The attached garage has space for two cars; there is
room for several more in the private driveway.

**Taxes:** $38,093 (estimated)
