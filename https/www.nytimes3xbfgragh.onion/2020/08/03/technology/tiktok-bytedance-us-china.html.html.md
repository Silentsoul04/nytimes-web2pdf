# How TikTok’s Owner Tried, and Failed, to Cross the U.S.-China Divide

The founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, dreamed of building a global
tech company based in China. Then the geopolitical reality set in.

The Chinese entrepreneur behind TikTok took ample precautions when he
set out to straddle the tech world’s most treacherous divide: the one
separating China’s tightly controlled internet from the rest of the
planet.

He made TikTok unavailable in China so the video app’s users wouldn’t be
subject to the Communist Party’s censorship requirements. He stored user
data in Virginia and Singapore. He hired [managers in the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/business/media/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer.html)
to run the app and [lobbyists in
Washington](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/technology/tiktok-washington-lobbyist.html)
to fight for it on Capitol Hill.

None of that counted for much in the end. With TikTok now negotiating [a
sale to
Microsoft](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html)
under intense pressure from President Trump, who said on Monday that he
was [giving the
go-ahead](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
to such a deal, the digital wall between China and the United States is
proving to be higher than ever at this moment of widening conflict
between the two countries.

Only this time, it is the U.S. government, not China’s, that is putting
up the barricades — an escalation that could foretell an even more
restrictive time for companies in both nations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

ByteDance, the eight-year-old Chinese social media giant behind TikTok,
is China’s first truly global internet success story. The company’s
founder, Zhang Yiming, 37, began pushing to expand overseas early on,
believing that only a company with worldwide reach could remain on the
technological edge.

But TikTok ended up resonating with American teenagers when even a
platform for short viral videos is subject to political scrutiny. Under
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, the Communist Party has emphasized [its
ultimate
authority](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/18/world/asia/xi-jinping-speech-china.html)
over Chinese people and businesses. Suspicion never dissipated that
TikTok — no matter how many non-Chinese executives it put in charge —
might be unable to withstand pressure from Beijing to surrender user
data or manipulate content.

Similar doubts already hang over many other Chinese tech companies.
TikTok’s sudden change of fortune could force them to re-evaluate their
own international ambitions.

Chibo Tang, a partner in Hong Kong at the venture capital firm Gobi
Partners, said that, increasingly, his advice to Chinese tech companies
was to steer clear of the United States when expanding overseas — to
follow instead the Chinese government’s diplomatic overtures and
investments in places such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East and
Africa.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If you want to go out and tackle more difficult markets, sure, but
obviously there’s consequences and additional costs,” Mr. Tang said.
“Going forward, Chinese entrepreneurs in these tech companies should
be aware of that.”

One unnamed entrepreneur put ByteDance’s position in even starker terms
to [the Chinese tech blog
Huxiu](https://m.huxiu.com/article/373071.html) on Monday: “Once the
U.S. business is lost, half of the space for thinking about
globalization has vanished.”

As uncertainty swirled on Sunday about whether Mr. Trump would allow
Microsoft to continue negotiations with TikTok, ByteDance issued [a
late-night statement in
China](https://www.toutiao.com/a1673929179426827) reiterating its
commitment to going global.

“In the process, we are facing all kinds of complex and unimaginable
difficulties,” the company said. The statement cited the tense
geopolitical environment, culture clashes and, in an unusually direct
jab at a competitor, “Facebook’s plagiarism and smears.”

Facebook is rolling out a TikTok-like feature called Reels on Instagram,
which it owns. The company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has also
argued that [undermining American tech companies with excess
regulation](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20200729/110883/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-ZuckerbergM-20200729.pdf)
could allow Chinese rivals to export their own, very different values to
the world. Facebook declined to comment on ByteDance’s
statement.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Mr. Zhang of ByteDance, TikTok’s run-in with the Trump
administration has been an education in government relations, though
hardly his first.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Zhang falls on the geekier side of the tech founder spectrum. He
repaired computers in college, and from past interviews, he appears most
at home talking about algorithms and the flow of information. He is not
a Communist Party member, [he told the Atlantic
magazine](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/07/tiktok-ban-china-america/614725/)
recently.

For many years, he echoed Mr. Zuckerberg in saying he ran a tech
company, not a media outlet, which meant he should not be imposing his
own judgments over content.

“I can’t accurately decide whether something is good or bad, highbrow or
lowbrow,” he [told the Chinese business magazine
Caijing](https://36kr.com/p/1721289883649) in 2016.

Mr. Zhang may have thought he was insulating himself in China. But the
perils of that technology-driven approach were made clear in 2018 when
the Chinese authorities shut down one of ByteDance’s oldest products,
a[humor app called Neihan
Duanzi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/11/technology/china-toutiao-bytedance-censor.html),
for spreading vulgar material.

“For a long time, we put too much emphasis on the role of technology and
didn’t realize that technology must be guided by core socialist values,”
Mr. Zhang wrote in a [public letter of
apology](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4r6rCwNE7BgTLD37cPJOoA).

ByteDance’s popular news aggregator app, Toutiao, had also been under
fire for saucy content. In response, Toutiao began featuring [more
stories about Mr.
Xi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/02/business/china-toutiao-censorship.html)
at the top of its feed.

By then, ByteDance had already begun expanding in Japan, India,
Southeast Asia and beyond. TikTok was released in 2017 as the
international edition of Douyin, one of ByteDance’s Chinese video apps.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TikTok had some early scrapes with foreign governments. In 2018,
[Indonesia temporarily blocked
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html)
for hosting inappropriate content. Despite the challenges, Mr. Zhang
said [at an event in Beijing that
year](https://www.techbuzzchina.com/bytedance/bytedance-ceo-zhang-yiming-at-tsinghua-university-part-3)
that going global was the only way to get access to the talent and
resources needed for long-term success.

He said he had studied another Chinese company’s rapid growth overseas
to see how it could be done.

Which company? Huawei.

His choice was prescient in hindsight, though perhaps not in the way he
intended. The Trump administration has for years sought
to<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>undermine the giant Chinese
maker of telecommunications equipment and smartphones. It, too, has been
called a national security threat by White House officials, who fear the
Chinese government could use Huawei gear for
espionage.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

International growth was top of mind when Mr. Zhang began courting
Musical.ly, a Chinese-made lip-syncing app that had found success in the
United States and Europe. In late 2017, [ByteDance agreed to buy
Musical.ly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/10/business/dealbook/musically-sold-app-video.html)
for around $1 billion. ByteDance would later merge the app into TikTok,
giving it a toehold in the West that would eventually propel it to wider
success.

According to people with knowledge of the matter, the two parties did
not approach the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States,
or CFIUS, to seek its blessing beforehand — a decision that would later
come back to haunt ByteDance.

CFIUS (pronounced SIFF-ee-yuss) typically evaluates foreign deals
involving an American business for possible national security risks. But
it also claims jurisdiction over deals between foreign businesses that
have significant American operations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As TikTok became a smash hit in the United States, concerns arose about
whether the app was [censoring
content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing)
that might offend Beijing. Late last year, The New York Times and others
reported that CFIUS was [looking into the Musical.ly
deal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/technology/tiktok-national-security-review.html).
Washington politicians also began voicing fears that TikTok could be a
conduit for China to [meddle in American
elections](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/467280-schumer-cotton-request-tiktok-security-assessment).

With pressure building, some of Mr. Zhang’s investors and advisers
offered ideas for putting distance between TikTok and ByteDance,
including reorganizing TikTok’s corporate or legal structure.

In an [interview in
November](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/18/technology/tiktok-alex-zhu-interview.html),
Alex Zhu, a founder of Musical.ly who was then the head of TikTok, said
the company wouldn’t rule out such changes.

“We continuously look at the company structure and optimize the
structure,” Mr. Zhu said.

But instead of a major restructuring, Mr. Zhang opted for personnel
changes. This spring, he [reshuffled ByteDance executives in
China](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OWrC9iXHxgUZtaLm8GN4ow) and said he
would personally devote more time and energy to Europe, the United
States and other markets. In May, Liu Zhen, a former Uber executive in
China who had been overseeing ByteDance’s global expansion, left the
company. Mr. Zhu was replaced as TikTok’s head by Kevin Mayer, [a
veteran Disney
executive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/business/media/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer.html)
in the United States.

ByteDance also embarked upon a [lobbying push in
Washington](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/technology/tiktok-washington-lobbyist.html)
to sell the idea that TikTok’s allegiances were with the United States,
not China. In meetings with lawmakers, lobbyists emphasized the app’s
light, uplifting fare and the fact that many of its top leaders were
American residents.

Last month, when American technology companies including Facebook and
Google began [reassessing their operations in Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/business/hong-kong-security-law-tech.html)
in the wake of a new security law that gave the Chinese government
greater powers in the territory, TikTok went further, announcing that it
would stop operating in Hong Kong completely.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The move let TikTok demonstrate its willingness to stand up to Beijing,
as its head of U.S. public policy later emphasized in an email
newsletter to Capitol Hill. But Hong Kong had not been a major market
for the app, making the decision look more like a publicity stunt than a
self-sacrifice made on principled
grounds.

The Trump administration’s scrutiny continued unabated. After [Mr. Trump
failed to draw huge
crowds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html)
at a June re-election rally in Tulsa, Okla., TikTok users claimed to
have pulled off a prank by registering for tickets and then not
attending the event. In early July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
floated the idea of [banning the
app](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/us-looking-at-banning-tiktok-and-chinese-social-media-apps-pompeo.html)
over security concerns.

Within weeks, [Microsoft
said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html)
it had received Mr. Trump’s go-ahead for pursuing a deal to buy TikTok’s
U.S. operations. [CFIUS had
decided](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/technology/tiktok-microsoft.html)
to order ByteDance to divest.

on Monday, Mr. Zhang made the recent turmoil sound more like a technical
matter than an existential threat brought about by hostile geopolitical
forces.

He wrote that the company had repeatedly emphasized that it was willing
to make technical changes to address U.S. concerns, yet the order to
sell was made anyway. “We do not agree with this decision, because we
have always insisted on guaranteeing users’ data security, the
platform’s neutrality and transparency.”
