# With TikTok, ‘Uncool’ Microsoft Aims for the Love of Tweens

Buying one of the largest and most influential social networks in the

SEATTLE — Maybe money can buy love. Or, at least,
[Microsoft](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/navy-seal-museum-kaepernick.html)
would like to find out.

On Sunday, the tech giant [announced in a blog
post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/)
that it would continue holding talks to buy TikTok in the United States,
opening up the possibility of using its financial might to buy the
fickle infatuation of tweens.

Microsoft made the announcement after its chief executive, Satya
Nadella, talked with President Trump, who had threatened to ban the
hugely popular social media company, which is owned by China’s
ByteDance, because of national security fears. On Monday, [Mr. Trump
said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
that TikTok would shut down in the United States on Sept. 15 unless
Microsoft or another company bought it.

A deal for TikTok — whose app featuring video clips has become wildly
popular among young smartphone users — could give Microsoft, a company
best known for databases and operating systems, control of one of the
largest and most influential social networks in the country.

“Microsoft is viewed as your grandpa’s company, and it is trying to
change that,” said Dan Ives, a managing director and an analyst at
Wedbush Securities. “Microsoft goes from an uncool company to many under
25 to potentially as hip as TikTok if they get this done.”

Microsoft declined to comment beyond its blog post.

Under Mr. Nadella, who became chief executive in early 2014, Microsoft
has turned the company into a giant of cloud computing. It has a market
value above $1.5 trillion and more than $130 billion in cash.

But Microsoft has not had a clear path to serving young consumers beyond
its video gaming business. The company is behind the Xbox video game
console and owns Minecraft, the hugely popular building game. As social
media grew into enormous consumer businesses — Facebook alone is worth
more than $720 billion — Microsoft largely missed out.

Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft’s biggest acquisitions have been of online
communities, those whose networks hooked users but also required a
complex cloud-computing infrastructure that Microsoft could provide.

In 2014, it bought the Swedish company that created Minecraft for $2.5
billion, and in 2016, it acquired LinkedIn, the professional social
network, for $26.2 billion. In 2018, Microsoft bought GitHub, an online
network for software developers, for $7.5 billion.

If history is a guide, teens and tweens may not need to worry that
Microsoft will mess up the product they love. With those recent
acquisitions, Microsoft increased the financial and tech resources at
the companies but largely let them run independently.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When Christopher Wanstrath, co-founder of GitHub, discussed the deal in
a call with investors after it was announced, he said the way Microsoft
handled Minecraft and LinkedIn showed him “how serious they are about
growing new businesses while maintaining their independence and
identity.”

Analysts say that patient approach has been successful. Until the
coronavirus pandemic, LinkedIn had been growing faster under Microsoft’s
ownership than before it was acquired.

TikTok, with its fun artificial intelligence tools and more than 100
million users in the United States, would most likely fit that pattern.
To be successful, its owner would need to run the technology and sustain
its online community. The deal being discussed involves purchasing
TikTok offices in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, would continue to own the
social media app’s offices in Beijing.

Microsoft also offers something other giant tech rivals cannot: peace in
Washington. Amazon, Facebook and Google have to tread carefully amid
antitrust scrutiny, making a blockbuster deal with obvious political
baggage unappealing. Other than its gaming business, Microsoft is mainly
in business markets.

And it has strategically navigated Mr. Trump’s Washington. While the
company has criticized some of the president’s policies, such as
immigration restrictions, it won a high-profile, [$10 billion
contract](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/25/technology/dod-jedi-contract.html)
to provide cloud computing to the Pentagon, which many analysts had
expected Amazon to get. Amazon is contesting the award, saying it was
politically motivated.

Microsoft has [gingerly tried to court China for more than a
decade](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/23/business/china-microsoft-bing.html),
with only modest success. Its search engine, Bing, was one of the last
remaining portals to the global internet, in part because the service
directed users in China to state media accounts on disputed topics like
the Dalai Lama. Even so, Bing [was taken
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/24/technology/microsoft-bing-china.html)
briefly last year. While Microsoft Windows and Office are common in
China, they are largely pirated copies; the country accounts for [less
than 2
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/technology/microsoft-coronavirus-earnings.html)
of Microsoft’s revenue.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Nadella’s conversation with Mr. Trump appeared to assuage the
president’s worries about TikTok’s security, at least temporarily. The
concern of the American government is that the app potentially gives the
Chinese government access to American user data. Microsoft’s statement
said it would “ensure that all private data of TikTok’s American users
is transferred to and remains in the United States.”

On Sunday evening, the news of continuing talks quickly garnered praise
from Republican lawmakers.

Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who [spoke with Microsoft
officials a few
times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html)
about the deal,
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1290083628261584896)
that the talks between TikTok and Microsoft were “a win-win in the
making.” And Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House
minority leader,
[said](https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1290037004797804544) it
“would protect Americans’ data, increase competition and secure a
creative platform for millions of users.”

Microsoft, said Mr. Ives, the analyst, “realized there is a window in
the clouds that just opened up, and they have to fly right through.”

Steve Lohr contributed reporting from New York.
