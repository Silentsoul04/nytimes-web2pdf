*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up

receive it weekdays.*

What’s happening with TikTok is one of the strangest things I’ve seen.

Let me catch you up. One of the world’s hottest apps has become a
[political hot
potato](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/technology/tiktok-data-privacy.html)
because it’s owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance at a time
when relations between the United States and China are [at a low
point](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-cold-war.html).

U.S. government officials say they are worried that the Chinese
government might force TikTok to hand over information it collects about
Americans and use the app to spread a Chinese-friendly view of the
world.

TikTok has [tried and failed to calm those
fears](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-trump-sale-microsoft.html).

That brings us to this weekend’s strange scene: The chief executive of
Microsoft negotiated directly with the president of the United States
[over the purchase of an
app](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/technology/tiktok-trump-microsoft-bytedance-china-ban.html)
from China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Here are some thoughts about what’s going on:

**U.S. officials are getting the outcome they want. Probably.** My New
York Times colleagues wrote that there are people inside the White House
who [want TikTok
banned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-national-security.html)
rather than sold to an American company. President Trump said as much
himself on Friday. It seemed that a phone call between him and Satya
Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, put a TikTok takeover by Microsoft
back on the front burner.

Microsoft
[said](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/)
on Sunday that it’s negotiating to buy the TikTok app, but only in the
United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

While some Trump officials might have preferred to have the app banned
outright, having it owned by a U.S. company would still be a win.

**Huh? Microsoft?** Microsoft is both an odd and perfect fit. A new
owner of TikTok needs to be palatable to the Trump administration, and
Microsoft has mostly stayed in the government’s good graces. A buyer
also needs to be rich enough to purchase TikTok but not so powerful —
ahem, Facebook or Google — that buying the app might tip it into
monopoly territory.

And Microsoft has the technical expertise to untangle TikTok from
ByteDance and make sure that information about Americans stays in U.S.
computer systems.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**This is not a done deal.** Microsoft has about six weeks to haggle
over price with ByteDance, figure out how to safeguard the information
of TikTok users, and keep U.S. government officials on board.

Some people who make a living on TikTok are [freaking
out](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/style/tiktok-ban-threat-trump.html)
about the app’s fate, my colleague Taylor Lorenz reported. There is a
cloud of uncertainty about all of this.

The Times’s Karen Weise
[wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-microsoft-tweens.html)
that Microsoft has a recent record of buying businesses and not
interfering in them too much — maybe a sliver of good news for TikTok
fans worried about the app becoming boring.

**Is every Chinese technology a no-go zone?** I wonder what will happen
to other Chinese technology companies in the United States. Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo hinted in a [weekend
interview](https://www.state.gov/secretary-michael-r-pompeo-with-maria-bartiromo-of-fox-news-sunday-morning-futures-2/)
that the administration was looking at other Chinese software companies
that he said fed data to China’s government.

He didn’t mention other kinds of technology from Chinese companies that
already operate in the United States — Lenovo, for example, is one of
the country’s biggest sellers of laptops, and it owns the mobile phone
maker Motorola. U.S. officials have [expressed concerns
previousl](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/politics/dji-drones-security-vulnerability.html)y
about DJI, which makes the popular Mavic drones.

If tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate,
all technology companies based in China — maybe Chinese companies in any
industry, really — may find it difficult to operate in the United
States.

### Tip of the Week

## How to request a record of your data from the Big Four

[*Brian X. Chen*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/brian-x-chen)*,
our personal tech columnist, tells us how you can obtain a record of
your data from the tech giants.*

Last week’s [antitrust
hearing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html)
made it clear that Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon touch every aspect
of our digital lives, including our messaging apps, virtual assistants
and hardware. That may make you curious what data each of those
companies has collected about you.

Here’s how you can find out. These instructions are to be followed from
a laptop or desktop computer, not a mobile app:

**Facebook:**

  - On facebookcorewwwi.onion, click the arrow pointing downward in the
    top-right corner.

<!-- end list -->

  - Click Settings & Privacy \> Settings. In the left column, click Your
    Facebook Information.

<!-- end list -->

  - Here, follow the steps to request a copy of your Facebook data.

**Google:**

  - Visit Google Takeout at takeout.google.com

<!-- end list -->

  - Here, select the categories for the data you would like to download.

**Apple:**

  - Visit privacy.apple.com and log in with your Apple ID credentials.

<!-- end list -->

  - Click Request a Copy of Your Data, to access the data portal.

**Amazon:**

  - Visit the [Request My Data
    portal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/privacycentral/dsar/preview.html).
    You’ll need to log into your Amazon account.

<!-- end list -->

  - From the drop-down menu, click Request All Your Data, and submit the
    request.

In 2018, I downloaded copies of my information from each of the Big
Four, and I was most disturbed by the [incredible amount of
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/11/technology/personaltech/i-downloaded-the-information-that-facebook-has-on-me-yikes.html)
that Facebook was hoarding about me, including information on my friends
and exes. The Facebook data also revealed that hundreds of advertisers,
many that I had never heard of, had my contact information.

You can guess what I did next: I deleted my Facebook account. I haven’t
regretted it.

## Before we go …

  - **The path of Twitter’s alleged teenage hacker:** My New York Times
    colleagues
    [traced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/technology/florida-teenager-twitter-hack.html)
    the life of Graham Ivan Clark, the 17-year-old charged with
    orchestrating a hack of Twitter last month that resulted in the
    takeover of accounts of some of the world’s most famous people. My
    colleagues write that Clark loved the Minecraft video game as a kid,
    becoming known as a scammer who cheated people out of their money.

  - **Living online without getting swept into perpetual surveillance:**
    One lesson from my colleague Kashmir Hill is that a lifetime of our
    online photos are fodder for searchable databases that can be used
    to identify us by our faces. Now Kash writes about a team of
    computer engineers who say they [found a way to disguise digital
    photos](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/fawkes-tool-protects-photos-from-facial-recognition.html)
    enough to confuse facial recognition systems. One problem: It might
    not work.

  - **Nostalgia for those ridiculous cellphone ringtones:** People of a
    certain age might remember how important it was to find just the
    right tune to signal that your boyfriend was calling your flip
    phone. The tech publication OneZero
    [explains](https://onezero.medium.com/how-the-custom-ringtone-industry-paved-the-way-for-the-app-store-and-then-vanished-11f0d2a1e53b)
    how the 2000s ringtone industry made today’s smartphone app stores
    and music streaming services possible.
