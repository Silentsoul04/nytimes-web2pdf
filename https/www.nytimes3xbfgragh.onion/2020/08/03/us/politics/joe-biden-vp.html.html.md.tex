He would be wise to remember that Barack Obama didn't pick him simply
because they were ``simpatico.''

When it comes to the vice presidency, Joe Biden has a perfect candidate
in mind: himself.

Well, if he were \emph{Josephine} Biden, of course.

In comments about his search for a running mate, Mr. Biden has made
clear he wants someone with the characteristics that he believes made
him the perfect pick for Barack Obama in 2008 --- someone who is loyal,
is ready to govern ``on Day 1'' and is, as Mr. Biden has said,
``simpatico with me, both in terms of personality as well as
substance.''

Of course, self-perception isn't always accurate. Sure, Mr. Obama wanted
someone he could work alongside. And, as his strategist David Axelrod
later recounted,
\href{https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2015/02/10/biden-vice-president-bayh-axelrod/81211852/}{early
chemistry} between the two men helped finalize the selection of Mr.
Biden.

But at the start, the Obama-Biden relationship was hardly the bromance
immortalized in the Democratic memes that followed. People close to Mr.
Obama's 2008 campaign have said they had real concerns about Mr. Biden,
most centrally about his ability to stay on message and his propensity
for political gaffes.

\href{https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/08/13/mccain-obama-race-enters-dead-heat/}{As
the race against John McCain tightened} that August, the thinking of
those in Mr. Obama's orbit was that they needed a white man on the
ticket, preferably an
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/16/us/politics/biden-obama-history.html}{older
guy}'' who could reassure voters worried about taking a chance on a
young, barrier-breaking senator.

People involved in the process, The New York Times
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/08/24/us/politics/24deconstruct.html?_r=1\&hp=\&adxnnl=1\&oref=slogin\&adxnnlx=1219585399-mopoNQ9Taivokt1V0PHsig}{reported
in the immediate aftermath of the announcement}, attributed Mr. Obama's
decision to Mr. Biden's appeal among white working-class voters and his
compelling personal story. Another plus: At Mr. Biden's age, then a spry
65 years old, Obama advisers didn't expect him to run for the presidency
(LOL).

``You are the pick of my heart, but Joe is the pick of my head,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/16/us/politics/biden-obama-history.html}{Mr.
Obama told Tim Kaine}, then the governor of Virginia, after he made his
choice.

So Mr. Biden's idealized version of his own vice-presidential process
clearly involves a bit of revisionist history.

He has already made at least one politically strategic choice by
limiting the candidates to women. Limiting the prospects by gender
eliminates a lot of Mr. Biden's most loyal and presumably ``simpatico''
allies --- a group that largely comprises white men. As
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-under-pressure-to-shatter-cement-ceiling-by-naming-a-black-woman-to-be-his-running-mate/2020/07/19/7dfb9dcc-c06f-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html}{one
racial justice activist politely put it}: ``Even his set of
relationships, I'm quite sure, are geared toward his world.''

Picking a woman isn't about personal loyalty; it's about energizing
female voters and recognizing the momentum that women --- particularly
Black women --- have given the Democratic Party during the Trump era.

Given his age, Mr. Biden also needs to reassure voters that there's
someone who can take over if he can no longer serve as president --- a
reason there aren't many older women on the list.

I suppose this is a really long way of guiding you, dear readers,
through the blizzard of vice-presidential speculation blanketing the
political conversation.

Mr. Biden said he would announce his pick in early August, so the
forecast this week is for more hot takes, rumors and backbiting. Because
the field is all women, there will probably be a touch of sexism in the
mix as well, as we've already seen in
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/kamala-harris-biden-vp-381829}{reports}
detailing largely anonymous concerns from donors
\href{https://twitter.com/feliciasonmez/status/1288587415813345282}{who
say Kamala Harris} is ``too ambitious'' for the job. (I've never met an
unambitious politician, but perhaps that's a subject for a whole other
column.)

Don't get too caught up in the leaks and the counterleaks, the ``close
Biden allies'' and the chattering donors. Sure, picking a running mate
is complicated. Sure, personal relationships and trust matter. But you
know who doesn't care about chemistry? Losing presidential candidates.

In the end, there's one strategic imperative that outweighs all of the
others.

Winning.

We asked for your thoughts on the vice-presidential pick. Here's some of
what you had to say:

\begin{quote}
It should be Kamala Harris for several reasons: 1) She will have Mike
Pence crying out for Mommy before the end of the V.P. debate. 2) When
attacked by the Republicans for her gaffes as California's attorney
general, she'll shame them as white nationalists trying to destroy
another Black woman. 3) She has a winning smile. Think Reagan. Think W.
Think Clinton. Think Obama. 4) Who else has an anagram of her name close
to ``I Alarm Shark''?
\end{quote}

--- Tom Woodward

\begin{quote}
The first --- and most important --- question the nominee has to ask of
her/himself is: ``Who would be the best president?'' Susan Rice passes
that test with all her experience, understanding, temperament and grace.
And she'll adapt easily to campaign mode.
\end{quote}

--- Tim Hulbert

\begin{quote}
Tammy Duckworth would be a strong vice-presidential candidate for the
following reasons: She has campaign experience. She has congressional
experience. She represents a seemingly forgotten constituency: the men
and women actually fighting a war that can't be won and apparently will
never end. She juggles daily the responsibilities of motherhood with
those of her political career.
\end{quote}

--- Elisabeth Martensen

And there were at least a few names not on Mr. Biden's list \ldots{}

\begin{quote}
I suggest Condoleezza Rice. As a former secretary of state, she has a
strong background in world affairs, speaks Russian and could help repair
the damage done by Trump around the world. Although she has not run for
office, I think she would be an articulate speaker and candidate. Since
she has served a Republican president, I think she would be appealing to
the many Republicans like me who will be voting for Joe Biden.
\end{quote}

--- Irene McAllister

\begin{quote}
Michelle Obama. She has more experience and ability than all of them,
including Biden.
\end{quote}
