WASHINGTON --- A Trump administration appointee whose anti-L.G.B.T.Q.
comments had spurred calls for her removal has left the United States
Agency for International Development, an agency spokeswoman said on
Monday.

The appointee, Merritt Corrigan, had drawn scrutiny shortly after
becoming the agency's deputy White House liaison this year because of
her
\href{https://www.propublica.org/article/new-trump-appointee-to-foreign-aid-agency-has-denounced-liberal-democracy-and-our-homo-empire}{previous
statements} that America is in the grip of a ``homo-empire'' pushing a
``tyrannical LGBT agenda.'' She had also
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/politics/merritt-corrigan-usaid/index.html}{argued}
that ``America has no moral imperative to accept immigrants'' and
\href{https://conservativewoman.co.uk/home-where-women-will-find-true-liberation/}{called
for} women to take up traditional roles of wife, mother and homemaker.

Ms. Corrigan
\href{https://twitter.com/MerrittCorrigan/status/1290310476673347584?s=20}{said
on Twitter} on Monday that she had been targeted by Democrats on Capitol
Hill and the news media because of her Christian faith.

``For too long, I've remained silent as the media has attacked me for my
Christian beliefs, which are shared by the majority of Americans,'' she
said, adding that ``gay marriage isn't marriage'' and ``men aren't
women.''

Sixty-seven percent of Americans support same-sex marriage, according to
a
\href{https://news.gallup.com/poll/311672/support-sex-marriage-matches-record-high.aspx}{Gallup
poll} conducted in May.

In July, 20 House Democrats, led by Representative Eliot L. Engel of New
York,
\href{https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/1/51d34be5-55fb-46bc-b652-fa2e0f86209b/FBA263E0FD66495029120654978C46CE.7-22-2020-ele-letter-to-barsa-on-corrigan.pdf}{wrote
a letter} to the aid agency's acting administrator, John Barsa, asking
for Ms. Corrigan's removal.

``Her record of public remarks, including disparaging L.G.B.T.Q. people
and those who express support for them, women in positions of leadership
and immigrants, is appalling, and has no place in a federal agency,''
the lawmakers wrote. ``The statements made by Ms. Corrigan create a
hostile work environment and are antithetical to the principles the
agency, and indeed America, espouses.''

U.S.A.I.D. provides economic and humanitarian aid to developing
countries around the world, investing in projects such as ones that help
local entrepreneurs or mitigate the spread of disease.

Ms. Corrigan, who said that Mr. Engel and other Democratic lawmakers had
``engaged in a corrupt campaign'' to oust her, said she would divulge
full details of her removal on Thursday and ``discuss the rampant
anti-Christian sentiment at USAID.'' She could not immediately be
reached for comment.

Pooja Jhunjhunwala, a U.S.A.I.D. spokeswoman, said that Ms. Corrigan was
no longer an employee of the agency as of 3 p.m. Monday and that her
claims of discrimination would be investigated.

``U.S.A.I.D. takes any claim of discrimination seriously, and we will
investigate any complaints of anti-Christian bias Ms. Corrigan has
raised during her tenure at the agency,'' she said.

Mr. Engel said in a statement that Mr. Barsa ``called to inform me of
Ms. Corrigan's departure and express his mortification at her comments
and wild accusations against myself and other members of Congress.''

Ms. Corrigan's exit,
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/usaid-appointee-unloads-as-rocky-tenure-ends-390972}{first
reported by Politico}, comes amid intense scrutiny over the agency's
hiring or promoting of a string of political appointees with histories
of anti-L.G.B.T.Q., misogynistic and anti-Islamic statements.

The agency's new deputy chief of staff, Bethany Kozma, has
\href{https://www.dailysignal.com/2016/07/10/im-a-mom-heres-what-im-doing-to-fight-obamas-transgender-agenda/}{spoken
out} against what she called President Barack Obama's ``transgender
agenda.'' She also praised the Trump administration's decision to
rescind Obama-era guidance that transgender students should be allowed
to use their preferred names, pronouns and bathrooms in public schools.

Mark Kevin Lloyd, the agency's new religious freedom adviser, has made
anti-Muslim statements on social media,
\href{https://apnews.com/d98c99e8626549d984d3695ac6ef589f/Racism-and-talk-of-religious-war:-Trump-staff\%E2\%80\%99s-online-posts}{calling
Islam} a ``barbaric cult.''

Peter Marocco, a former Defense Department staff member with a
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/08/usaid-chief-conflict-marocco-352010}{history
of workplace misconduct allegations}, was tapped to lead the agency's
conflict bureau.

In recent weeks, Tera Dahl, a former Breitbart News writer who has made
statements against Islam, joined the agency as a senior adviser, along
with
\href{https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/14/trump-anti-abortion-foreign-aid-development-white-house-installs-loyalist-usaid/}{Patrina
Mosley}, an anti-abortion activist who accused the United Nations of
using the coronavirus pandemic to promote abortions.

Mr. Barsa has
\href{https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/jun-8-2020-statement-acting-administrator}{defended
the hiring} of Ms. Corrigan, Ms. Kozma and Mr. Lloyd. ``Political
appointees are appointed at the discretion of the White House to carry
out the president's foreign policy agenda at U.S.A.I.D.,'' he said in a
news release in June, calling the backlash against the three
``unwarranted and malicious.''

Current and former U.S.A.I.D. staff members have noted their fear that
incoming appointees will steer agency programming in a more contentious
direction, potentially directing funding toward projects that benefit
certain faiths. Officials in Vice President Mike Pence's office
\href{https://www.propublica.org/article/how-mike-pences-office-meddled-in-foreign-aid-to-reroute-money-to-favored-christian-groups}{pressured
the agency's staff} in 2018 to reroute Middle East program funding to
religious minorities, in particular Christian organizations.

Mr. Barsa has also drawn criticism. Lawmakers accused him of ``pursuing
a political agenda'' after he wrote a letter to the United Nations
asking that abortion services no longer be considered an essential
service in the organization's fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
