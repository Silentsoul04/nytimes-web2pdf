The president sidestepped Congress when it became clear that his nominee
for a top Defense Department position would not win Senate approval.

WASHINGTON --- In making an end run around Congress to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/anthony-tata-pentagon-nomination.html}{appoint
Anthony J. Tata}, a retired brigadier general with a history of
Islamophobic and other inflammatory views, to a top Defense Department
post, President Trump has once again put the military exactly where it
does not want to be: in the middle of a political battle that could hurt
bipartisan support for the Pentagon.

Mr. Tata, who had been nominated to the No. 3 job at the Pentagon,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-inhofe-tata-pentagon.html}{was
unlikely to win Senate approval} because of past incendiary comments,
according to congressional staff members from both sides of the aisle.
At a time when vulnerable Republican senators are grappling with how to
deal with the movement to end systemic racism that has rolled across the
country, Mr. Tata's nomination to the top policy post was widely seen as
a step too far. Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma,
canceled Mr. Tata's confirmation hearing last Thursday just 30 minutes
before it was set to begin.

But on Sunday, the White House sidestepped Congress. Mr. Trump had
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper appoint Mr. Tata to a temporary senior
position in the same Defense Department office. Arcane rules say that if
he stays in that office for 90 days, Mr. Tata can then take the original
job in an acting capacity --- without Senate approval. (Mr. Tata had
withdrawn his name from consideration for that job on Sunday, and Mr.
Trump formally withdrew the nomination on Monday.)

On Monday at the Pentagon, where military officials have already been
engaged in a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/politics/pentagon-trump-confederate-symbols.html}{tug
of war with Mr. Trump} over the president's insistence that the military
continue to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/us/politics/congress-trump-confederate-base-names.html}{honor
former Confederate leaders}, the Tata maneuver was greeted with both
resignation and consternation.

``This is only going to exacerbate civil-military tensions and is an
added insult to the policy team in the Pentagon, which has already been
hollowed out,'' said Derek Chollet, a former assistant secretary of
defense in the Obama administration. ``And the idea of having a voice
like his at the highest levels of the Pentagon during a moment of such
tension and turmoil, both of which will only get worse in the coming
months, is very alarming.''

Mr. Tata endeared himself to the president using a tried-and-true
method: praising Mr. Trump on Fox News and bashing his political
opponents. Mr. Tata promoted conspiracy theories that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/27/magazine/john-brennan-president-trump-national-security-state.html}{John
O. Brennan}, the C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama, wanted to
oust Mr. Trump from office, even through assassination if necessary.

Mr. Tata also said Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama, the first lady, engaged
in ``borderline treasonous'' behavior by expressing their dismay over a
Trump presidency during the transition period.

Mr. Tata's views, expressed in
\href{https://twitter.com/ajtata/status/1014278134185840640}{a series of
tweets}, struck a jarring note. He called Islam ``the most oppressive
violent religion'' and referred to Mr. Obama as a ``terrorist leader.''
He has since apologized for the remarks, which were
\href{https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/12/politics/pentagon-nominee-tata-trump-kfile/index.html}{first
reported by CNN}.

``At a moment when the Defense Department is warning about the dangers
of politicization and trying to keep its personnel out of the 2020
presidential campaign, Tata's appointment demonstrates that apolitical
orders only mean so much,'' said John Gans, a Pentagon speechwriter for
former Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter. ``Tata's blowtorch tweets set
a horrible example and precedent with three months to go in a
contentious campaign.''

After the comments caught the public's attention, several senior retired
military officers dropped their support for Mr. Tata. Gen. Joseph L.
Votel, the former head of the Central Command; Gen. Tony Thomas, the
former head of the Special Operations Command; and Lt. Gen. David A.
Deptula, a former top Air Force general, all asked in June that their
names be removed from
\href{https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/Tata-Letter_06-18-2020.pdf}{a
letter} backing Mr. Tata's nomination sent by 36 current and former
leaders to the Armed Services Committee.

Mr. Tata was meant to succeed John C. Rood, who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/19/us/politics/john-rood-trump.html}{resigned
in February} at Mr. Trump's request. Mr. Rood had pushed back on efforts
to withhold military aid to Ukraine, a central issue in Mr. Trump's
impeachment hearings.

One Republican on the armed services panel, Senator Kevin Cramer of
North Dakota, had publicly indicated that he was prepared to block the
nomination over an unrelated Pentagon policy on adding names to the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Other Republican lawmakers were privately
unsettled by Mr. Tata's inflammatory remarks, and taking a vote on the
nomination would have put four Republicans on the panel, who are facing
difficult re-election battles, in a particularly unsavory position:
Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa, Martha McSally of Arizona, Thom Tillis of
North Carolina and David Perdue of Georgia.

Democratic lawmakers on the panel were united in opposing Mr. Tata,
making the threat of Mr. Cramer's opposition potentially fatal to moving
the nomination out of the committee. That was enough for Mr. Inhofe to
cancel the hearing.

The night before canceling the hearing, Mr. Inhofe was overheard
discussing the matter in a phone call with Mr. Trump. The call was
overheard because Mr. Inhofe put it on speakerphone to hear better as he
sat in the Trattoria Alberto restaurant in Washington. During the
conversation, Mr. Trump suggested he might give Mr. Tata a different
appointment.

On Monday, Mr. Inhofe indicated he would not try to stand in the way of
Mr. Trump's latest move. ``While I have always stressed the need to have
Senate-confirmed leadership in top Pentagon positions, I believe it is
within the president's authority to appoint D.O.D. officials when and as
appropriate,'' Mr. Inhofe said in an emailed response to a request for
comment. ``These are clearly critical positions within the department
where a full bench is needed.''
