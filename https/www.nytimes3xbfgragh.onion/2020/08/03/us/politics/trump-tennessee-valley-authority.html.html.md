The Tennessee Valley Authority, an electric utility, quickly said it
would reconsider its move to shift some work to contractors outside the
United States.

WASHINGTON — President Trump abruptly announced on Monday the firing of
two members of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s board of directors and
demanded that the electric utility’s chief executive reverse what he
said was a decision to outsource workers to other countries.

The president’s announcement came during a White House meeting in which
he signed an executive order seeking to ensure that the government hired
Americans. Mr. Trump said that Jeff Lyash, the utility’s chief
executive, was “ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year.” The
president said he was also removing James Thompson, the board chairman,
and Richard Howarth, another board member, to show his opposition to the
outsourcing decision.

Mr. Trump then vowed a continued purge of the rest of the utility’s
board if it continued with its plan.

“If the T.V.A. does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire
their workers, then more board members will be removed,” he said.

About 20 minutes later, after reading from a note handed to him by an
aide, the president said that Mr. Lyash had called the White House and
had “indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course.”

Attendees at the meeting, including about a dozen employees of the
Tennessee Valley Authority, clapped enthusiastically as Mr. Trump added,
“Now maybe he’ll take a major cut in salary.”

A federally owned corporation, the Tennessee Valley Authority provides
electricity to about 10 million people in parts of seven states in the
Southeast. It receives no federal funding, operating almost exclusively
on the revenue it receives from the sale of energy to business and
individual customers.

The utility announced in January that it would lay off about 120
information technology employees and shift to using contractors, some of
whom are based in Paris and other locations abroad, [according to The
Chattanooga Times Free
Press](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/business/aroundregion/story/2020/jan/28/tvcuts-120-jobs-it-it-outsources-software-wor/514284/).

The Tennessee Valley Authority said in a statement on Monday afternoon
that it did not have any employees who worked overseas, though it did
not address whether it contracted work out to companies that did.

“All T.V.A. employees are U.S.-based citizens,” said Jim Hopson, a
spokesman for the utility. “All jobs related to T.V.A.’s information
technology department must be performed in the U.S. by individuals who
may legally work in this country.”

He added: “We want to ensure that U.S. employees have good opportunities
through our employment and supply chain practices. We look forward to
working with the White House, continuing a dialogue and supporting
future policies in this direction.”

Gay Henson, the president of the local union that represents T.V.A.
workers, praised the president’s efforts.

“The workers here at T.V.A. whose jobs are slated to be offshored are
thankful and relieved to see the White House issue this executive
order,” she said.

Several hours after making his announcement, Mr. Trump nominated Charles
W. Cook Jr., a technology executive, to be a member of the Tennessee
Valley Authority board.
