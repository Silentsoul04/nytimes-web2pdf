I’m not sure whether to call this the good news or the bad news, but
Covid-19 is not the only thing that parents need to think about right
now.

Summer regularly brings up a set of safety concerns for children, and
that is as true this year as any other. Of course, this year is very
different, and when I talked to pediatric emergency room specialists
around the country, they reinforced summer safety advice, while noting
some of the special twists and dangers of this dangerous and twisty
time.

“Everyone has cabin fever, and they want to get out and have a good
time,” said Dr. Mark Zonfrillo, an associate professor of emergency
medicine and pediatrics at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown
University. And even as many parents may feel that it’s all they can do
to enforce social distancing and mask-wearing, it’s important to
remember the safety measures from the before times as well.

Dr. Maya Haasz, an attending physician in the pediatric emergency room
at Children’s Hospital Colorado and an assistant professor at University
of Colorado School of Medicine, said they are seeing injuries that
reflect a summer of individual activity rather than team sports. Kids
are out riding their bikes and their scooters, she said, but not always
wearing helmets. “We’re seeing more significant head injuries,” she
said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

\[**[*Sign up for the Well Family
newsletter*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/well-family)**\]

And because some parents are still scared to go to hospitals, injured
children are sometimes not coming in immediately. The delay can be
painful for the child and problematic for the doctors, for example if a
laceration is more than a day old, and can’t be safely sewn up.

“We’re doing a tremendous amount to keep the hospital safe,” Dr. Haasz
said. “You are not at risk of getting Covid in the hospital.”

But to help keep kids out of the emergency room, remember the sunscreen
and the bike helmets and the adult supervision for kids in the
water.

## Water Safety

[Drowning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/22/well/family/drowning-children-water-safety.html)
is the leading cause of death for children from 1 to 4 and it can happen
silently and swiftly, leaving behind devastated families and regrets
that never go away.

Dr. Maneesha Agarwal, a pediatric emergency physician and assistant
professor at Emory in Atlanta, said that in 2018, 443 children from 1 to
4 died from drowning, and that it kills about 1,000 children of all ages
every year. There are two peaks in age, she said, first the toddlers and
young children who accidentally gain access to a body of water, and then
the adolescents, the risk-takers, “who might be horsing around, sneaking
into pools.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With the pandemic, children may not be going to community pools, where
there would be lifeguards, and the home pool market has been booming. “A
lot of people are getting new
[pools](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Pool-Dangers-Drowning-Prevention-When-Not-Swimming-Time.aspx)
and first-time pools, so with that comes a responsibility for not only
proper barriers and pool gates, but also proper supervision in an era of
distraction,” Dr. Zonfrillo said.

Parents need to think about layers of safety, Dr. Agarwal said, such as
having a four-foot tall fence around the entire pool, but also alarms.
Parental supervision is key. “We recommend for younger children and not
experienced swimmers that they should always be within arm’s reach,” Dr.
Agarwal said. Parents should not assume they can rely on a lifeguard,
who will have many swimmers to watch.

Even kiddie pools and shallow bodies of water can be dangerous, Dr.
Zonfrillo said: “A toddler can drown in just a few inches of water.”

## Trampolines

If you have a trampoline, supervise children carefully, follow all
safety instructions, and make sure there is only one child on the
trampoline at a time. Trampoline sales have gone up in the pandemic, and
doctors have been very concerned about [trampoline-related
fractures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/well/family/coronavirus-shutdown-children-injuries.html?searchResultPosition=1)
and trips to the emergency room. “A bunch of kids on a trampoline can
really cause a lot of injury,” Dr. Agarwal said.

## Bikes, Scooters and ATVs

Be mindful of [bike
safety](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/10/well/family/children-bike-scooter-safety.html?searchResultPosition=3),
be vigilant about helmets. And remember that kids can get badly injured
on scooters and on [all-terrain
vehicles](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/ATV-Safety-Rules.aspx),
or ATVs. ** ATVs are very common, especially in rural communities, Dr.
Agarwal said, and nationally, about four children are seen in an
emergency department every hour with ATV injuries. She recently treated
a child who had taken “every single precaution,” she said. “He was on a
designated ATV recreational area, he had a helmet, he was supervised, he
had no passengers — and yet he still managed to roll over his ATV on
himself.” Bottom line: Although she understands their appeal, Dr.
Agarwal said, “Don’t put your kid on an ATV.”

## Sun

Take the [summer
sun](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/15/well/family/shielding-kids-from-the-sun-isnt-just-about-sunscreen.html?searchResultPosition=2)
seriously: Keep children in the shade as much as possible, use hats and
protective clothing in addition to sunscreen. Apply lots of sunscreen,
reapply it every couple of hours, and after children go in the water.
Make sure children stay hydrated, especially if they’re exercising.
Children who are engaged in athletics should start hydrating before they
go out to practice, Dr. Agarwal said, and if they haven’t been
practicing during the shutdown, they should ease back in, and be
particularly careful about hydration and heat exposure when they go back
to
practicing.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

## Heat Stroke

Heat stroke is always a worry, especially [vehicular heat
stroke](https://www.kidsandcars.org/how-kids-get-hurt/heat-stroke/),
which happens when small children are left in cars. Many doctors were
worried that the pandemic might put children at additional risk, if
parents who are reluctant to take them into stores leave them in
vehicles. “In hot temperatures, the temperature in the car can rise
within minutes,” Dr. Zonfrillo said. Ideally, parents should leave
children at home while they do errands.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This year, Dr. Agarwal said, the numbers are actually looking a little
better. For the past two years, over 50 children a year have died from
heat stroke; there have been 11 deaths so far this year.

## Guns

Be aware of the danger posed by
[firearms](https://well.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/01/07/keeping-guns-away-from-children/)
that are not properly secured and stored. Firearms are not specifically
a summer risk, but this is a summer of children not going to camp, and
home injuries loom large. Firearm sales have increased in the pandemic,
and Dr. Agarwal says that pediatric emergency doctors are worrying over
these new owners especially, and whether they are storing the guns
safely — they should be stored unloaded, locked up in a gun safe or with
a trigger lock, and with the ammunition locked up in a separate
location. “I want to encourage all parents to [ask about the presence of
unsecured
firearms](https://well.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/24/ask-well-gun-storage-and-children/)
in any home where children go to visit,” Dr. Agarwal said.

## Household Injuries

Other at-home injuries to avoid in an at-home summer include poisonings
and falls, especially [falls from
windows](https://www.nsc.org/home-safety/safety-topics/child-safety/window-safety#:~:text=Falls%20from%20windows%20are%20more,to%20go%20to%20the%20hospital.).
A window screen alone is not a sufficient protection. Be aware that even
the substances you’re using to protect your children can be
[toxic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/health/fda-Eskbiochem-toxic-hand-sanitizer-virus.html?searchResultPosition=1);
the pandemic has meant increased [poisoning incidents involving hand
sanitizers](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Keep-Hand-Sanitizer-Out-of-Childrens-Reach.aspx#:~:text=Children%20and%20adults%20also%20have,after%20repeated%20use%20on%20skin.).
Dr. Zonfrillo emphasized the importance of what he called
“re-child-proofing the home, based on the child’s developmental age.”

## Mental Health

Social isolation may be taking a toll, especially on children who suffer
from anxiety or depression, and on those who may not have been able to
get help and therapy virtually. On the other hand, as children begin to
interact more, whether in person or virtually, and even start school
again, doctors worry about bullying.

Dr. Haasz said this is a time for “really keeping an eye out for friends
and family who have mental health concerns.” To help keep vulnerable
children safe, it’s again important to be sure the home is
injury-proofed, she said: “Lock up anything they could use to hurt
themselves, even seemingly benign medications like Tylenol and
Benadryl.” And if you’re worried about your child’s mental health, she
said, bring it up.

“You are not going to harm your child by asking them questions,” she
said. “If you are concerned about them, talk to them. If you’re
concerned they’re going to hurt themselves, bring them into the
hospital.”
