I’m a lifelong extrovert who readily establishes and relishes casual
contacts with people I encounter during daily life: while walking my
dog, shopping for groceries, working out at the Y, even sweeping my
sidewalk. These ephemeral connections add variety to my life, are a
source of useful information and often provide needed emotional and
physical support. Equally important, they nearly always leave me with a
smile on my face (although now hidden under a mask\!).

In recent months, under stay-at-home orders because of the coronavirus
pandemic, many people lost such daily encounters. I, on the other hand,
have done my best to maintain as many of them as possible while striving
to remain safe. With in-person time with family and close friends now
limited by a mutual desire to avoid exposure to Covid-19, the brief
socially distant contacts with people in my neighborhood, both those
I’ve known casually for years and others I just met, have been crucial
to my emotional and practical well-being and maybe even my health.

The benefits I associate with my casual connections were reinforced
recently by a fortuitous find. During a Covid-inspired cleanup I
stumbled upon a book in my library called “Consequential Strangers: The
Power of People Who Don’t Seem to Matter … *But Really Do.”* Published
11 years ago, this enlightening tome was written by Melinda Blau, a
science writer, and Karen L. Fingerman, currently a professor of
psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, who studies the nature
and effects of so-called weak ties that people have with others in their
lives: the barista who fetches their coffee, the person who cuts their
hair, the proprietor of the local market, the folks they see often at
the gym or train station.

In an interview, Dr. Fingerman noted that casual connections with people
encountered in the course of daily life can give people a feeling that
they belong to a community, which she described as “a basic human need.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As she and Ms. Blau wrote in their book, consequential strangers “are as
vital to our well-being, growth, and day-to-day existence as family and
close friends. Consequential strangers anchor us in the world and give
us a sense of being plugged into something larger. They also enhance and
enrich our lives and offer us opportunities for novel experiences and
information that is beyond the purview of our inner circles. They are
vital social connections — people who help you get through the day and
make life more
interesting.”

My tendency to “chat up” total strangers I meet in the course of just
living has resulted in a slew of acquaintances who have filled my days
with pleasantries, advice, information, needed assistance and, most
important of all during this time of enforced semi-isolation, a valuable
sense of connections to people who share my environment.

Covid-19 lockdowns have reminded so many of us of how important our
relationships are to our quality of life — not only relationships with
the friends and family members we love and know well and who know us
well, but also with more casual ones that help us maintain a positive
outlook during dark and distressing times.

Dr. Fingerman’s research has also shown that people who are more
socially integrated are also more active physically. “Being sedentary
kills you,” she said. “You have to get up and move to be with the people
you run into when exercising.” Consequential strangers also help your
brain, she said, because “conversations are more stimulating than with
people you know well.”

A fellow researcher in the field, Katherine L. Fiori, chairwoman of
undergraduate psychology at Adelphi University who studies social
networks of older adults, has found that activities that foster “weaker
ties” than are formed with family and close friends foster greater life
satisfaction and better emotional and physical health.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The greater the number of weaker ties, the stronger the association
with positive feelings and fewer depressed feelings,” Dr. Fiori said in
an interview. “It’s clearly not the case that close ties are all that
older adults need.”

And not just older adults, all adults. Dr. Fingerman said research has
shown that, in general, “people do better when they have a more diverse
group of people in their lives.” But as Dr. Fiori observed,
“Unfortunately, Covid has severely curtailed our ability to maintain
weaker ties. It can take a lot more effort to do this
online.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

When Covid-19 descended with a fury on New York City, many people I knew
who had second homes “escaped” the city in hopes of avoiding the virus.
I, on the other hand, chose to stay in my Brooklyn neighborhood where
everyday I encountered people I knew casually as well as others in my
extended network of friends and acquaintances I’d made at the Y, in
local stores and when walking and cycling in Prospect Park.

In my country house, especially during the dark cold days of early
spring, I would have been far more isolated. Yes, I could walk my dog
and ride my bike without having to wear a mask because I would have met
almost no one else on route. But I would also have been deprived of
conversations with the many “consequential strangers” I encountered
daily during my outdoor excursions in Brooklyn, including the 7 p.m.
“shout-out” in support of our essential workers.

To counter the loneliness and maintain her many casual connections, one
of my Y buddies started a group email that not only filled in for the
daily conversations she was missing but also gave her an ongoing support
system when faced with an injury and struggling with doom-and-gloom
isolation.

In their book, Ms. Blau and Dr. Fingerman emphasize the importance of
creating and being in environments that foster relationships with
consequential strangers. Decades ago when The New York Times erected
cubicles for its writers and editors, it destroyed an environment that
was conducive to sharing information and fostering camaraderie,
prompting me to work from home most days and save the time and effort
needed to dress for work and commute. I suspect that when Covid
limitations are finally lifted, many more office workers will do the
same and sacrifice casual work-based relationships.

As the authors wrote, “Where we live, work, shop, and mingle has
everything to do with the weak ties we cultivate, and therefore our
quality of life.” As they described a central theme of their book,
“Casual acquaintances inspire us to venture beyond our comfort zones.”
And until we do, we’ll never know what we might gain from relationships
with “people who don’t seem to matter.”
