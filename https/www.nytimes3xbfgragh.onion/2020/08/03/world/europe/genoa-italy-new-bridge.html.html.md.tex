Resilience}\label{italy-leaders-hail-genoas-new-bridge-as-sign-of-resilience}}

Less than two years after the collapse of the Morandi Bridge killed 43
people and embarrassed the nation, Italy inaugurated its replacement,
and vowed to do better.

Less than two years after the collapse of a highway bridge in Genoa took
43 lives and became a source of national embarrassment, Italy's leaders
flocked to the city on Monday to inaugurate a gleaming replacement that
they called proof of the country's resilience and prowess.

``Today Genoa is starting again,'' Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told a
crowd of officials gathered in the port city, in an event broadcast live
nationwide. ``Our country can face and overcome difficulties, and can go
back to racing.''

Genoa's mayor, Marco Bucci, called the new bridge ``a message of trust
and competence for the future.''

The inauguration commanded national attention,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/world/europe/genoa-Morandi-bridge-replacement.html}{offering
a rare bright spot}after months of suffering from
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-reopening.html}{the
coronavirus pandemic} and the resulting recession.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/09/06/world/europe/genoa-italy-bridge.html}{The
Morandi Bridge collapsed} shortly before noon on Aug. 14, 2018, during a
torrential rain, dropping dozens of cars as much as 150 feet into the
ravine below; if the disaster had occurred at rush hour, the toll would
have been much higher. It severed the primary connection between the
western part of Genoa and the rest of the city, and between Genoa and
much of northwestern Italy.

The disaster was seen as emblematic of Italy's hapless government and
corrupt practices --- an image Mr. Conte and others are keen to reverse.

The bridge, completed in 1967, was hailed in its time for its innovative
use of prestressed concrete and clean lines. But it suffered from
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/15/world/europe/italy-genoa-bridge-collapse.html}{years
of poor maintenance}, and engineers came to see
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/16/world/europe/italy-bridge-collapse-design.html}{the
heralded design as a weakness}, making for a fragile structure.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/03/world/03genoa3/merlin_142844598_ea03d4d4-6ed7-435d-9b96-24c9960f8602-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Prosecutors are investigating whether Autostrade per l'Italia, the
company that operated the Morandi bridge, performed the necessary work
to keep it safe. Extensive evidence has emerged testifying to the
bridge's poor condition.

Autostrade, originally a public enterprise that was privatized in 1999,
is under investigation, along with several transport ministry officials,
for homicide. A trial is expected next year.

The government has announced plans to take the company back from private
ownership, in a contested deal that has yet to be finalized.

Immediately after the collapse, the anti-establishment Five Star
Movement, the leading party in Italy's government, decried the role of
Autostrade in the tragedy and vowed to change the rules for concessions
to operate Italy's toll highways and bridges.

The investigation into the collapse expanded to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/09/06/world/europe/genoa-italy-bridge.html}{involve
hundreds of bridges}, tunnels and bypasses across the county, leading to
many closures and a new seriousness about enforcing maintenance rules.

With remarkable speed, the remains of the Morandi Bridge were dismantled
and removed, and the replacement, the Genoa San Giorgio Bridge, was
built by almost 1,200 workers for several of Italy's leading industrial
and construction companies.

``We are suspended between grief and pride,'' Renzo Piano, the new
bridge's architect and a native of Genoa told the attendees with a
broken voice. ``The country showed its best side, competence, energy,
resilience.''

Mr. Piano, who has been seen on early morning strolls through the work
site, said he hoped that this bridge would be loved.

``Everyone will discover the light of this bridge,'' he said. ``The
light of the Mediterranean.''

The San Giorgio bridge will have four maintenance robots running along
its length to spot weathering and wear, as well as a dehumidifying
system to limit corrosion in the damp, salty Mediterranean winds.

Minutes before the official speeches began on Monday, a long rainbow
broke the clouds. An orchestra played the national anthem and jets
trailing the green, white and red of the Italian flag roared across the
sky.

The names of the victims were read aloud, but many of their relatives
chose not to attend the inauguration, offended by the plans to turn the
occasion into a televised celebration of national pride. President
Sergio Mattarella met privately with a number of them.

``They planned a carnival, showing terribly bad taste and no idea of
what we are still going through,'' said Egle Possetti, whose sister died
in the disaster, along with her husband and two children. They were on
their way to the beach.

``We wanted a sober ceremony,'' she said.

The tragedy is still very present in the minds of Genoese people who
recall being stuck in traffic on the Morandi bridge, often with a
feeling of precariousness, as well as the seemingly endless repair work
on it.

Days after the tragedy, Daniela Cerruti, a doctor, recalled driving
across the bridge in heavy traffic the night before it fell. Like many
people in the city, she could not shake the thought that she could have
been on it when it gave way.

``None can forget,'' she said.
