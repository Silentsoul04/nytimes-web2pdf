# ‘I Am Scared’: Italian Sex Workers Face Poverty and Illness In the Pandemic

</div>

Prostitution is not illegal in Italy, nor is it regulated as an official
occupation. But the coronavirus has forced many sex workers to accept
certain risks in order to avoid poverty.

MILAN — When the mayor of Modica, a Sicilian town known for its
chocolates and churches, learned that a sex worker in the area had
tested positive for the coronavirus, he immediately started to worry
about an outbreak.

He made a frantic public appeal for clients to get tested, assuring them
that their wives wouldn’t find out. But contact tracing proved difficult
as the mayor, Ignazio Abbate, began receiving anonymous phone calls from
men “asking for a friend” what the sex worker looked like.

The secrecy and stigma around unregulated sex work put “everyone in
danger,” Mr. Abbate said.

Modica has so far not experienced a new outbreak, but as the sex worker
recovered in a hospital in Perugia last month, news of her situation and
occupation spread throughout the country, highlighting the ways in which
the pandemic has affected some of the most vulnerable and marginalized
communities in Italy, and the dangers of keeping sex work in the
shadows.

“Of course I am scared,” said Fernanda Ponciano, a 31-year-old sex
worker from Torre del Lago, in Tuscany. Ms. Ponciano started taking
clients again after a three-month hiatus during the lockdown. She works
as a maid in the morning and as a sex worker in the afternoon, she said.
She also supports her mother, her sister and a niece in Brazil.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The fear of ending up homeless is bigger than that of Covid,” said Ms.
Ponciano.

In Italy, prostitution is not illegal, nor is it regulated as an
official occupation, making the country’s 70,000 sex workers largely
ineligible to receive economic relief. Many have been forced to take
their chances by returning to work in order to avoid poverty.

Mery Sommella, a 54-year-old sex worker in Bologna, stopped taking
clients in mid-March. By the beginning of April, she was unable to pay
for groceries and started relying on bags of food from a local charity.
She said she is too scared to return to work.

“For 40 years on the street I have been so careful to protect myself
from viruses,” she said. “I can’t catch coronavirus
now.”

In May, organizations that promote the rights of Italian sex workers
sought to draw the government’s attention and get support, arguing that
the pandemic showed the harm of forcing sex work underground.

In other European countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, sex
workers can enter formal contracts with their clients. During the
lockdown, those who were officially registered with the government were
eligible for economic relief.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scotland also included sex workers in its relief programs. In Greece,
where prostitution is legal and regulated, brothels were allowed to
reopen on June 15, provided that sex workers kept their clients’ names
and contact details for four weeks for tracing purposes.

In Italy, [various charities and associations have raised
money](https://www.produzionidalbasso.com/project/covid19-nessuna-da-sola-solidarieta-immediata-alle-lavoratrici-sessuali-piu-colpite-dall-emergenza/)
for groceries, medicines, bills and rent to benefit the country’s sex
workers. But for the most part, Italian sex workers, who are often from
immigrant communities, have had to fend for themselves.

In March, Regina Satariano, a 60-year-old sex worker in Tuscany, started
hearing about colleagues who hadn’t eaten, and a landlord who had
threatened to evict a group of 17 housemates, all sex workers who were
out of work because of the pandemic.

Ms. Satariano put together her savings and bought bags of pasta, tomato
sauce, chicken and soap to distribute to her colleagues. But without
support from the state, she said, many sex workers will continue to go
hungry. If officials don’t change things now, she added, “they never
will.”

A recent report by the Sex Workers’ Rights Advocacy Network and the
International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe showed
that many sex workers defied lockdown rules in order to work, putting
both themselves and their clients at risk.

The day after the sex worker from Modica was hospitalized in Perugia, a

in prostitution, was also hospitalized with Covid-19. Reports soon

Last month, Antonio Guadagnini, a Conservative councilor in the Veneto

regulating prostitution would protect society. In Sicily, Ruggero Razza,
the top regional health official, said that authorities should reflect
on how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in high-risk,
unregulated occupations such as sex
work.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

“Once again we were excluded from the system,” said Pia Covre, a former
sex worker and the founder of the Committee for the Civil Rights of
Prostitutes, which promotes the legal recognition and regulation of sex
work.

She added that, after being excluded from government economic support,
sex workers were also deprived regular coronavirus tests and the
opportunity to keep a record of their clients for contact tracing.

The regulation of sex work is opposed by those who argue that it would
lead to more exploitation and human trafficking. The pandemic, they say,
hasn’t changed that.

Senator Alessandra Maiorino, the spokeswoman for the Five Star Movement,
Italy’s governing political party, has said that up to 90 percent of sex
workers are victims of human trafficking. Last June she signed a
petition to demand that Escort Advisor, Europe’s largest sex worker
review website, be shut down.

She and others argue that hitting demand is the only way to end
prostitution while also protecting victims of human trafficking. But
