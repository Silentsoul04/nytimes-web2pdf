``I'm almost certain Trump has no idea what TikTok is. I'm betting
TikTok was one of the answers he wrote on his cognitive test,'' Seth
Meyers joked on Monday's ``Late Night.''

President Trump recently told reporters that, in the interest of
national security, he was considering a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/style/tiktok-ban-threat-trump.html}{ban
of the Chinese-owned social video platform TikTok in the United States}.
Then, on Monday,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html}{Mr.
Trump confirmed that he had given Microsoft}, which has expressed
interest in buying the app, or any additional American companies until
Sept. 15 to acquire it.

TikTok was one of the answers he wrote on his cognitive test.''
\emph{--- SETH MEYERS}

``Apparently this is a real national security threat, the Chinese
government knowing which Americans can and can't dance.'' \emph{---
JIMMY FALLON}

``I am sure it has everything to do with national security and nothing
to do with the TikTok teens who sabotaged his Tulsa rally.\emph{'' ---
JIMMY FALLON}

``Trump gave Microsoft 45 days to make a deal, although they'll spend
the first 44 days clicking `remind me tomorrow.'\emph{'' --- JIMMY
FALLON}

``It's a big day for the three TikTok fans that also love Excel
spreadsheets.'' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``Trump doesn't know anything about TikTok, and he doesn't actually care
--- he just says stuff like this because it's his favorite thing to do.
He loves to stand on the White House lawn next to a giant whirring
helicopter and shout empty pronouncements at reporters because it makes
him feel like he's actually the president and not just some soulless
husk who fell ass-backward into a job he wasn't qualified for because
some dummy made fun of him at a dinner once.'' \emph{--- SETH MEYERS,
referring to his jabs at Mr. Trump while hosting the White House
Correspondents' Association dinner in 2011.}

Edition)}\label{the-punchiest-punchlines-tiktok-edition}}

\begin{quote}
``What is he doing? Is he the president of the United States or the
preacher from `Footloose'?'' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``\emph{{[}Imitating Trump{]}} We're also looking very strongly at Candy
Crush. We don't want criminals like the Jelly Queen and Cupcake Carl
coming into our country. Joe Biden doesn't have what it takes to stop
the bubble gum troll.'' \emph{--- SETH MEYERS}

``Trump is playing hard ball with China. If he bans TikTok, China will
only be able to spy on our phones, TVs, cars and refrigerator. So,
that's where he draws the line.\emph{'' --- JIMMY FALLON}

``The president can't just unilaterally ban a social media app, and I
don't trust Republicans to regulate social media since most of them
don't seem to understand it.'' \emph{--- SETH MEYERS}

``At first Trump was confused because he thought TikTok was the name of
`60 Minutes.'\emph{'' --- JIMMY FALLON}

``But on the bright side, Trump is also using executive action to stop
people from writing Instagram captions like `So this happened.'\emph{''
--- JIMMY FALLON}
