**What comes after “The Good Fight”? — Douglas**

What indeed\! One of the things that makes “[The Good
Fight](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/watching/recommendations/the-good-wifehttps://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/the-good-fight-tv-recaps)”
so singular is its sense of imagination and ambition, a willingness to
take big swings; there just aren’t that many shows that are going for it
in the same way.

I’m going to assume you started with “[The Good
Wife](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/watching/recommendations/the-good-wife),”
from which “The Good Fight” was spun off, but I encourage you to watch
it again. Bingeing “Good Wife,” which I had previously watched
week-to-week, highlighted how subtle and specific the show is — all
these small changes and tiny shifts that I only noticed up close, like
how Will and Diane prioritize or don’t prioritize the other’s approval
via quick glances in a meeting.

For another lawyer show that strikes that classy-but-horny balance, try
“[The
Split](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/watching/titles/the-split),” a
British drama about a family of divorce lawyers who go through breakups
and shake-ups themselves. The show is serious and meaty, with maybe less
flair than “The Good Fight” but a little more intimacy. (Season 1 is
streaming on
[Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/the-split-5d1de53d-d263-48b9-b44c-75410ef9b9f4).)

If you want something equally polished and simmering with rage, but less
about the law and more about business, watch
“[Succession](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/spotlight/succession).”
(It’s streaming on [HBO](https://www.hbo.com/succession).) Brian Cox
stars as the patriarch of a media empire, and his adult children are
smart and vicious and hungrily unloved. Characters on “The Good Fight”
and “Succession” are obsessed with reputation, though that obsession
leads them down different paths, and they understand their legacies in
different ways — is work your family, or is your family work?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a different vein, there’s
“[Goliath](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/14/arts/television/review-in-goliath-billy-bob-thornton-plays-a-down-and-out-david.html),”
starring Billy Bob Thornton as a craggy genius lawyer. The show loves
seediness and revels in the dirtbag aspects of California, but it has
robust legal maneuvers and terrifically vivid characters, though I’ll
warn you that it loses some potency as the seasons go on. “The Good
Fight” and “Goliath” have a similar stylish confidence, the swagger of
grown-up shows for grown-up people.

**A friend and I (she’s in Seattle; I’m in Los Angeles) have had a
weekly Netflix viewing party going for about two months now where we
chat online while watching something. We tend to gravitate toward darker
true crime/cult documentary material (“Wild Wild Country,” “The
Staircase,” “Filthy Rich,” “Holy Hell,” “Fyre”) as the commentary flows
pretty naturally with those. In a deviation from our usual genre, we
just started “[The Last Dance.](https://www.netflix.com/title/80203144)”
Any suggestions on series or documentaries that would make for a good
viewing party? — Amani**

If you’re part of an ESPN+ household, watch “[O.J.: Made in
America](http://www.espn.com/30for30/ojsimpsonmadeinamerica/),” which is
among the best TV documentaries of all time — fascinating and deep, true
crime but not lurid. You can also find tremendous joy and options from
the “[30
for 30](https://www.espn.com/espnplus/series/0514c1ad-efd1-4d3a-ad82-41ca579a94a2/30-for-30)”
library, which are all sports documentaries and are all at least decent;
some are truly excellent. In terms of chitchat potential, start with
“[9.79\*](http://www.espn.com/30for30/film/_/page/9.79),” which is
about the men’s 100-meter finals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Prepare to
use the OMG eyes emoji a lot as you learn about steroid use and the
various open secrets of the era.

For something with more of the cult-y “wow, everyone sure is tolerating
a lot of bad behavior from the leader of this organization, who is also
exerting tremendous control over everyone’s lives, and at some point
will everyone realize the purported benefits of participating in this
group are small compared to the day-in-day-out emotional and physical
distress of enduring it?” vibe, watch the first two seasons of the
junior college football documentary series “[Last Chance
U](https://www.netflix.com/title/80091742)[.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/arts/television/last-chance-u-season-5.html)”
(The other three seasons are great, too, but have a different energy.
They’re all on Netflix.)

If you want more stories of people buying into a collective delusion,
watch “[The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon
Valley](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/18/arts/television/theranos-elizabeth-holmes.html)”
(streaming on
[HBO](https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-inventor-out-for-blood-in-silicon-valley)
and HBO Max), about the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and her
company, Theranos. Come for the juicy, terrible behavior, stay for the
animation that reminds you, “Oh yeah, that invention would also leave
you with a big old box of blood in your house.”

**After depleting most of what appeals to me from American-produced
content … I fled to Australia (virtually, of course). I absolutely loved
“[Offspring](https://www.netflix.com/title/80118289).” I also devoured
“Rosehaven,” basically a slow show about a small hamlet populated by
quirky characters. Getting to know them through the seasons was as
satisfying as picking leaves off an artichoke to get to the heart. Alas,
now I am adrift in an empty sea. Anything to match these? — Michelle**

I also adore
“[Rosehaven](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/watching/titles/rosehaven)”
(on [Sundance](https://www.sundancetv.com/shows/rosehaven--27554)), and
it reminds me a lot of “[Please Like
Me](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/watching/recommendations/please-like-me),”
a similarly darling, small-scale series, this one about a young gay man
trying to start his adult life. (It’s streaming on
[Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/please-like-me-172a0482-c365-4225-935e-255d45314c52).)

If you like plucky Australian heroines, watch “[Miss Fisher’s Murder
Mysteries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/watching/recommendations/miss-fishers-murder-mysteries)”
(on [Acorn](https://acorn.tv/missfisher/)), a detective show set in
Melbourne in the 1920s. The costumes alone are reason to watch, and for
light procedurals and endearing romance, this is tough to beat. But if
you prefer your procedurals set in the present day, watch “My Life Is
Murder,” starring Lucy Lawless. (That’s on
[Acorn](https://acorn.tv/mylifeismurder/).) It reminds me of
“[Psych](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/watching/recommendations/watching-tv-psych)”
sort of, and has that kind of affection for its characters.

For something more grounded, try “Tangle,” a domestic suburban drama
from 2009. (Season 1 is streaming on [Amazon Prime
Video](https://www.amazon.com/Tangle/dp/B07TSB82WF)). If you like shows
where backyard barbecues go awry, and couples gripe to each other for a
good long time before bed, watch this.
