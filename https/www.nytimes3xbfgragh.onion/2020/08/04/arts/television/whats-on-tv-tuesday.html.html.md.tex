\textbf{JOHN LEWIS: CELEBRATING A HERO} \emph{10 p.m. on CBS.} On
Thursday, Representative John Lewis,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html}{who
died on July 17}, was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/john-lewis-live-funeral.html?searchResultPosition=8}{eulogized
by three former presidents} at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
Lewis, a luminary of the civil rights movement, represented the city in
Congress for more than three decades, following his years as an activist
working alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In a continued
celebration of his legacy, Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Gayle King and
Brad Pitt will host this one-hour special that looks back at Lewis's
tireless civil rights work and political career, featuring appearances
by Common, Jennifer Hudson, John Legend, Trevor Noah, Billy Porter and
more.

\textbf{THE SWAMP} \emph{9 p.m. on HBO.} A key rallying cry during
President Trump's 2016 campaign was his promise
to\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-lobbyists-swamp-campaign.html}{``drain
the swamp''} by battling the corruption of special interests, lobbyists
and big-money donors in Washington. This documentary follows three
Republican congressmen who have tried to champion that mission:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-trump.html}{Rep.
Matt Gaetz} of Florida,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/us/politics/thomas-massie-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=5}{Rep.
Thomas Massie} of Kentucky and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/03/us/politics/trump-republican-party.html?searchResultPosition=12}{Rep.
Ken Buck} of Colorado. Over the course of a year, they navigate
fund-raising requirements; the process of securing key committee
assignments; and relationships with lobbyists and special interest
groups. The result is a look at what substantial reform might actually
require.

Smith} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/10/11/sports/john-carlos-of-68-olympics-protest-maintains-his-passion.html}{John
Carlos} stepped up to the podium, accepted their medals and raised their
fists during the national anthem to protest the treatment of Black
Americans. ``Depending on your perspective, their silent gesture of
protest was one of the most disturbing images in the history of American
sports, or one of the most inspiring,'' William C. Rhoden wrote of the
protest in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/18/sports/olympics/john-carlos-tommie-smith-committee-apology.html}{The
New York Times.} This documentary looks back on the circumstances that
led to that moment, as well as the way their protest has

outspoken athletes today.}

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1994/03/28/sports/hockey-from-russia-with-endorsements.html}{the
American entertainment industry collided with post-Soviet Russia.} After
the fall of the U.S.S.R., the famed Russian Red Army hockey team became
a pet project for a group of American investors. Under the marketing
whiz Steven Warshaw, the games were transformed into spectacle,
including bears on skates and exotic dancers, until oligarchs and the
Russian mob got involved.
