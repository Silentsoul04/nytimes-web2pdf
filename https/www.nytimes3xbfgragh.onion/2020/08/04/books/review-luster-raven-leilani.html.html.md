You may know of the hemline theory — the idea that skirt lengths
fluctuate with the stock market, rising in boom times and growing longer
in recessions.

Perhaps publishing has a parallel; call it the blurb theory. The more
strained our circumstances, the more manic the publicity machine, the
more breathless and orotund the advance praise. Blurbers (and critics)
speak with a reverent quiver of *this moment,* anointing every other
book its guide, every second writer its essential voice.

Take “Luster,” by Raven Leilani, perhaps the summer’s most touted debut.
It’s a book that has been so feverishly praised for its boldness, humor
and sexual frankness that I was a little crushed to find instead a
perfectly agreeable if uneven first novel — brisk and pleasantly pulpy,
hobbled occasionally by some seriously mangled prose and pat psychology.

Edie, the protagonist of “Luster,” would never have allowed this to
happen. She’s a spectacularly disabused and skeptical 23-year-old Black
woman, an assistant book editor, wise to the industry’s excesses. Not
that she’s especially engaged with her 9-to-5; she marshals her real
creative energy for sleeping with her male colleagues. She’s a sexual
adventuress of a joyless sort, not looking for love so much as a kind of
annihilation, an escape from the self — “ecstatic rutting and cushy
ether of the void,” as she puts it.

</div>

*\[ “Luster” was one of our most anticipated books of the month.* [*See
the full
list*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/books/new-august-books.html)*.
\]*

When we meet her, she’s become infatuated with Eric, a much older white
man in an open marriage. The snaky plot takes us from their online
courtship to Edie moving in with him and his wife, Rebecca. It’s a tense
ménage, initiated by Rebecca — a woman of “freaky competence” who takes
a chilly interest in Edie and hopes she might counsel the couple’s
12-year-old adopted daughter, Akila, who is lonely and isolated, one of
the few Black children in a white suburb. It’s the strange attraction
between Edie and Rebecca — “two magnets of identical charge” — that
propels the story.

The sex in the book, marked by a light sadomasochistic edge — Edie pines
to be punched, to be dominated — has attracted enthusiastic admiration.
Sex has a way of getting all the attention; in this case, it obscures
that, page by page, this is less a story about coupling than it is one
about work. The spikiest, funniest scenes send up corporate life, with
all its feints at inclusion and its complacent racism.

In one scene, Edie browses the latest “diversity” offerings from her
publishing house: They include “a slave narrative about a mixed-race
house girl fighting for a piece of her father’s estate; a slave
narrative about a runaway’s friendship with the white schoolteacher who
selflessly teaches her how to read; a slave narrative about a tragic
mulatto who raises the dead with her magic chitlin pies; a domestic
drama about a Black maid who, like Schrödinger’s cat, is both alive and
dead.”

There is nothing on offer like “Luster” — the story of a Black woman who
is neither heroic nor unduly tragic. Edie’s a little depressed, a little
perplexing to herself, a little needy. She’s thrilled to hear that Eric
finds her aloof: “Aloof is a casual lean, a choice. It is not a girl in
Bushwick, licking clean a can of tuna.” She is destructive but tender,
ravenous for experience but deeply vulnerable — and often wickedly
funny: “There are times I interact with kids and recall my abortion
fondly.”

\[ *Read* [*our
profile*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/books/raven-leilani-luster.html)
*of Raven Leilani.* \]

Even when her competitive side is awakened — with her colleague Aria,
for example, the only other Black woman on staff, one who has mastered
“that unthreatening aw-shucks shtick for all the professional whites”
— she shows generosity and a desire for kinship. “Even as we look at
each other through borrowed faces, we see each other. I see her hunger,
and she sees mine.”

A blurry feeling settled over me as I kept encountering rhyming
descriptions and plot points. Edie’s moments of connection with women
take identical forms. She shares a cigarette with each of them, and
cares for their hair, or tries to. She tenderly dyes Rebecca’s hair, and
she teaches Akila how to care for hers, traveling back to Brooklyn to
buy the oil and conditioners unavailable in the white suburbs. Other
details repeat: Rebecca monitors Akila’s weight in a way that reminds
Edie of her own mother: “We were bonded in our mutual hatred of our
bodies.”

It’s a book full of pairs, relationships that mirror one another. It is,
in fact, a book gleaming with actual mirrors. There are countless
references to Edie gazing at her reflection — in dressing rooms, at the
bathroom at a party. “Sometimes the face I see doesn’t feel like mine,”
she says. That tension creeps into the painting she pursues in her spare
time; she’s unable to complete a self-portrait.

This is the governing terror Edie describes in her life, and in the
lives of the Black women in the novel: If you are hypersurveilled but
unseen, can you lose sight of your own face? Your own desires?

The reader, though, perhaps sees Edie too clearly. Narrative causality
flows a little too neatly, the back story filters in to explain Edie as
a culmination of her upbringing — her father’s philandering, her
mother’s addiction and drive to oblivion. It’s strange, perhaps, to
crave more privacy for a fictional character, but I wanted it for Edie.
I wanted more mystery, for her to resist being so neatly summed up. In a
word she might use, I wanted agency for her, but this story is
interested in inheritance, hence those echoes and doublings. Why do the
gestures repeat? We use what is available to us, the tools and habits of
consolation; we use what we have been taught, on ourselves and on
others.

One of Edie and Eric’s few shared interests is disco, the pleasure of
which Edie explains slightly apologetically: It’s the “too much,” she
says, it’s “the horn section and the cheese.” So it is with “Luster.”
Your enjoyment will depend on a tolerance for run-on sentences that
strain painfully for profundity (“for a moment I consider the
possibility of God as a chaotic, amorphous evil who made autoimmune
disease but gave us miraculous genitals to cope” begins one such
example), for odd, often indecipherable metaphors. When Edie is
discovered snooping in Akila’s room, she describes seeing the
embarrassment on the young girl’s face “like seeing an Olive Garden
commercial after having already plowed through two bowls of fettuccine.”

The dialogue is flat, mostly expository with an interesting repetition.
The characters frame their impatience with Edie — her transgressions,
her need — as a generational divide, prefiguring, perhaps, how this book
might be read. Novels by young writers tend to attract a strange sort of
attention — more anthropological than literary. *What does the work
of<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Sally Rooney tell us about
“millennial precarity”? What does Kristen Roupenian’s “Cat Person”
reveal about gender and power?* It’s not that fiction can’t be a rich
mine of evidence, but such analyses often go against how and why most
people read. Do we go to Ann Petry for a sociological snapshot of
midcentury Harlem life? “Anna Karenina” for hot takes on the sexual
politics of the Russian landed gentry? We don’t go to novels because
they are timely, but because they feel *timeless* in their treatment of
consciousness and emotional life. We don’t want characters to exist as a
bundle of symptoms but as full personalities in their rich confusion and
ambivalence.

Edie could tell you all that. She enacts it; she’d flinch from being
lazily lumped in with any trend or cohort. “Why does it have to be my
generation?” she learns to respond. “Why can’t it be me, specifically?”
