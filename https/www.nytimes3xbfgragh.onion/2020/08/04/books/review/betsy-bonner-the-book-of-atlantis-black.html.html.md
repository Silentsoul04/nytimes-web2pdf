**THE BOOK OF ATLANTIS BLACK**  
**The Search for a Sister Gone Missing**  
By Betsy Bonner

When we meet Atlantis Black in 2002, she is onstage, an up-and-coming
musician performing at the Sidewalk Café in New York City’s East
Village. Atlantis “tossed her head like a horse assailed by flies” as
she sang about “sex, drugs and a love of pain, death and
transformation.” Watching Atlantis from the crowd is her younger
sister, Betsy. The scene elegantly establishes the dynamic at the core
of Betsy Bonner’s haunting, mind-bending memoir: Atlantis as the
charismatic, troubled performer; Betsy the stable observer, witnessing
her sister’s life unfold.

Six years later, a body is found in a Tijuana hotel room with Atlantis’s
identification. The death looks like an accidental overdose, but
inconsistencies pile up. The autopsy photographs do not appear to match
the body Betsy’s mother identifies at the morgue. Are the toxicology
reports forged? Could Atlantis still be alive? “The Book of Atlantis
Black” traces Bonner’s search for the truth. It is also a wrenching
portrait of Atlantis and her role in Bonner’s life.

From an early age, the sisters seem bound for different fates. Nancy
(who changed her name to Atlantis at 17) is molested by a neighbor at
age 8. At 13 she cuts her wrists and begins taking antidepressants. By
her mid-20s she’s addicted to painkillers and suffering from panic
attacks. When Atlantis attempts suicide in 1998, Betsy is studying
abroad at Oxford. When Atlantis spends a week in jail on a prescription
drug fraud charge, Betsy is “island-hopping” during a teaching gig in
Greece. “That was just how life went for us,” Bonner writes in
hindsight. “Our destinies were already written.”

Bonner constructs much of her memoir from Atlantis’s emails, Facebook
updates, interviews, Craigslist ads, voice mail messages and song
lyrics. This collage captures both Atlantis’s mesmerizing voice and her
instability; the Facebook updates — *Atlantis is …, Atlantis is …* — are
incantatory, spellbinding. Bonner’s narrative choice to follow many of
these extracts with her reactions as she experienced them in the moment
can sometimes be more compelling in conception than in execution. After
a Facebook message in which Atlantis brags, “Oh honey, I run a whole
cartel from Barstow to Bejing \[*sic*\],” Bonner’s response — “She was
obviously kidding, pretending to be some big-time drug dealer” — feels
at once logically superfluous and emotionally insufficient. Bonner’s
interjections throughout Atlantis’s searing “final will and testament”
(“I couldn’t imagine sending Atlantis’s jacket to her first adult
therapist”) douse much of that document’s fire. But if this strategy
frustrates, it also provokes, refusing to supply the aestheticized
reflections upon trauma that readers may expect, even crave.

Keeping the reader close to her real-time perspective also allows Bonner
to pull off a riveting balancing act in the memoir’s final third, when
we find ourselves on increasingly unsteady ground, forced to ask with
each new twist: Is this a veritable true-crime investigation? Or is
Betsy — and are we — merely “obsessing over details and typos … doing
everything I could to avoid the truth”? As a medical examiner writes to
her, “You’ve inlaid your obsession into the frame of writing a book.”

Much earlier in the story, Betsy and Nancy and their mother go on a
cross-country road trip. At a Super 8 in New Mexico, Nancy and their
mother — a fascinating figure, vulnerable and cruel — bond over their
struggles with mental illness; the mother eventually commits suicide
too. That night, Nancy bestows upon her sister a nickname that
reverberates across this memoir: “Lucky Betsy.” What does it mean to be
lucky, to be spared, when such luck carries with it the burden of
bearing witness? In the end, Bonner is the only one who can tell this
story, because she is the only one who survives it.
