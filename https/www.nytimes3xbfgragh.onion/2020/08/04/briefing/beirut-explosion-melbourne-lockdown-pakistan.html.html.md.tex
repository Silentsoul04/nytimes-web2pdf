rocked the center of the Lebanese capital} on Tuesday, damaging
buildings in several neighborhoods and sending a giant pink cloud
skyward near the city's port. At least 30 people were killed and 2,500
were injured, Lebanon's health minister said.

With the wounded still streaming into hospitals and the search for
missing people underway, the figures were likely to go higher. The
governor of Beirut, Marwan Abboud, could not say what had caused the
explosions. Breaking into tears, he called it a national catastrophe.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab declared a national day of mourning for
Wednesday.

\textbf{What caused it:} ``Highly explosive materials,'' seized by the
government years ago, were stored near where the explosions occurred,
said Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, the head of Lebanon's general security
service. He warned against speculating about a terrorist act.

Australia's second-largest city has now imposed some of the toughest
restrictions in the world to beat back a new wave of coronavirus
infections. Officials are promising a
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/world/australia/coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown.html}{shock
and awe'' attack on the virus} that will last at least six weeks.

There are signs that people are fed up with the lockdown. Our Sydney
bureau chief writes that ``the new waves of restrictions feel to many
like a bombing raid that just won't end.''

A door-to-door campaign to check in on 3,000 people who had Covid-19
found that 800 of them were not at home. The police are facing
opposition. On at least four occasions in the last week, they smashed
the windows of cars and pulled people out after they refused to provide
their names and addresses.

\textbf{The second wave}: Australia was seen as a shining example for
beating the virus, and it was thought that Melbourne had done so as of
late June. But the city's hotel quarantine program broke down, with
travelers passing the virus to security guards, who carried the
contagion into their neighborhoods.

\textbf{Details:} The latest lockdown will close stores, return schools
to at-home instruction, order restaurants to be takeaway or
delivery-only, and child care centers will be available only with
special permission. An 8 p.m. curfew is in place. The outbreak in
Victoria state peaked at 753 new cases on July 30 and has hovered at
around 500 a day ever since.

Hindus living in Pakistan often face discrimination in housing, jobs and
access to government programs. Now, Hindu community leaders say there's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/world/asia/pakistan-hindu-conversion.html}{been
an uptick in conversions to Islam}, brought on by economic hardship.

Dozens of Hindu families converted in June in the Badin district of
Sindh Province in southern Pakistan. Video clips of the ceremony went
viral across the country, delighting hard-line Muslims and weighing on
Pakistan's dwindling Hindu minority.

\textbf{Quotable:} ``What we are seeking is social status, nothing
else,'' said Muhammad Aslam Sheikh, whose name was Sawan Bheel before he
converted to Islam with his family. ``These conversions,'' he added,
``are becoming very common in poor Hindu communities.''

\textbf{A few figures:} At independence in 1947, Hindus composed 20.5
percent of the population of the areas that now form Pakistan. In the
following decades, the percentage shrank rapidly, and by 1998, Hindus
were just 1.6 percent of Pakistan's population. Most estimates say it
has further dwindled in the past two decades.

At a time when the Tokyo Olympics should have been in full swing,
gymnasts are talking about
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/sports/olympics/gymnastics-abuse-athlete-a.html}{verbal
and physical abuse by coaches.}

Among the horror stories: Chloe Gilliland, 29, a former member of the
Australian national team, said she considered suicide as a teenager
after her coaches said she was ``a bad child'' because she was too
heavy. Catherine Lyons, 19, once a top junior competitor for Britain,
said coaches would hit her and harass her about her weight, and, when
she was 7 or 8, she would cry so hard that coaches would shut her inside
a cupboard until she composed herself. Above, Lisa Mason, a 2000 British
Olympian, has encouraged fellow gymnasts to speak out.

The stories from gymnasts are part of a broader push, empowered by the
\#MeToo movement and by a parallel outcry in the U.S. gymnastics world.
National federations in Britain, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium
say they are trying to curb abuses.

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the

    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make

\emph{Americans have been battling surprise coronavirus bills for nearly
as long as they've been fighting the disease itself, according to Sarah
Kliff, our investigative reporter on health issues.}

\emph{So, she started a project that uses those bills, sent by readers,
to examine the cost of testing and treatment. We'll be sharing these
stories as we explore how the virus outbreak is changing health care in

I'm a reporter who has been writing articles about those bills since
mid-February. My first story focused on an American man and his
3-year-old daughter who faced more than \$3,900 in bills for care
received during a government-mandated quarantine.

``I assumed it was all being paid for,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/29/upshot/coronavirus-surprise-medical-bills.html}{Frank
Wucinski, the patient}, said at the time. ``We didn't have a choice.
When the bills showed up, it was just a pit in my stomach, like, `How do
I pay for this?'''

Since then, my colleagues and I have written about \$2,315 coronavirus
tests and \$401,886 bills for treatment. We've discovered that the price
of a coronavirus test can vary by 2,700 percent within the same
emergency room.

I've run similar projects that have inspired legislation and demystified
American medical billing. Because health care providers keep their
prices secret, bills play a critical role in helping us understand how
Americans are grappling with medical costs during the health crisis.
