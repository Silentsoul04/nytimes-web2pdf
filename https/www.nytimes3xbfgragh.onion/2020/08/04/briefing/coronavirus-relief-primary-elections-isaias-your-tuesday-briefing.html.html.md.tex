Democrats and Republicans in Congress started far apart on negotiations
over the latest coronavirus stimulus bill last month. They haven't
closed the gap much since --- even though extended unemployment benefits
expired Friday.

What's getting in the way of a deal?

The gulf between the two sides' proposals is one reason for the impasse.
``The policy differences are just that significant,'' says Emily
Cochrane, who covers Congress for The Times.

Democrats' \$3 trillion bill, which the House passed in May, was a
nonstarter for Senate Republicans. Their \$1 trillion counteroffer,
unveiled last week, includes reduced funding for state and local aid and
omits Democratic priorities like election security. Democrats want to
revive the lapsed \$600 weekly unemployment benefit through January;
Republicans want to slash it to about \$200.

A deal has also remained elusive because Republicans aren't all in
agreement.

President Trump has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/congress-jobless-aid-talks-trump.html}{complicated
his own negotiators' jobs} by insulting Democrats and floating
proposals, like a payroll tax cut, that congressional Republicans have
long since ruled out. ``Republican lawmakers and aides acknowledge they
lost a week of valuable negotiating time just trying to get on the same
page as the administration,'' Emily says.

Other Republicans --- especially those not up for re-election in
November, like Senator Ted Cruz --- say they're worried a large stimulus
bill will increase the national debt, putting them at odds with members
of their own caucus.

So what comes next? ``Another flurry of meetings on Capitol Hill, with
administration officials shuttling across the complex in an effort to
hammer out differences,'' says Emily.

A small fraction of students in the South and Midwest have returned to
classrooms, and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/school-closing-coronavirus.html}{the
coronavirus is already disrupting plans}. In one Indiana school
district, the superintendent sent out a note Saturday thanking students
and parents for ``a great first two days of school!'' He also said
several staff members had tested positive --- and the high school was
swiftly closed.

``I've been in the business over 40 years --- I have never experienced
anything like this,'' said Lee Childress, a superintendent in
Mississippi whose district has seen three students test positive since
last week. ``It's kind of like drinking out of a fire hose because it's
happening so fast.''

\textbf{A cautionary tale from Israel:} The government
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/coronavirus-israel-schools-reopen.html}{rushed
students back into the classroom in May}, confident that the country had
moved past the pandemic. Outbreaks ultimately closed more than 240
schools and led to the quarantine of more than 22,520 teachers and
students.

Voters in five states will cast ballots in primary elections today.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/elections/primary-election-michigan-arizona-kansas.html}{Here
are a few races to watch}:

\textbf{Kansas:} Kris Kobach, the polarizing former Kansas secretary of
state and staunch Trump supporter,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/kris-kobach-kansas-senate-primary.html}{hopes
to win his party's nomination for the Senate}. Republicans fear his
candidacy would give Democrats a better chance to take the seat --- and,
potentially, a Senate majority.

\textbf{Michigan:} Representative Rashida Tlaib --- a member of the
``Squad'' of progressive women of color in Congress --- is facing a
rematch with a primary challenger she narrowly beat in 2018.

\textbf{Missouri:} Cori Bush,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/cori-bush-william-lacy-clay-missouri.html}{an
activist backed by the progressive group Justice Democrats}, hopes to
unseat the 10-term Democratic House incumbent William Lacy Clay.

\textbf{Arizona:} Joe Arpaio, the 88-year-old former sheriff of Maricopa
County whose hard-line immigration stance earned him a criminal
conviction,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/arizona-election-joe-arpaio.html}{is

After an initial threat to ban TikTok, Trump yesterday voiced
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html}{his
approval for Microsoft to pursue an acquisition of the popular
Chinese-owned video app}. He also argued that the U.S. government should
get a ``big percentage'' of the sale for allowing it to happen, without
explaining how such an arrangement would possibly work.

The events followed a pattern that Trump set early on in his presidency,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/business/economy/trump-tiktok-china-business.html}{Ana
Swanson and Michael D. Shear write}, ``in which some of the world's most
powerful companies have found themselves at his whims.''

\textbf{Bridging the gap:} From the beginning, Zhang Yiming wanted to
create a global tech company based in China. This is the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-bytedance-us-china.html}{story

divide}.

Good news for nostalgic gamers everywhere: Video game developers, much
like remake-loving Hollywood,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/business/video-game-remake-remaster-nostalgia.html}{are
looking to their archives for fresh material}. Popular '90s and
early-2000s franchises like Resident Evil and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater are
being overhauled, often to critical and financial success. Lesser-known
titles are banking on sentimentality, too: the 2003 game ``SpongeBob
SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom'' released a ``rehydrated'' remake
in June.

What makes them so popular? ``Because you can actually revisit those
virtual spaces, it's a more powerful type of nostalgia,'' said one
expert. ``It's the same when you go back to it; it's the same as it was
when you were 7.''

Padma Lakshmi wants the food world to be a little less white. The host
of Bravo's long-running cooking competition ``Top Chef'' makes that
point with her latest show,
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/dining/padma-lakshmi-taste-the-nation.html}{Taste
the Nation},'' where she spotlights different cultures' cuisines across
the U.S., from cracking crab shells with South Carolina's Gullah Geechee
community to comparing flour and corn tortillas along the border in
Texas.

But the road wasn't always easy.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/03/magazine/padma-lakshmi-interview.html}{In

greenlit and the need for more inclusive representation in food media.
``There's such a laziness --- it's not often malicious --- about
reaching for the thing that is most familiar,'' she said.
