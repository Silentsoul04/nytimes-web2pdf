\textbf{BP} reported
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/business/energy-environment/bp-renewable-investment.html}{a
\$16.8 billion quarterly loss} on Tuesday, and cut its dividend in half
for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon disaster a decade ago, as
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/shell-and-total-report-big-drop-in-profits-but-made-clean-energy-investments.html}{lower
oil prices and plunging demand} from the effects of the coronavirus
pandemic took a toll on the London-based energy giant.

At the same time, the company took \$17. 4 billion in write-offs in
exploration and other activities, and cut its forecasts for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/15/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/opec-russia-and-other-oil-producers-will-ease-production-cuts}{oil
and gas prices}.

In cutting its dividend to 5.25 cents a share, BP said that it would
prioritize keeping the payout at that level. The company has previously
said it would cut about 10,000 jobs, with the majority expected to leave
this year.

On a call with journalists on Tuesday, the company's chief executive,
Bernard Looney, outlined an effort to shift BP away from its focus on
oil to what he called an ``integrated energy company.''

Among the highlights of his presentation: BP will increase its
investments in low-carbon energy, like solar and wind power, by tenfold
in a decade, while cutting its oil and gas production by 40 percent. He
also said BP would not begin exploration in any new countries.

By the end of the decade, he said, oil and gas would make up about half
of the company's capital investments, with renewables and other non-oil
investments accounting for the rest.
