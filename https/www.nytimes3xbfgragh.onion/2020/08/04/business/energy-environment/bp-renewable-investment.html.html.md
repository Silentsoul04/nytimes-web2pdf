BP reported a $16.8 billion quarterly loss on Tuesday, and cut its
dividend in half — the first reduction since the Deepwater Horizon
disaster a decade ago.

But what caught the attention of analysts and, apparently, investors,
was the ambitious plan that Bernard Looney, the chief executive, set out
for making over the London-based oil giant into a diversified purveyor
of cleaner energy within a decade. BP’s share price jumped by more than
7 percent during trading Tuesday.

On a webcast with analysts Mr. Looney described a transformation plan
that Stuart Joyner, an analyst at the market research firm Redburn, said
in a note to clients was “major, positive, thoughtful and largely
unexpected.”

European oil companies, much more that their counterparts in the United
States, have made a flurry of commitments to reduce carbon emissions in
the future, responding to pressure from investors and governments to be
on the right side of tackling climate change.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Looney, though, was more specific in his investment goals, saying
that he intended for BP in a decade to be investing around $5 billion a
year in renewable energy like wind, solar and hydrogen, a clean-burning
gas, about 10 times the current amount. BP’s capital spending is likely
to be about $12 billion this
year.

He said that he wanted to reduce oil and gas production by about 40
percent in that time frame. As part of the shift, BP, whose origins date
back to the discovery of oil in Iran in the early 20th century, would
not enter any new countries to explore for oil and would also pare back
its refining by about one-third, Mr. Looney said.

Other large oil companies have been wary of saying that their petroleum
output would decline despite growing climate change concerns. Now they
may come under pressure to do the same.

The ambition to cut oil and gas output is “a massive departure,” said
Mr. Joyner of Redburn. “I think it will go down as a watershed moment
not only for BP but for the industry,” he added.

Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein, a market research firm, said BP’s
plans were “peer-leading” and that its potential to smoothly manage
large projects in the renewables area was “underappreciated.”

BP’s second-quarter results were also laden with reminders that the
company has made mistakes before and could make them again.

It took [a total of $17.4 billion in write
downs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/business/energy-environment/bp-oil-gas-write-down.html),
an acknowledgment that its oil and gas fields are no longer worth as
much as they once were.

BP has aspired to be a different kind of energy company before. In 2000
it adopted the slogan [Beyond
Petroleum](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/12/08/magazine/how-green-is-bp.html),
though early forays into renewable energy lost momentum after the 2010
Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico.

“There are significant risks for BP” and other large oil companies as
they move toward lower-carbon businesses, said Jennifer C. Rowland, an
analyst at Edward Jones, a securities broker. “However, the risk of
inaction is just as significant, as the value of their traditional oil
and gas assets, as well as their relevance in the energy world, could be
diminished over time, “ she said.

BP sliced its dividend to $5.25 cents, while saying it would prioritize
keeping the still generous payout at that level.

Mr. Looney, a 29-year company veteran, became [chief
executive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/04/business/bp-ceo-bob-dudley-bernard-looney.html)
in February and promptly set out a target of achieving “net zero”
emissions
[by 2050](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/12/climate/bp-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html).
On Tuesday he provided some details on meeting that goal that were
originally supposed to be revealed in September to impatient investors.

Mr. Looney said the coronavirus pandemic and the grim earnings that it
had produced “only makes us more determined to change, not less.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A key focus of the new BP will be electricity generation, although cash
from oil and gas will fund investment. Analysts say that electric power
will be the key means for delivering cleaner energy in the future. By
2030 BP plans to have about 50 gigawatts of renewable generating
capacity, roughly equivalent to fifteen large modern nuclear power
stations.

Mr. Looney says his aim is to profit from renewables through BP’s
extensive buying and selling of electricity and by offering cities or
companies large amounts of clean energy. The company is optimistic that
it can make double-digit profits from such operations. That is more than
some analysts say utility-type businesses are likely to produce.

This new direction is coming at a difficult juncture. Mr. Looney [said
previously](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-52966609) that he was
cutting about 10,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of the work force, most
of them this year, as he creates what he calls a more agile company.
This exercise will lead to around $1.5 billion in write downs to be
recognized during this year.

Adding to the risks, the company is now looking to buy into areas, such
as electricity generation, where Mr. Looney and most of his colleagues
have much less experience than they do in oil and gas. Mr. Looney began
his career as a drilling engineer, and rose to be head of the unit that
discovers and produces petroleum — the source of the billions of dollars
in write-offs that were officially announced Tuesday.

“I want to make sure that we don’t have to keep doing this in the
future,” Mr. Looney said.
