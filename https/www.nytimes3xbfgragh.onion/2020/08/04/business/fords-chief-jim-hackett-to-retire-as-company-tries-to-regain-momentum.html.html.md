**Ford Motor** said its chief executive, Jim Hackett, will retire on
Oct. 1, ending a three-year run in which the automaker has worked with
mixed results to streamline its operations and focus its business on
electric cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles.

Mr. Hackett, 65, will be succeeded by James D. Farley Jr., who had been
named chief operating officer in February.

“I am very grateful to Jim Hackett for all he has done to modernize Ford
and prepare us to compete and win in the future,” said William Clay Ford
Jr., Ford’s executive chairman. The company, he added, is becoming “much
more nimble.”

Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of **Steelcase**, an office
furniture manufacturer that is much smaller and less complex, was named
to [the top job at
Ford](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/22/business/jim-hackett-ford.html)
in May 2017, as the company’s business was slumping. He promised to
revitalize Ford’s operations and steer the company toward vehicles that
would generate profits and invest in emerging technologies like electric
and self-driving vehicles.

The company is starting to introduce some of the models developed under
Mr. Hackett, including a redesigned F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang
Mach E, an electric S.U.V. styled to resemble the storied sports car.

But so far the turnaround has had little effect on the company’s bottom
line and stock price. Ford shares were trading at about $11 when he
arrived. The stock was trading at about $6.88 Tuesday morning, up more
than 2 percent after news of the Mr. Hackett’s retirement.

Investors value Ford at about $27 billion, just one-tenth the market
capitalization of **Tesla**, the electric automaker that makes far fewer
cars and has been around only since 2003.

Mr. Farley, 58, joined Ford in 2007 from **Toyota Motor**, and has held
a variety of jobs, including running the company’s marketing, its
European operations and a new business strategy group.
