\textbf{Ford Motor} said its chief executive, Jim Hackett, will retire
on Oct. 1, ending a three-year run in which the automaker has worked
with mixed results to streamline its operations and focus its business
on electric cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles.

Mr. Hackett, 65, will be succeeded by James D. Farley Jr., who had been
named chief operating officer in February.

``I am very grateful to Jim Hackett for all he has done to modernize
Ford and prepare us to compete and win in the future,'' said William
Clay Ford Jr., Ford's executive chairman. The company, he added, is
becoming ``much more nimble.''

Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of \textbf{Steelcase}, an office
furniture manufacturer that is much smaller and less complex, was named
to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/22/business/jim-hackett-ford.html}{the
top job at Ford} in May 2017, as the company's business was slumping. He
promised to revitalize Ford's operations and steer the company toward
vehicles that would generate profits and invest in emerging technologies
like electric and self-driving vehicles.

The company is starting to introduce some of the models developed under
Mr. Hackett, including a redesigned F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang
Mach E, an electric S.U.V. styled to resemble the storied sports car.

But so far the turnaround has had little effect on the company's bottom
line and stock price. Ford shares were trading at about \$11 when he
arrived. The stock was trading at about \$6.88 Tuesday morning, up more
than 2 percent after news of the Mr. Hackett's retirement.

Investors value Ford at about \$27 billion, just one-tenth the market
capitalization of \textbf{Tesla}, the electric automaker that makes far
fewer cars and has been around only since 2003.

Mr. Farley, 58, joined Ford in 2007 from \textbf{Toyota Motor}, and has
held a variety of jobs, including running the company's marketing, its
European operations and a new business strategy group.
