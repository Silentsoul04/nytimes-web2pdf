European Union authorities on Tuesday announced an investigation of
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/technology/google-fitbit.html}{Google's}}\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/technology/google-fitbit.html}{\$2.1
billion purchase of the fitness-tracking
company}\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/technology/google-fitbit.html}{Fitbit}},
raising alarms about the health data the internet giant would be
acquiring as part of the deal.

The inquiry shows the increased scrutiny Google and other large
technology companies are facing from regulators in Europe and the United
States about their growing dominance over the digital economy. Officials
have raised concerns that the biggest tech platforms buy up smaller
companies to solidify their dominance and limit competition.

\href{https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1446}{Margrethe
Vestager,}the European Commission's top antitrust regulator, said a
preliminary investigation of the Fitbit deal had raised concerns about
how Google would use data collected from Fitbit for its online
advertising services, a market where Google is already dominant. The
health and fitness data could be used to more narrowly target ads, she
said.

``By increasing the data advantage of Google in the personalization of
the ads it serves via its search engine and displays on other internet
pages, it would be more difficult for rivals to match Google's online
advertising services,'' the commission said in a statement announcing
the investigation.

Google defended the acquisition, saying it competes with companies like
\textbf{Apple}, \textbf{Samsung} and \textbf{Garmin} that offer fitness
tracking devices. ``This deal is about devices, not data,'' Rick
Osterloh, Google's senior vice president for devices and services,
\href{https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/update-fitbit/}{said
in a blog post}. The company said it would not use Fitbit health and
wellness data for advertising services and offered to make a legally
binding commitment to the commission to limit its use of the data.
