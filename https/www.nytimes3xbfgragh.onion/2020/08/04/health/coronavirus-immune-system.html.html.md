Scientists are beginning to untangle one of the most complex biological
mysteries of the coronavirus pandemic: Why do some people get severely
sick, whereas others quickly recover?

In certain patients, according to a
[flurry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2588-y) of
[recent](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/07/15/science.abc8511)
[studies](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/49/eabd7114), the
virus appears to make the immune system go haywire.

Unable to marshal the right cells and molecules to fight off the
invader, the bodies of the infected instead launch an entire arsenal of
weapons — a misguided barrage that can wreak havoc on healthy tissues,
experts said.

“We are seeing some crazy things coming up at various stages of
infection,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who
led one of the new studies.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Researchers studying these unusual responses are finding patterns that
distinguish patients on the path to recovery from those who fare far
worse. Insights gleaned from the data might [help tailor treatments to
individuals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-drugs-treatments.html),
easing symptoms or perhaps even vanquishing the virus before it has a
chance to [push the immune system too
far](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm-immune-system.html).

“A lot of these data are telling us that we need to be acting pretty
early in this process,” said John Wherry, an immunologist at the
University of Pennsylvania who recently published a study of these
telltale immune signatures. As more findings come out, researchers may
be able to begin testing the idea that “we can change the trajectory of
disease,” he
said.

When a more familiar respiratory infection, like a flu virus, tries to
gain a foothold in the body, the immune response launches a defense in
two orchestrated acts. First, a cavalry of fast-acting fighters flocks
to the site of infection and tries to corral the invader, buying the
rest of the immune system time to mount a more tailored attack.

Much of the early response depends on [signaling molecules called
cytokines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm-immune-system.html)
that are produced in response to a virus. Like microscopic alarms,
cytokines can mobilize reinforcements from elsewhere in the body,
triggering a round of inflammation.

Eventually, these cells and molecules leading the initial charge will
stand down, making way for [antibodies and T

— specialized assassins built to home in on the virus and the cells it

But this coordinated handoff seems to break down in people with severe
Covid-19.

Rather than bowing out gracefully, the cytokines that drive the first
surge never stop sounding the alarm, even after antibodies and T cells
arrive on the scene. That means the wildfire response of inflammation
may never get snuffed out, even when it’s no longer needed.

“It’s normal to develop inflammation during a viral infection,” said
Catherine Blish, a viral immunologist at Stanford University. “The
problem comes when you can’t resolve it.”

This sustained signaling may result in part from the body’s inability to
keep the virus in check, Dr. Iwasaki said. Many who struggle to recover
from their illness seem to harbor the pathogen long after other patients
have purged it, perhaps goading the immune system into prolonging its
frantic inflammatory siege.

[Plenty of other
viruses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/opinion/coronavirus-antibodies-immunity.html),
including those that cause AIDS and herpes, have evolved tricks to elude
the immune system. Recent evidence hints that the new coronavirus might
have a way of delaying or muffling interferon, one of the [earliest
cytokine
defenses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.088179v1)
the body mounts.

The failure of this first line of defense may dupe the immune system
into sounding its alarm bells even louder, dragging out the response
into something destructive. “It’s an enigma,” said Avery August, an
immunologist at Cornell University. “You have this raging immune
response, but the virus continues to replicate.”

And the quality of these cytokines may matter as much as the quantity.
In a [paper published last week in Nature
Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2588-y), Dr.
Iwasaki and her colleagues showed that patients with severe Covid-19
appear to be churning out signals that are better suited to subduing
pathogens that aren’t viruses.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although the delineations aren’t always clear-cut, the immune system’s
responses to pathogens can be [roughly grouped into three
categories](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749\(14\)01585-1/fulltext):
type 1, which is directed against viruses and certain bacteria that
infiltrate our cells; type 2, which fights parasites like worms that
don’t invade cells; and type 3, which goes after fungi and bacteria
that can survive outside of cells. Each branch uses different cytokines
to rouse different subsets of molecular
fighters.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

sensible approach, concentrating on type 1 responses, Dr. Iwasaki’s team
found. Patients struggling to recover, on the other hand, seem to be
pouring an unusual number of resources into type 2 and type 3 responses,
which is kind of “wacky,” Dr. Iwasaki said. “As far as we know, there is
no parasite involved.”

It’s almost as if the immune system is struggling to “pick a lane,” Dr.
Wherry said.

This disorientation also seems to extend into the realm of B cells and T
cells — two types of immune fighters that usually need to stay in
conversation to coordinate their attacks. Certain types of T cells, for
instance, are crucial for coaxing B cells into manufacturing
disease-fighting antibodies.

Last month, Dr. Wherry and his colleagues [published a paper in
Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/07/15/science.abc8511)
finding that, in many patients with severe Covid-19, the virus had
somehow driven a wedge between these two close-knit cellular
communities. It’s too soon to tell for sure, but perhaps something about
the coronavirus is preventing B and T cells from “talking to each
other,” he said.

These studies suggest that treating bad cases of Covid-19 might require
an immunological reset — drugs that could, in theory, restore the
balance in the body and resurrect lines of communication between
bamboozled cells. Such therapies could even be focused on specific
subsets of patients whose bodies are responding bizarrely to the virus,
Dr. Blish said: “the ones who have deranged cytokines from the
beginning.”

But that’s easier said than done. “The challenge here is trying to blunt
the response, without completely suppressing it, and getting the right
types of responses,” Dr. August said. “It’s hard to fine-tune
that.”

[Timing](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/05/how-quieting-cytokine-storms-could-be-key-to-treating-severe-cvd/)
is also crucial. Dose a patient too early with a drug that tempers
immune signaling, and they may not respond strongly enough; give it too
late, and the worst of the damage may have already been done. The same
goes for treatments intended to shore up the initial immune response
against the coronavirus, like [interferon-based
therapies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/world/covid-19-treatment-synairgen-interferon-beta.html),
Dr. Blish said. These could stamp out the pathogen if [given shortly
after
infection](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128\(20\)30401-7)
— or run roughshod over the body if [administered after too long of a
delay](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/06/10/science.abc3545).

So far, treatments that block the effects of [one cytokine at a
time](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-drugs-treatments.html)
have yielded mixed or lackluster results — perhaps because researchers
haven’t yet identified the right combinations of signals that drive
disease, said Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University.

Steroids like dexamethasone, on the other hand, are like “big hammers”
that can curb the activity of multiple cytokines at once, Dr. Farber
said. Early clinical trials have hinted at dexamethasone’s benefits
against severe cases of the coronavirus, and more are underway. Such
[broad-acting treatments have their
downsides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196557/). But,
she added, “it seems that’s a good strategy, until we know more.”
