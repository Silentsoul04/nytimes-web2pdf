Novavax, the little-known Maryland company that [received a $1.6
billion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html)
deal from the federal government for its experimental [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/health/russia-covid-vaccine.html),
announced encouraging results in two preliminary studies on Tuesday.

In one study, 56 volunteers produced a high level of antibodies against
the virus without any dangerous side effects. In the other, researchers
found that the vaccine strongly protected monkeys from coronavirus
infections.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although it’s not possible to directly compare the data from clinical
trials of different coronavirus vaccines, John Moore, a virologist at
Weill Cornell Medicine who was not involved in the studies, said the
Novavax results were the most impressive he had seen so far.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is the first one I’m looking at and saying, ‘Yeah, I’d take
that,’” Dr. Moore said.

Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University who was not
involved in the studies, called them “encouraging preliminary results,”
but cautioned that it won’t be possible to say whether the vaccine is
safe and effective until Novavax conducts a large-scale study — known as
Phase 3 — comparing people who get vaccinated to people who get a
placebo.

The studies are being submitted to scientific journals to be reviewed
for publication, said Dr. Gregory Glenn, the president of research and
development at Novavax.

The company has said that if its vaccine is shown to be effective, it
can produce 100 million doses by the beginning of next year, or enough
to give to 50 million people if administered in two doses. Under its
deal with the federal government, the company will also receive money to
undertake large-scale manufacturing of millions more doses if the
vaccine is shown to
work.

Novavax’s vaccine is [one of more than two dozen

Phase 1 trials. Five other coronavirus vaccines are already in Phase 3
trials, in which thousands of people are tested to see if a vaccine
works.

Its vaccines contain a coronavirus protein that prompts a response from
the immune system. Protein-based vaccines have a longer track record
than some of the newer approaches used by competing coronavirus
vaccines, such as those [based on viral
genes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html)
or so-called
[adenoviruses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/world/covid-coronavirus-vaccine.html).

Protein-based vaccines are licensed for diseases such as hepatitis B and
shingles. Novavax successfully completed a Phase 3 trial for a
protein-based vaccine for influenza earlier this year and has done
research on other diseases, such as MERS.

Novavax’s technology turns moth cells into factories for a [coronavirus
protein called
spike](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-mutation-spike-treatment.html),
which studs the surface of coronaviruses. Its vaccine combines several
of the spike proteins in a nanoparticle.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

To improve the performance of the vaccine, Novavax mixed the spike
proteins with a compound called an adjuvant. Studies on mice had
previously shown that the adjuvant stimulates immune cells so that they
develop a potent response to the virus.

The researchers gave the protein and adjuvant to monkeys in different
combinations of doses. The monkeys began making high levels of
antibodies that could specifically block the
coronavirus.

When the monkeys were infected, some versions of the vaccine left them
with no trace of the virus in their lungs or noses.

“That’s pretty remarkable,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale
University. She noted that the Novavax vaccine provided stronger
protection for monkeys than have other coronavirus vaccines, such as
Moderna’s messenger RNA vaccine.

In May, Novavax started a Phase 1 human trial on 134 volunteers. Some of
the people who received the vaccine experienced tenderness at the spot
where they got injected. But the researchers found no serious side
effects.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

The researchers extracted serum from the vaccinated volunteers and mixed
it with coronaviruses and cells. This showed that the volunteers
produced high levels of antibodies that prevented the viruses from
infecting cells. The vaccine produced more antibodies in the volunteers
than in patients who had recovered from Covid-19 on their own.

“There’s no way to know yet what level leads to protection,” said Matt
Frieman, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine
and a co-author of the Phase 1 study. “But all of these pieces point to
it being quite effective.”

Volunteers who only received the spike protein in their vaccine did not
make a lot of antibodies, the researchers found. “The adjuvant is
critical,” Dr. Glenn of Novavax said.

Dr. Moore said that the volunteers’ strong response to the vaccine “does
not surprise me in the slightest.” In June, he and his Weill Cornell
colleague P. J. Klasse predicted protein-based vaccines would produce a
strong antibody response in a
[review](https://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2020/06/26/JVI.01083-20) they
published in the Journal of
Virology.

Although Novavax is the first company to share clinical results on the
immune response of a protein vaccine, it is not the only one testing
this technology. Three other protein-based vaccines for Covid-19 — from
Clover Biopharmaceuticals, the University of Queensland and Vaxine — are
also in Phase 1 trials.

The World Health Organization lists more than 50 protein-based
coronavirus vaccines in preclinical trials. One of them is being
developed by Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, a partnership that last month
was [granted $2.1 billion from the federal
government](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/health/covid-19-vaccine-sanofi-gsk.html)
for 100 million doses. Sanofi expects to start its Phase 1 trial next
month.

Sanofi and Novavax both manufacture their vaccines inside the cells of
the fall armyworm moth, which allows them to be produced more quickly
than older methods that use mammal cells. This technique is one reason
Novavax’s vaccine candidate has gotten so much attention — in addition
to its deal with the U.S. government, the company has also secured up to
$388 million from the nonprofit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations, which seeks to make vaccines available outside of the
United States. Sanofi’s Flublok vaccine, which is already on the market,
uses this technology.

Immunologists have been debating the importance of antibodies for
fighting the coronavirus. It’s possible that another part of the immune
system, T cells, is also needed to fend off the virus. Dr. Moore
speculated that the best vaccine against Covid-19 might marshal both
types of responses.

A protein vaccine could provide strong antibody protection, while
another vaccine — perhaps one based on messenger RNA or an adenovirus —
could enlist T cells.

“If these first-generation vaccines are safe but they’re just not potent
enough, then you would certainly want to look at combining them,” Dr.
Moore said.
