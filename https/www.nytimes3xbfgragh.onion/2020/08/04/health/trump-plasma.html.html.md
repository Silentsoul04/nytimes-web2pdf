# As Trump Praises Plasma, Researchers Struggle to Finish Critical Studies

Thousands of Covid-19 patients have been treated with blood plasma
outside of rigorous clinical trials — hampering research that would have
shown whether the therapy worked.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

An American Airlines flight took off from La Guardia Airport in New York
last Wednesday morning, carrying 100 pouches of [blood plasma donated by
Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/trump-plasma.html)
survivors for delivery to Rio de Janeiro. American scientists are hoping
Covid-19 patients in Brazil will help them answer a century-old
question: Can this golden serum, loaded with antibodies against a
pathogen, actually heal the sick?

The truth is that no one knows if it works.

Since April, the Trump administration has funneled $48 million into a
program with the Mayo Clinic, allowing more than 53,000 Covid-19
patients to get plasma infusions. Doctors and hospitals desperate to
save the sickest patients have been eager to try a therapy that is safe
and might work. Tens of thousands more people are now enrolled to get
the treatment that’s been trumpeted by everyone from the president to
the actor Dwayne Johnson, better known as The Rock.

President Trump on Monday promoted its promise: “You had something very
special. You had something that knocked it out. So we want to be able to
use it,” he said, calling on Covid-19 survivors to donate their plasma,
which he called a “beautiful ingredient.”

But the unexpected demand for plasma has inadvertently undercut the
research that could prove that it works. The only way to get convincing
evidence is with a clinical trial that compares outcomes for patients
who are randomly assigned to get the treatment with those who are given
a placebo. Many patients and their doctors — knowing they could get the
treatment under the government program — have been unwilling to join
clinical trials that might provide them with a placebo instead of the
plasma.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The trials have also been stymied by the waning of the virus outbreak in
many cities, complicating researchers’ ability to recruit sick people.
One of those clinical trials, at Columbia University, sputtered to a
halt after the outbreak subsided in New York. One of its leaders, Dr. W.
Ian Lipkin, looked for hospitals in other hot spots in the United States
to continue the work. But he found few takers.

“Without a randomized control trial, it’s very difficult to be certain
that what you have is meaningful,” he said.

As of last week, just 67 people had enrolled in the Columbia study — too
few to form sound statistical conclusions. In a last-ditch effort, Dr.
Lipkin’s team shipped the plasma to Brazil, where the epidemic is still
raging.

Now, at the height of a public health crisis, the government’s push to
distribute an unproven treatment to desperately ill patients as quickly
as possible could come at the cost of completing clinical trials that
would potentially benefit millions around the world by determining
whether those treatments actually work.

In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration said
that the expanded access program was meant to bridge the gap until
trials could get underway and “was never intended to substitute for
randomized clinical trials, which are critically important for the
demonstration of efficacy.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The F.D.A. is preparing an emergency authorization to use the treatment,
according to scientists who have been briefed on the plans. The policy
would ease the clerical burden on hospitals to get clearance for
transfusions, further hampering clinical trials, researchers said. An
F.D.A. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether such an authorization
was in the works.

The move would mean the F.D.A. is “yielding to political pressure,” said
Dr. Luciana Borio, who oversaw public health preparedness for the
National Security Council under Mr. Trump and who was acting chief
scientist at the F.D.A. under President Barack Obama.

“I’m not as concerned about the political leaders having a misguided
approach to science,” she said. “What I’m really concerned about is
scientists having a misguided approach to science.”

On Monday, four former F.D.A. commissioners — including Dr. Scott
Gottlieb, who served under Mr. Trump — [called for more rigorous
clinical
trials](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/03/4-former-fda-commissioners-blood-plasma-might-be-covid-19-treatment-we-need/)
to evaluate whether plasma is an effective treatment for the
coronavirus. “If this is going to work, we need to do it right,” they
wrote.

Convalescent plasma, the pale yellow liquid that’s left after blood is
stripped of its red and white cells, has been used [since
the 1890s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4781783/) to
treat infectious diseases, including the flu, SARS and Ebola. Scientists
believe it may work by giving sick patients the antibodies of those who
have recovered from the
infection.

Plasma’s potential benefits are also promoted on conservative talk
shows, as was hydroxychloroquine, a treatment for malaria that was
[enthusiastically embraced by Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-chloroquine-trump.html)
but had not been found effective against the coronavirus in recent
clinical trials.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Unlike hydroxychloroquine, which has potentially harmful side effects,
plasma was seen as safe and top medical researchers had enthusiastically
set out to study it as American hospitals filled with Covid-19 patients.

“We are in a medical crisis — we don’t have alternatives,” said Dr.
Arturo Casadevall, a microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University who is
the chair of the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, a
consortium coordinating research into the therapy.

But at least 10 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in the United
States have enrolled only a few hundred people. And now, seven months
into the health crisis, some scientists say the F.D.A.’s program has
undermined their efforts to get answers about plasma’s utility.

“I’ve seen other people describe it as liquid gold,” said Dr. Richard
Kaufman, medical director of the transfusion service at the Brigham and
Women’s Hospital in Boston, where he is the principal investigator of a
trial that had [intended to enroll 220
patients](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04361253?term=convalescent+plasma&type=Intr&cond=COVID&intr=randomized&draw=3&rank=11)
but has enrolled only one. “I would say I have a lot of uncertainty at
this
point.”

## A century of experimentation

Antibodies have been tapped to heal the sick [since at least
the 1890s](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/21/1/150/402600), when
doctors used the serum of animals to treat diphtheria, a dangerous
bacterial disease. Convalescent plasma was used during the 1918 flu
pandemic, and so-called serum therapy became a treatment for everything
from pneumonia to measles. In 1925, teams of sled dogs [traveled
hundreds of
miles](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20161014-in-1925-a-remote-town-was-saved-from-lethal-disease-by-dogs)
over ice to deliver serum to the Alaskan town Nome, which was battling a
diphtheria outbreak.

Although it fell out of favor in the 1940s with the discovery of
antibiotics, convalescent plasma is often the first tool that doctors
use when they are desperate to treat an emerging epidemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So when the coronavirus began spreading this year, doctors in Wuhan,
China, as well as in Iran and Italy turned to the old standby.

Dr. Casadevall became one of its earliest U.S. backers, [writing an
opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in
February](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-boys-blood-stopped-an-outbreak-11582847330)
and calling colleagues from his Baltimore living room to encourage its
study.

By late March, as deaths from the virus rose, [Mount Sinai Hospital in
New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/health/plasma-coronavirus-treatment.html)
and [Houston Methodist in
Texas](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/mar/coronavirus-blood-transfusion-therapy-may-offer-promise-for-critically-ill-patients/)
began transfusing patients with plasma.

As the outbreak spread across the United States, calls grew to expand
distribution of plasma. But hospitals could use the plasma on a limited
number of patients only if they received emergency approval from the
F.D.A. Every day beginning in March, the agency heard from the doctors
of hundreds of patients asking for permission to try plasma, according
to a spokeswoman for the agency.

A loosely organized group of doctors, including Dr. Casadevall, began
pushing for a more coordinated approach. On April 3, the F.D.A. and the
Mayo Clinic
[opened](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-coordinates-national-effort-develop-blood-related-therapies-covid-19)
the “expanded access” program, using plasma donated through the American
Red Cross.

Extracting plasma is cumbersome. It begins much like a blood donation,
with a needle inserted into a vein. The blood is drawn into a machine
with a centrifuge, which filters the plasma and returns the rest of the
blood to the body. The plasma must be stored at freezing temperatures.
It cannot be mass produced.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. R. Scott Wright of the Mayo Clinic, who is helping to run its plasma
program, said he was an early advocate for conducting randomized trials
of convalescent plasma. But the mechanics of setting up large studies
were complicated by early shortages of plasma, coordination via Zoom and
the difficulty of predicting where the virus would spread to
next.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, researchers at major medical centers in the Northeast began
setting up studies. Dr. Mila B. Ortigoza, an infectious disease
specialist at NYU Langone Health, started a trial with colleagues at
Montefiore Medical Center in just weeks, enrolling its first patient on
April 17 and condensing years of work into days. But by the time it got
started, the pandemic was easing.

“The curve got squashed here in New York,” said Dr. Elliott
Bennett-Guerrero, the leader of another randomized trial of plasma at
Stony Brook Medicine on Long Island. He said the hospital had enrolled
only about 80 of the [500 planned
participants](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04344535?term=convalescent+plasma&type=Intr&cond=COVID&intr=randomized&draw=3&rank=20).
The trial is now stalled.

And the Mayo Clinic’s expanded access program exploded.

“We initially thought that we would enroll 3,000 people,” said Dr.
Michael Joyner, the scientist leading the effort. Dr. Casadevall was so
inundated with inquiries from patients’ families asking about plasma
that he removed his personal email from the Johns Hopkins website.

By June, 20,000 people had received plasma, and the program released [a
promising
report](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/jmcp/jmcp_ft95_6_8.pdf)
on the method’s safety. But there was no control group for comparison,
so the study could not evaluate whether the treatment did any
good.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

As in the U.S. trials, the Wuhan study had trouble recruiting
participants and concluded early with just 103 volunteers. An [analysis
recently
conducted](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20162917v1.full.pdf)
by researchers, including Drs. Joyner and Casadevall, found that several
overseas studies hinted that plasma was effective, but not all of them
were randomized.

## An Opening for President Trump

The Trump administration has framed convalescent plasma as a rare bright
spot in the pandemic.

Eager to present his administration as marching toward a “cure,” Mr.
Trump has mentioned plasma alongside remdesivir and dexamethasone, two
coronavirus treatments that have been shown to be effective in
randomized trials.

Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the leader of the White House’s coronavirus task
force, at one point pushed for the federal government to secure 500,000
bags of plasma to store for a possible wave of infections in the fall,
according to a senior administration official. She also pushed for
plasma transfusions in nursing homes, the official said.

When asked about these claims, a task force official said that Dr. Birx
wanted to move quickly to capitalize on the period of time after a
person is infected, when their plasma contains higher antibody levels.
Dr. Birx said she wanted clinical trials to include vulnerable people in
nursing homes, the official added.

Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, began discussing the
benefits of plasma at White House briefings in March. In interviews and
congressional testimony since then, he has presented it as one of the
few therapeutics the agency can publicly endorse.

Last week, he said the F.D.A. was “encouraged by the early promising
data that we’ve seen” and that it was “studying these data to determine,
ultimately, the safety and efficacy of this product.”

But he added that if plasma “doesn’t turn out to be the treatment we
think it might be, remember that your donations still count with the
American Blood Centers and the American Red
Cross.”

The treatment has the backing of celebrities like the songwriter Dolly
Parton, [who is
financing](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04362176?term=convalescent+plasma&type=Intr&cond=COVID&intr=randomized&draw=2&rank=9)
a randomized trial at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville,
and Mr. Johnson, who recorded [a
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYpmJcAdp2E) pleading with
survivors to donate blood.

“The plasma that’s in your blood can literally save lives,” he says in
the message. “But we have to act fast.”

Dr. Joyner said that Mayo researchers were preparing to publish a more
detailed analysis of the data they had collected through the access
program. But he said even he was not sure of the F.D.A.’s plans for the
expanded access program.

There is also an effort underway, led by New York medical institutions,
to [pool the data of unfinished
trials](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/research/continuous-monitoring-pooled-international-trials-convalescent-plasma-covid19-hospitalized-patients),
a strategy encouraged by Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the
National Institutes of Health. “It is a really, really powerful
approach,” said Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, the chief of infectious
diseases at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical
Center who is leading the clinical trial with Dr. Ortigoza.

But that idea, said Dr. Kaufman of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is less
than ideal. He said he did not plan to participate. “I worry about
combining partially finished studies that really may be different,” he
said.

Some of the trial investigators, like Dr. Lipkin, are finding new sites
where they hope to complete their work. NYU Langone is expanding to
hospitals in Connecticut, Florida and Texas. And researchers at Johns
Hopkins have begun two trials of convalescent plasma in people who are
not yet sick enough to be hospitalized, testing the theory that the
treatment might work best earlier in the infection.

Dr. Casadevall said that he still believed randomized trials were the
“only way we’re going to know whether it works or not,” but that they
should not be put in opposition to Mayo’s program.

“These things can always be second-guessed afterwards,” he said. “But
given the likelihood that it would work and given the history of safety,
it was worth trying it as a compassionate use. Maybe you can do this in
an emergency and still walk out with efficacy data.”

Dr. Lipkin said that, in retrospect, he might have played a role in
shaping plasma’s fame, unknowingly undermining his own trial. In March,
he [appeared on television shows like “Lou Dobbs
Tonight](https://twitter.com/loudobbs/status/1237892870331191297?lang=en)”
on Fox News, where he extolled its potential benefits — a move that, he
speculates, could have led administration officials to move more quickly
to expand access.

“I share some responsibility for this,” he said. “I think there are all
kinds of arguments one can make based on history, having a precedent.
But that’s not a substitute for rigorous science.”

Sheri Fink contributed reporting from Houston. Katie Thomas reported
from Chicago, and Noah Weiland from
Washington.
