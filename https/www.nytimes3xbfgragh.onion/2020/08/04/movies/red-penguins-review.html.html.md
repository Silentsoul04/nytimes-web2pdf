# ‘Red Penguins’ Review: A Rowdy Look at Post-Soviet Russia

</div>

This new documentary tells the tale of the Americans who invested in
Russia’s premier hockey team in the early 1990s. Unsurprisingly, things
went awry.

The director Gabe Polsky’s “Red Penguins” qualifies as a follow-up of
sorts to his 2014 documentary [“Red
Army,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/11/14/movies/red-army-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-soviet-hockey-dynasty.html)
titled after a nickname for the Soviet Union’s near-indomitable national
hockey team. But this time, sports are almost incidental.

The new documentary is interested in hockey as a commercial entity. It
delves into what happened when, in the early 1990s, two owners of the
Pittsburgh Penguins took a financial stake in a cash-strapped franchise
known as the C.S.K.A. — sometimes called the Central Red Army for its
previous relationship with the Soviet armed forces — as the team’s
greatness was slipping.

Although this episode might sound like a footnote in the story of
Russia’s transition to capitalism, “Red Penguins” is filled with tales
of cultures clashing and misunderstood intentions. The de facto
protagonist is not an athlete but a goofy, curly-maned marketing
executive, Steven Warshaw, whose up-for-anything attitude made him a fun
drinking buddy for his new Russian pals.

The Americans viewed **** Russian professional sports — and the
advertising that came with them — as an opportunity for feeding players
to the N.H.L. and for providing stateside corporations with inroads to
the new Russian market. But first they needed to lure fans to the Moscow
arena, which required gimmicks like strippers, free beer or a
Gorbachev-Yeltsin look-alike contest. Not everything went to plan. A
Jeep might have seemed like a great prize for a lucky spectator, but
Warshaw says the winner was so afraid of being robbed that he negotiated
a deal on the ice for cash.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As recounted here, Warshaw and the other Americans came to expect that
the team’s profits would be skimmed and that they couldn’t particularly
trust anyone. Valery Gushin, the team’s general manager, laughs heartily
about Warshaw’s fear of the Russian mob.

Polsky is a scattered storyteller, and it takes a while for “Red
Penguins” to coalesce from a haphazard assembly of clips and
reminiscences into more than a macho specialty item. The lighthearted
tales of cultural exchange give way to what the film suggests is a
backdrop of corruption and even suspicious deaths.

If “Red Penguins” doesn’t always strike a satisfying balance between the
glib and the grim, the broader topic — the commercialization of hockey —
affords it a novel lens on Russia’s economic transition.
