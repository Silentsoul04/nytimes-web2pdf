Keep flashlights close, make sure your phones are fully charged and
watch out for flooding. That’s what state officials advised as [Tropical
Storm
Isaias](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/isaias-storm-updates.html)
[moved up the Eastern

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A tropical storm warning is in effect through early Wednesday morning
for regions across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The storm,
which made landfall in North Carolina about 11 p.m. Monday as a Category
1 hurricane, is likely to bring strong wind and heavy rain to New York.
It might have a greater impact than [Tropical Storm
Fay](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/nyregion/tropical-storm-fay-nyc.html)
did last month.

The storm may wallop New York with the strongest wind the city has
experienced since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, but officials don’t expect it
to cause significant damage in the region.

“But we have been surprised before,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news
conference on Monday. “So we’re in a very vigilant state right now.”

*\[*[*Read the latest updates on the forecast for Tropical Storm
Isaias*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/isaias-storm-updates.html)*.\]*

Here’s what you need to know:

### The forecast

Two to four inches of rain may fall in the region, the National Weather
Service said. Strong wind may begin around noon, but the most intense
rain and gusts are expected in the afternoon and the evening, when heavy
downpours may occur in New York City and the lower Hudson Valley.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Coastal flooding and powerful wind from 30 to 70 miles per hour are
expected throughout the day. New Yorkers may see downed trees, damage to
homes and scattered power
outages.

If the wind reaches those speeds, the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority might suspend some service.

The storm is expected to weaken as it moves through the region,
according to the National Weather Service, with its effects in the area
diminishing by Tuesday night. In North Carolina, flooding, home fires
and power outages were reported as the storm passed through.

### The preparations

Emergency crews set up barriers throughout Lower Manhattan, which state
officials said was particularly vulnerable to flooding.

The South Street Seaport is the only area in New York City expected to
be at risk of storm surge, which could reach one to three feet, though
minor flooding may occur in other neighborhoods, officials said on
Monday.

While evacuation orders were not put in place for any regions in the
state, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said motorists should anticipate poor
weather and take precautions for potential flash flooding.

In New York City, restaurants were told to bring in all outdoor
furniture and to secure all barriers and platforms that were recently
created to accommodate outdoor dining.

## And finally: George Floyd and a dance festival

*The Times’s Marina Haas writes:*

This summer, as stages across the country lie unused, Kaatsbaan, a dance
center in the Hudson Valley, will be something precious and rare: one of
the few places in America where dancers will be performing live and in
front of a living and breathing, if well-distanced and masked, audience.

From now until Sept. 27, Kaatsbaan is holding an outdoor dance festival,
made up mostly of solos and socially distanced duets, ranging from
ballet to flamenco to tap to Broadway to postmodern dance. The festival,
a response to the lack of performance opportunities facing American
dancers, is the brainchild of Stella Abrera, the center’s artistic
director, and Sonja Kostich, its executive director.

*\[*[*In the Hudson Valley: Live dancers, real sweat and natural
beauty*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/arts/dance/kaatsbaan-dance-festival-stella-abrera.html)*.\]*

The national soul-searching touched off by the killing of George Floyd
in Minneapolis further intensified the sense of urgency. “How can we not
respond to what is happening in our society?” Ms. Abrera said. “Art
helps us be part of our world, to process what is happening around us,
to grieve.”

She and Ms. Kostich saw a need as well as an opportunity. To make the
festival as inclusive and as responsive to the moment as possible, they
invited three distinguished Black dancers to develop the programming
with them. Their input influenced all aspects of the festival, like the
curation of programs, the selection of dancers and the inclusion of new
works.

For Calvin Royal III of American Ballet Theater, who programmed the
first evening of the festival last weekend, the chance to reimmerse
himself in dance came at just the right moment. A ballet dancer on the
cusp of stardom, he saw several important debuts melt away during the
spring season. Then came the killing of Mr. Floyd and the ugliness it
highlighted.

“The news is so depressing and so negative,” Mr. Royal said. “I wanted
to really show the beauty that’s out there, honoring Black and brown
artists.”

*It’s Tuesday — lift up
artists.*

Dear Diary:

It was the early ’70s, and we were at our favorite Chinatown restaurant.
Our party of five included a former New York City junior high school
teacher, Cathleen McDonnell Pietronuto.

As usual, the restaurant was crowded, and the noise level was getting
out of control.

At some point, Cathy stood up.

“There is entirely too much noise in this room,” she announced in her
classroom-tested voice.

Total silence.

Then a tentative voice piped up from across the dining room.

“Miss McDonnell?”
