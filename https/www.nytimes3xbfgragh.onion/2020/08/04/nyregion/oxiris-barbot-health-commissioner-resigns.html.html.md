The resignation of Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the commissioner since 2018, came

New York City’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, resigned on
Tuesday in protest over her “deep disappointment” with Mayor Bill de
Blasio’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent efforts to
keep it in check.

Her departure came after [escalating
tensions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/nyregion/coronavirus-de-blasio-mitchell-katz.html)
between City Hall and top Health Department officials, which began at
the start of the city’s outbreak in March, burst into public view.

“I leave my post today with deep disappointment that during the most
critical public health crisis in our lifetime, that the Health
Department’s incomparable disease control expertise was not used to the
degree it could have been,” she said in her resignation email sent to
Mr. de Blasio, a copy of which was shared with The New York Times.

“Our experts are world renowned for their epidemiology, surveillance and
response work. The city would be well served by having them at the
strategic center of the response not in the background.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Barbot’s resignation could renew questions about Mr. de Blasio’s
handling of the response to the outbreak, which devastated the city in
the spring, killing more than 20,000 residents, even as it has largely
subsided in recent weeks. And it comes at a pivotal moment: Public
schools are scheduled to partially open next month, which could be
crucial for the city’s recovery, and fears are growing that the outbreak
could surge again when the weather
cools.

The mayor had been faulted by public health experts, including some
within the Health Department, for not moving faster to close down
schools and businesses in March, when New York emerged as an epicenter
of the pandemic.

Public health officials have bristled at the mayor’s decision to strip
the Health Department of its responsibility for contact tracing and
[give it
instead](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/nyregion/coronavirus-contact-tracing-nyc.html)
to the public hospital system, known as Health + Hospitals. The Health
Department has performed such tracing for decades; the public hospitals
have not.

“It had been clear in recent days that it was time for a change,” Mr. de
Blasio said in a hastily called news conference. “We need an atmosphere
of unity. We need an atmosphere of common purpose.”

The mayor moved quickly to replace Dr. Barbot, immediately announcing
the appointment of a new health commissioner, Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, a
former senior leader at Health + Hospitals.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At no point in the statement about Dr. Chokshi’s appointment did the
mayor thank — or even mention — Dr. Barbot, who had served in his
administration since the start of his first term in 2014. Mr. de Blasio
did acknowledge her service during the news
conference.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“It’s a bad day for the city. She’s a very qualified commissioner of
health,” said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, a former deputy mayor of health
under Mr. de Blasio who worked with Dr. Barbot. “There’s another woman
of color that goes down. I think it’s a really regrettable thing.

“This is not a position you can put anybody just because. It’s the
premier public health agency in the country,” Ms. Barrios-Paoli added.
“It’s just a shame that she did not feel that she was supported by the
mayor.”

The turmoil at the top of the city’s health agency emerged in late May
over the mayor’s decision to locate the city’s contact-tracing efforts
within its public hospital system and not in the Health Department.

The decision caused an eruption from former top public health officials
in the city. But Dr. Barbot, a public health expert who had led the
department since 2018, did not publicly raise objections to the move.
After a private meeting with the mayor, she remained in her role.
