Over
Virus}\label{nyc-health-commissioner-resigns-after-clashes-with-mayor-over-virus}}

The resignation of Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the commissioner since 2018, came
after Mayor Bill de Blasio stripped her agency of a key virus tracing
program.

New York City's health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, resigned on
Tuesday in protest over her ``deep disappointment'' with Mayor Bill de
Blasio's handling of the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent efforts to
keep it in check.

Her departure came after
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/nyregion/coronavirus-de-blasio-mitchell-katz.html}{escalating
tensions} between City Hall and top Health Department officials, which
began at the start of the city's outbreak in March, burst into public
view.

``I leave my post today with deep disappointment that during the most
critical public health crisis in our lifetime, that the Health
Department's incomparable disease control expertise was not used to the
degree it could have been,'' she said in her resignation email sent to
Mr. de Blasio, a copy of which was shared with The New York Times.

``Our experts are world renowned for their epidemiology, surveillance
and response work. The city would be well served by having them at the
strategic center of the response not in the background.''

Dr. Barbot's resignation could renew questions about Mr. de Blasio's
handling of the response to the outbreak, which devastated the city in
the spring, killing more than 20,000 residents, even as it has largely
subsided in recent weeks. And it comes at a pivotal moment: Public
schools are scheduled to partially open next month, which could be
crucial for the city's recovery, and fears are growing that the outbreak
could surge again when the weather cools.

The mayor had been faulted by public health experts, including some
within the Health Department, for not moving faster to close down
schools and businesses in March, when New York emerged as an epicenter
of the pandemic.

Public health officials have bristled at the mayor's decision to strip
the Health Department of its responsibility for contact tracing and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/nyregion/coronavirus-contact-tracing-nyc.html}{give
it instead} to the public hospital system, known as Health + Hospitals.
The Health Department has performed such tracing for decades; the public
hospitals have not.

``It had been clear in recent days that it was time for a change,'' Mr.
de Blasio said in a hastily called news conference. ``We need an
atmosphere of unity. We need an atmosphere of common purpose.''

The mayor moved quickly to replace Dr. Barbot, immediately announcing
the appointment of a new health commissioner, Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, a
former senior leader at Health + Hospitals.

At no point in the statement about Dr. Chokshi's appointment did the
mayor thank --- or even mention --- Dr. Barbot, who had served in his
administration since the start of his first term in 2014. Mr. de Blasio
did acknowledge her service during the news conference.

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

``It's a bad day for the city. She's a very qualified commissioner of
health,'' said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, a former deputy mayor of health
under Mr. de Blasio who worked with Dr. Barbot. ``There's another woman
of color that goes down. I think it's a really regrettable thing.

``This is not a position you can put anybody just because. It's the
premier public health agency in the country,'' Ms. Barrios-Paoli added.
``It's just a shame that she did not feel that she was supported by the
mayor.''

The turmoil at the top of the city's health agency emerged in late May
over the mayor's decision to locate the city's contact-tracing efforts
within its public hospital system and not in the Health Department.

The decision caused an eruption from former top public health officials
in the city. But Dr. Barbot, a public health expert who had led the
department since 2018, did not publicly raise objections to the move.
After a private meeting with the mayor, she remained in her role.
