Microsoft has emerged in recent days as the leading suitor for the
fast-growing but embattled social media app TikTok. What the company may
be buying is a big headache.

The tech giant said it would continue negotiating toward a purchase of
the short-video-sharing service amid President Trump’s attempts to ban
from the United States or wrest control of TikTok, which is owned by a
Chinese company. The president’s concerns ostensibly revolve around
security, particularly the threat — real or imagined — that the Chinese
government may gain access to TikTok’s valuable data on American
citizens.

Mr. Trump on Monday [blessed Microsoft’s
pursuit](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html)
of some of TikTok’s assets, including versions of the app that are
available in the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. If
Microsoft or another “very American” company fails to reach a deal to
bring TikTok in the U.S. under local control by Sept. 15, Mr. Trump
said, he will force it to shut down.

TikTok offers a steady stream of user-made videos, featuring everything
from dance moves to cooking tips to piano-playing cats to movie
re-enactments, most clocking in at less than a minute. The app is wildly
popular with teenagers and young adults and is backed by software that
delivers videos to users matching their interests. It’s great fun.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But what would staid old Microsoft, purveyor of Windows and Excel, get
out of this deal? Instant access to a demographic that has largely
bypassed it.

The company would, though, also be taking on all of the hassles and
dangers that come with running a social media service: hate speech,
misinformation, trolling, nudity, copyright infringement. Interspersed
with TikTok’s largely anodyne content are growing [far-right
communities](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/far-right-tiktok-gen-z_n_5cb63040e4b082aab08da0d3),
[white
supremacists](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw74gy/tiktok-neo-nazis-white-supremacy)
and [Covid-19
misinformation](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/tiktok-conspiracy-theories-bill-gates-microchip-vaccine-996394/).

TikTok has said it removed [49 million
videos](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21317832/tiktok-content-violations-videos-removed-49-million-2h2019-transparency-report)
for various reasons in the last half of 2019, compared with about 15
million taken down by its much larger rival YouTube. Like Facebook,
TikTok has formed [an outside
group](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/tiktok-brings-in-outside-experts-to-help-it-craft-moderation-and-content-policies/)
to help police its content.

“Microsoft is buying itself real aggravation,” said Gigi Sohn, a former
Federal Communications Commission senior adviser and a fellow at the
Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy. “There’s no reason
hate speech and misinformation won’t just keep growing.”

Whether or not TikTok funnels personal information to the Chinese
government, its collection of data like locations, internet addresses
and private messages rivals that of Facebook, [The Washington Post has
reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/13/tiktok-privacy/).
India
[banned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/technology/india-china-tiktok.html)
the app over privacy concerns, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has
raised similar concerns. In part to quell that unease, TikTok has hired
an American chief executive and says data is stored only in the United
States and Singapore.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Microsoft so far has declined to comment on its interest in TikTok
beyond [a blog
post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/)
over the weekend assuring users that information collected from TikTok
would be kept in the United States, and data housed elsewhere would be
deleted.

The company would need to do much more than that to protect users.
Though Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have deployed artificial
intelligence software and hired thousands of content moderators to take
down vile or misleading posts, dangerous content inevitably slips
through. Recently, a [video spreading bogus
claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/technology/virus-video-trump.html)
about the value of using hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 racked up
millions of views on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter and was shared by
members of the Trump family before being taken down.

Microsoft has little experience in the tricky and subjective art of
corralling a social media site. It
[bought](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/08/technology/with-linkedin-microsoft-looks-to-avoid-past-acquisition-busts.html)
LinkedIn for about $26 billion in 2016, but that’s a reliably sober
platform. If the company is successful in snapping up TikTok’s U.S.
operations, and its roughly 100 million American users, Microsoft should
immediately beef up TikTok’s policies with a clear, aggressive code of
conduct of its own — and then actually enforce that policy.

If YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are any indication, Microsoft would
have to defend itself against significant criticism from both sides of
the political aisle about unevenly enforced policies. Does the company
have the wherewithal to ramp up content removal or blocking of users
when it might anger a key political or business ally — or a TikTok star?

TikTok users already have demonstrated their might, including
[claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html)
to registering en masse for tickets to President Trump’s Tulsa, Okla.,
rally that they never redeemed.

There are, of course, serious matters of international diplomacy to
consider in this deal. There’s also the concern that, despite vehement
denials by TikTok’s parent, ByteDance, the Chinese government may now or
in the future collect and analyze the reams of data that the app culls
from its roughly 800 million users. In the United States,
[senators](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/07/22/technology/22reuters-usa-tiktok-vote.html),
Mr. Trump’s cabinet and, apparently,
[Amazon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/technology/tiktok-amazon-security-risk.html)
all have developed a mistrust of the service.

“While TikTok isn’t immune to the challenges that all platforms face,
the fact that our users come to express their creative sides immediately
makes TikTok a much more uplifting environment than one might experience
on other platforms,” a company spokeswoman, Jamie Favazza, said in a
statement. Ms. Favazza noted that TikTok forbids posting misleading
information about elections and removes content that violates its
policies, and she reiterated that ByteDance doesn’t share data with the
Chinese government.

Microsoft has a perfectly [profitable
business](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-revenue-surges-thoughazure-cloud-growth-slows-11595449687)
without TikTok, meaning the potential scrutiny must be worth it to score
tech’s most coveted prize: data, data, data. The investment firm Cowen
Group estimated the coveted 18- to 24-year-old demographic averages
nearly an hour a day on TikTok, compared with 44 minutes on Instagram
and 36 minutes on Snapchat. And TikTok could be worth [$200
billion](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/microsoft-tiktok-stock-add-value-billion-deal-wall-street-analyst-2020-8-1029463140#)
to Microsoft in just three years, estimates Wedbush Securities.

Microsoft has
[longed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-microsoft-tweens.html)
to be one of the cool kids of tech. Last week it was left out of a House
antitrust subcommittee hearing where the chief executives of Facebook,
Google, Amazon and Apple were peppered with questions about a host of
issues, including bias, post removals and their ever-shifting policies.
Cool or not, buying TikTok just might get Microsoft into that hot seat.
