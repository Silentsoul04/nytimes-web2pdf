There is a statistician’s rejoinder — sometimes offered as wry
criticism, sometimes as honest advice — that could hardly be a better
motto for our times: “Update your priors\!”

In stats lingo, “priors” are your prior knowledge and beliefs,
inevitably fuzzy and uncertain, before seeing evidence. Evidence prompts
an updating; and then more evidence prompts further updating, so forth
and so on. This iterative process hones greater certainty and generates
a coherent accumulation of knowledge.

In the early pandemic era, for instance, airborne transmission of
Covid-19 was not considered likely, but in early July the World Health
Organization, with mounting scientific evidence,
[conceded](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/opinion/coronavirus-aerosols.html?surface=most-popular&fellback=false&req_id=877412152&algo=top_conversion&imp_id=115726583&action=click&module=Most%20Popular&pgtype=Homepage)
that it is a factor, especially indoors. The W.H.O. updated its priors,
and changed its advice.

This is the heart of Bayesian analysis, named after Thomas Bayes, an
18th-century Presbyterian minister who did math on the side. It captures
uncertainty in terms of probability: Bayes’s theorem, or rule, is a
device for rationally updating your prior beliefs and uncertainties
based on observed evidence.

Reverend Bayes set out his ideas in “An Essay Toward Solving a Problem
in the Doctrine of Chances,” published posthumously in 1763; it was
refined by the preacher and mathematician Richard Price and included
[Bayes’s
theorem](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?searchResultPosition=7).
A couple of centuries later, Bayesian frameworks and methods, powered by
computation, are at the heart of various models in epidemiology and
other scientific fields

As Marc Lipsitch, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard,
[noted on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/mlipsitch/status/1257858402186940421),
Bayesian reasoning comes awfully close to his working definition of
rationality. “As we learn more, our
[beliefs](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1276742731948158976)
should change,” Dr. Lipsitch said in an interview. “One extreme is to
decide what you think and be impervious to new information. Another
extreme is to over-privilege the last thing you learned. In rough terms,
Bayesian reasoning is a principled way to integrate what you previously
thought with what you have learned and come to a conclusion that
incorporates them both, giving them appropriate weights.”

With a new disease like Covid-19 and all the uncertainties it brings,
there is intense interest in nailing down the parameters for models:
What is the basic reproduction number, the rate at which new cases
arise? How deadly is it? What is the infection fatality rate, the
proportion of people with the virus that it kills?

But there is little point in trying to establish fixed numbers, said
Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University
of Florida.

“We should be less focused on finding the single ‘truth’ and more
focused on establishing a reasonable range, recognizing that the true
value may vary across populations,” Dr. Dean said. “Bayesian analyses
allow us to include this variability in a clear way, and then propagate
this uncertainty through the model.”

A textbook application of Bayes theorem is serology testing for
Covid-19, which looks for the presence of antibodies to the virus. All
tests are imperfect, and the accuracy of an antibody test turns on many
factors including,
[critically](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coronavirus-antibody-tests-have-a-mathematical-pitfall/),
the rarity or prevalence of the
disease.

The first SARS-CoV-2 antibody body test approved by the F.D.A., in
April, seemed to be wrong as often as it was right. With Bayes theorem,
you can calculate what you really want to know: the probability that the
test result is correct. As one
[commenter](https://twitter.com/Riderius/status/1246172832071135236) on
Twitter put it: “Understanding Bayes’ theorem is a matter of life and
death right now.”

## The logic of uncertainty

Joseph Blitzstein, a statistician at Harvard, delves into the utility of
Bayesian analysis in his popular course “[Statistics 110:
Probability](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo).”
For a primer, in lecture one, he says: “Math is the logic of certainty,
and statistics is the logic of uncertainty. Everyone has uncertainty. If
you have 100 percent certainty about everything, there is something
wrong with you.”

By the end of lecture four, he arrives at Bayes’s theorem — his favorite
theorem because it is mathematically simple yet conceptually powerful.

“Literally, the proof is just one line of algebra,” Dr. Blitzstein said.
The theorem essentially reduces to a fraction; it expresses the
probability P of some event A happening given the occurrence of another
event
B.

“Naïvely, you would think, How much could you get from that?” Dr.
Blitzstein said. “It turns out to have incredibly deep consequences and
to be applicable to just about every field of inquiry” — from finance
and genetics to political science and historical studies. The Bayesian
approach is applied in [analyzing racial disparities in
policing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0858-1) (in the
assessment of officer decisions to search drivers during a traffic stop)
and [search-and-rescue
operations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/09/30/science/the-odds-continually-updated.html)
(the search area narrows as new data is added). Cognitive scientists
ask, ‘Is the brain Bayesian?’ Philosophers of science posit that science
as a whole is a Bayesian process — as is common sense.

Take diagnostic testing. In this scenario, the setup of Bayes’s theorem
might use events labeled “T” for a positive test result — and “C” for
the presence of Covid-19
antibodies:

Now suppose the prevalence of cases is 10 percent (that was so in [New
York City in the
spring](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42665370/Kissler_etal_NYC_mobility.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)),
and you have a positive result from a test with accuracy of 87.5 percent
sensitivity and 97.5 percent specificity. Running numbers through the
Bayesian gears, the probability that the result is correct, and that you
do indeed have antibodies is 79.5%. Decent odds, [all things
considered](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/health/coronvirus-antibody-tests.html?searchResultPosition=1).
If you want more certainty, get a second opinion. And continue to be
cautious.

An international [collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13847) of
researchers, doctors and developers created another Bayesian strategy,
pairing the test result with a
[questionnaire](http://homecovidtests.org) to produce a better estimate
of whether the result might be a false negative or a false positive. The
tool, which has won two hackathons, collects contextual information: Did
you go to work during lockdown? What did you do to avoid catching
Covid-19? Has anyone in your household had Covid-19?

“It’s a little akin to having two ‘medical experts,’” said Claire
Donnat, who recently finished her Ph.D. in statistics at Stanford and
was part of the team. One expert has access to the patient’s symptoms
and background, the other to the test; the two diagnoses are combined to
produce a more precise score, and more reliable immunity estimates. The
priors are updated with an aggregation of information.

“As new information comes in, we update our priors all the time,” said
Susan Holmes, a Stanford statistician, via unstable internet from rural
Portugal, where she unexpectedly pandemicked for 105 days, while
visiting her
mother.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

That was the base from which Dr. Holmes refined a [preprint
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05272), co-authored with Dr. Donnat,
that provides another example of Bayesian analysis, broadly speaking.
Observing early research in March about how the pandemic might evolve,
they noticed that classic epidemiological models tend to use fixed
parameters, or constants, for the reproduction number — for instance,
with an R0 of 2.0.

But in reality, the reproduction number depends on random, uncertain
factors: viral loads and susceptibility, behavior and social networks,
culture and socioeconomic class, weather, air conditioning and unknowns.

With a Bayesian perspective, the uncertainty is encoded into randomness.
The researchers began by supposing that the reproductive number had
various distributions (the priors). Then they modeled the uncertainty
using a random variable that fluctuates, taking on a range of values as
small as 0.6 and as large as 2.2 or 3.5. In something of a nesting
process, the random variable itself has parameters that fluctuate
randomly; and those parameters, too, have random parameters
(hyper-parameters), etcetera. The effects accumulate into a “Bayesian
hierarchy” — “turtles all the way down,” Dr. Holmes said.

The effects of all these up-and-down random fluctuations multiply, like
compound interest. As a result, the study found that using random
variables for reproductive numbers more realistically predicts the risky
tail events, the rarer but [more significant superspreader
events](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/science/how-coronavirus-spreads.html).

Humans on their own, however, without a Bayesian model for a compass,
are [notoriously bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) at
fathoming individual
[risk](https://twitter.com/xkcdComic/status/1283437923421937666/photo/1).

“People, including very young children, can and do use Bayesian
inference unconsciously,” said Alison Gopnik, a psychologist at the
University of California, Berkeley. “But they need direct evidence about
the frequency of events to do so.”

Much of the information that guides our behavior in the context of
Covid-19 is probabilistic. For example, by [some
estimates](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2), if you
get infected with the coronavirus, there is a 1 percent chance you will
die; but in reality an individual’s odds can vary by a
[thousandfold](https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196)
or more, depending on age and other factors. “For something like an
illness, most of the evidence is usually indirect, and people are very
bad at dealing with explicit probabilistic information,” Dr. Gopnik
said.

## Modeling humility

Even with evidence, revising beliefs isn’t easy. The scientific
community struggled to update its priors about the asymptomatic
transmission of Covid-19, even when evidence emerged that it is a factor
and that masks are a helpful preventive measure. This arguably
contributed to the [world’s sluggish response to the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/27/world/europe/coronavirus-spread-asymptomatic.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article).

“The problems come when we don’t update,” said David Spiegelhalter, a
statistician and chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence
Communication at the University of Cambridge. “You can interpret
confirmation bias, and so many of the ways in which we react badly, by
being too slow to revise our beliefs.”

There are techniques that compensate for Bayesian shortcomings. Dr.
Spiegelhalter is fond of an approach called [Cromwell’s
law](https://understandinguncertainty.org/node/97). “It’s heaven,” he
said. In 1650, Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of
England, wrote in a letter to the Church of Scotland: “I beseech you, in
the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.”

In the Bayesian world, Cromwell’s law means you should always “keep a
bit back — with a little bit of probability, a little tiny bit — for the
fact that you may be wrong, ”Dr. Spiegelhalter said. “Then if new
evidence comes along that totally contradicts your main prior belief,
you can quickly ditch what you thought before and lurch over to that new
way of thinking.”

“In other words, keep an open mind,” said Dr. Spiegelhalter. “That’s a
very powerful idea. And it doesn’t necessarily have to be done
technically or formally; it can just be in the back of your mind as an
idea. Call it ‘modeling humility.’ You may be wrong.”
