# Clickety Clack, Press-On Nails Are Back

</div>

The onetime ’80s mass-market cheapie has gotten an artisanal upgrade —
just in time for quarantine home manicures.

Yewande Moore used to get an acrylic overlay with a gel-polish manicure
every couple of weeks before coronavirus hit. But when Ohio, where she
lives in Athens, shut down salons, she went to Walmart to get tools to
take her nails off, not knowing when she could get them done again.

There, taking a look at the press-on nails in the beauty aisle, Ms.
Moore, 32, who works with student leaders at a nearby university, had an
idea.

“I love doing my nails so much,” she said. “I’m going to offer it to
other people.”

Ms. Moore took her stimulus check and invested in supplies to start a
press-on nail business. After painting some sets and building a website,
she introduced [Nail Candy](https://nailcandypressons.squarespace.com/)
to the world on June 2 and said she has sold about 125 nail sets. While
some customers seem to be pros at putting on press-ons, she gets plenty
of questions about how to put them on correctly.

“There are a lot of people trying it for the first time who probably
never would have tried it before,” she said.

Along with other nonessential businesses, nail salons closed across the
country when the first stay-at-home orders came down in March. It left
nail salon workers out of work and people that are used to having their
nails done without access to a cherished grooming ritual.

Press-on nails last had a big moment in the clickety-clack-typewriter
1980s, with ads from a brand called Lee (“easy on, easy off”).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, more salons, independent creators and customers are selling
press-on nails as a way to still have nice-looking manicures in the era
of social distancing. The nails can cost as little as $8 from a retailer
to at least $160 for a customized set with [Frida Kahlo-inspired
art](https://www.etsy.com/listing/788328318/unique-frida-kahlo-inspired-nails-luxury?ref=shop_home_active_1&frs=1).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s usually cheaper than a salon, where a set of acrylics, as they’re
known there, can cost from $60 to more than $200 for custom art, and
that doesn’t include a tip. Press-ons may fall off more than acrylics
put on in a salon, but kits usually send enough glue to reattach any
errant nail.

Even as states open back up, safety is still a concern for some
costumers. Charlotte Brubeck, a laid-off restaurant worker in Boynton
Beach, Fla., was getting her nails done regularly in a salon, with
press-ons something she’d do for specific outfits on occasions like
Halloween.

Ms. Brubeck, 26, turned to press-ons while the salons were closed but
doesn’t plan to go back, even though her local spot has been open for a
few weeks. Despite the fact that press-ons aren’t as durable as her
normal style, she said it’s worth it.

“I spend about $7 to $8 on a box of press-ons versus $35-plus on a fresh
manicure, and I don’t have to leave my house,” Ms. Brubeck said. “During
a health pandemic when most people are out of work and need to stay
home, that to me is all the info you need to see how much better
press-ons are than a salon manicure.”

Vanity Projects, which has salons in New York and Miami, hadn’t sold
press-ons before the pandemic until its owner Rita Pinto started paying
her workers to paint sets in May. The salons advertised them on
Instagram and has sold 200 sets, also called tips, which Ms. Pinto, 45,
said has helped keep the company in business.

“The tips have been a saving grace,” she said.

During previous periods of economic uncertainty, the beauty sector has
historically seen an increase in sales of small luxury purchases in what
was named by Leonard Lauder the “lipstick effect.” These little
indulgences can make people feel better without blowing a budget.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This crisis is different than past recessions, however, with people
quarantining and with fewer occasions to dress up. It has left salons
scrambling for ideas.

“We aren’t pandemic-proof, but we are recession-proof,” Ms. Pinto
said.

Fortunately, press-on nails have gotten nicer in the last decade, with
most sets lasting two to three weeks and coming in different shapes and
lengths. Before the pandemic, [Jennifer
Lopez](https://www.instyle.com/beauty/nails/best-press-on-nails-tips-jennifer-lopez-manicurist)
and [Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.allure.com/story/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-impress-press-on-manicure-amtrak)
had worn press-ons, with [Ariana
Grande](https://www.allure.com/story/ariana-grande-milky-press-on-nails)
and
[Chrissy](https://www.allure.com/story/chrissy-teigen-press-on-nails-at-home)Teigen
joining them over the last few months. Influencers are also getting
attached, with Whitney Simmons, a YouTube fitness influencer, singing
press-ons’ praises.

“I am a full-blown convert to press-on nails, I never saw this day
coming,” Ms. Simmons says in a
YouTube[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h61TWqyD4s) posted in
June. “My nail salon opened back up on May 1, and I have not gone back.”

But customers new to doing their nails need to be wary and listen to
what professionals say when it comes to putting fake nails on and taking
them off, according to Morgan Dixon, who owns the M.A.D. nail salon in
New Orleans. Ms. Dixon is also the lead manicurist for the television
show “Claws,” a TNT comedy-drama series set in a nail salon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A natural nail can be damaged if a press-on is put on top of a gel
manicure, or if ripped off without the right process.

“Just like any other beauty product,” Ms. Dixon, 29, said. “You want to
make sure you aren’t doing anything harmful to yourself.”

She predicted that the at-home press-on passion will likely continue
after the pandemic now that people have seen the possibilities and lower
prices. Still, she doesn’t see the in-person experience going away
forever.

“I honestly love that I can sit down with someone where you can feel
like you’re getting a therapy session too,” Ms. Dixon said. “You’re
paying for more than just throwing nails on.”
