\subsection{Ambulance Songs}\label{ambulance-songs}}

I can't help but notice the increasing frequency of Isabella singing
``Wee-woo, wee-woo!'' It took me a moment to realize that my
19-month-old was imitating the sounds of ambulances as they passed.
We've become accustomed to them screaming down the streets toward Tucson
Medical Center. Isabella now sings the ambulance song four, five, six
times a day. Spinning with both arms raised, she projects unmitigated
toddler joy at those loud, flashy boxes that roll by day and night.
Every unlucky person transported past our home gets an ambulance song
dedicated to them. I hope it helps. --- \emph{Amber Gates}

\subsection{Learning From Each Other}\label{learning-from-each-other}}

We met on a St. Patrick's Day blind date. I partied, got drunk and
passed out on our friend's couch. He thought I was beautiful. We married
six months later. He is the grandson of a Klansman. His parents disowned
him because I am Black; my parents accepted him. We had two sons. I
almost left him three times. He was often an impatient, temperamental
know-it-all. I was often too passive, insecure and private. Over 40
years, I taught him to quiet his temper and listen to others. He taught
me to speak up and be stronger. We are committed. --- \emph{Jacquelyn
Jobe}

\subsection{The Only Person Who Could
Help}\label{the-only-person-who-could-help}}

When I was 14 and my first boyfriend and I broke up, my little sister
was the only person who could get me to leave my room. She led me
downstairs, where she had spelled ``I love you'' with cards on the
floor. Eyes red and puffy, I smiled for the first time all day. Nine
years later, when she was 15, her first boyfriend broke up with her. I
did the only thing I could to help. I wrote ``I love you'' in playing
cards at the bottom of the stairs. Eyes red and puffy, she smiled. ---

\subsection{The Tree}\label{the-tree}}

My mother died at almost 95, and I needed to walk to the tree. That's
what my son would say after we planted a Texas redbud in Riverside Park
18 years ago. His father had died two years before, when my son was 4.
Many times since we have held onto a branch and cried or stayed quiet. I
talked to the tree when my son wouldn't talk to me. I walked to the tree
today and it was gone. My soul ached. Disease? Storm? I wanted to ask
the tree. Without answers, we will plant another. --- \emph{Patty Dann}
