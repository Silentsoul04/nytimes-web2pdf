*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up

receive it weekdays.*

What if the U.S. government tries to restrain the power of America’s
tech superstars, and it doesn’t work?

That’s essentially what has happened so far in Europe, where some
regulators and lawmakers have been ahead of the United States in putting
guardrails on Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.

I talked with my colleague [Adam
Satariano](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/adam-satariano), who
writes about technology in Europe, about what happens when government
officials decide they want to do *something* about Big Tech, but
struggle to figure out what that something should be.

**Shira: What’s been Europe’s approach to the American tech
superpowers?**

**Adam:** Europe started doing antitrust investigations several years
ago. But the resulting lawsuits and regulation haven’t done much.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Google is the best example. Investigations into allegations of
anti-competitive tactics took years. The European Union then
[fined](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/18/technology/google-eu-android-fine.html)
Google
[several](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html)
billion
[dollars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/20/business/google-fine-advertising.html)
for breaking the law. But critics say that Google wasn’t forced to
change much, so this [did little to restore
competition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/11/business/europe-technology-antitrust-regulation.html).

**What can American lawmakers and regulators learn from Europe’s
mistakes?**

Speed is crucial, otherwise regulators are fighting yesterday’s battles.

There was also a problem with enforcement. Europe passed a highly-touted
privacy law called General Data Protection Regulation, but it’s been [a
flop at limiting data
collection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/technology/GDPR-privacy-law-europe.html)
by the biggest tech companies. Much of the policing of the law was left
to Ireland, which simply doesn’t have the resources to keep up.

**It sounds as if the lesson is that you can believe there’s a problem
with tech companies’ power, but it’s hard to craft an appropriate
response.**

Without a doubt. The authorities in Europe are [changing their tactics
now](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/technology/europe-new-phase-tech-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html).
They’re looking at rewriting laws to directly target the way big tech
companies do business: How they use data or box out rivals, and ways
they give their products preferential treatment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But after a few years covering this in Europe, I have become much more
suspect about these efforts at regulation. There’s a lot of potential
for unintended consequences.

**What have been the unintended consequences?**

A big one is the ripple effects of several countries, especially
Germany, making new rules against hate speech online. The worry is that
[gave cover to countries to enact censorship
laws](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/06/technology/europe-tech-censorship.html).
Turkey cited Germany’s hate speech law in enacting its new social media
restrictions. Another law, [known as the right to be
forgotten](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/23/technology/right-to-be-forgotten-law-europe.html),
has also raised concerns about limiting the availability of information
online.

**Does this mean we should be skeptical about any U.S. government action
against Big Tech?**

Maybe. But it’s still been interesting to watch this growing realization
among the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic about the size of
these companies and the influence they hold over their democratic
societies and how they operate, including their communication systems,
information flow and commerce.

You can sense this feeling that lawmakers think they must do something,
but aren’t quite sure what that is yet. The next 12 to 18 months are
going to be extraordinary.

*Hello, dear readers\! Several of you had asked about differences in how
the United States and Europe handle regulation of technology. This
conversation gets the ball rolling on that subject. Please keep the

## Twitter’s blunder is a symptom of our broken internet

Twitter is in hot water with the U.S. government. Let me explain why you
should be angry.

The Federal Trade Commission is [investigating
Twitter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/ftc-twitter-privacy-violations.html)
and may fine the company up to $250 million for using people’s phone
numbers in ways that users didn’t expect, my colleague Kate Conger
wrote.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This stems from Twitter’s
[disclosure](https://help.twitter.com/en/information-and-ads) in October
that the phone number you might have listed as a [second form of account
verification](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/08/technology/personaltech/protecting-your-accounts-by-text-or-app.html)
— in addition to a password — might also have been used to target
advertisements at you. This is not good.

Phone numbers used for security purposes shouldn’t be repurposed for
Twitter to make money. Twitter said this was a mistake, but it hasn’t
said how long this practice had gone on or how it made this error.
(Facebook had [gotten in trouble for the same
thing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/23/facebook-deceived-users-about-way-it-used-phone-numbers-facial-recognition-ftc-allege-complaint/).)

There are two interrelated problems revealed by what might seem like
Twitter’s minor flub.

First is the problem of companies ignoring common sense. People who
enter a phone number to keep impostors out of their Twitter accounts do
not expect that number to be used to target ads. Period. Therefore,
companies should absolutely not do this.

Two, Twitter’s mistake is a symptom of the broader scourge of online
surveillance. Internet advertising [is an arms race waged with our
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/technology/just-collect-less-data-period.html),
and that leads to ever more intrusive harvesting and use of our
information.

This is not only a concern for tin-foil-hat privacy paranoiacs.
Companies like Facebook and Google have a big leg up over all other
companies that sell digital ads because they have more and better data
than anyone else. Every other company is tempted to play catch up by
resorting to increasingly creepy ways of collecting user data.

That might include Twitter, or apps we’ve never heard of [that gather
our location information and sell it without our knowledge to other
data-hungry
companies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html).
All the tech problems are connected.

## Before we go …

  - **I suspect people will have** ***feelings*** **about this:** Stacey
    Steinberg, a children’s rights lawyer and photographer, says that
    parents sharing information, including photos, about their children
    online may unwittingly be providing fodder for bullying or child
    abuse. These risks have [made her think twice before she shares
    information](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/well/family/parents-social-media-privacy.html)
    about her kids on social media.

  - **Maybe this newsletter should just be memes?** On Instagram and
    other apps, news organizations and activists have captivated
    audiences’ attention by posting less text and more charts, graphics
    and other [easy-to-digest ways to convey news and
    information](https://www.axios.com/instagram-information-coronavirus-george-floyd-706d1ad3-9d6d-48d4-b085-3469a0d93b56.html),
    according to Axios. This is a pattern that younger people latched
    onto a long time ago: Quick-scan visuals like memes are [a great way
    to explain complicated
    things](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/24/style/finance-memes.html).

  - **The online forum that traces the internet’s past five years:**
    Wired has a [fascinating
    look](https://www.wired.com/story/the-hate-fueled-rise-of-rthe-donald-and-its-epic-takedown/)
    at a Reddit group about President Trump that became one of the most
    popular and divisive gatherings online. The article tells how this
    group’s story encapsulated the evolution of internet forums in
    molding or policing people’s personal interactions and beliefs.
