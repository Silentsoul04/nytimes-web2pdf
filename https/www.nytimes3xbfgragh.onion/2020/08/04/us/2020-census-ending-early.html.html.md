# With Census Count Finishing Early, Fears of a Skewed Tally Rise

With 60 million households still uncounted, the bureau said it would
wrap up the survey a month early. Critics called it a bald move to
politicize the count in favor of Republicans.

WASHINGTON — With the Trump administration’s decision to end the 2020
census count four weeks early, the Census Bureau now has to accomplish
what officials have said it cannot do: accurately count the nation’s
hardest-to-reach residents — nearly four of every 10 households — in
just six weeks.

The result is both a logistical challenge of enormous proportions that
must take place in the middle of a pandemic, and yet another political
crisis for the census, historically a nonpartisan enterprise. The
announcement, which came Monday evening, immediately generated sharp
criticism.

On Tuesday, four former directors of the Census Bureau issued a
statement warning that an earlier deadline would “result in seriously
incomplete enumerations in many areas across our country,” and urged the
administration to restore the lost weeks. The directors, who served
under Democratic and Republican presidents, also urged Congress to
assemble a trusted body of experts to develop standards for assessing
the quality of the bureau’s population totals.

[A similar plea was
issued](https://sdcclearinghouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/2020-census-timeline-july-2020.pdf)
on Tuesday by an official network of agencies and nonprofit institutions
that act as liaisons between the Census Bureau and state governments,
helping them use population data to make policies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The credibility of the U.S. Census Bureau as the gold standard of data
in the United States will be undermined by rushing an incomplete census
count to meet deadlines,” a letter from the group stated.

The Census Bureau, which had earlier set and planned on an April 2021
deadline because of the coronavirus pandemic, said the change was needed
to meet a federal deadline to get the numbers to President Trump by the
end of the year. But Democratic lawmakers said the change reflected a
deliberate attempt to undercount groups that tend to support their
party.

Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the House
majority leader, said on Tuesday that the change was an attempt to
undercount poor communities with large numbers of immigrants and ethnic
minorities and called the shortened schedule “yet another example of
this administration’s blatant assault on our Constitution and our
democracy.”

Federal law requires the Census Bureau to send population totals to the
president by Dec. 31 of every census year. But the pandemic forced
census officials in April to rewrite that timeline, pushing delivery of
population totals to April 2021. The House approved the new deadline in
May, but the Republican-controlled Senate has not followed suit,
apparently at Mr. Trump’s behest.

The Constitution requires a count of all residents, but Mr. Trump has
long made clear his desire to have population counts of citizens, not
all residents. The president ordered the Census Bureau last month to
produce a state-by-state count of undocumented immigrants so he could
remove undocumented residents from census totals before he sends them to
Congress for use in reapportioning the House. Several lawsuits have
argued that would be unconstitutional.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

An end-of-year delivery of population figures could provide a different
avenue for Mr. Trump to remove undocumented immigrants — by not counting
them in the first place. And delaying the totals until next year, as had
been planned, would open the possibility that the totals would go to a
new president and
Congress.

Mr. Trump had tried earlier to achieve a similar objective by adding a
question on citizenship to the census, but the Supreme Court rejected
that effort last year after an extended legal battle.

Some of his most ardent Republican backers have supported his efforts
aimed at not counting undocumented immigrants.

“Instead of working with Republicans to conduct credible oversight of
2020 census operations to ensure that all Americans are counted,
Democrats are instead choosing to recklessly reduce census participation
by resorting to lies and scare tactics,” Representative James R. Comer
of Kentucky, a Republican who is the ranking member on the Oversight
Committee, said in a recent statement.

But the campaign has [placed some Republicans in a
bind](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-s-census-memo-puts-some-republicans-in-catch-22/ar-BB17gKkQ)
of sorts, since not counting undocumented immigrants in major Republican
states like Texas and Florida probably would cause them to lose seats in
the House in the next reapportionment.

“It’s sort of a Catch-22 because it would hurt Florida” to the extent
that the state has undocumented immigrants, Senator Marco Rubio,
Republican of Florida, said last week in an interview with MSNBC. “But
at the same time, it dilutes the representation of people that are here
legally and eligible to vote.”

The decision to shorten the counting schedule is a U-turn from the
bureau’s statement months ago that the pandemic [had made it
necessary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/us/census-coronavirus-delay.html?searchResultPosition=12)
to ask for more time to complete the count. And census experts have said
that shortening the time frame would wreak havoc with efforts to reach
the very hardest-to-count households that have long been flagged as most
likely to be missed in this year’s tally.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is a whole systemic attack on the census for political gain,”
Julie Menin, the census director for New York City, said. “There’s an
intentional attempt here to basically steal the census — to politicize
this census to gain Republican seats across the country.”

So far this year, nearly 63 percent of households have voluntarily
completed census surveys, either online, by mail or by telephone. Exact
comparisons to the 2010 census are not possible because this year’s
response deadline has not passed, but during that census the [peak
response rate was slightly higher, at 66.5
percent](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/31/stacey-abrams/fact-checking-stacey-abrams-comparison-census-resp/).
In part because of population growth, however, the bureau this year has
a considerably larger number of households to track down and count — 60
million, compared with 47 million in 2010.

The schedule change announced on Monday primarily affects the count of
those 60 million households, but it also compresses the time left for
tallying other groups, including homeless people and residents of
nursing homes and dormitories.

All of those counts normally would be completed this month, and some
well before that, but the bureau said in April that it was giving itself
until Oct. 31 to complete the count.

The latest [schedule
change](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/trump-census.html)
will move that deadline up by one month, to Sept. 30. The effect is to
shorten to six weeks what had been a 10-week period reserved for
completing the count, so that the data can be compiled and processed in
time to deliver population totals by year’s end.

In recent months, however, some senior census officials have been clear
that they believe that timeline is not feasible.

“We can’t do that anymore,” the census official leading field operations
for the count, Tim Olson, [told a Native American
organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6IyJMtDDgY&feature=youtu.be&t=4688)
during a webinar in May. The associate director of the census, Albert E.
Fontenot Jr., echoed that last month, saying “we are past the window of
being able to get those counts” by year’s end.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some state and local officials in areas with diverse, hard-to-count
populations reacted with dismay.

“Oh God,” said Shameka S. Reynolds, the mayor of Lithonia, Ga. “Covid-19
is on the rise in our county, and it was already hard, to be honest with
you, in previous years. It was hard trying to get people to get their
mailings in and do
it.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

Ms. Reynolds, who became mayor of the small, majority-Black suburban
city this year, said about 44 percent of residents had responded to the
census. “Now we no longer have until October, so it’s shrinking the
time, and it’s kind of messing me up,” she said. “Now we’ve got to get
creative.”

Lithonia is in DeKalb County, a sprawling expanse of 760,000 people east
of Atlanta that is typical of the places that are hardest to get an
accurate population count. The local chamber of commerce [says it is the
most ethnically diverse county in the
Southeast](https://www.dekalbchamber.org/why-dekalb/), with at least 64
languages spoken.

The stakes are tremendous: The county’s chief executive, Michael
Thurmond, has estimated that with a full count, DeKalb County could
receive $1.8 billion per year in federal funding over the next 10 years.
A serious undercount could leave billions of dollars on the table for
public safety, public health, immunizations, Head Start programs, summer
jobs programs and more.

“It’s just disheartening,” Larry Johnson, a DeKalb County commissioner,
said on Tuesday. All three officials are Democrats.

The Census Bureau said in its announcement that it planned to mount “a
robust field data collection operation” to meet the new deadline, and
that it would be able to complete the 2020 census in a short time
“without sacrificing completeness.” Beyond saying it would hire more
people and give its army of door-knockers awards for extra work, it has
offered few details of how it plans to meet the new goal.

But outside experts, including directors of past censuses, have said the
bureau would be forced to use statistical techniques and notoriously
inaccurate administrative records to make educated guesses about who
lived where, especially in low-income areas.

Serious inaccuracies would not only affect numbers used to reapportion
and redraw political districts, but also would skew the baseline that
will be used to allot trillions of dollars in federal grants and other
aid to the states until the next census in 2030.

Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, the Democratic chairwoman
of the House Oversight Committee that has jurisdiction over the census,
said in [a letter sent
Tuesday](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2020-08-04.CBM%20to%20Dillingham%20re%20Transcribed%20Interviews.pdf)
to Steven Dillingham, the Census Bureau director, that she would summon
career Census Bureau experts to testify about the impact of the change.

The controversy comes atop a series of political struggles over the
census.

Less than a month after Mr. Trump was sworn in, Commerce Secretary
Wilbur L. Ross Jr. began exploring the addition of a question on
citizenship to the 2020 survey, an action that both outside critics and
the bureau’s own experts warned would deter noncitizens and immigrants
from responding. A court battle over the issue raged for two years
before the Supreme Court invalidated the question last summer, calling
its addition a pretext for some other unstated goal. The furor over Mr.
Trump’s order not to count undocumented immigrants played out last
month.

In July, the Trump administration also added two political appointees to
Census Bureau positions just one level beneath that of the director, Mr.
Dillingham, a huge departure for the bureau.

Outside experts who deal regularly with the Census Bureau say its
operations have become progressively more opaque in recent months.
Within the last day, the bureau removed from [its main 2020 census
website](https://2020census.gov) a link that directed outsiders to a
sheaf of documents detailing its plans for the head count, although [the
same
link](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/2020-operations.html?#)
remains on a less prominent page [explaining the bureau’s response to
the
pandemic.](https://2020census.gov/en/news-events/operational-adjustments-covid-19.html)

In the end, the success of the census will depend on millions of
connections, made or missed. Less time will not help make them.

Roger Alexander, 32, a resident of Marietta, Ga., was in downtown
Lithonia on Tuesday finishing up work on a hip-hop-themed video
encouraging people to register and vote. Mr. Alexander said he had heard
that the decennial count was being taken: “I feel like I’ve seen
something about the census trying to get it together,” he said.

Mr. Alexander had not filled out a form yet but said that he would
eventually do so — “if it is something convenient for me to do.”

Michael Wines reported from Washington, and Richard Fausset from
Lithonia, Ga.
