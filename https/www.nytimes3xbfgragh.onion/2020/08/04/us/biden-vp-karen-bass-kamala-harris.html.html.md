*Good morning.*

Joseph R. Biden Jr. is[expected to finally announce his running
mate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/joseph-biden-vice-president.html)
— well, if not this week, then
[soon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html?).

And while one woman who represents California in Congress has shot to
the top of the list, it may not be the one you thought.

**Representative Karen Bass**, [a respected
consensus-builder](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/politics/karen-bass.html)
who made history as the first Black woman in the country[to serve as the
speaker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-karen-bass-fought-for-blacks-and-latinos-in-south-los-angeles-now-shes-on-bidens-vp-shortlist/2020/07/31/6d224a58-d1d3-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories-2_vpkarenbass-1135am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans)
of a state legislature, has become a leading contender amid what[my
colleagues
reported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/joseph-biden-vice-president.html)
has been intense jockeying.

As my colleagues have written, [Ms.
Bass’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/politics/karen-bass-vice-president-biden.html)
credentials as an advocate for social justice and racial equity run
deep: Her political career is rooted in her work as a community
organizer in South Los Angeles during the 1990s, when the crack cocaine
epidemic was ravaging the community and when rage against racist
policing bubbled over in the Rodney King uprisings.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Bass also explicitly worked to bring together Black and Latino
community members, as Jose A. Del Real[reported for The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-karen-bass-fought-for-blacks-and-latinos-in-south-los-angeles-now-shes-on-bidens-vp-shortlist/2020/07/31/6d224a58-d1d3-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories-2_vpkarenbass-1135am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans).

Today, she’s a five-term congresswoman and[chair of the Congressional
Black Caucus](https://cbc.house.gov/about/about-the-chair.htm) who is
close with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

But **Senator Kamala Harris** is by no means out of the picture. You may
recall she [also ran for
president](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/us/kamala-harris-drops-out.html),
and she still has many of the things going for her that [made her a
major candidate for the Oval
Office](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/kamala-harris.html):
a barrier-breaking political career in which she has won multiple
statewide races; sharp speaking skills, which she said she’d use to
“prosecute the case” against President Trump; and name recognition
both within and outside California.

Still, some observers have said Ms. Harris might be too focused on her
own presidential aspirations to make for a
second-in-command.

Although, as my colleague [Lisa Lerer
wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/joe-biden-vp.html),
it’s best not to get too caught up in the chatter.

**So, how does this all affect California?**

Ms. Bass and Ms. Harris are not the only competitors, of course; the
Biden campaign is orchestrating an unusually public “veepstakes,” in
which [all the
contenders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html?)
are established public servants who would represent subtly different
visions of the Democratic Party, said Raphael Sonenshein, the executive
director of the [Pat Brown Institute for Public
Affairs](https://calstatela.patbrowninstitute.org/) at Cal State Los
Angeles.

And Mr. Biden’s announcement [during the
primaries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/us/politics/joe-biden-vp-running-mate.html)
that he’d choose a woman for the job has helped head off less
substantive discussion about [a woman’s
electability](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/us/warren-presidential-race-2020.html)
and instead focused it on which woman would be most likely to help Mr.
Biden beat the president. That, Mr. Sonenshein told me, is the biggest
priority for many California Democrats.

Still, he said, it’s notable — nay, “exciting” — to have two
Californians at the top of the list.

“What’s interesting is, historically, California has not been a site for
Democrats to get on the national ticket,” he said.

Despite Democrats’ current dominance within the nation’s most populous
state, when it comes to national elections, California has been a more
powerful springboard for Republican politicians — think Ronald Reagan
and Richard Nixon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, Mr. Sonenshein said, no matter how the veepstakes shakes out, “a
number of California politicians are going to get called to Washington —
it’s probably long overdue.”

Ms. Harris and Ms. Bass, he said, represent parts of the Democratic base
that haven’t gotten the attention they deserve: women in general, Black
women in particular — and Californians.

“You could make a case for both of them,” he said. “Bass has a
reputation as a first-class legislator and Harris is a strong
litigator.”

Mr. Sonenshein said he got out of the predictions business after 2016
(seems wise), but one thing is certain: If either Californian is tapped
to join a Biden administration, it’ll set off a reshuffling of
Democratic power in the Golden State.

If Ms. Harris leaves her Senate post, he said, “You’re going to see a
game of musical chairs like you’ve never seen
before.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered encouraging news for residents
who [have been
whipsawed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/california-covid-19-cases.html)
by moves to push ahead with a patchwork reopening process and surging
case numbers.

The state’s average number of new cases each day over the past week had
decreased, as had intensive care admissions. The state’s average
positivity rate over the past two weeks decreased to 7 percent.

*\[Track virus case trends in* [*every California
county*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html)*.\]*

But Mr. Newsom cautioned that the numbers aren’t a sign that the state
should consider easing restrictions again.

“It’s good to see this number trending down, not trending up,” he said.
“We need to see another few weeks of this kind of data coming in to
feel more confident about where we are as a state.”

*\[Read our* [*coverage of California’s
reopening*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-california-reopening-phases.html)*.\]*

He repeated that the effects of the virus are disparate across
California; broad averages can mask some of the pandemic’s most dire
impacts. Right now, he said, the state is [focusing on the Central
Valley](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/newsom-coronavirus-valley.html),
where Mr. Newsom said state and federal “strike teams” are using
strategies they honed when cases spiked in Imperial County.

That includes transferring patients out of overburdened smaller
hospitals in rural communities and improving “culturally competent
communication” in places where many people speak Spanish.

But increasingly, experts say that targeted response [should have come
sooner.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/coronavirus-california-health-equity.html)
