\emph{Good morning.}

Joseph R. Biden Jr.
is\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/joseph-biden-vice-president.html}{expected
to finally announce his running mate} --- well, if not this week, then
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html?}{soon}.

And while one woman who represents California in Congress has shot to
the top of the list, it may not be the one you thought.

\textbf{Representative Karen Bass},
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/politics/karen-bass.html}{a
respected consensus-builder} who made history as the first Black woman
in the
country\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-karen-bass-fought-for-blacks-and-latinos-in-south-los-angeles-now-shes-on-bidens-vp-shortlist/2020/07/31/6d224a58-d1d3-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories-2_vpkarenbass-1135am\%3Ahomepage\%2Fstory-ans}{to
serve as the speaker} of a state legislature, has become a leading
contender amid
what\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/joseph-biden-vice-president.html}{my
colleagues reported} has been intense jockeying.

As my colleagues have written,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/politics/karen-bass-vice-president-biden.html}{Ms.
Bass's} credentials as an advocate for social justice and racial equity
run deep: Her political career is rooted in her work as a community
organizer in South Los Angeles during the 1990s, when the crack cocaine
epidemic was ravaging the community and when rage against racist
policing bubbled over in the Rodney King uprisings.

Ms. Bass also explicitly worked to bring together Black and Latino
community members, as Jose A. Del
Real\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-karen-bass-fought-for-blacks-and-latinos-in-south-los-angeles-now-shes-on-bidens-vp-shortlist/2020/07/31/6d224a58-d1d3-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories-2_vpkarenbass-1135am\%3Ahomepage\%2Fstory-ans}{reported
for The Washington Post}.

Today, she's a five-term congresswoman
and\href{https://cbc.house.gov/about/about-the-chair.htm}{chair of the
Congressional Black Caucus} who is close with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

But \textbf{Senator Kamala Harris} is by no means out of the picture.
You may recall she
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/us/kamala-harris-drops-out.html}{also
ran for president}, and she still has many of the things going for her
that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/kamala-harris.html}{made
her a major candidate for the Oval Office}: a barrier-breaking political
career in which she has won multiple statewide races; sharp speaking
skills, which she said she'd use to ``prosecute the case'' against
President Trump; and name recognition both within and outside
California.

Still, some observers have said Ms. Harris might be too focused on her
own presidential aspirations to make for a second-in-command.

Although, as my colleague
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/joe-biden-vp.html}{Lisa
Lerer wrote}, it's best not to get too caught up in the chatter.

\textbf{So, how does this all affect California?}

Ms. Bass and Ms. Harris are not the only competitors, of course; the
Biden campaign is orchestrating an unusually public ``veepstakes,'' in
which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html?}{all
the contenders} are established public servants who would represent
subtly different visions of the Democratic Party, said Raphael
Sonenshein, the executive director of the
\href{https://calstatela.patbrowninstitute.org/}{Pat Brown Institute for
Public Affairs} at Cal State Los Angeles.

And Mr. Biden's announcement
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/us/politics/joe-biden-vp-running-mate.html}{during
the primaries} that he'd choose a woman for the job has helped head off
less substantive discussion about
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/05/us/warren-presidential-race-2020.html}{a
woman's electability} and instead focused it on which woman would be
most likely to help Mr. Biden beat the president. That, Mr. Sonenshein
told me, is the biggest priority for many California Democrats.

Still, he said, it's notable --- nay, ``exciting'' --- to have two
Californians at the top of the list.

``What's interesting is, historically, California has not been a site
for Democrats to get on the national ticket,'' he said.

Despite Democrats' current dominance within the nation's most populous
state, when it comes to national elections, California has been a more
powerful springboard for Republican politicians --- think Ronald Reagan
and Richard Nixon.

Now, Mr. Sonenshein said, no matter how the veepstakes shakes out, ``a
number of California politicians are going to get called to Washington
--- it's probably long overdue.''

Ms. Harris and Ms. Bass, he said, represent parts of the Democratic base
that haven't gotten the attention they deserve: women in general, Black
women in particular --- and Californians.

``You could make a case for both of them,'' he said. ``Bass has a
reputation as a first-class legislator and Harris is a strong
litigator.''

Mr. Sonenshein said he got out of the predictions business after 2016
(seems wise), but one thing is certain: If either Californian is tapped
to join a Biden administration, it'll set off a reshuffling of
Democratic power in the Golden State.

If Ms. Harris leaves her Senate post, he said, ``You're going to see a
game of musical chairs like you've never seen before.''

On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered encouraging news for residents
who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/california-covid-19-cases.html}{have
been whipsawed} by moves to push ahead with a patchwork reopening
process and surging case numbers.

The state's average number of new cases each day over the past week had
decreased, as had intensive care admissions. The state's average
positivity rate over the past two weeks decreased to 7 percent.

\emph{{[}Track virus case trends in}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html}{\emph{every
California county}}\emph{.{]}}

But Mr. Newsom cautioned that the numbers aren't a sign that the state
should consider easing restrictions again.

``It's good to see this number trending down, not trending up,'' he
said. ``We need to see another few weeks of this kind of data coming in
to feel more confident about where we are as a state.''

\emph{{[}Read our}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-california-reopening-phases.html}{\emph{coverage

He repeated that the effects of the virus are disparate across
California; broad averages can mask some of the pandemic's most dire
impacts. Right now, he said, the state is
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/newsom-coronavirus-valley.html}{focusing
on the Central Valley}, where Mr. Newsom said state and federal ``strike
teams'' are using strategies they honed when cases spiked in Imperial
County.

That includes transferring patients out of overburdened smaller
hospitals in rural communities and improving ``culturally competent
communication'' in places where many people speak Spanish.

But increasingly, experts say that targeted response
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/coronavirus-california-health-equity.html}{should
have come sooner.}
