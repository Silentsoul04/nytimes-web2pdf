\subsection{Positive vaccine news}\label{positive-vaccine-news}}

Novavax, the little-known Maryland company that received \$1.6 billion
from the federal government to produce an experimental coronavirus
vaccine, announced encouraging results in two preliminary studies on
Tuesday.

In one study, 56 volunteers produced a high level of antibodies against
the virus without any dangerous side effects. In the other, researchers
found that the vaccine strongly protected monkeys from coronavirus
infections.

There are other vaccines that are further along with clinical trials,
but Novavax's stands out because it is protein-based --- the same proven
technology used for existing vaccines against diseases like shingles ---
which could make it safer and easier to manufacture in large amounts.

Our colleague Carl Zimmer, a science writer and author of ``A Planet of
Viruses,'' thinks there will be a number of coronavirus vaccines that
will turn out to be safe and effective. ``I think that there will be a
patchwork,'' he told us. India, China, and Russia, could all end up with
their own successful vaccines, he said, and ``there may be vaccines that
are better for old people and other groups.''

Despite the promising initial results, it won't be possible to say
whether the Novavax vaccine is safe and effective until the company
conducts a large-scale study --- known as Phase 3 --- comparing people
who get vaccinated to people who get a placebo.

\subsection{The strain on Main Street}\label{the-strain-on-main-street}}

Even as the larger economy is showing signs that it's beginning to heal,
small businesses are still reeling from the pandemic.

In New York City, family-run restaurants, independent bookstores and
other small businesses are the backbone of the economy, but when the
pandemic eventually wanes,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-small-businesses-closing-coronavirus.html}{roughly
one-third (around 80,000) may never reopen}. Many American small
businesses have exhausted federal and local aid, while
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{others
have received only a fraction of what they need} to stay afloat.

The situation is perhaps most dire for Black business owners, who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/business/paycheck-protection-program-bias.html}{had
a harder time securing federal aid} than their white counterparts, own
businesses in areas that were hit hard by the outbreak, and now

Australia looked as though it might be one of the few success stories in
the fight against the coronavirus, thanks to a rapid, tough response
from the government. But after the outbreak had largely been brought
under control,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/world/australia/coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown.html}{cases

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second
    bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a
    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

The Stage 3 lockdown, once the toughest level, has given way to even
more restrictive policies that will last at least six weeks. Residents
are now under curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.

Nearly everyone traveling for a job deemed essential must carry a signed
work permit. And after a campaign to check in on people with Covid-19
found that one in four was not at home, a fine equivalent to about
\$3,500 was established for future violators. Some of the new rules have
led to widespread confusion, with unclear guidance for everything from
dog-walking to seeing romantic partners.
