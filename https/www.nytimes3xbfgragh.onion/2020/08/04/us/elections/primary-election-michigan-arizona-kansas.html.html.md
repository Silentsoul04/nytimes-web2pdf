President Trump downplayed the legacy of John Lewis in an interview. In

William Lacy Clay, a 20-year incumbent.

Two G.O.P. Senate primaries offer — what else? — a test of loyalty to
Trump.

There are, as [a once promising
Democrat](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/07/27/politics/campaign/senator-john-edwardss-remarks-to-the-democratic-national.html)
memorably said, two Americas.

In one, [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
is sagging in the polls, his ineffectual handling of the coronavirus and
incendiary response to racial justice protests having alienated a large
segment of the country.

Yet in the other America, the one where Republican primary voters will
go to the polls this week in Kansas and Tennessee, Mr. Trump is not
toxic at all.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>In fact, his
endorsement amounts to a political seal of good housekeeping.

The Senate primaries in those states for seats held by two retiring
Republicans have, like G.O.P. contests elsewhere, evolved into tests of
who’s most supportive of Mr. Trump and critical of his intraparty
opponents. Never mind that the president could be on his way out of
office when the would-be senators are sworn in next
year.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

In Tennessee, which holds its primary on Thursday, Bill Hagerty, a
private equity executive who served as finance chairman for Mitt
Romney’s 2012 campaign, is running on his endorsement from the
president. Mr. Hagerty helped exorcise his ties to Mr. Romney by
supporting Mr. Trump in the 2016 general election and serving as his
ambassador to Japan.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His upstart challenger, Manny Sethi, an orthopedist who teaches at
Vanderbilt University, is trying to upset Mr. Hagerty by pledging his
loyalty to Mr. Trump and relentlessly highlighting Mr. Hagerty’s
relationship with Mr. Romney, now a first-term Utah senator. Mr. Romney,
the only Senate Republican [who voted to remove Mr. Trump from office
during
impeachment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/us/politics/romney-trump-impeachment.html),
is now something of a dirty word in Republican primaries.

The president has not endorsed a candidate in Kansas, where
establishment-aligned Republicans are [petrified that the polarizing
former secretary of state Kris
Kobach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/kris-kobach-kansas-senate-primary.html)
may claim the nomination and imperil an otherwise safe Republican Senate
seat.

But Mr. Kobach and two of his main rivals — Representative Roger
Marshall and the plumbing executive Bob Hamilton — are all embracing Mr.
Trump in their advertising and vowing to support his policies.

Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and a few other
Republicans in Washington had urged Mr. Trump to throw his support to
Mr. Marshall. But that was before Senator Ted Cruz used an Air Force One
flight last week to remind the president that Mr. Marshall supported
former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio in the 2016 presidential primary.

Mr. Kasich is one of the most vocal Trump critics in the G.O.P. In fact,
going further than Mr. Romney, he’s expected to speak at the Democratic
National Convention and endorse [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
this month.

President Trump is suddenly a big supporter of mail-in voting — in
Florida.

President Trump, who only a day ago [suggested he could restrict voting
by
mail](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/trump-mail-in-voting.html)
through executive fiat, reversed course on Tuesday, urging his
supporters in Florida to request mail-in ballots as [some polls show him
trailing](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/26/politics/trump-trails-in-must-win-florida/index.html)
in the [pandemic-racked battleground
state.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/florida-hurricane-isaias-coronavirus.html)

“Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting, in Florida the
election system is Safe and Secure, Tried and True,” [Mr. Trump wrote on
Twitter.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1290692768675901440)
“Florida’s Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats
attempts at change), so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot &
Vote by Mail\!”

Mr. Trump’s caustic public denunciation of the mail-in voting system has
chafed many Republicans who see his statements as likely to cost him
support among older voters, many of whom may rely on mail-in ballots to
avoid going to polling stations during the pandemic. Senator Rick Scott,
Republican of Florida, and other party leaders, have said mail-in voting
can work as long [as anti-fraud measures are in
place](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/499352-gop-senator-you-can-do-mail-in-voting-with-laws-in-place-to-limit-fraud).

Campaign officials have recently warned the president that efforts to
block mail-in voting in Florida, with its large population of older
voters, could have especially dire consequences, according to two
Republicans familiar with the situation.

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday that
the president’s tweet about Florida mail-in voting was meant to
encourage voters to file “absentee ballots,” not to expand the practice
more broadly; Democrats have said that is a distinction without a
difference.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump was asked on Monday if he has the authority to draft an
executive order to prevent states from widening the use of alternative
voting methods despite the fact that the Constitution vests control of
voting procedures with the states.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>

“I have the right to do it,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “We haven’t got
there yet, but we’ll see what happens.”

For months, the president has been [claiming without
evidence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html)
that voting by mail will encourage widespread voter fraud, even as
Democrats and some Republicans press to loosen restrictions in order to
protect voters from the coronavirus.

Mr. Trump has, increasingly, taken aim at officials in Nevada, which
enacted universal mail-in balloting this week. He threatened to sue to
block the measure on Monday.

Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, has said fraud concerns are unfounded
and failing to expand voting would disenfranchise thousands of Nevada
residents, many of them older and low-income voters.

“With less than three months until the November election, Congress must
act now so states have enough time to make the necessary changes and
plans, recruit and train workers, buy equipment, and do outreach to the
public about new voting processes,” Sylvia Albert, the director of
voting and elections at Common Cause, said in written testimony to a
subcommittee of the House Committee on Homeland Security.

Primary elections around the country this year — plagued with long
lines, polling place closures and high rates of ballot rejection — have
exposed “significant barriers to voting for certain individuals,
especially Black and brown voters,” Ms. Albert said in her written
testimony.

“Longstanding disparities, including long lines, the ballot rejection
rates, particularly of Black and brown communities, are now exacerbated
by the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said Tuesday. “The chasm of those with
access is growing larger. Voters of color are on the losing end.”

Several states, including Georgia, Pennsylvania and Indiana, saw voting
machine glitches and other failures that contributed to long waits.

“Without proper funding, the problems seen in previous elections are
going to be just the tip of the iceberg this November,” she testified.

David Levine, an elections integrity fellow with the Alliance for
Securing Democracy, told the panel that many states and counties lacked
the resources needed to offer alternatives for safe and secure elections
amid the pandemic, like “robust voting by mail, early voting, and
Election Day options.”

The stimulus law enacted in March provided $400 million to states for
administering elections, but one study said the need was 10 times that.
In May, the Democratic-controlled House passed another pandemic relief
bill that would provide $3.6 billion in additional election funding, but
that plan has run into a brick wall in the Senate, where there is little
appetite among Republicans for such spending.

The dispute is one of the issues fueling a stalemate between the White
House and congressional Democrats on a sweeping economic recovery
package. Mr. Trump has cast doubt on the idea of expanding mail-in
voting to make it safer for Americans to cast ballots during the
pandemic, saying that it would lead to widespread fraud. But there is no
evidence that the practice leads to higher incidence of voter fraud.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A routine bill-signing turned into an embarrassing blooper for Mr. Trump
on Tuesday.

At a signing of the Great American Outdoors Act, the president appeared
not to recognize the word “Yosemite” in his prepared text, pronouncing
it instead “Yo Semites.”

The latest verbal miscue by Mr. Trump came as he and his campaign have
repeatedly seized on verbal gaffes by his Democratic opponent, former
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and sought to portray Mr. Biden as
senile.

And Yosemite National Park in California, which Mr. Trump was trying to
reference, is a federal treasure that presidents have often highlighted.

Before he signed the act into law, Mr. Trump talked about young
Americans looking at “the breathtaking beauty of the Grand Canyon,”
before moving on in his script.

“When they gaze upon Yo Semites — Yo Seminites — towering sequoias,
their love of country grows stronger,” Mr. Trump said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gun sales skyrocketed after the police killing of George Floyd in May,
and the lieutenant governor of Texas pointing to the increase as a sign
of a victory for Mr. Trump in the November election.

Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is the chairman of Mr. Trump’s re-election
campaign in Texas, on Tuesday cited gun sales as a measure of the
president’s political fortunes.

“Guns sales are a leading indicator pointing to Trump’s electoral
success in November,” Mr. Patrick said [in a
statement](https://www.scribd.com/document/471381594/PR-20-08-04). “The
millions of Americans who are buying guns will not vote for a candidate
who threatens their Second Amendment rights and promises confiscation
policies.”

In Texas, where [polls show a tight
race](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/texas/) between Mr.
Trump and Mr. Biden, Mr. Patrick has been an unwavering ally of the
president. Last month, Mr. Patrick drew attention when he said during a
[Fox News
interview](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6168445167001#sp=show-clips) that
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert,
“doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” His comments came as Texas
became a hot spot for coronavirus cases.

Mr. Patrick’s comments on gun ownership came one day after Texas and the
nation paused to remember the 23 people who were killed in an
[Aug. 3, 2019, massacre at a Walmart in El
Paso](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/09/us/el-paso-suspect-confession.html).
The suspect confessed that he had been targeting Mexicans, the
authorities said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Citing F.B.I. statistics, Mr. Patrick said that more than 2.3 million
guns were sold in June — a more than 145 percent increase compared to
last year — and that a record 3.9 million background checks were
conducted.

Much the way Mr. Trump and the president’s leading surrogates have done,
Mr. Patrick appeared to be trying to [stoke fears among suburban voters
and Mr. Trump’s conservative base over the
unrest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/upshot/trump-suburban-voters.html)
in many of the country’s cities since Mr. Floyd’s death in late May.

“Democrat-led cities across the nation, including Portland, Seattle and
now Austin, are surrendering the streets to lawlessness and mob rule,”
he said. “With their ‘defund the police’ rhetoric escalating, they have
sent a clear message that protecting and defending their residents is a
low priority.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Representative Rashida Tlaib marked her first day in Congress in January
2019 with [an expletive-fueled call to impeach Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/04/us/politics/tlaib-impeach-trump.html).
It made her an instant Democratic star as she became part of the
four-member Squad, the group of progressive Democratic women who were
elected to the House in 2018 and have come to embody the vanguard of the
party’s liberal grass-roots energy.

While popular with the Democratic base, Ms. Tlaib’s broadside didn’t win
her many friends in the party’s House leadership, which held off
impeachment proceedings for months before allowing them to begin last
fall.

It also fueled whispers back home in Detroit that Ms. Tlaib, a
Palestinian-American who was one of the first two Muslim women elected
to Congress, was more eager to advance a national profile and
fund-raising network than she was in representing her predominantly
Black district.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now the most endangered member of the group, Ms. Tlaib faces a rematch
with Brenda Jones, the Detroit City Council president she defeated in
the 2018 primary. (In a separate contest held the same day, Ms. Jones
eked out a two-point victory over Ms. Tlaib in a special primary
election to serve out the remainder of the long-serving Representative
John Conyers’s term after [his abrupt
resignation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/05/us/politics/john-conyers-election.html).)

Ms. Jones has now regrouped to challenge Ms. Tlaib, arguing that she has
become too preoccupied with national issues.

Ms. Tlaib has raised far more money, $3 million, than Ms. Jones, who
posted just $165,000 in her latest Federal Election Commission report.

And while she has emerged as one of the Democratic Party’s most muscular
disrupters, Ms. Tlaib retained the endorsement last week of its most
significant establishment figure: Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

More than 1.4 million Michigan voters already cast absentee ballots and
fewer people were expected to vote in person at polling places. Election
officials were expecting a late night and perhaps delayed results
because of the surge in those ballots, and the fact that local clerks
could not begin processing or tabulating them until the polls opened
this morning.

Although Michigan sent 35 extra elections workers to Detroit on Tuesday,
a few polling places opened late after election workers did not show up
for shifts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is in direct relation to the pandemic and in direct relation to
the high number of absentee ballots,” said Jake Rollow, a spokesman for
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. “And we’ve got fewer election workers
able to serve because traditionally so many election workers are older
and more susceptible to the virus.”

Kansas has not sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since the 1930s. But
for months, Republicans in Washington and in the state [have
feared](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/30/us/politics/kansas-senate-kobach.html)
that if Mr. Kobach wins the party’s Senate primary, a traditionally safe
seat will be endangered — and so will the Senate majority.

Mr. Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, is an incendiary
figure in state politics, known for his hard-line views on immigration
and voting rights, and his 2018 loss in the governor’s race to Laura
Kelly, a Democrat.

Top Senate Republicans, long wary of Mr. Kobach and his 2018
performance, have pleaded with Mr. Trump to endorse Representative Roger
Marshall, whom they see as the strongest general election candidate in a
crowded field. But the president has remained on the sidelines, [stoking
tensions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/kansas-senate-kobach-trump.html)
between Senate Republicans and the White House.

The winner of Tuesday’s primary is expected to face Barbara Bollier, a
Democratic state senator who was until recently a Republican herself.

A statewide race remains a challenge in Kansas for any Democrat,
regardless of the Republican nominee. But as Mr. Trump’s faltering
approval ratings have endangered Republican candidates in down-ballot
races across the country, there is a growing sense that the outcome even
in deep-red Kansas is no sure bet.

An increasingly bitter Democratic
primary<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>in St. Louis [between
the activist Cori Bush and Representative William Lacy
Clay](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/cori-bush-william-lacy-clay-missouri.html),
a 20-year incumbent with the party establishment’s full backing, will be
one of the most significant tests this summer of the power of the
resurgent progressive wing of the party.

Mr. Clay and his father, a founding member of the Congressional Black
Caucus, have held the seat in Congress for more than 50 years, and the
congressman had routinely sailed to re-election until Ms. Bush
challenged him in 2018.

He [prevailed then by about 20
points](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/elections/results/missouri-house-district-1-primary-election),
and this time around, Mr. Clay wants to make a show of blunting the
progressive movement against primary incumbents like himself.

If Mr. Clay loses, he would be the first Black congressman to fall to a
challenger backed by the Justice Democrats, a progressive national group
that helped fuel the rise of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of
New York. So far, the long-serving House members, like Eliot L. Engel
and Joseph Crowley in New York, who Justice Democrats-backed candidates
have succeeded in upsetting have all been white, in many cases
representing racially diverse districts.

Ms. Bush, an activist who jumped into the political arena after the
police shooting of Michael Brown six years ago, responded in a recent
interview with The Times to Mr. Clay calling her a “prop” for the
Justice Democrats.

Four years and two electoral defeats since he last held office, Joe
Arpaio is asking Republicans in Maricopa County, Ariz., [to return him
to his former role as sheriff of the state’s largest
jurisdiction](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/arizona-election-joe-arpaio.html).

But Mr. Arpaio, 88, is no longer the towering local figure who had
forced inmates to wear pink underwear, castigated illegal immigration
and who, well after former President Barack Obama left office, continued
insisting the 44th president wasn’t born in Hawaii.

Mr. Arpaio lost a 2016 re-election bid to Paul Penzone, a Democrat, then
finished a distant third in the state’s 2018 Senate primary, winning
just one of the state’s 15 counties. His comeback bid, like his Senate
race, is fueled more by his name recognition and repeated attempts to
tie himself to Mr. Trump than it is by any sense of how he would run the
sheriff’s office.

Now, Mr. Arpaio is involved in a three-way race that includes Jerry
Sheridan, his former chief deputy. But it is Mr. Penzone, the Democrat,
who has the support of the state’s Republican establishment figures, who
find Mr. Arpaio’s antics generally embarrassing and hurtful to Arizona’s

[Mr. Trump played down the accomplishments of Representative John
Lewis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/politics/trump-john-lewis-axios.html),
the recently deceased civil rights icon, and criticized him for not
attending the Trump inauguration in January 2017.

The comments from Mr. Trump, in an interview with [“Axios on
HBO”](https://www.axios.com/trump-john-lewis-inauguration-1adc0747-51b8-4990-a7d8-29290e990dc5.html)
that aired Monday night, were unsurprising, given his penchant for
grievance. But they were nonetheless stunning for the degree to which
Mr. Trump refused to view Mr. Lewis’s life and legacy in terms beyond
how it related to Mr. Trump himself.

“I never met John Lewis, actually,” Mr. Trump said. “He didn’t come to
my inauguration. He didn’t come to my State of the Union speeches, and
that’s OK. That’s his right.”

Asked to reflect on Mr. Lewis’s contributions to the civil rights
movement, Mr. Trump instead talked up his own record.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Again, nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have,” he said.
“He should have come. I think he made a big mistake.”

Mr. Trump declined to say whether he found Mr. Lewis’s life story
“impressive.” He seemed indifferent to renaming the Edmund Pettus
Bridge in Selma, Ala., after the congressman. The bridge, named after a
former Confederate general, Grand Dragon in the K.K.K. and senator, was
the site of a turning point in the civil rights movement that became
known as Bloody Sunday.

On that day, March 7, 1965, Mr. Lewis suffered a cracked skull during a
march across the bridge when a state trooper clubbed him and beat him to
the ground. The moment was a defining one in his life and in the civil
rights movement. Mr. Trump, in the Axios interview, suggested there
“were many others also” whose work should be praised.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Abruptly reversing its stated schedule, the Census Bureau confirmed late
Monday that it would end its count of the nation’s 330 million residents
by Sept. 30, a month earlier than it had stated only this
spring.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

The four-week acceleration sounds small, but census experts have said it
would wreak havoc with efforts to reach the very hardest-to-count
households — immigrants, minorities, young people and others — that have
long been flagged as most likely to be missed in this year’s
tally.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Critics of the sped-up schedule pounced on the announcement, casting it
as an unvarnished attempt by the administration to twist the nation’s
population count to exclude groups that, by and large, tended to support
Democrats.

“This is a whole systemic attack on the census for political gain,”
Julie Menin, the census director for New York City, said in an
interview. “There’s an intentional attempt here to basically steal the
census — to politicize this census to gain Republican seats across the
country.”

The bureau has offered no explanation for the change [posted on its
website](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/delivering-complete-accurate-count.html).
But outside experts said the explanation was clearly rooted in politics
—<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>in particular, in a demand
by Mr. Trump last month to exclude undocumented immigrants from the
population totals that are used every 10 years to reallocate House seats
among the states.

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform said on Tuesday that it
wanted to question eight census officials about the change.
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the
committee’s chairwoman, called the development [“alarming” in a letter
to the census
director](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2020-08-04.CBM%20to%20Dillingham%20re%20Transcribed%20Interviews.pdf)
and said it was a further attempt to “rush and politicize” the census.

Slammed by the pandemic, the Census Bureau had said earlier that it
wanted to delay its final delivery of population totals to April 2021,
rather than the statutory deadline of December
31.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>The speedup announced late
Monday reverses that request and assures that the totals will be
delivered to the White House by year’s end — before any new president or
Congress might take office.

That gives the White House its best opportunity to act on Mr. Trump’s
effort to remove undocumented immigrants from the reapportionment
totals.

The announcement on Monday by the Census Bureau speeds up the last
counts of some 60 million households that have failed to respond to
requests to turn in census forms. The pandemic-delayed schedule called
for that count to be completed by October 31. The plan announced on
Monday, [which had been reported last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/trump-census.html),
will move that deadline up by one month, to September 30.
