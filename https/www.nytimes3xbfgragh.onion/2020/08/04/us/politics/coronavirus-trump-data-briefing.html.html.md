# Trump Cherry-Picks Coronavirus Data in Briefing Appearance

The president selectively highlighted statistics, falsely claimed New
York and New Jersey were solely responsible for high national death
rates and again wrongly asserted that a rise in cases was because of
testing.

President Trump, in a news conference on Tuesday, cited a slew of
statistics to argue that “our strong mitigation efforts are working very
well.”

Here’s a fact-check.

what Mr. Trump said

*“Thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we
have gained about the disease itself, the recent rise in cases has not
been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths. Fatalities
nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak.”*

**This is misleading.** Mr. Trump is right that the number of deaths,
currently averaging over 1,000 a day, remain well below the 2,200 deaths
a day seen in April, [according to a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
But fatalities nationwide have increased and are double that of the low
in July, when daily deaths hovered below 500.

what Mr. Trump said

*“The numbers are going down, but Florida is going down very
significantly. Texas and California are going down rather
significantly.”*

[Texas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html)

what Mr. Trump said

*“A lot of our numbers were based on the New York — had a very tough
time, as you know — New York, New Jersey, that area. And when you take
them out, just as an example, take a look at Florida relative to New
York. That’s not to say anything wrong with New York, it’s just a very
tough place. People are close together, it’s crowded, it’s not easy. But
when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest and even with
them in — I will get back to you — but we have among the lowest numbers.
They’ve done a fantastic job.”*

**False.** Mr. Trump was responding to a reporter who accurately pointed
out that the United States has one of the highest rates of deaths per
100,000 population in the world. But he is wrong that omitting New York
and New Jersey would place the United States “among the lowest.”

The entire country’s rate of 47.5 deaths per 100,000 is currently the
fourth highest among the 20 countries most affected by the coronavirus,
and the 10th highest among more than 160 countries, [according to data
collected by Johns Hopkins
University.](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)

As of Tuesday evening, [New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html)
and [New
Jersey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html)
combined account for 48,268 of the 157,119 deaths nationwide, and [28.3
million](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/NJ,NY,US/PST045219)of
the total population of 328.2 million. Omitting the two states would
result in a rate of 36.3 deaths per 100,000 — placing the United States
at sixth highest among the most infected, and 14th in the world.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

what Mr. Trump said

*“We are testing at a level that no country in the world — and I’ve
spoken to the leaders of the world and they’ll ask me about it — no
country in the world thought that it’s even believable that we’re able
to test so much, 61 million versus, you know, most countries don’t even
test. You know when they test? When somebody’s feeling badly, if
somebody’s feeling badly, if they’re symptomatic, that’s when they test.
And that’s a big difference. With us, we go around and looking, because
if we find spots, we find hot spots. One problem is from the standpoint
of the media, we end up with far more cases than we would normally
show.”*

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

**False.** Mr. Trump compared the total number of tests conducted to
that of Australia, Canada, France and Mexico. While the United States
has conducted more tests than those countries or any other country, Mr.
Trump [was once again
wrong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/22/us/covid-testing-rising-cases.html)
that testing is driving the increase in number of cases.

According to [Johns Hopkins
University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/international-comparison),
the positivity rate is “the most reliable way to determine if a
government is testing enough.” The United States currently has a daily
positive rate of 7.13 percent, higher than that of Australia’s 0.47
percent and Canada’s 3.82 percent.

He was also wrong that other countries test only those with symptoms.
Like the United States, Australia and Canada have [open public testing
available](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-testing-policy)
to asymptomatic people. It should also be noted that places like [New
Zealand](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/world/australia/new-zealand-coronavirus-ardern.html),
