\section{Trump Cherry-Picks Coronavirus Data in Briefing
Appearance}\label{trump-cherry-picks-coronavirus-data-in-briefing-appearance}}

The president selectively highlighted statistics, falsely claimed New
York and New Jersey were solely responsible for high national death
rates and again wrongly asserted that a rise in cases was because of
testing.

President Trump, in a news conference on Tuesday, cited a slew of
statistics to argue that ``our strong mitigation efforts are working
very well.''

Here's a fact-check.

what Mr. Trump said

\emph{``Thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the
knowledge we have gained about the disease itself, the recent rise in
cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths.
Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April
peak.''}

\textbf{This is misleading.} Mr. Trump is right that the number of
deaths, currently averaging over 1,000 a day, remain well below the
2,200 deaths a day seen in April,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{according
to a New York Times database}. But fatalities nationwide have increased
and are double that of the low in July, when daily deaths hovered below
500.

what Mr. Trump said

\emph{``The numbers are going down, but Florida is going down very
significantly. Texas and California are going down rather
significantly.''}

\textbf{This is misleading.} As of Tuesday evening, the number of new
cases in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html}{California},
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/florida-coronavirus-cases.html}{Florida}
and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html}{Texas}
were declining, but the number of deaths had plateaued or even
increased. Over all, cases are increasing in 16 states and have remained
level in 28 states, while deaths are increasing in 27 states.

what Mr. Trump said

\emph{``A lot of our numbers were based on the New York --- had a very
tough time, as you know~--- New York, New Jersey, that area. And when
you take them out, just as an example, take a look at Florida relative
to New York. That's not to say anything wrong with New York, it's just a
very tough place. People are close together, it's crowded, it's not
easy. But when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest and
even with them in --- I will get back to you --- but we have among the
lowest numbers. They've done a fantastic job.''}

\textbf{False.} Mr. Trump was responding to a reporter who accurately
pointed out that the United States has one of the highest rates of
deaths per 100,000 population in the world. But he is wrong that
omitting New York and New Jersey would place the United States ``among
the lowest.''

The entire country's rate of 47.5 deaths per 100,000 is currently the
fourth highest among the 20 countries most affected by the coronavirus,
and the 10th highest among more than 160 countries,
\href{https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality}{according to data
collected by Johns Hopkins University.}

As of Tuesday evening,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html}{New
York} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html}{New
Jersey} combined account for 48,268 of the 157,119 deaths nationwide,
and
\href{https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/NJ,NY,US/PST045219}{28.3
million}of the total population of 328.2 million. Omitting the two
states would result in a rate of 36.3 deaths per 100,000 --- placing the
United States at sixth highest among the most infected, and 14th in the
world.

what Mr. Trump said

\emph{``We are testing at a level that no country in the world --- and
I've spoken to the leaders of the world and they'll ask me about it ---
no country in the world thought that it's even believable that we're
able to test so much, 61 million versus, you know, most countries don't
even test. You know when they test? When somebody's feeling badly, if
somebody's feeling badly, if they're symptomatic, that's when they test.
And that's a big difference. With us, we go around and looking, because
if we find spots, we find hot spots. One problem is from the standpoint
of the media, we end up with far more cases than we would normally
show.''}

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second
    bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a
    drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll
    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

\textbf{False.} Mr. Trump compared the total number of tests conducted
to that of Australia, Canada, France and Mexico. While the United States
has conducted more tests than those countries or any other country, Mr.
Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/22/us/covid-testing-rising-cases.html}{was
once again wrong} that testing is driving the increase in number of
cases.

According to
\href{https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/international-comparison}{Johns
Hopkins University}, the positivity rate is ``the most reliable way to
determine if a government is testing enough.'' The United States
currently has a daily positive rate of 7.13 percent, higher than that of
Australia's 0.47 percent and Canada's 3.82 percent.

He was also wrong that other countries test only those with symptoms.
Like the United States, Australia and Canada have
\href{https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-testing-policy}{open
public testing available} to asymptomatic people. It should also be
noted that places like
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/world/australia/new-zealand-coronavirus-ardern.html}{New
Zealand}, South Korea, and Taiwan also controlled their outbreaks with
far lower testing figures than the United States has.
