# Trump Assesses John Lewis’s Legacy: ‘He Didn’t Come to My Inauguration’

President Trump was asked by an interviewer to reflect on the late
congressman’s contributions to the civil rights movement. He talked up
his own record

President Trump played down the accomplishments of Representative John
Lewis, the recently deceased civil rights icon, and criticized him for
not attending the Trump inauguration in an interview conducted while Mr.
Lewis was lying in state at the Capitol.

The comments from Mr. Trump, which aired on [“Axios on
HBO”](https://www.axios.com/full-axios-hbo-interview-donald-trump-cd5a67e1-6ba1-46c8-bb3d-8717ab9f3cc5.html)
Monday night, were unsurprising, given his penchant for grievance. But
they were nonetheless stunning for the degree to which Mr. Trump refused
to view Mr. Lewis’s life and legacy in terms beyond how it related to
Mr. Trump himself.

“I never met John Lewis, actually,” Mr. Trump said. “He didn’t come to
my inauguration. He didn’t come to my State of the Union speeches, and
that’s OK. That’s his right.”

When asked to reflect on Mr. Lewis’s contributions to the civil rights
movement, Mr. Trump instead talked up his own record.

Mr. Trump declined to say whether he found Mr. Lewis’s life story
“impressive.” He seemed indifferent to renaming the Edmund Pettus
Bridge in Selma, Ala., after the congressman. The bridge, named after a
former Confederate general, Grand Dragon in the Ku Klux Klan and
senator, was the site of a turning point in the civil rights movement
that became known as Bloody Sunday.

On that day, March 7, 1965, Mr. Lewis suffered a cracked skull during a
march across the bridge when a state trooper clubbed him and beat him to
the ground. The moment was a defining one in his life and in the civil
rights movement. Mr. Trump, in the Axios interview, suggested there
“were many others also” whose work should be praised.

Mr. Trump did not attend the events honoring Mr. Lewis at the Capitol
last week, though Vice President Mike Pence visited to pay his respects,
as did former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump’s
presumptive November opponent.

The president and the congressman were at odds since before Mr. Trump’s
inauguration, when Mr. Lewis questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Trump’s
election and said he would not be in attendance when the president-elect
traveled to the Capitol to be sworn in.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected,” Mr.
Lewis said in a television interview days before Mr. Trump took office.
“And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I don’t
plan to attend the inauguration. It will be the first one that I miss
since I’ve been in the Congress. You cannot be at home with something
that you feel that is wrong, is not right.”

(Mr. Lewis, [in
fact](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/01/lewis-skipped-bushs-inauguration-too/),
also skipped the first inauguration of President George W. Bush after
the controversial 2000 election recount in Florida.)

In [the wide-ranging
interview](https://www.axios.com/trump-coronavirus-under-control-5f114a16-9952-428c-bc07-3cfa360b0977.html)
with Jonathan Swan of Axios, Mr. Trump repeatedly insisted he deserved
praise for the country’s ability to detect the coronavirus through
testing and dismissed criticism that he and his administration should
have done more to contain it. Remarking on [the more than 150,000
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
the virus has caused, he said: “It is what it is.”

“They are dying. That’s true,” Mr. Trump said in the interview, which
was recorded on July 28.

“It is what it is. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t doing everything we
can. It’s under control as much as you can control it.”

Mr. Trump repeatedly played down the virus throughout the spring, and
did so again in the interview, insisting that cases are falling in
places where they aren’t.

“One person’s too much,” Mr. Trump said. “And those people that really
understand it, that really understand it, they said it’s an incredible
job that we’ve done.”

Mr. Trump was also asked about his recent well wishes for Ghislaine
Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, [who has been charged
by federal
officials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-arrest-jeffrey-epstein.html)
with trafficking underage girls. Mr. Trump said he hoped nothing “bad”
happened to her in prison.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out
how did it happen, was it suicide, was he killed?” Mr. Trump said. “I do
wish her well. I’m not looking for anything bad for her.”

Attorney General William P. Barr has said that Mr. Epstein definitely
killed himself as he was being held in a Manhattan jail last year. But
conspiracy theorists have continued to question the death.
