President Trump was asked by an interviewer to reflect on the late
congressman's contributions to the civil rights movement. He talked up
his own record instead.

President Trump played down the accomplishments of Representative John
Lewis, the recently deceased civil rights icon, and criticized him for
not attending the Trump inauguration in an interview conducted while Mr.
Lewis was lying in state at the Capitol.

The comments from Mr. Trump, which aired on
\href{https://www.axios.com/full-axios-hbo-interview-donald-trump-cd5a67e1-6ba1-46c8-bb3d-8717ab9f3cc5.html}{``Axios
on HBO''} Monday night, were unsurprising, given his penchant for
grievance. But they were nonetheless stunning for the degree to which
Mr. Trump refused to view Mr. Lewis's life and legacy in terms beyond
how it related to Mr. Trump himself.

``I never met John Lewis, actually,'' Mr. Trump said. ``He didn't come
to my inauguration. He didn't come to my State of the Union speeches,
and that's OK. That's his right.''

When asked to reflect on Mr. Lewis's contributions to the civil rights
movement, Mr. Trump instead talked up his own record.

``Again, nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have,'' he
said. ``He should have come. I think he made a big mistake.''

Mr. Trump declined to say whether he found Mr. Lewis's life story
``impressive.'' He seemed indifferent to renaming the Edmund Pettus
Bridge in Selma, Ala., after the congressman. The bridge, named after a
former Confederate general, Grand Dragon in the Ku Klux Klan and
senator, was the site of a turning point in the civil rights movement
that became known as Bloody Sunday.

On that day, March 7, 1965, Mr. Lewis suffered a cracked skull during a
march across the bridge when a state trooper clubbed him and beat him to
the ground. The moment was a defining one in his life and in the civil
rights movement. Mr. Trump, in the Axios interview, suggested there
``were many others also'' whose work should be praised.

Mr. Trump did not attend the events honoring Mr. Lewis at the Capitol
last week, though Vice President Mike Pence visited to pay his respects,
as did former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump's
presumptive November opponent.

The president and the congressman were at odds since before Mr. Trump's
inauguration, when Mr. Lewis questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Trump's
election and said he would not be in attendance when the president-elect
traveled to the Capitol to be sworn in.

``I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected,''
Mr. Lewis said in a television interview days before Mr. Trump took
office. ``And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I
don't plan to attend the inauguration. It will be the first one that I
miss since I've been in the Congress. You cannot be at home with
something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.''

(Mr. Lewis,
\href{https://www.factcheck.org/2017/01/lewis-skipped-bushs-inauguration-too/}{in
fact}, also skipped the first inauguration of President George W. Bush
after the controversial 2000 election recount in Florida.)

In
\href{https://www.axios.com/trump-coronavirus-under-control-5f114a16-9952-428c-bc07-3cfa360b0977.html}{the
wide-ranging interview} with Jonathan Swan of Axios, Mr. Trump
repeatedly insisted he deserved praise for the country's ability to
detect the coronavirus through testing and dismissed criticism that he
and his administration should have done more to contain it. Remarking on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{the
more than 150,000 deaths} the virus has caused, he said: ``It is what it
is.''

``They are dying. That's true,'' Mr. Trump said in the interview, which
was recorded on July 28.

``It is what it is. But that doesn't mean we aren't doing everything we
can. It's under control as much as you can control it.''

Mr. Trump repeatedly played down the virus throughout the spring, and
did so again in the interview, insisting that cases are falling in
places where they aren't.

``One person's too much,'' Mr. Trump said. ``And those people that
really understand it, that really understand it, they said it's an
incredible job that we've done.''

Mr. Trump was also asked about his recent well wishes for Ghislaine
Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-arrest-jeffrey-epstein.html}{who
has been charged by federal officials} with trafficking underage girls.
Mr. Trump said he hoped nothing ``bad'' happened to her in prison.

``Her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out
how did it happen, was it suicide, was he killed?'' Mr. Trump said. ``I
do wish her well. I'm not looking for anything bad for her.''

Attorney General William P. Barr has said that Mr. Epstein definitely
killed himself as he was being held in a Manhattan jail last year. But
conspiracy theorists have continued to question the death.

Katie Rogers contributed reporting.
