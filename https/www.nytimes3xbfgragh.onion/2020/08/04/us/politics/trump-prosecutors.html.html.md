## Where things stand

  - **A court filing yesterday contained a significant clue** indicating
    that [the Manhattan district attorney’s office may be conducting a
    broader
    investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
    than previously known into President Trump’s personal and business
    practices.

  - Until now, New York prosecutors were thought to be leading a
    relatively narrow investigation into hush payments made to Stormy
    Daniels and Karen McDougal in the run-up to the 2016 presidential
    election.

  - But in the filing, prosecutors said they had a wide legal basis on
    which to investigate Trump’s business practices, citing “undisputed”
    assertions made in earlier court papers and various news reports.

  - Among those reports was one that suggested the president might have
    illegally inflated his assets to lenders and insurers. Another
    focused on the congressional testimony of Michael Cohen, Trump’s
    former fixer, who told lawmakers last year that the president had
    committed insurance fraud. Trump’s lawyers have denied wrongdoing.

  - **Another day, another flare-up in Trump’s continuing war** with
    social media companies, which he seems to both love and loathe. But
    this time, conflict appears to have been averted.

  - Trump threatened last week to ban TikTok, a Chinese-owned company,
    from operating in the United States — part of a campaign-season
    blitz of anti-China messaging. But yesterday, [Trump said that he
    had given his blessing over the
    weekend](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html)
    for Microsoft to buy the popular social media network, so long as a
    deal takes place by Sept. 15.

  - “It can’t be controlled for security reasons by China,” Trump said
    in comments at the White House. He said he would not mind if
    Microsoft or another “very American” company bought it.

  - Trump suggested that the government should be compensated for
    letting a deal go through, although he didn’t make it clear how such
    a premium might be collected. “A very substantial portion of that
    price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United
    States, because we’re making it possible for this deal to happen,”
    Trump said.

  - Administration officials and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle
    have repeatedly cited security concerns over TikTok, a viral video
    app popular with children and young adults, saying it [could
    potentially allow the Chinese government
    access](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-microsoft-tweens.html)
    to American user data.

  - **Seven years of allegedly defrauding the government**. $100 million
    in losses. One on-the-record exchange between a senior Trump
    administration official and a senator, during a congressional
    hearing, in which [the official pledges to see if he can help the
    company](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/yrc-coronavirus-relief-funds.html).

  - These are all at the heart of a deal that the government struck with
    YRC Worldwide, a trucking company that had been sued by the Justice
    Department — until the administration decided to extend it a loan of
    $700 million, in exchange for a 30 percent stake in the business.

  - The deal, approved on the grounds that YRC was essential to national
    security, sent the company’s stock soaring and made YRC one of the
    largest recipients of taxpayer money allocated as part of the
    coronavirus relief legislation.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Barack Obama is wading more deeply** into the 2020 campaign, and
    yesterday [he released his first slate of
    endorsements](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#link-3de249e6).
    He lent his support to 118 candidates in 17 states, including 52 for
    the House of Representatives and five for the Senate in key
    battlegrounds.

  - All five of the Senate endorsements are of Democratic challengers
    running to unseat Republicans — in Colorado, Iowa, Maine, North
    Carolina and South Carolina. For now, he’s staying out of the Senate
    races in certain conservative-leaning states — including Montana,
    Kentucky, Georgia and Texas — where Democratic candidates are also
    challenging Republican incumbents, but where it isn’t clear if his
    endorsement would have the desired effect.

  - Ten of the candidates endorsed by Obama were alumni of his
    presidential administration.

  - All eyes are on Joe Biden as [he moves toward an announcement of his
    choice of a running
    mate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-elections-2020&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu).
    He recently indicated that he would make a decision this week,
    though his aides now say the choice won’t become public until next
    week.

  - **The White House is carrying out mandatory, random coronavirus
    testing** for its staff in an effort to contain the virus’s spread
    at a time when it is pervading several regions of the country.
    Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, was revealed
    last week to have tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the
    latest in a string of administration officials to contract it.

  - The testing decision arrived a day after Dr. Deborah Birx, the White
    House coronavirus response coordinator, said on CNN that the
    pandemic had entered a “new phase” in which the virus was
    “extraordinarily widespread” in rural areas as well as urban ones,
    in part because it was being transmitted by asymptomatic people.

  - Trump and other Republicans attacked Birx for her proclamation. The
    president tweeted that her comments were “pathetic” and painted the
    bad news as Democratic propaganda. He sought to walk back those
    remarks in an evening news conference, expressing his “respect” for
    Birx.

  - Also yesterday, [Dr. Anthony Fauci backed up Birx’s
    analysis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-4e40df05)
    during a news conference at which he joined the governor of
    Connecticut by video conference. Fauci, the nation’s leading
    infectious disease expert, said Birx had been referring to the
    “inherent community spread” happening in some states. “When you
    have community spread, it’s much more difficult to get your arms
    around that and contain it,” he
said.

## Young voters haven’t forgotten about gun control, but they see it as inextricably linked to racial justice.

Yesterday was exactly one year since the massacre in El Paso, where a
gunman who the authorities say was motivated by anti-Hispanic hatred
killed 23 people at a Walmart Supercenter.

Young gun-control activists in El Paso gathered for a vigil last night
at the site of the attack, where they were joined by other community
groups.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Joe Biden released a campaign
[advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbQQEPwarmU) recognizing
the anniversary. In it, he says that Americans must “stand against
hate.”

And Students Demand Action, a grass-roots arm of the nonprofit Everytown
for Gun Safety, [posted a
message](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDbpUdzHq_L/) on Instagram in
remembrance of the victims. “We are committed to fighting for stronger
gun legislation, because too often guns end up in the wrong hands and
make hatred lethal,” the post read.

Each of these acts of commemoration acknowledged the shooting not only
as part of a national scourge of gun violence but also as an example of
the country’s struggle with racism.

It has been over two years since young activists led the March for Our
Lives, storming Washington with a demand for change after a school
shooting in Parkland, Fla., left 17 people dead. In those years, March
for Our Lives and Students Demand Action have sprouted hundreds of
chapters across the country. In 2018, their organizing efforts helped
drive a surge in youth turnout in the 2018 midterm elections. And they
have committed themselves to making just as big an impact this year.

The only catch is that many of those young voters who said that gun
safety was their top priority in the months after Parkland have now
turned their most intense focus toward other issues, particularly
matters of racial justice, according to polls.

Still, activists insist that it isn’t a matter of either/or. [In our
interview for an article published
yesterday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/gun-control-voters.html),
Alanna Miller, a 19-year-old organizer with Students Demand Action, said
that the overlap between issues of racial justice and gun violence was
in fact central to activists’ focus this year.

“I don’t know if I would still be in this movement, organizing, if I
hadn’t expanded my worldview in thinking about this issue and how
insidious and how pervasive it is,” Miller said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And Charlie Kelly, Everytown’s senior political director, said that
drawing these ties resonated with the young voters whom organizers were
seeking to mobilize. “When we put out a call to our supporters to
support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, we saw students take
action at twice the rate of any previous action,” he said.
