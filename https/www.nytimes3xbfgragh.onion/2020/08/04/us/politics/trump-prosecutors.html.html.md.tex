\subsection{Where things stand}\label{where-things-stand}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{A court filing yesterday contained a significant clue}
  indicating that
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{the
  Manhattan district attorney's office may be conducting a broader
  investigation} than previously known into President Trump's personal
  and business practices.
\item
  Until now, New York prosecutors were thought to be leading a
  relatively narrow investigation into hush payments made to Stormy
  Daniels and Karen McDougal in the run-up to the 2016 presidential
  election.
\item
  But in the filing, prosecutors said they had a wide legal basis on
  which to investigate Trump's business practices, citing ``undisputed''
  assertions made in earlier court papers and various news reports.
\item
  Among those reports was one that suggested the president might have
  illegally inflated his assets to lenders and insurers. Another focused
  on the congressional testimony of Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer,
  who told lawmakers last year that the president had committed
  insurance fraud. Trump's lawyers have denied wrongdoing.
\item
  \textbf{Another day, another flare-up in Trump's continuing war} with
  social media companies, which he seems to both love and loathe. But
  this time, conflict appears to have been averted.
\item
  Trump threatened last week to ban TikTok, a Chinese-owned company,
  from operating in the United States --- part of a campaign-season
  blitz of anti-China messaging. But yesterday,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html}{Trump
  said that he had given his blessing over the weekend} for Microsoft to
  buy the popular social media network, so long as a deal takes place by
  Sept. 15.
\item
  ``It can't be controlled for security reasons by China,'' Trump said
  in comments at the White House. He said he would not mind if Microsoft
  or another ``very American'' company bought it.
\item
  Trump suggested that the government should be compensated for letting
  a deal go through, although he didn't make it clear how such a premium
  might be collected. ``A very substantial portion of that price is
  going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States, because
  we're making it possible for this deal to happen,'' Trump said.
\item
  Administration officials and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have
  repeatedly cited security concerns over TikTok, a viral video app
  popular with children and young adults, saying it
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-microsoft-tweens.html}{could
  potentially allow the Chinese government access} to American user
  data.
\item
  \textbf{Seven years of allegedly defrauding the government}. \$100
  million in losses. One on-the-record exchange between a senior Trump
  administration official and a senator, during a congressional hearing,
  in which
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/yrc-coronavirus-relief-funds.html}{the
  official pledges to see if he can help the company}.
\item
  These are all at the heart of a deal that the government struck with
  YRC Worldwide, a trucking company that had been sued by the Justice
  Department --- until the administration decided to extend it a loan of
  \$700 million, in exchange for a 30 percent stake in the business.
\item
  The deal, approved on the grounds that YRC was essential to national
  security, sent the company's stock soaring and made YRC one of the
  largest recipients of taxpayer money allocated as part of the
  coronavirus relief legislation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Barack Obama is wading more deeply} into the 2020 campaign,
  and yesterday
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage\#link-3de249e6}{he
  released his first slate of endorsements}. He lent his support to 118
  candidates in 17 states, including 52 for the House of Representatives
  and five for the Senate in key battlegrounds.
\item
  All five of the Senate endorsements are of Democratic challengers
  running to unseat Republicans --- in Colorado, Iowa, Maine, North
  Carolina and South Carolina. For now, he's staying out of the Senate
  races in certain conservative-leaning states --- including Montana,
  Kentucky, Georgia and Texas --- where Democratic candidates are also
  challenging Republican incumbents, but where it isn't clear if his
  endorsement would have the desired effect.
\item
  Ten of the candidates endorsed by Obama were alumni of his
  presidential administration.
\item
  All eyes are on Joe Biden as
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/biden-vice-president-2020.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&module=styln-elections-2020\&region=TOP_BANNER\&context=storylines_menu}{he
  moves toward an announcement of his choice of a running mate}. He
  recently indicated that he would make a decision this week, though his
  aides now say the choice won't become public until next week.
\item
  \textbf{The White House is carrying out mandatory, random coronavirus
  testing} for its staff in an effort to contain the virus's spread at a
  time when it is pervading several regions of the country. Trump's
  national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, was revealed last week to
  have tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the latest in a
  string of administration officials to contract it.
\item
  The testing decision arrived a day after Dr. Deborah Birx, the White
  House coronavirus response coordinator, said on CNN that the pandemic
  had entered a ``new phase'' in which the virus was ``extraordinarily
  widespread'' in rural areas as well as urban ones, in part because it
  was being transmitted by asymptomatic people.
\item
  Trump and other Republicans attacked Birx for her proclamation. The
  president tweeted that her comments were ``pathetic'' and painted the
  bad news as Democratic propaganda. He sought to walk back those
  remarks in an evening news conference, expressing his ``respect'' for
  Birx.
\item
  Also yesterday,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html\#link-4e40df05}{Dr.
  Anthony Fauci backed up Birx's analysis} during a news conference at
  which he joined the governor of Connecticut by video conference.
  Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said Birx had
  been referring to the ``inherent community spread'' happening in some
  states. ``When you have community spread, it's much more difficult to
  get your arms around that and contain it,'' he said.

\subsection{Young voters haven't forgotten about gun control, but they
see it as inextricably linked to racial
justice.}\label{young-voters-havent-forgotten-about-gun-control-but-they-see-it-as-inextricably-linked-to-racial-justice}}

Yesterday was exactly one year since the massacre in El Paso, where a
gunman who the authorities say was motivated by anti-Hispanic hatred
killed 23 people at a Walmart Supercenter.

Young gun-control activists in El Paso gathered for a vigil last night
at the site of the attack, where they were joined by other community
groups.

Joe Biden released a campaign
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbQQEPwarmU}{advertisement}
recognizing the anniversary. In it, he says that Americans must ``stand
against hate.''

And Students Demand Action, a grass-roots arm of the nonprofit Everytown
for Gun Safety, \href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CDbpUdzHq_L/}{posted a
message} on Instagram in remembrance of the victims. ``We are committed
to fighting for stronger gun legislation, because too often guns end up
in the wrong hands and make hatred lethal,'' the post read.

Each of these acts of commemoration acknowledged the shooting not only
as part of a national scourge of gun violence but also as an example of
the country's struggle with racism.

It has been over two years since young activists led the March for Our
Lives, storming Washington with a demand for change after a school
shooting in Parkland, Fla., left 17 people dead. In those years, March
for Our Lives and Students Demand Action have sprouted hundreds of
chapters across the country. In 2018, their organizing efforts helped
drive a surge in youth turnout in the 2018 midterm elections. And they
have committed themselves to making just as big an impact this year.

The only catch is that many of those young voters who said that gun
safety was their top priority in the months after Parkland have now
turned their most intense focus toward other issues, particularly
matters of racial justice, according to polls.

Still, activists insist that it isn't a matter of either/or.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/gun-control-voters.html}{In
our interview for an article published yesterday}, Alanna Miller, a
19-year-old organizer with Students Demand Action, said that the overlap
between issues of racial justice and gun violence was in fact central to
activists' focus this year.

``I don't know if I would still be in this movement, organizing, if I
hadn't expanded my worldview in thinking about this issue and how
insidious and how pervasive it is,'' Miller said.

And Charlie Kelly, Everytown's senior political director, said that
drawing these ties resonated with the young voters whom organizers were
seeking to mobilize. ``When we put out a call to our supporters to
support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, we saw students take
action at twice the rate of any previous action,'' he said.
