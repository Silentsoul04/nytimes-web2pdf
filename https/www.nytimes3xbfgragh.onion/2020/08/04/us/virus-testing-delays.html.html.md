Frustrated by a nationwide testing backlog, the governors of six states
took the unusual step of banding together on Tuesday to reduce the
turnaround time for coronavirus test results from days to minutes.

The agreement, by three Republican governors and three Democratic
governors, was called the first interstate testing compact of its kind.
The six states — Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio and
Virginia — agreed to work with the Rockefeller Foundation and two U.S.
manufacturers of rapid tests to buy three million tests.

The bipartisan plan highlights the depth of the testing problems in the
United States more than six months into the pandemic.

The United States is testing about 755,000 people a day, up from about
640,000 per day a month ago, and far more than in April and May,
[according to the Covid Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily). But numbers alone do
not tell the whole story. With testing chemicals and other equipment in
short supply, and a surge in coronavirus cases nationwide leading to
skyrocketing demands, many Americans are still having to wait many days
for results, effectively rendering those tests useless.

Most people who are tested for the virus do not receive results within
the 24 to 48 hours recommended by public health experts to effectively
stall the virus’s spread and quickly conduct contact tracing, according
to a [new national
survey](https://covidstates.net/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%208%20TEST%20JULY%202020.pdf)
by researchers from Harvard University, Northeastern University,
Northwestern University and Rutgers University.

The survey — representing 19,000 people from 50 states and Washington,
D.C., who responded to an online questionnaire last month — found
lengthy wait times among those who had been tested for the virus, about
18 percent of all respondents. People who had been tested for the virus
in July reported an average wait time of about four days. That is about
the same wait time for those who reported taking a test in April. Over
all, about 10 percent of people reported waiting 10 days or more.

Respondents in a vast majority of states reported a median turnaround
time of at least three days, including residents of California, Florida,
Texas and other hot
spots.

The survey also found disparities across racial groups, an indication
that people who are hit hardest by the pandemic are also having to wait
longer for test results. Black people surveyed reported an average wait
time for results of five days, and Hispanic respondents reported an
average wait time of 4.6 days, compared with 3.9 days for white people.

“Testing is just not quick enough,” said Matthew A. Baum, a professor of
public policy at Harvard University and one of the researchers in the
group, which found that wait times were “strikingly similar” across the
country. “This is an enormously widespread problem.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The challenge, experts say, is a basic issue of supply and demand. About
half of all coronavirus tests are conducted by large-scale commercial
laboratory companies like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, which are
racing to turn around swabs while competing with a global market. There
is also a critical shortage of certain equipment and supplies, including
reagents, the chemical ingredients needed to detect whether the
coronavirus is present in a sample.

Federal officials argue that long wait times are unusual, citing figures
that more than 80 percent of tests are completed within three days. With
plans to reduce the share of tests done by commercial labs, shifting
more responsibility to hospitals and other facilities where tests can be
done in as little as 15 minutes, officials say that turnaround times are
expected to improve soon. Still, labs around the country have been
feeling the pressure for weeks.

In Brunswick, Ga., lab technicians are working around the clock.
Machines churn out results in 50 minutes to four and a half hours, but
there are so many orders that the labs cannot keep up. Regular shipments
of chemicals needed to test for the virus do not last even a week, so
pathologists have begun to carefully dole out their supplies.

“We literally ration tests,” said Dr. Patrick Godbey, the president of
the College of American Pathologists and the director of two labs in the
Brunswick area. He estimated that for every test his labs are able to
perform, they have to send three to national commercial laboratory
companies.

“Why keep a backlog?” he said. “Tomorrow is going to be just as busy.”

In California, Dr. Amir Jamali, an orthopedic surgeon, had to order
swabs from eBay in order to test surgery patients at his practice in the
Bay Area. He paid about $50 for a bundle of five, which he said was far
above the normal price. But now, Dr. Jamali said, the effort has been
largely for naught because turnaround times at local labs are inching
longer by the day.

“We used to be able to get it within 24 and 48 hours,” Dr. Jamali said.
“Almost every week it’s increasing to three day, five days, seven
days, 10 days.” In that time, he fears his patients could have gone to a
party or a barbecue, potentially exposing other people, as well as his
staff and other patients. Some days, he has had to cancel surgery rather
than risk exposure.

The problem spans much of the country. In Alabama, the health department
recently put out a warning that the turnaround time for test results has
ballooned to an average of seven days.

“A test result that comes back in seven or eight days is worthless for
everybody — it shouldn’t even be counted,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a
senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health
Security and a physician in Pittsburgh. “It’s not a test in any kind of
effective manner because it’s not actionable.”

Despite a shortage of the chemical reagents, Dr. Adalja said he
typically has no problem getting a quick test for hospitalized patients,
who are given priority. But people who go to a drive-through clinic or
walk into a CVS may have to wait much longer for their tests to come
through the
system.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Based on federal guidance, LabCorp said it was prioritizing hospitalized
patients and nursing home tests. “All other testing for patients are
performed in the order in which they are received,” a spokeswoman said
in a statement. As of July 30, the company reported that its turnaround
time for test results was two to three days from when the sample was
picked up.

Quest Diagnostics, another major commercial lab, is [reporting a
turnaround time of five
days](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates/) for
all patients, and two for patients who were the highest priority.

James Davis, executive vice president of general diagnostics for Quest,
said that the company had recently ramped up testing by acquiring its
own testing process and ingredients, and that it was already seeing
improvements in turnaround times. But he said there was only so much
that can be done because a majority of about 150,000 tests that Quest
performs each day rely on automated testing machines from two companies
that must use reagent kits from those companies, similar to a Honda car
that needed a replacement part made by Honda.

“Right now, we live hand to mouth,” he said of the chemicals. “I need a
shipment on Monday to make sure all of my labs run through Wednesday,
and then on Wednesday, I need another shipment,” he said, adding,
“That’s how tight the supply chain is.”

The six-state agreement announced on Tuesday showed how the lack of a
federal testing program has left municipalities and states to fend for
themselves. The Trump administration has provided new support to
hard-hit regions by providing free coronavirus testing in cities through
a “surge testing” program announced last month. But the bulk of
government-sponsored testing has been provided by cities, counties and
states that hire third-party contractors such as Quest and LabCorp. As a
result, the length of the delay varies between states, and within them.

In Texas, officials in San Antonio said it was taking 24 to 36 hours to
get test results back at a free government-run testing site at Freeman
Coliseum. The wait was longer at Legacy Community Health clinics in
Houston and the surrounding Gulf Coast region, where test results were
on a two-day to five-day turnaround time.

On Tuesday, officials in Harris County, which includes Houston, said
they were increasing testing capacity and shortening lab turnaround
times as part of federal “surge testing.” The temporary support, which
lasts until 30,000 testing samples are reached at two free testing
sites, will have test results in three to five business days.

The compact was negotiated by the Rockefeller Foundation and Gov. Larry
Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, during the final days of his tenure as
chairman of the National Governors Association. Instead of each of the
six states separately ordering thousands of tests, the group of states
is instead in discussions with the two U.S. manufacturers of antigen
tests, the Quidel Corporation and Becton, Dickinson & Company, to buy
three million tests, or 500,000 tests per state.

Unlike the more readily available tests that use polymerase chain
reaction, or P.C.R., antigen tests can rapidly determine whether a
person has been infected by the virus by detecting fragments of virus in
a sample. The tests will deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, the
governors said. Still, scientists have said the tests can frequently
miss infections. Tests from both Becton Dickinson and Quidel [could
produce false negative
results](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
between 15 and 20 percent of the time.

The Trump administration’s testing czar, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, [told
Congress last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-testing.html)
that “turnaround times are definitely improving.” But Admiral Giroir, a
doctor and the assistant secretary for health, testified that getting
test results within two to three days “is not a possible benchmark we
can achieve today.”
