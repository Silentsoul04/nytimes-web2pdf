For 45 minutes, Clinton Phillips and his family soared in a hot-air
balloon Monday morning, high above Jackson Hole, a bucolic mountain
valley in Wyoming that is popular with tourists.

“This is the greatest thing we’ve ever done as a family,” he recalled
thinking. Then, a strong gust of wind threw Mr. Phillips’s balloon out
of control. “I looked past my wife and I just screamed, ‘Brace for
impact\!’” he said.

After that impact, when they rolled out of the balloon, Mr. Phillips
said everyone in his family was limping; his son thought he’d had a
concussion, and his wife’s ribs were broken.

The balloon carrying Mr. Philips and 20 others was one of three hot air
balloons owned by the same company to crash on Monday morning about the
same time, officials said.

The precise number of people injured was unclear. The local sheriff’s
office said “multiple victims” were transported to hospitals for
treatment. Mr. Phillips said his family and others decided not to wait
for ambulances and took themselves to local hospitals. At least one
victim was flown to a hospital in Idaho Falls, according to The
Associated Press.

The president of the balloon company said that they were carrying 38
passengers
total.

Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal
Aviation Administration are investigating the crashes, according to
Sheriff Matt Carr of Teton County.

Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman for the F.A.A. said “each balloon landed
hard under unknown circumstances in Teton Village” shortly before 8 a.m.
Messages left for the N.T.S.B. were not immediately returned.

The three balloons crashed across an area that was approximately
one-third of a mile, the sheriff said in a statement.

“I was dragged, slamming into the ground four times, for 200 yards,”
said Mr. Phillips. “You didn’t know when it was going to stop.”

In an interview Monday night, the president of Wyoming Balloon Company,
the tour company that owns the balloons, said that they made “high-wind
landings” in response to a sudden wind gust.

The forecast had called for clear conditions and “light winds,” said the
company president, Andrew Breffeilh. The wind gusts were “outside the
forecast,” he said.

“High-wind landings happen every day,” Mr. Breffeilh said.

“Every high-wind landing looks like a crash,” he added. “It skids and
bounces.”

But Monday’s landings were more severe, he said. The winds were so
strong that “it took us 300 feet to stop after I opened up the valve” in
the balloon, he said. “That’s a pretty long drag.”

“Considering the conditions we were in, there could have been worse
results in winds that strong,” he said.

One of Mr. Phillips’s daughters fainted, he said. Another daughter, who
because of a previous incident can use only one of her arms, managed to
stay inside the balloon only because she was squashed under fellow
passengers.

Mr. Phillips’s son had to push against the ground as they were skidding
to keep himself in the balloon.

“His arm could have been ripped off,” Mr. Phillips said. “If anyone had
fallen out, I think they would have been killed, because the cage is so
hard and heavy, it would have crushed you.”

In the interview, Mr. Breffeilh initially declined to characterize what
happened on Monday as a “crash.” Later, he said, “You can call it what
you want. People were injured.”

Typically landings are so smooth “you may not feel the touchdown,” Mr.
Breffeilh said.

He said his company had never had<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>a crash in 31 years of operating. The passengers on Monday, he
said, “were all scared.”

“The most important thing is to get them down as quickly and safely as
possible,” Mr. Breffeilh said.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

It was not clear when balloons from the company would lift off again.
Mr. Breffeilh said he was “considering a stand-down for some period of
time in order to learn from what happened today” and to cooperate with
federal investigations.
