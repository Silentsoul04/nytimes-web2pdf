TAIPEI, Taiwan — The United States’ top health official, Alex M. Azar
II, will lead a delegation on a trip to Taiwan, a rare high-level visit
by an American official to the island that is likely to anger China and
further fray ties between Beijing and Washington.

The trip by Mr. Azar, the secretary of health and human services, will
be the first by a U.S. health secretary and the first in six years by a
U.S. cabinet member, the department said in a
[statement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/08/04/hhs-secretary-alex-azar-lead-delegation-taiwan-in-first-visit-by-us-hhs-secretary.html)
on Tuesday.

No date was given for the visit to Taiwan, a self-ruled territory that
is claimed by Beijing, but the health department billed it as an
opportunity to strengthen economic and public health cooperation between
the United States and Taiwan and to highlight [Taiwan’s success in
battling the coronavirus
pandemic.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/world/asia/taiwan-vice-president-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=9)

“Taiwan has been a model of transparency and cooperation in global
health during the Covid-19 pandemic and long before it,” Mr. Azar said
in the department’s statement. “I look forward to conveying President
Trump’s support for Taiwan’s global health leadership and underscoring
our shared belief that free and democratic societies are the best model
for protecting and promoting health.”

As of Tuesday, the island of 23 million people just off the coast of
southern China had reported 476 coronavirus cases and seven deaths.
Officials in Taiwan have tried to turn their relative success in
battling the coronavirus at home [into a geopolitical
victory.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/world/asia/coronavirus-china-taiwan.html?searchResultPosition=4)
The island has sent millions of masks, emblazoned with the words “made
in Taiwan,” to the United States, Italy and other countries devastated
by the
coronavirus.

It has also promoted itself as a model of democracy amid China’s own
campaign to use the crisis to promote the strength of its authoritarian
system.

The announcement of Mr. Azar’s visit comes as case numbers have been
surging throughout most of the United States, where more than 4.7
million people have been infected and at least 157,100 have died,
according to a New York Times database.

Chinese officials did not immediately respond to the announcement. But
Mr. Azar’s visit will almost certainly enrage Beijing, which has long
sought to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and has objected to U.S. support
for the island, which remains an important, though unofficial, American
ally in the Pacific region. Though the United States has been cautious
in holding official contact with Taiwan, it continues to be the island’s
leading arms supplier.

Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that Mr. Azar would meet
with senior Taiwanese leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen.
Discussions are expected to touch on Taiwan’s role as a supplier of
medical equipment and critical technology, among other issues, the U.S.
health department said. The island is home to one of the world’s leading
computer chip makers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and is
a major manufacturer of medical masks and other hospital equipment.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The health secretary will also deliver a speech in which he will
highlight “Taiwan’s constructive role in the international community,
especially in global public health,” the statement said.

The trip threatens to further fuel tensions between the United States
and China, with diplomatic ties reaching their lowest point since the
two countries normalized relations more than four decades ago. The two
superpowers have become increasingly locked in a fast-growing battle on
multiple fronts, including in trade, technology, defense and human
rights.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In addition, Beijing has in recent years [steadily picked
off](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/16/world/asia/solomon-islands-taiwan-china.html)
Taiwan’s few remaining official allies and has blocked Taiwan’s
participation as an observer in the World Health Assembly, the World
Health Organization’s top decision-making body.

The tense relations between Beijing and Taiwan dates to 1949, when the
Communist Party defeated its Nationalist rivals, who fled to the island
and set up the Republic of China government that still rules the
territory today. Unification with Taiwan remains one of the Chinese
Communist Party’s ultimate goals, and in recent years, China’s top
leader, Xi Jinping, has bluntly warned that any move toward formal
independence by the island would invite military force.

Mr. Azar will be the highest-ranking American cabinet official to visit
the island since 1979, the year the U.S. switched its recognition of the
Chinese government from Taiwan to Beijing. The last trip by a U.S.
cabinet-level official to Taiwan was in 2014 by Gina McCarthy, then the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Health and Human Services Department did not say whether Mr. Azar
would attend an official memorial that has been established in Taipei
for [Lee
Teng-hui,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/world/asia/lee-teng-hui-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1)
the former Taiwanese president who died last week.

In a
