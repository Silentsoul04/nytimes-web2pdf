Australia’s second-largest city, Melbourne, is grappling with a
spiraling coronavirus outbreak that has led to a lockdown with some of
the toughest restrictions in the world — offering a preview of what many
urban dwellers elsewhere could confront in coming weeks and months.

The new lockdown is the product of early success; the country thought it
had the virus beat in June. But there was a [breakdown in the quarantine
program for
hotels](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/how-hotel-quarantine-let-covid-19-out-of-the-bag-in-victoria-20200703-p558og.html).
Returning travelers passed the virus to hotel security guards in
Melbourne, who carried the contagion home.

Even after masks became mandatory in the city two weeks ago, the spread
continued. And now, as officials try to break the chain of infections,
Melbourne is being reshaped by sweeping enforcement and fine print. A
confounding matrix of hefty fines for disobedience to the lockdown and
minor exceptions for everything from romantic partners to home building
has led to silenced streets and endless versions of the question: So,
wait, can I \_\_\_\_?

Restaurant owners are wondering about food delivery after an 8 p.m.
curfew began on Sunday night. Teenagers are asking if their boyfriends
and girlfriends count as essential partners. Can animal shelter
volunteers walk dogs at night? Are house cleaners essential for those
struggling with their mental health? Can people who have been tested
exercise outside?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is such a weird, scary, bizarro time that we live in,” said
Tessethia Von Tessle Roberts, 25, a student in Melbourne who admits to
having hit a breaking point a few days ago, when her washing machine
broke.

“Our health care workers are hustling around the clock to keep us
alive,” she said. “Our politicians are as scared as we are, but they
have to pretend like they have a better idea than we do of what’s going
to happen next.”

Pandemic lockdowns, never easy, are getting ever more confusing and
contentious as they evolve in the face of second and third rounds of
outbreaks that have exhausted both officials and residents. With success
against the virus as fleeting as the breeze, the new waves of
restrictions feel to many like a bombing raid that just won’t end.

For some places, risk calculations can change overnight. In Hong Kong,
officials banned daytime dining in restaurants last month, only to
[reverse themselves a day
later](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/world/asia/hongkong-dining-lunch-coronavirus.html)
after an outcry. Schools in some cities are opening and closing like
screen doors in summer.

Whatever the metaphor, the situation is bleak.

In Melbourne, a city of five million that is considered a capital of
food and culture, the pandemic has come raging back even after a
so-called Stage 3 lockdown began in early July — until recently the
highest level of restrictions.

Officials have been flummoxed at every turn by the persistent
complacency of just enough people to let the virus thrive and multiply.

Traffic data showed people [driving more in
July](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/lockdown-2-0-traffic-worse-compared-with-april-but-less-than-pre-covid-20200801-p55hlq.html)
than they had during the first Stage 3 lockdown, in March and April.
Even worse, almost nine out of 10 people with Covid-19 had not been
tested or isolated when they first felt sick, Mr. Andrews, the state’s
top leader, said in late July. And 53 percent had not quarantined while
waiting for their test results.

“That means people have felt unwell and just gone about their business,”
Mr. Andrews said.

Sounding the alarm, he made face masks mandatory the next day, on July
22.

Still, infections have continued to rise. They peaked at 753 new cases
on July 30, and have hovered around 500 a day ever since, with the death
toll in Victoria now standing at 147, after 11 deaths were recorded on
Monday.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Those figures, while far less troublesome than those in the United
States, have paved the way for a Stage 4 lockdown — what officials are
calling a “shock and awe” attack on the virus — that will last at least
six
weeks.

Overwhelming force, with precision, seems to be the goal. The chief
modelers of the pandemic response in Australia have found that the virus
can be suppressed only if more than 70 percent of the population abides
by social distancing guidelines and other public health rules.

Mr. Andrews said the new restrictions would take 250,000 more people out
of their routines, in the hopes of reaching the necessary threshold.

So retail stores will be closed. Schools will return to at-home
instruction. Restaurants will be takeout or delivery only. Child-care
centers will be available only for permitted workers.

Those restrictions are already well understood. The rules requiring more
explanation are tied to the curfew and industries that have to cut back.

Large-scale construction projects of more than three stories, for
example, will have to reduce their on-site work force by 75 percent, and
workers will not be able to work at more than one location. Small-scale
construction cannot have more than five workers.

All of which sounds clear. But does a bathroom renovation, for example,
amount to home building in an apartment with one bathroom? And what
about fixing things that break, like Ms. Von Tessle Roberts’s washing
machine?

Some businesses, like cleaning services, are already emailing customers
to say they think they can do some work, for people who pay through
welfare or who need help for mental health reasons. But, like many
others, they are still seeking official
clarification.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

On Tuesday, he answered questions from reporters about dog-walking
(allowed after curfew, sort of, only near home) and other subjects of
great confusion at a news conference in Melbourne.

Thanking those who complied with the new rules and scolding those who
did not, he announced that no one in self-isolation would now be allowed
to exercise outdoors. A door-knocking campaign to check in on 3,000
people who had Covid-19 found that 800 of them were not at home.

All 800 have been referred to the Victoria police for investigation. The
fine for violators going forward, he said, will be 4,957 Australian
dollars, $3,532.

Working, even legally, will also become trickier. Other than, say,
hospital workers with formal identification, everyone traveling for a
job deemed essential during the lockdown must carry a formal document —
a work permit signed by the employer and employee.

For Cara Devine, who works at a wine store that closes at 8 p.m., that
means carrying a government form with her everywhere, and hoping that
the police recognize her task as essential when she heads home after the
curfew. But she also worried about the Uber drivers who take her back
and
forth.

“Even before the newest restrictions, I’ve had two Uber drivers being
really late picking up from the shop because they got stopped by the
police, taking about an hour out of their work time,” she said.

The police are already confronting opposition. On at least four
occasions in the last week, they reported having to smash the windows of
cars and pull people out after they refused to provide a name and
address at a police checkpoint. The Victoria police commissioner, Shane
Patton, said a 38-year-old woman had also been charged with assault
after attacking a police officer who had stopped her for not wearing a
face mask.

Some criminologists are questioning whether the harsher enforcement will
help. Mostly, though, Melburnians are just trying to endure.

Walking to get groceries, Peter Barnes, 56, said he welcomed the
stricter rules, though he admitted his city was starting to feel like
George Orwell’s “1984,” with the heavy hand of the state around every
corner.

Those focused solely on the economics, he said, should remember the
obvious: “You can’t hire a corpse. Very bad employment prospects for
people who are dead.”

By Monday night, the city seemed to be in listening mode. The streets
were emptying out, silent in hibernation.

“It’s like a Sunday in the 1950s,” said Mark Rubbo, the owner of
Readings, Melbourne’s largest independent bookstore. He also noted that
people were stocking up again on books through online orders, with a
memoir called [“The Happiest Man on
Earth,”](https://www.readings.com.au/products/32836563/the-happiest-man-on-earth)
about a Holocaust survivor, becoming a runaway hit.

Ms. Von Tessle Roberts has found another solution, perhaps just as
likely to grow in popularity: [Stand on your front porch and
scream](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/events/2738223623055680/).
That’s the name she has given to an event she posted on Facebook, set
for Friday at 7 p.m. By Tuesday afternoon, 70,000 people had expressed
an interest in joining her collective shout in anguish.

“Yelling is great,” she said. “It’s less dehydrating than
crying.”
