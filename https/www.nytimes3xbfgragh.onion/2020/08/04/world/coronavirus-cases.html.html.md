# Coronavirus Live Updates: McConnell Signals Openness to Jobless Aid Extension

</div>

Tens of millions of Americans have lost crucial jobless benefits, and
lawmakers still can’t seem to agree on a relief measure. Israel’s
troubled school reopenings could be a lesson for the U.S.

<div class="css-192lewg e1oheyly0">

Right Now

Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi, a Republican, said that masks would be
mandatory in public and retail spaces statewide starting

As talks drag on, McConnell signals openness to jobless aid extension,
and negotiators agree on a deadline.

Negotiators on Capitol Hill reported little progress on Tuesday toward
reaching an agreement over an economic recovery package. But the top
Senate Republican signaled that he might be willing to reverse course
and accept the extension of $600-per-week jobless-aid payments that many
in his party oppose if it would yield a compromise, and the White House
and congressional Democrats agreed to an end-of-the-week deadline to
seal a deal.

“The American people, in the end, need help,” Senator Mitch McConnell,
Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, told reporters. “And
wherever this thing settles between the president of the United States
and his team that has to sign it into law and the Democrat
not-insignificant minority in the Senate and majority in the House is
something I am prepared to support, even if I have some problems with
certain parts of it.”

Democrats [have rejected narrow
proposals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-jobless-aid.html)
extending the expired benefits, insisting that the problem must be dealt
with in a broader package of relief measures. They also want aid for
states and cities whose budgets have been crippled.

Mr. McConnell’s comments came after he and other Republicans huddled
privately over lunch with Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff,
and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Afterward, Republican
senators who have largely sat out the talks sounded downbeat about
striking a deal before they are scheduled to begin a monthlong recess on
Friday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But later, after a meeting with Mr. Meadows and Mr. Mnuchin, top
Democrats indicated there had been progress.

“They made some concessions, which we appreciated; we made some
concessions, which they appreciated,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York,
the Democratic leader, said after the 90-minute meeting, which Speaker
Nancy Pelosi of California hosted in her Capitol Hill suite. “We’re
still far away on a lot of the important issues, but we’re continuing to
go at it.”

Tens of millions of Americans have lost crucial [unemployment
benefits](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F07%2F30%2Fbusiness%2Funemployment-payments-change.html)
that formally expired on Friday, and economists warn that permanent
damage could be wrought on the economy without action.

Republican leaders have put forward their own plan to extend the weekly
benefit at a significantly lower level. But many of their own
rank-and-file members oppose even that, giving them little leverage
against the united Democrats.

At the White House, Mr. Trump continued to dangle the possibility that
he could circumvent Congress and take executive action to halt evictions
nationwide and suspend the payroll tax. It is far from clear that the
president has the power to do either of
these<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>unilaterally, but his
deputies appeared to be using the possibility as a negotiating tactic
with Democrats — and to get around the objections even within Mr.
Trump’s own party on the payroll-tax issue.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We want to take care of the eviction problem,” Mr. Trump said at a news
conference. “People are being evicted unfairly. It’s not their fault.
It’s China’s fault.”

The president blamed the Democrats for rejecting White House offers to
pass a short-term extension of the expired unemployment benefits and
said the only thing Democrats “really want to do is bail out states that
have been poorly managed by Democrats.”

Novavax, the little-known Maryland company that [received a $1.6
billion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html)
deal from the federal government for its experimental coronavirus
vaccine, announced encouraging results in two preliminary studies on
Tuesday.

In one study, 56 volunteers produced a high level of antibodies against
the virus without any dangerous side effects. In the other, researchers
found that the vaccine strongly protected monkeys from coronavirus
infections.

Although it’s not possible to directly compare the data from clinical
trials of different coronavirus vaccines, John Moore, a virologist at
Weill Cornell Medicine who was not involved in the studies, said the
Novavax results were the most impressive he had seen so far.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is the first one I’m looking at and saying, ‘Yeah, I’d take
that,’” Dr. Moore said.

Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University who was not
involved in the studies, called them “encouraging preliminary results,”
but cautioned that it won’t be possible to say whether the vaccine is
safe and effective until Novavax conducts a large-scale study — known as
Phase III — comparing people who get vaccinated with people who get a
placebo.

The company, which has never brought a vaccine to market in its 33-year
history, has said that if its vaccine is shown to be effective, it can
produce 100 million doses by the beginning of next year, or enough to
give to 50 million people if administered in two doses. Under its deal
with the federal government, the company will also receive money to
undertake large-scale manufacturing of millions more doses if the
vaccine is shown to work.

Novavax’s vaccine is [one of more than two dozen
products](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
to have entered the first round of safety tests in people, known as
Phase I trials. Five other coronavirus vaccines are already in Phase III
trials, in which thousands of people are tested to see if a vaccine
works.

In Mississippi, masks are now mandatory in public and retail spaces
statewide, the governor announced Tuesday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, said at a news conference that he was
“implementing a statewide mask mandate today.” He also said that all
students and teachers would be mandated to wear masks when schools open
in the fall, unless they have a medical reason not to. And he said that
he was pushing back the start of the school year in eight counties that
have been hit hardest by the coronavirus.

“I know that I want to see college football in the fall,” he added. “The
best way for that to occur is for us all to recognize that wearing a
mask, as irritating as it can be — and I promise you, I hate it more
than anybody watching today — it is critical.”

Previously, masks had been mandated in 37 of Mississippi’s 82 counties.
At the news conference, Mr. Reeves noted that his “piecemeal approach”
had been criticized “by an awful lot of people.”

Mr. Reeves has also been criticized for [failing to encourage many
businesses to shut
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/us/mississippi-coronavirus-essential-businesses-tate-reeves.html)
during the early months of the pandemic. And in the months that
followed, he had been eager to lift restrictions that were stalling
Mississippi’s economy, hoping to have the whole state open by July 1.

According to [a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/mississippi-coronavirus-cases.html),
at least 8 new coronavirus deaths and 572 new cases were reported in
Mississippi on Monday. Over the past week, there have been an average of
1,167 cases per day, an increase of 13 percent from the average two
weeks earlier.

On Monday, Mr. Reeves said the state was “starting to turn a corner.”

“Things are improving here,” he said. “But that does not mean that we
can declare victory and take a step back.”

Elsewhere in the U.S:

  - **Students in Ohio** will also wear face coverings when they return
    to school in the fall, Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said Tuesday.
    The order will apply to students from kindergarten through Grade 12,
    with exemptions for children who have developmental delays or who
    cannot remove their masks without assistance. Mr. DeWine [cited
    recommendations](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1290715998102880259)
    from the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association and the state’s
    chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which said in a
    letter Tuesday that children returning to school should wear masks.
    “We are going to make that an order from the health department,”
    Mr. DeWine said. “I have great confidence that the teachers will
    work this out with kids.”

  - Public and private schools in **Maryland** are divided over
    in-person instruction. An emergency order [issued
    Monday](https://twitter.com/GovLarryHogan/status/1290330304830246912)
    by Gov. Larry Hogan countermanded a Montgomery County Health
    Department directive instructing private schools to [start the year
    teaching
    remotely](https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OPI/Resources/Files/pdf/2020/NonPublicSchools_07-31-20.pdf),
    as every public school district in the Washington area has already
    decided to do. Mr. Hogan, a Republican, said that county health
    officers didn’t have the authority to stop private schools from
    reopening. A similar dynamic is [playing out in some other parts of
    the
    country](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/upshot/coronavirus-school-reopening-private-public-gap.html),
    where public schools are opening remotely while private schools are
    planning in-person or various hybrid models.

  - A [rash of positive
    cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/school-closing-coronavirus.html)
    during the first week of school in some **parts of the United
    States** foreshadows a stop-and-start year in which students and
    staff members may have to bounce between instruction in the
    classroom and remotely at home because of infections and
    quarantines.

  - In his first report to Congress since being appointed by Mr. Trump
    in June, **Brian D. Miller**, the inspector general overseeing the
    Treasury Department’s $500 billion pandemic recovery fund, said some
    individuals and companies have been able to draw from multiple pots
    of federal pandemic relief money at the same time, a practice he
    warned could lead to an increase in fraud and abuse. Mr. Miller, a
    former White House lawyer, offered a broad overview of his
    responsibilities in his report on Tuesday and provided status
    updates on the lending programs that Treasury is managing as part of
    the $2.2 trillion law enacted in March.

  - Counting for **the 2020 census** will end on Sept. 30, a month
    earlier than previously scheduled, the Census Bureau [said in a
    statement on
    Monday](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/delivering-complete-accurate-count.html).
    In recent weeks, the Trump administration and Senate Republicans
    appeared to signal that they [wanted the census finished well ahead
    of
    schedule](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/trump-census.html).

  - Isaias pounded a large swath of the Atlantic Coast on Tuesday,
    unleashing heavy rains and winds as fast as 70 miles per hour as the
    storm swept through the Carolinas and into the Northeast. Shelters
    had prepared to deal with a dual threat from severe weather and the
    virus by screening for symptoms, socially distancing people and
    distributing protective gear. The storm has also closed **testing
    centers** from Florida to Maryland, which could complicate efforts
    to gauge virus
transmission.

The United States’ top health official, Alex M. Azar II, will lead a
delegation on a trip to Taiwan, a rare high-level visit by an American
official to the island that has won praise for its success in battling
the coronavirus.

Despite the likelihood that the visit will anger China and further fray
ties between Beijing and Washington, officials billed it as an
opportunity to strengthen economic and public health cooperation between
the United States and Taiwan, a self-ruled territory that is claimed by
Beijing.

As of Tuesday, the island of 23 million people just off the coast of
southern China had reported 476 coronavirus cases and seven deaths.
Officials in Taiwan have tried to turn their relative success in
battling the coronavirus at home [into a geopolitical
victory.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/world/asia/coronavirus-china-taiwan.html?searchResultPosition=4)
The island has sent millions of masks, emblazoned with the words “made
in Taiwan,” to the United States, Italy and other countries devastated
by the coronavirus.

No date was given for the visit. The trip by Mr. Azar, the secretary of
health and human services, will be the first by a U.S. health secretary
and the first in six years by a U.S. cabinet member, the department said
in a
[statement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/08/04/hhs-secretary-alex-azar-lead-delegation-taiwan-in-first-visit-by-us-hhs-secretary.html)
on Tuesday. He is scheduled to meet with senior Taiwanese counterparts
to discuss Taiwan’s role as a supplier of medical equipment and critical
technology, among other issues, the health department said.

“Taiwan has been a model of transparency and cooperation in global
health during the Covid-19 pandemic and long before it,” Mr. Azar said
in the department’s statement. “I look forward to conveying President
Trump’s support for Taiwan’s global health leadership and underscoring
our shared belief that free and democratic societies are the best model
for protecting and promoting health.”

The United Nations on Tuesday called for the world’s schools to make
plans to reopen safely — but only after countries suppress transmission
of the virus and control outbreaks.

“With the combined effect of the pandemic’s worldwide economic impact
and the school closures, the learning crisis could turn into a
generational catastrophe,” [a U.N. policy
brief](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/sg_policy_brief_covid-19_and_education_august_2020.pdf)
from U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said.

The announcement argued that the adjustments made by schools worldwide
to closing orders made in response to the coronavirus — providing
lessons online, over radio, even on television in some places —
highlighted inequalities among students and school districts and left
many children behind, including those with disabilities.

“Parents, especially women, have been forced to assume heavy care
burdens in the home,” the brief said.

In many countries around the world, including the United States, school
districts planning to reopen are considering various measures, including
holding classes in shifts or outdoors, mask wearing and so-called
blended classes, in which students supplement in-person lessons with
virtual ones.

Nearly every day, a crew at [Starr County Memorial, a small rural
hospital on the Mexican
border](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/texas-coronavirus-rio-grande-valley-starr-county.html),
prepares a patient whom its doctors are unable to help, loads the gurney
into a helicopter and stands back as the aircraft roars into the country
sky.

“Very, very unfortunately, of all of the patients we have transferred,
none have come back alive,” said Dr. Jose Vazquez, the health authority
in Starr County, a remote section of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas that
before the coronavirus outbreak did not have a single I.C.U. bed.

Starr County Memorial’s 45 beds were once sufficient for the roughly
65,000 people spread out along the border near Tamaulipas, Mexico. But
the new wave of coronavirus infections has been merciless, with more
than 2,110 cases in the county and nearly 70 deaths that are suspected
of being linked to Covid-19, local officials said.

The surge was slow to arrive. After neighboring counties began reporting
an explosion of infections in the spring, 21 days passed before a single
case was detected in Starr County, Dr. Vazquez said.

But when the state reopened its economy in May, the virus began
spreading rapidly through nearby Hidalgo and Cameron Counties, fueled by
poverty and chronic disease. [Large family
outbreaks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-texas-rio-grande-valley-border.html)
occurred as soon as people were allowed to leave their homes freely,
health officials said.

Starr County, [one of the poorest in the
nation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/01/25/poorest-counties-in-the-us-median-household-income/38870175/),
is not alone. A [study published this week in the journal Health
Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00581),
warning of stark disparities in the availability of critical care
facilities, found that nearly half of the nation’s communities with a
median income of $35,000 or less had no intensive care beds at all.

New York City’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, [resigned on
Tuesday in protest over her “deep
disappointment”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/nyregion/oxiris-barbot-health-commissioner-resigns.html)
with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and
subsequent efforts to keep the outbreak in check.

Her departure came after [escalating
tensions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/nyregion/coronavirus-de-blasio-mitchell-katz.html)
between City Hall and top city health department officials, which had
begun at the start of the outbreak in March, burst into public view and
raised concerns that the feuding was undermining crucial public health
policies.

“I leave my post today with deep disappointment that during the most
critical public health crisis in our lifetime, that the health
department’s incomparable disease control expertise was not used to the
degree it could have been,” she said in her resignation email sent to
Mr. de Blasio, a copy of which was shared with The New York Times.

“Our experts are world renowned for their epidemiology, surveillance and
response work. The city would be well served by having them at the
strategic center of the response not in the background.”

Mr. de Blasio reacted to her resignation by defending his handling of
the outbreak, which devastated the city in the spring, killing more than
20,000 residents, even as it has largely subsided in recent weeks.

Still, the turnover in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene comes
at a pivotal moment: Public schools are scheduled to partially open next
month — which could be crucial for the city’s recovery — and fears are
growing that the outbreak could surge again when the weather cools.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It had been clear in recent days that it was time for a change,” Mr. de
Blasio said in a hastily called news conference. “We need an atmosphere
of unity. We need an atmosphere of common purpose.”

The mayor moved quickly to replace Dr. Barbot, immediately announcing
the appointment of a new health commissioner, Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, a
former senior leader at Health + Hospitals, the city’s public hospital
system. The speed of the appointment and the robustness of the
announcement — Mr. de Blasio had lined up [a former surgeon
general](https://wayback.archive-it.org/4765/20170106172109/https:/www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/vadm-vivek-murthy/index.html)
to speak highly of Dr. Chokshi — suggested that Dr. Barbot’s resignation
had not occurred in a vacuum. One city official said she had done so on
Tuesday because she believed she was going to be fired.

than any other African country. Tanzania’s president has declared the
scourge “absolutely finished” and encouraged tourists to come back.

But outside the country, people are skeptical, and inside, few dare
stand up to the president, John Magufuli, who has become increasingly
autocratic since he was elected. Mr. Magufuli has said that the power of
prayer helped purge the virus from Tanzania, even as the African
continent is expected this week to cross the threshold of one million
reported cases.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Tanzanian president has promoted an unproven herbal tea from
Madagascar as a cure. He has disparaged social distancing and mask
wearing. And his government has not disseminated any recent data to the
World Health Organization. The group last heard from Tanzania on April
29, when the country reported 509 cases and 21 deaths from Covid-19.

Mr. Magufuli’s handling of the pandemic “has been nothing short of an
irresponsible disaster,” said Tundu Lissu, an opposition leader who
[fled the country in 2017 but recently
returned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/07/27/world/africa/ap-af-tanzania-opposition-leader-returns.html)
to run for president. “His attitude has been Covid-19 will somehow go
away if we all stop talking about it.”

In neighboring Kenya, lawmakers have also [expressed
concern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1PeaFeAxGM) about Tanzania’s
virus response. The Kenyan authorities denied entry to dozens of
Tanzanian truck drivers who had tested positive at border points.

Health experts warn that Mr. Magufuli’s denial around the virus could be
calamitous.

“With no testing data or clinical surveillance information, Tanzania
will be late in detecting and dealing with a potentially delayed
explosion of severe clinical cases,” said Frank Minja, a Tanzanian
doctor who is an associate professor of radiology and biomedical imaging
at the Yale School of Medicine.

October could be a “make-or-break election” in Tanzania’s history, Mr.
Lissu said. “We stand on the brink of disaster,” he added. “But we are
also on the brink of a miracle.”

Elsewhere around the world:

    injured thousands. The country has reported 5,062 cases and 65
    deaths from the virus, while lockdown measures have aggravated an
    already [dire economic
    crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/12/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-economic-crisis.html).

  - After Moscow announced that it would begin widespread vaccination of
    its population in October with a vaccine that had not yet been fully
    tested in clinical trials, the **World Health Organization** on
    Tuesday urged caution, recommending that the country follow
    established guidelines for producing safe vaccines. Russia is moving
    ahead with several vaccine prototypes, its officials said, and at
    least one effort, developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, is
    in advanced stages of testing and has reportedly has been tested to
    some extent on soldiers.

    weeks,” starting at 10 p.m. on Tuesday. “Nearing the end of this
    period, we will assess the health data and advise whether a further
    lockdown period is necessary,” he said. The Bahamas previously
    instituted a strict 24-hour lockdown for residents, which if broken
    could result in a $10,000 fine or 18 months in prison. Virus cases
    have [skyrocketed there

The president’s critics say he could have done much more to keep the
virus from spreading to the extent it has, including encouraging states
to be more cautious in reopening instead of encouraging them.

The country’s death toll, currently nearly 156,000, is far from the
total of “75, 80 to 100,000” deaths that [Mr. Trump predicted in early
May](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/03/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html)
when he credited himself with preventing the toll from being worse.

Even after his predictions proved wrong, Mr. Trump has continued to
credit himself for the United States not being even worse off.

“One person’s too much,” Mr. Trump told Axios. “And those people that
really understand it, that really understand it, they said it’s an
incredible job that we’ve done.”

Governors of six states said on Tuesday that they were partnering to
purchase millions of [virus
tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/virus-testing-delays.html)
and expand their testing capability as many states continue to struggle
to keep up with the demand for tests.

The governors of Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio and
Virginia are negotiating a purchase of three million antigen tests —
500,000 per state — as part of the new compact, which was created by
Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican and the outgoing chair of the
National Governors Association.

Members of the compact hope that it will show companies that there is
“significant demand” to create more tests, according to a statement
from Mr. Hogan’s office, something made apparent by the long lines that
continue to plague virus testing sites across the country. The governors
— three Republicans and three Democrats — also hoped the compact would
help states buy tests in a more “cost-effective manner.” More states and
local governments may join the group.

[Antigen tests, the type the states would buy, can provide
results](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
in less than an hour, but scientists have said that they fear the tests
will frequently miss infections. The governors are negotiating to
purchase the three million tests from two medical companies — Becton,
Dickinson & Company and the [Quidel
Corporation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/health/antigen-testing-fda-coronavirus.html)
— whose tests [could produce false negative
results](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
between 15 and 20 percent of the time. The companies were [the first to
receive emergency
authorization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
from the Food and Drug Administration for their coronavirus antigen
tests.

The Rockefeller Foundation, a philanthropic organization in New York, is
also part of the compact between the governors and said it was ready to
help find sources of funding for the testing operation.

“With severe shortages and delays in testing and the federal
administration attempting to cut funding for testing, the states are
banding together to acquire millions of faster tests to help save lives
and slow the spread of Covid-19,” Mr. Hogan said in a statement.

  - The National Institutes of Health is now recruiting patients for two
    studies to test possible **antibody treatments** for Covid-19. The
    studies, which are now in their second phase, are testing drugs
    called monoclonal antibodies produced by Eli Lilly and its partner,
    Abcellera Biologics in Vancouver. The process began in March, and
    has progressed at “record speed,” said Daniel Skovronsky, chief
    scientific officer at Eli Lilly. Researchers hope to have results in
    October or November.

  - Researchers are studying why in certain patients, according to a
    flurry of recent studies, the virus appears to
    [make](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html)**[the

    haywire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html).
    Unable to marshal the right cells and molecules to fight off the
    invader, the bodies of the infected instead launch an entire arsenal
    of weapons — a misguided barrage that can wreak havoc on healthy
    tissues, experts said. Researchers studying these unusual responses
    are finding patterns that distinguish patients on the path to
    recovery from those who fare far worse. Insights gleaned from the
    data might [help tailor treatments to
    individuals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-drugs-treatments.html),
    easing symptoms or perhaps even vanquishing the virus before it has
    a chance to [push the immune system too

  - Thousands of Covid-19 patients have been [treated

    plasma](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/blood-plasma-covid-19.html)**
    outside of rigorous clinical trials — hampering research that would
    have shown whether the therapy worked. Doctors and hospitals
    desperate to save the sickest patients have been eager to try a
    therapy that is safe and might work. Many patients and their doctors
    — knowing they could get the treatment under a government program —
    have been unwilling to join clinical trials that might provide them
    with a placebo instead of the plasma. The unexpected demand for
    plasma has inadvertently undercut the research that could prove that
    it works.
