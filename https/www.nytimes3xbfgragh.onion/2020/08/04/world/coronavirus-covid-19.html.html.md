# Coronavirus Live Updates: Fight Over Aid Package Drags On

</div>

Tens of millions of Americans have lost crucial jobless benefits, and
lawmakers still can’t seem to agree on a relief measure. Israel’s
troubled school reopenings could be a lesson for the U.S.

<div class="css-192lewg e1oheyly0">

Right Now

The secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, said that
more than a billion children worldwide were affected by school closures
last
month.

‘Long days, long nights’: Washington prepares for a prolonged fight over
virus relief.

Negotiators on Tuesday are set to reconvene on Capitol Hill to continue
hammering out differences over a coronavirus relief package, with top
Trump administration officials scheduled to return for [another meeting
with congressional
Democrats](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-jobless-aid.html).

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mark Meadows, the White House
chief of staff, will meet with Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. Mr. Mnuchin and
Mr. Meadows will also join Senate Republicans for a closed-door policy
lunch.

The Senate is scheduled to take a monthlong recess at the end of the
week, but it is unclear if lawmakers will leave Washington without a
deal. Tens of millions of Americans have lost crucial [unemployment
benefits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/unemployment-payments-change.html)
as well as a [federal moratorium on
evictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/evictions-moratorium-cares-act.html),
and economists warn that permanent damage could be wrought on the
economy without action.

“I’ve never been a gambler,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of
Alaska, when asked about the prospect of a deal before the end of the
week. “But if I were a gambler, I’d say we need to have some long days,
long nights. Work hard.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

White House officials and Democratic leaders reported some progress over
the weekend, but there are still [substantial
differences](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-jobless-aid.html).
Democrats are proposing a $3 trillion rescue plan that would include
restoring $600-per-week jobless aid payments that expired on Friday and
extending them through January, while Republicans are pushing a $1
trillion package that would reduce those payments substantially.

President Trump on Monday raised the idea of using an executive order to
address the moratorium on evictions, while also hurling insults at
Democratic leaders who were meeting with his top advisers in search of a
compromise. But [he has been notably absent from the
negotiations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/congress-jobless-aid-talks-trump.html)
themselves.

Mr. Trump accused Democrats of being focused on getting “bailout money”
for states controlled by Democrats, and unconcerned with extending
unemployment benefits.

Democrats have proposed providing more than $900 billion to strapped
states and cities whose budgets have been decimated, but it is
Republicans who have proposed slashing the jobless aid. Democrats have
refused to do so, cementing the stalemate.

Fueling an already complicated impasse, outside advisers are also trying
to get the president to bypass Congress and unilaterally impose a
[temporary payroll tax cut, an idea that Mr. Trump has
championed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/payroll-tax-cut-trump-recession.html)
but that his negotiators dropped amid opposition from both parties.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Congressional staff and lobbyists who are engaged in discussions said on
Monday that the talks between administration officials and Ms. Pelosi
and Mr. Schumer had essentially frozen negotiations between top
Democrats and Republicans on key committees who would have to hammer out
the details of any deal.

That could leave the parties little time to flesh out any compromises
over additional aid to businesses or individuals, yielding a plan that
mostly consists of re-upping existing aid programs like the Paycheck
Protection Program and direct payments to
individuals.

As the United States and other countries anxiously consider how to
reopen schools, Israel, one of the first countries to do so,
[illustrates the dangers of moving too
precipitously](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/coronavirus-israel-schools-reopen.html).

Confident that it had beaten the coronavirus and desperate to reboot a
devastated economy, the Israeli government invited the entire student
body back in late May.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Within days, infections were reported at a Jerusalem high school, which
quickly mushroomed into the largest outbreak in a single school in
Israel, possibly the world.

The virus rippled out to the students’ homes and then to other schools
and neighborhoods, ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers
and relatives. Other outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close.
Across the country, tens of thousands of students and teachers were
quarantined.

Israel’s advice for other countries?

“They definitely should not do what we have done,” said Eli Waxman, a
professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and chairman of the team
advising Israel’s National Security Council on the pandemic. “It was a
major failure.”

The lesson, experts say, is that even communities that have gotten the
spread of the virus under control need to take strict precautions when
reopening schools. Smaller classes, mask wearing, keeping desks six feet
apart and providing adequate ventilation, they say, are likely to be
crucial until a vaccine is available.

“If there is a low number of cases, there is an illusion that the
disease is over,” said Dr. Hagai Levine, a professor of epidemiology and
the chairman of the Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians.
“But it’s a complete illusion.”

The United States is facing similar pressures to fully reopen schools,

more than 60,000 new cases a day, and some states continue to set

On Tuesday, the secretary general of the United Nations, António
Guterres, [said that over a billion children worldwide were affected by
school
closures](https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1290500206572666881)

pandemic in which more than 250 million children had been out of school.
“We are at a defining moment for the world’s children and young people,”
Mr. Guterres said.

Hurricane Isaias made landfall in southern North Carolina on Monday
night, at a time when many people in the Southeast are already
beleaguered by the coronavirus outbreak. [Here are the latest updates on
the
storm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/isaias-storm-updates.html).

Disruptions in testing could complicate efforts to gauge virus
transmission in states that have struggled to contain it.

In Florida, for example, 43 state-run [testing
sites](https://floridadisaster.org/covid19/testing-sites/) were forced
to close on Friday as Isaias, then a tropical storm, headed for the
state’s east coast. The number of lab results [received daily by
Florida’s Health
Department](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf),
which had generally been in the 90,000 range in the past two weeks, fell
on Sunday to about 61,000.

Officials have told residents in the storm’s projected path to prepare
themselves, and businesses are concerned about how much damage it will
bring.

“It’s a wait-and-see game,” said Jay Slevin, the manager of a pizzeria
about a mile from the shore in Myrtle Beach, S.C., southwest of where
Isaias made landfall.

Officials are also changing how they run shelters and advising residents
to regard them as a last resort, [out of fear that the virus could
spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/us/virus-texas-storm.html)
in crowded indoor spaces.

At [a briefing on
Monday](https://www.ncdps.gov/storm-update?fbclid=IwAR3gtINKPXqQdsJixuf1kwBKbAtEMz62wzyoDHlu7FDBN1HTarDlw8FlVwQ),
Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina advised residents in vulnerable areas
to stay with friends or family or to go to a hotel. But he added that
shelters would open for those who need them, with health screenings,
social distancing and cleaning protocols.

“I know that North Carolinians have had to dig deep in recent months to
tap into our strength and resilience during the pandemic, and that
hasn’t been easy,” he said. “But with this storm on the way, we have
to dig a little deeper.”

Italian sex workers face poverty and illness during the pandemic.

In Italy, prostitution is not illegal, nor is it regulated as an
official occupation, making the country’s 70,000 sex workers largely
ineligible to receive economic relief. Many have been forced to take
their chances by returning to work in order to avoid poverty.

In May, organizations that promote the rights of Italian sex workers
sought to draw the government’s attention and get support, arguing that
the pandemic showed the harm of forcing sex work underground.

In March, Regina Satariano, a 60-year-old sex worker in Tuscany, started
hearing about colleagues who hadn’t eaten and a landlord who had
threatened to evict a group of 17 housemates, all sex workers who were
out of work because of the pandemic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Satariano put together her savings and bought bags of pasta, tomato
sauce, chicken and soap to distribute to her colleagues. But without
support from the state, she said, many sex workers will continue to go
hungry. If officials don’t change things now, she added, “they never
will.”

In other European countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, sex
workers can enter formal contracts with their clients. During the
lockdown, those who were officially registered with the government were
eligible for economic relief.

Scotland also included sex workers in its relief programs. In Greece,
where prostitution is legal and regulated, brothels were allowed to
reopen on June 15, provided that sex workers kept their clients’ names
and contact details for four weeks for tracing purposes.

In Italy, [various charities and associations have raised
money](https://www.produzionidalbasso.com/project/covid19-nessuna-da-sola-solidarieta-immediata-alle-lavoratrici-sessuali-piu-colpite-dall-emergenza/)
for groceries, medicines, bills and rent to benefit the country’s sex
workers. But for the most part, Italian sex workers, who are often from
immigrant communities, have had to fend for themselves.

A recent report by the Sex Workers’ Rights Advocacy Network and the
International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe showed
that many sex workers defied lockdown rules in order to work, putting
both themselves and their clients at risk.

Counting for the 2020 census will end on Sept. 30, a month earlier than
previously scheduled, the Census Bureau said in a statement on Monday.

The census is constitutionally required to count all residents of the
United States every 10 years, but the 2020 effort [has faltered amid the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-census.html).
In recent weeks, the Trump administration and Senate Republicans
appeared to signal that they [wanted the census finished well ahead of
schedule](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/trump-census.html).

Census data is enormously important. It is used to reapportion all 435
House seats and thousands of state and local districts, as well as to
divvy up trillions of dollars in federal aid.

“Under this plan, the Census Bureau intends to meet a similar level of
household responses as collected in prior censuses, including outreach
to hard-to-count communities,” the Census Bureau said in its
[statement](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/delivering-complete-accurate-count.html).

Critics said the move was pushed by the White House and motivated by
partisanship.

“We’re dealing with a census that’s been really challenged by Covid-19,”
said Vanita Gupta, a former head of the Justice Department’s civil
rights division who is now the [president of the Leadership Conference
on Civil and Human
Rights](https://civilrights.org/about/our-staff/vanita-gupta/). “And in
the middle of this pandemic, the administration has tried to sabotage
the census for partisan gain, to move its anti-immigrant agenda and to
silence communities of color.”

She added that rural communities could be badly hurt by an undercount.

On Monday night, the White House referred questions to the Commerce
Department, which oversees the Census Bureau. It did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.

New Zealand newlyweds, stranded in the Falkland Islands, went home on a

A newly married couple from New Zealand who were stranded for months in
the remote Falkland Islands have managed to return home — by catching a
ride for more than 5,000 nautical miles on an Antarctic fishing boat.

The couple, Feeonaa and Neville Clifton, were honeymooning in the south
Atlantic archipelago, about 300 miles off the coast of Argentina, as
South America’s coronavirus epidemic began to escalate in March. After
their flights home via Brazil were canceled, they remained in lockdown
with an aunt in the Falklands, where Mr. Clifton was born.

The couple have been together more than 25 years and raised three
children, but decided only recently to marry and take a honeymoon. Ms.
Clifton said they spent their time in lockdown rekindling old hobbies,
like playing card games.

“I think maybe I fell in love with him just a little bit more,” she
added of her husband.

That was the easy part.

Ms. Clifton, 48, said that when they began planning their escape from
the Falklands, one of their only options was a military transport
through Africa and Britain.

“At the time we were being told Latam might fly next month, and then
again the next month after that,” she said, referring to Latam Airlines,
a major carrier in the region. “Unfortunately the deadline kept getting
further and further pushed back.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They explored other travel options, but each seemed complex and likely
to put them at increased risk of contracting the virus.

Eventually, they settled on the San Aotea II, a fishing boat that was
heading their way. The only catch was that the journey would take 29
days and traverse the notoriously treacherous Southern Ocean.

But Ms. Clifton, who had never spent a night on a boat, said the trip
was surprisingly calm, and that the crew helped pass the time by playing
cards with them.

The couple arrived in New Zealand on Tuesday morning after testing
negative for the virus. Ms. Clifton said in a telephone interview a few
hours later that they still felt “extremely wobbly” — to the point where
a shopkeeper they came upon during the drive home thought they were
dancing.

“We were just trying to stand up straight,” she said.
