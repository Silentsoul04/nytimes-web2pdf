As public school teachers, Tori Smith and her husband have careers that
should survive the coronavirus economy, but their mortgage lender wasn’t
taking any chances.

It told them that they would have to put down more money to keep the
interest rate they wanted, then dialed back what it was willing to lend
them. And Ms. Smith said it had checked their employment status several
times during the approval process — and again a few days before the
couple closed on their home in Zebulon, N.C., last month.

Ms. Smith said she had never gotten a straight answer about the new
requirements, but she ventured a guess. “I felt like we had to bring
more just because of Covid,” she said.

The economic crisis caused by the pandemic has driven [interest rates to
rock-bottom
levels](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html),
meaning there has hardly been a better time to borrow. But with tens of
millions of people out of work and coronavirus infections surging in
many parts of the country, qualifying for a loan — from mortgages to
auto loans — has become more trying, even for well-positioned borrowers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lenders that have [set aside billion of
dollars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/business/big-banks-quarterly-results.html)
for future defaults have also tightened their standards, often requiring
higher credit scores, heftier down payments and more documentation.
Some, such as Wells Fargo and Chase, have temporarily eliminated home
equity lines of credit, while Wells Fargo also stopped cash-out
refinancing.

It’s not unusual for lenders to tighten the credit reins during a
downturn, but the current situation has made it especially challenging
for them to get an accurate read on consumers’ financial health.
Borrowers have been able to pause mortgages, halt student loan payments
and delay paying their tax bills, while millions of households have
received an extra $600 weekly in unemployment benefits. Those forms of
government support could be masking an underlying condition.

“It makes it hard for a lender to understand what the consumer’s true
state of credit quality is and their ability to pay back a loan,” said
Peter Maynard, senior vice president of global data and analytics at the
Equifax credit
bureau.

Credit card companies, for example, mailed out 57 million offers to
consumers in June, a historic low and down from 272 million a year
earlier, according to Mintel, a research firm that has been tracking the
offers since 1999. Some banks have stopped offering the types of cards
that attract people who may be focused on paying down debt, such as
BankAmericard, Mintel found.

Issuers are also being careful with cards belonging to current
customers, said Mark Miller, associate director of insights for payments
at Mintel.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“Some dormant accounts are being closed,” he said. “So if they have a
credit card sitting in a drawer, those accounts are at risk of being
closed, and credit lines with a $10,000 limit may eventually be knocked
down to $8,000.”

For auto loans, borrowers with lower credit scores and thin credit
histories face more rigorous requirements and less generous terms,
including shorter loan periods.

“Subprime borrowers are not getting loans as readily as they were
pre-pandemic or a year ago,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox
Automotive, referring to consumers with credit scores below 620.

Interest rates for new and used vehicles remain low — below 4 percent at
many banks and credit unions — but only for more qualified borrowers,
said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at BankRate.com.

“Good credit and a down payment are required to get the best rates, with
weaker credit increasingly sidelined — particularly for older-model used
car purchases,” he said.

Ford Motor said it hadn’t tightened standards on loans through its
financing unit, but last month it introduced a program to make wary
borrowers more comfortable. Those who buy or lease a car through Ford’s
financing unit before Sept. 30 can return it within a year if they lose
their jobs. Ford said it would reduce the customer’s balance by the
vehicle’s book value, and then waive up to an additional $15,000.

If that measure is meant to stoke demand, no such program is necessary
for home buyers.

For the first time in nearly half a century of tracking, 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages averaged about 2.98 percent, according to [Freddie
Mac](https://freddiemac.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mortgage-rates-fall-below-three-percent).
The mortgage industry made $865 billion in loans during the second
quarter, the highest amount since 2003, when quarterly originations
twice topped $1 trillion, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade
publication.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And that’s with lenders being picky about their customers and particular
about their requirements. JPMorgan Chase, for example, will make
mortgages to new customers only with credit scores of 700 or more (up
from 640) and down payments of 20 percent or higher. USAA has
temporarily stopped writing jumbo loans, which are mortgages that are
generally too large to be backed by the federal government, among other
products. Bank of America said it had also tightened its underwriting,
but declined to provide details.

Ms. Smith and her husband, Philip Ellis, had hoped to go through a
first-time homebuyer program at Wells Fargo that would require them to
put down 3 percent. They even sat through a required educational course.
But two weeks before closing on their $205,000 home, their lending
officer said they needed to put down 5 percent to keep their
rate.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

A week later, Ms. Smith said, they learned their loan was for less than
what they had been preapproved for — and they needed to come up with an
additional $4,000. In the end, their down payment and closing costs
exceeded $14,000 — about 45 percent more than they had anticipated.

The couple, who had married in April, used money recovered from their
canceled wedding reception. Ms. Smith said they were also lucky to have
the support of their families, who fed and sheltered them so they could
save every penny. But the stability of their jobs was also most likely a
crucial factor.

“I think our ability to secure the loan was due to us both being
schoolteachers and having a contract for employment already for the
following year,” she said.

Wells Fargo said it hadn’t increased its credit score requirements, but
it has raised down-payment minimums on certain loans not backed by the
government because it had to suspend most interior appraisals of homes
during the pandemic. Even under normal circumstances, there are a
variety of situations in which borrowers may be asked to raise their
down payment or obtain a better rate by doing so, a company spokesman
said.

Some lenders also want to know more about borrowers’ other possible
sources of cash.

When Chris Eberle, a technology executive, and his wife were locking in
their jumbo mortgage for a new home in Palo Alto, Calif., their lender,
a California mortgage bank, wanted to know not only how much they had in
their retirement accounts but how easy it was to get at that money.

“They wanted, account by account, details on the withdrawal and loan
options,” Mr. Eberle said.

And they, too, had to put down more than they had planned. Before the
crisis, a jumbo loan could be had with 10 percent down. Mr. Eberle said
they had to put down 20 percent — and found a cheaper house to make it
easier.

Other borrowers, including the self-employed, are being asked to provide
more detailed proof of their earnings — at least when they’re getting a
loan that will be backed by [Fannie

“Employment and income verification for self-employed borrowers is now
multiple times more detailed as it previously was,” said Ted Rood, a
loan officer in St. Louis who lends nationally.

Income verification is also more rigorous across the board, and Mr. Rood
said he was required to do two verifications over the phone. It makes
sense, he said: He had just prepared a loan for a married couple — a gym
owner whose income had suffered and his wife, a speech therapist with a
seemingly more stable position because she was able to work with clients
remotely.

“We were set to close on a Monday in early June,” said Mr. Rood, who was
working at Bayshore Mortgage Funding, which is based in Timonium, Md.,
at the time. But when the loan processor called the wife’s employer the
Friday before, the processor learned that the woman had been laid off.

The lender withdrew the loan.
