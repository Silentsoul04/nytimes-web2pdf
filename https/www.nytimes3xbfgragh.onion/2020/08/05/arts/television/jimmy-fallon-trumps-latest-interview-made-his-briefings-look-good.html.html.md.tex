The ``Axios on HBO'' interview was ``such a disaster, at one point FEMA
showed up and wrapped Trump in a foil blanket,'' the ``Tonight Show''
host said.

Stupidity'}\label{adult-content-child-language-brief-stupidity}}

With most of late night taking the week off, Jimmy Fallon and Seth
Meyers stayed busy with what President Trump has been up to --- notably
an
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/politics/trump-john-lewis-axios.html}{interview
on ``Axios on HBO,''} in which Trump fared poorly under questioning by
the Australian reporter Jonathan Swan. Fallon said it ``was so bad it
made his coronavirus briefings look good.''

\begin{quote}
``If you don't know Jonathan Swan, he's an Australian reporter, which is
fun because we got to see a Trump interview go down the drain in the
opposite direction.'' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``The interview was such a disaster, at one point FEMA showed up and
wrapped Trump in a foil blanket.'' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``In a new interview, President Trump said the coronavirus pandemic is,
quote, `under control as much as you can control it.' What? You're not
controlling it at all. You're handling the pandemic the way parents
handle a third child: `Eh, gotta get tired eventually. Just, uh, just
turn the TV up.''' \emph{--- SETH MEYERS}

``When asked in a new interview how history will remember late civil
rights leader Congressman John Lewis, President Trump said he did not
know because he doesn't know John Lewis. I guess in the same way
Republicans suddenly won't know Trump after Nov. 4.'' \emph{--- SETH
MEYERS}

``Trump did so poorly the only HBO interview he'll do now is Elmo's
late-night talk show.'' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``That's right, the interview was on HBO, which is why beforehand they
showed this graphic: `Adult content, child language, brief stupidity.'''
\emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

Edition)}\label{the-punchiest-punchlines-fdr-edition}}

\begin{quote}
``In the same interview, President Trump said the coronavirus death
toll, quote, `is what it is.' God, he's like the last-resort friend you
confide in during a breakup. \emph{{[}imitating Trump{]}} Yeah, yeah,
yeah, no, it's sad, it's sad but it, uh --- it is what it is. Can we get
back to me?'' \emph{--- SETH MEYERS}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
```It is what it is'? You're the president of the United States, you're
not Paulie Walnuts delivering bad news to Tony Soprano.'' \emph{---
JIMMY FALLON}

``Yep, move over, MAGA, we've got a new hat on the market.'' \emph{---
JIMMY FALLON}

``That reminds me of the moment after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when
F.D.R. said, `Eh, what are you going to do?''' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}
\end{quote}

For his ``Really!?!'' segment, Seth Meyers took on a Norwegian cruise
line that reopened for business, only to shut down after a predictable

talking painting at his in-laws' house.
