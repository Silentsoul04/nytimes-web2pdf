WASHINGTON — Top Democrats and White House officials on Wednesday
remained nowhere close to an agreement for a new rescue package to
address the coronavirus’s toll on the economy, growing increasingly
pessimistic that they could meet a self-imposed Friday deadline as
President Trump again threatened to act on his own to provide relief.

Even as they vowed to continue talks, negotiators remained dug in on
crucial points of any potential deal, jeopardizing additional relief for
small businesses and laid-off workers — and all but guaranteeing that
senators who had planned to go home for a scheduled recess next week
would instead stay in Washington awaiting a deal.

Given the number of outstanding policy issues, including the revival of
expanded [unemployment
benefits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/business/economy/unemployment-claims.html)
and Mr. Trump’s rejection of a key Democratic demand for nearly $1
trillion for struggling state and local governments, the prospect of
votes on such a package next week appeared remote.

“I feel optimistic that there is a light at the end of the tunnel,”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said after hosting another round of
talks in her Capitol Hill office with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury
secretary, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and Senator
Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. “But how long that
tunnel is remains to be seen.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader,
told reporters on Wednesday that the Senate would “certainly be in next
week,” delaying the beginning of the recess in a bid to produce a
legislative framework in the coming days.

Every day of delay risks further damage to an economic recovery that has
stalled — and, by some measures, begun to regress — as the number of
cases and deaths from the coronavirus continues to surge in the United
States. Economic forecasters were bracing for the Labor Department’s
monthly jobs report on Friday to show a significant deceleration in
hiring from May and June. Any additional help for people and businesses
that lawmakers approve in a new package, including a resumption of
expanded unemployment benefits that have lapsed, could take weeks to
make its way into the economy once Mr. Trump signs a new bill.

“There are no top-line numbers that have been agreed to,” Mr. Meadows
said after the meeting, charging that Democrats were unwilling to make
significant concessions. “We continue to be trillions of dollars apart
in terms of what Democrats and Republicans hopefully will ultimately
compromise
on.”

“Is Friday a drop-dead date? No,” he added. “But my optimism continues
to diminish the closer we get to Friday and certainly falls off the
cliff exponentially after Friday.”

Barring a compromise, Mr. Trump and his top lieutenants on Wednesday
continued to explore the possibility of taking executive action to
address some of the unresolved disputes. Those included reinstating a
weekly federal unemployment benefit that lapsed on Friday, reviving a
federal moratorium on evictions and imposing a payroll tax cut that has
been rejected by lawmakers in both parties.

It is unclear whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to force the
changes he wants without the consent of Congress. Democrats have sued to
block Mr. Trump from repurposing federal funds for construction of his
border wall. It is also not certain that the orders would work to
bolster the economy as Mr. Trump hopes. For example, companies might not
pass the savings of a suspended payroll tax on to their employees, and
instead continue to withhold them in the event that the tax must be
repaid next year.

“If we can reach a compromise on these big issues, I think everything
else will fall into place,” Mr. Mnuchin said after briefing Mr.
McConnell on the latest meeting. “If we can’t reach an agreement on
these big issues, then I don’t see us coming to an overall deal and then
we’ll have to look at the president taking actions under his executive
authority.”

On Wednesday, disputes over funding for the Postal Service also emerged
as a sticking point between Democratic leaders and the Trump
administration, as top officials huddled with the postmaster general,
Louis DeJoy, for more than an hour as part of their negotiations.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Mr. Schumer described a “heated discussion” with Mr. DeJoy, who he said
had ignored multiple phone calls over concerns about slow mail delivery
in New York. Democrats and voting rights groups [have
charged](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F07%2F31%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-usps-mail-delays.html)
that cutbacks Mr. DeJoy has put into place are part of a deliberate
effort by Mr. Trump to undermine the Postal Service in an effort to
interfere with [mail-in
voting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/11/us/politics/vote-by-mail-us-states.html)
that will be critical to a safe election in November.

“We told him that elections are sacred and to do cutbacks, at a time
when all ballots have to count — you can’t say, ‘Whoa, we’ll get 94
percent’ — is insufficient,” Mr. Schumer said after the meeting. “We are
demanding that the regulations that are put in place, which cut
employment over time, be rescinded, particularly because of Covid and
because of the
elections.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

Democrats are pushing for $10 billion to be allocated to the agency over
a year, instead of their original proposal for distributing $25 billion
over three years. They have also proposed additional money for food
assistance programs, money for child care, and more than $900 billion to
help states and local governments avoid laying off public workers as tax
revenues fall. Administration officials have offered $150 billion in
state and local aid, and on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he opposed any
such money.

“We can’t go along with the bailout money,” he told reporters at the
White House. “We’re not going to go along with that.”

The fate of a $600-per-week federal unemployment supplement to laid-off
workers, which lapsed last week in the absence of an agreement to extend
them, also remains another significant point of contention. Senate
Republicans want to slash the benefit.

Democrats are pressing to extend the payments through January. On
Tuesday, Republicans countered with a plan to resume them at $400 per
week through Dec. 15, according to two people with knowledge of the
discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them.
Democrats declined the offer, which was first reported by Politico.

Some Senate Republicans, largely removed from the process, have begun
discussing the possibility of holding procedural votes on individual
proposals, forcing Democrats to block them. One of those votes could be
an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular federal
small-business loan program, which stops taking applications at the end
of the week.

News of a self-imposed deadline did not completely assure senators that
a deal was to be had, though some Republicans said it could compel some
sort of compromise.

“At some point, you have to set a deadline, or just continue this Kabuki
dance every day,” said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri.
“Nobody wants to do that.”

“There’s plenty of time to get a deal if there’s a deal to be gotten,”
he added. “If there’s not a deal to be gotten, there’s no reason to
continue to act like there is.”
