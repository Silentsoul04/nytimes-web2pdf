ST. LOUIS — Cori Bush, a progressive activist and a leader of the
swelling protest movement for racial justice, toppled Representative
William Lacy Clay Jr. of Missouri in a Democratic primary on Tuesday,
notching the latest in a stunning string of upsets against the party
establishment.

Ms. Bush, 44, had [captured nearly 49
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/04/us/elections/results-missouri-house-district-1-primary-election.html)
of the vote by late Tuesday evening compared with 45.5 percent for Mr.
Clay, according to The Associated Press. She had tried and failed to
unseat Mr. Clay in 2018, but this year rode a surge in support for more
liberal, confrontational politics within the Democratic Party amid the
coronavirus pandemic and the national outcry over festering racial
inequities.

Ms. Bush’s victory, which came on the same night that Missouri voters
decided to expand Medicaid eligibility, was a significant milestone for
insurgent progressive candidates and the groups, like Justice Democrats,
that have backed them across the country. It showed that the same brand
of politics that has helped young, liberal candidates of color unseat
veteran party stalwarts in places like Massachusetts and New York could
also resonate deep in the heartland against a Black incumbent whose
family has been synonymous with his district for decades.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Bush now joins figures like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
of New York, who
[defeated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/26/nyregion/joseph-crowley-ocasio-cortez-democratic-primary.html)
the 20-year veteran Representative Joseph Crowley in 2018, and Jamaal
Bowman, who last month [won a
primary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/nyregion/jamaal-bowman-eliot-engel.html)
against Representative Eliot L. Engel, a powerful committee chairman in
his 16th term representing a district straddling the Bronx and
Westchester.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A single mother, former nurse and pastor, Ms. Bush would be the first
Black woman to represent the state of Missouri in Congress. The
plurality of the district, which encompasses St. Louis and some of its
innermost liberal suburbs, is African-American and considered safely
Democratic.

“Tonight, Missouri’s 1st District has decided that an incremental
approach isn’t going to work any longer,” Ms. Bush told supporters at a
jubilant news conference after the race was called. “We decided that we
the people have the answers, and we will lead from the front lines.”

Mr. Clay, the scion of a storied Black Missouri political dynasty in his
10th term in Congress, had tried to make the campaign a referendum on
not only Ms. Bush’s suitability for elected office but also the
progressive movement behind her. He carried out a series of dark,
personal attacks in the campaign’s final days to try to halt Ms. Bush’s
momentum and [described her as a “prop” of out-of-town interests seeking
to divide the Democratic
Party](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/cori-bush-william-lacy-clay-missouri.html)
along racial lines.

Mr. Clay highlighted his own ties to the Democratic power structure,
earning endorsements from Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Kamala Harris of
California and groups like Planned Parenthood.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Late Tuesday night, it was Justice Democrats, which helped groom Ms.
Bush and other successful progressive challengers, that was celebrating.

“If you don’t know, now you know: The Squad is here to stay, and it’s
growing,” said Alexandra Rojas, the group’s executive director.

Unlike other incumbents who have lost in recent years, Mr. Clay did not
fit neatly into the moderate or progressive wings of the party. He had
supported some hallmark progressive policies in Washington, including
“Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal, but also continued to take
campaign money from corporations. Ms. Bush’s backers bashed him for
helping payday
lenders.

Ms. Bush built her campaign around her personal story as a working-class
Black woman who was pulled into public life after a white police officer
shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager, in Ferguson,
Mo., in 2014. She joined protesters in the days after the shooting, and
in the weeks and years that followed became one of their leaders,
staring down tear gas, mace and rubber bullets.

Ms. Bush was a fixture at protests across the district this summer after
the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

Speaking to reporters and a small group of supporters Tuesday night
through a medical mask, Ms. Bush drew a bright line from her experience
confronting the police on the streets where Mr. Brown died to her
victory at the ballot box.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I was maced and beaten by those same police officers in those same
streets,” she said. “Six months from now, as the first Black
congresswoman in the entire history of Missouri, I will be holding every
single one of them accountable.”

She added: “If you didn’t understand what happened, what was birthed
right here in St. Louis, Missouri, in St. Louis County, in Ferguson,
we’re about to show you.”

Amid a worsening health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus
pandemic, Ms. Bush pushed drastic changes to the nation’s criminal
justice system, including defunding and dismantling police departments;
called for Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage and a universal basic
income; and swore off corporate campaign contributions.

But as the campaign wore on, she also began sharpening her attacks
against Mr. Clay directly, accusing him of “failed leadership” after two
decades in office. She noted that he was largely absent from the
protests and questioned his commitment to fighting for voters in a city
troubled by segregation and economic stagnation.

“He’s had 20 years to make a change, not only in St. Louis but across
this country,” Ms. Bush said on Saturday. “He waits until something is
popular to stand up for it, or he waits until there is pressure. I do it
just because that is the need.”

The message ultimately resonated with voters, many of whom had never
before voted for a congressman not named Clay. William Lacy Clay Sr., a
local civil rights figure, entered Congress in 1969 and handed the seat
to his son when he retired in 2001.

While Mr. Clay narrowly carried the portions of the district in suburban
St. Louis County, Ms. Bush won a commanding victory in the city of St.
Louis.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Bush’s campaign explicitly benefited from the momentum claimed by
progressives this summer and since 2018. A documentary about her 2018
campaign and that of challengers like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, “[Knock Down
the
House](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/30/movies/knock-down-the-house-review.html),”
helped build a national profile. And donations to her campaign far
outpaced those in 2018, allowing her to advertise on TV here, as other
progressives notched victories.

Ms. Bush’s victory comes just a few weeks after [Mr. Bowman, a middle
school principal from the Bronx, upset Mr.
Engel,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/nyregion/jamaal-bowman-eliot-engel.html)
the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In Illinois in
March, [Marie Newman, another progressive, defeated Representative Dan
Lipinski](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/us/politics/marie-newman-dan-lipinski-illinois.html),
a conservative Democrat who opposed abortion rights and the Affordable
Care Act. Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, each challenger had the backing of
Justice Democrats.

But while Ms. Bush had the group’s enthusiastic support as well — she
was one of only two challengers to Black incumbents it endorsed this
cycle — and was endorsed by Mr. Bowman, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had
conspicuously sat on the sidelines. She had campaigned for Ms. Bush in
2018, but Mr. Clay courted the New York Democrat in Washington, signing
onto the Green New Deal, and inviting Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other
progressive lawmakers to support some of his bills.
