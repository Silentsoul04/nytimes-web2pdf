The nuclear weapons dropped over [Hiroshima and
Nagasaki](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/world/asia/hiroshima-nagasaki-japan-photos.html)
75 years ago this week wreaked a devastation never before seen in human
warfare. Yet they were firecrackers compared with the nuclear weapons
that were soon developed — bombs, warheads, shells, torpedoes and other
devices capable of vaporizing the human race in an apocalyptic flash.

For decades, that thought cast a pall of acute anxiety over America and
the world. Whether because of that fear, a strategy of effective
deterrence, chance or all the above, the United States remains the only
country to have used nuclear weapons in combat. With the end of the Cold
War, anxiety around nuclear war has receded. Most people probably are
not aware that a harrowing and expensive new arms race is now underway.

Today Americans are more likely to identify climate change as the
greatest man-made threat to the planet. Last year, in the [list of what
Americans
fear](https://www.chapman.edu/wilkinson/research-centers/babbie-center/survey-american-fears.aspx#:~:text=Results%20from%20the%202019%20Chapman,warfare%20for%20the%202019%20survey.)
compiled annually by Chapman University, “North Korea using nuclear
weapons” and “Nuclear weapons attack” ranked 27 and 29, far below
“Corrupt government officials” (No. 1) or “Pollution of oceans, rivers
and lakes” (No. 2).

Yet even with the Cold War long over and stockpiles of nuclear weapons
in the Russian and American arsenals sharply reduced through a series of
nuclear arms treaties, to fewer than 6,000 warheads each, there are no
grounds for complacency. The world can still be destroyed in a flash.

Nine states have nuclear weapons — the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. [Iran’s nuclear
program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/world/asia/iran-khamenei-us-sanctions.html)
has been the focus of intense concern for years, and Saudi Arabia has
vowed that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, it will follow suit.
Consider also that two men have the power to unleash a nuclear barrage
entirely on their own — President Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian
president, who are both working assiduously on modernizing their
arsenals.

Mr. Trump has [said he is
working](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/23/trump-china-russia-new-arms-control-agreement-start/)
on a new arms control agreement with Russia and is seeking to include
China in the talks. But his administration has always found it easier to
tear up treaties than to sign them, especially if the result in any way
restrains the United States. As the special envoy for arms control,
[Marshall
Billingslea](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-armscontrol/u-s-prepared-to-spend-russia-china-into-oblivion-to-win-nuclear-arms-race-u-s-envoy-idUSKBN22X2LS),
boasted in May, “We know how to win these races, and we know how to
spend the adversary into oblivion.”

Before the coronavirus pandemic put millions of Americans out of work,
spending so much money on new doomsday weapons was profligate. Now, it
seems morally indefensible. This week, the [Government Accountability
Office](https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/53270-report-examines-nuclear-weapons-modernization-costs/)
said that, without changes, the Pentagon’s nuclear weapons modernization
effort is on track to surpass its $1.2 trillion price tag over the next
three decades. It seems as though the United States is plunging into a
new nuclear arms race with Russia and China without having learned the
lessons of the last one.

When briefed by the military in 2017 on the levels to which American and
Russian nuclear arsenals had been reduced through arms treaties, Mr.
Trump
[reportedly](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/11/trump-reportedly-wanted-nearly-10-times-more-nuclear-weapons.html)
demanded that the United States increase its nuclear stockpile tenfold.
According to some reports, this was what prompted the secretary of state
at the time, Rex Tillerson, to call the president a “moron.”

Mr. Trump [withdrew the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/01/us/politics/trump-inf-nuclear-treaty.html)
from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Iran nuclear
deal, and he has not yet extended the New START accord, the only
agreement still in place limiting American and Russian nuclear forces,
which was signed by President Barack Obama and expires in early
February. In addition, the Trump administration was [recently
reported](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/politics/trump-administration-nuclear-test/index.html)
to be thinking of breaking the 28-year-old moratorium on nuclear
testing.

The 75th anniversary of Hiroshima is a good time to revive serious
public concern about nuclear weapons. The pandemic may leave little room
for other fears, but public health and economic recovery should not have
to compete for resources with a needless and enormously expensive new
arms race. As Jessica Mathews, former president of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, writes in the current issue of [The
New York Review of
Books](https://www.nybooks.com/contributors/jessica-t-mathews/), it
would be good for the five original nuclear powers — the United States,
Russia, Britain, France and China — to formally endorse the principle
set forth by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev at their
1985 summit, that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be
fought.”

Above all, the wrenching images of scorched rubble where Hiroshima had
stood ought to be cause for serious reflection on what nuclear weapons
do — and what they cannot do.
