``Nice White Parents'' is a new podcast from Serial Productions, a New
York Times Company, about the 60-year relationship between white parents
and the public school down the block.

Chana Joffe-Walt explores how white parents can shape a school --- even
when they aren't there.

She traces the history of I.S. 293, now the Boerum Hill School for
International Studies, from the 1980s through the modern education
reforms of the 2000s. In the process, Chana talks to alumni who loved
their school and never questioned why it was on the edge of a white
neighborhood. To them, it was just where everyone went. But she also
speaks to some who watched the school change over the years and
questioned whether a local community school board was secretly plotting
against 293.

``Nice White Parents'' was reported by Chana Joffe-Walt; produced by
Julie Snyder; edited by Sarah Koenig, Neil Drumming and Ira Glass.
Editorial consulting was done by Eve L. Ewing and Rachel Lissy; and
sound mix by Stowe Nelson.

The original score for ``Nice White Parents'' was written and performed
by the jazz group The Bad Plus. The band consists of Reid Anderson, the
bassist; Orrin Evans, the pianist; and Dave King, the drummer.
Additional music from Matt McGinley.

Special thanks to Sam Dolnick, Julie Whitaker, Seth Lind, Julia Simon
and Lauren Jackson.
