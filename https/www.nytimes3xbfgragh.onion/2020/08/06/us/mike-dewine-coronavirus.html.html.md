Gov. Mike DeWine tested negative for the coronavirus hours after a
positive rapid-result test had prevented him from welcoming President
Trump to Ohio on Thursday, a whiplash reversal that reflected the
nation’s increasingly complex state of testing.

In a high-profile example of a new testing frontier, Mr. DeWine first
received an antigen test, which allows for results in minutes, not days,
but has been shown to be [less
accurate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html).
The positive result came as a “big surprise,” said Mr. DeWine, a
Republican, who had not been experiencing symptoms other than a
headache.

Later on Thursday, he was tested using a more standard procedure known
as polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., an accurate but time-intensive
method that requires samples to be processed at a laboratory. His wife,
Fran, and staff members also tested negative.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We feel confident in the results,” the governor’s office said in a
statement late Thursday, noting that the negative result had been
processed twice. “This is the same P.C.R. test that has been used over
1.6 million times in Ohio by hospitals and labs all over the state.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The puzzling results capped a long day for Mr. DeWine, 73, who drove
three hours up Interstate 71 to meet with Mr. Trump in Cleveland. He had
hoped to discuss testing, a key issue that has [plagued the response to
the virus in the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/virus-testing-delays.html).
But first, he had to be tested himself as part of a routine White House
screening.

After the unwelcome news, the president stood alone outside Marine One
and praised Mr. DeWine as “a very good friend of mine,” while Mr. DeWine
left to get the secondary test and returned to quarantine at his home in
Cedarville,
Ohio.

Several people have tested positive as part of regular screenings meant
to protect the president, [including Representative Louie
Gohmert](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/politics/louie-gohmert-positive-coronavirus-mask.html),
a Texas Republican who has frequently refused to don a face covering in

in Tulsa, Okla., in June also [tested
positive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-campaign-coronavirus-tulsa.html).

The immediate result Mr. DeWine received during the White House
screening [stands in contrast to the experience of many
Americans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/virus-testing-delays.html),
who have had to wait hours to be tested for the virus and continue to
face turnaround times that stretch for days and even weeks.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Public health experts say that widespread, rapid testing is necessary
for quarantining and contact tracing to effectively control the virus.
But the United States has consistently struggled to test as frequently
as needed. The country has recently averaged about 700,000 tests per
day, nowhere near the [millions of tests that some models
recommend](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EhUfmT6ayG3ERxX-wZUmB2wtIEOhRAmP/view).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Experts are increasingly arguing that the best chance to catch the most
outbreaks is through large numbers of less accurate tests. But there are
drawbacks: Antigen tests will miss some people who would test positive
by P.C.R., with some past antigen tests missing up to half the
infections they looked for.

Mr. DeWine was the second governor to publicize a positive test, after
Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, [tested positive for the
virus last
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/oklahoma-governor-coronavirus-stitt.html).

A mild-mannered career politician, Mr. DeWine spent decades in public
office — as a county prosecutor, state senator, congressman, lieutenant
governor, U.S. senator and state attorney general — largely out of the
national spotlight, until the pandemic turned him into something of a
social media sensation. At times breaking with his party to take a more
assertive approach on public health, Mr. DeWine was the first governor
to shut down schools, and he issued an early stay-at-home order in
March.

His daily 2 p.m. news briefings, in which he took on a professorial air,
speaking alongside graphs and charts while wearing round glasses and
[colorful ties representing Ohio
universities](https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1247586451623227394?s=20),
spawned a fan club this spring. The briefings, known as [“Wine With
DeWine,”](https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2020/05/wine-with-dewine-an-indispensable-refuge-in-our-day.html)
inspired T-shirts and wine glasses with the motto “It’s 2 o’clock
somewhere.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

As new daily cases in Ohio surged this summer, ballooning to more than
1,000 a day, more than the state’s previous peak in April, Mr. DeWine
again took on a more urgent tone. “Don’t we all want to be around to
meet our future children, our future grandchildren?” he said during a
televised state address last month. “To attend their baptism, to watch
our kids and grandkids graduate from school?”

He later issued a statewide mask order, drawing familiar criticism.
Before the governor’s negative test on Thursday, a Republican state
representative, Nino Vitale, posted a photo of Mr. DeWine wearing a face
covering with the news he had tested positive: “I thought masks worked?”

Mr. DeWine pushed back against critics on Thursday, saying he had
received several “not so nice” text messages suggesting that wearing a
face covering did not matter. “Look, we know it does,” he said.

Ohio is among eight states that this week made a bipartisan pact to buy
four million antigen tests, with the hope of detecting outbreaks more
quickly. The governors are negotiating to buy the tests from two medical
companies — Becton, Dickinson & Company and the [Quidel
Corporation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/health/antigen-testing-fda-coronavirus.html)
— whose tests [could produce false negative
results](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
between 15 and 20 percent of the time.

Speaking to reporters after his positive test, Mr. DeWine said that he
had considered the possibility of an inaccurate result but that that
would not change his desire to pursue a variety of testing options for
the state, including more rapid testing.

“It’s a constant re-evaluation,” he said. “Collectively, we know more
about the virus today than we did in March. Same way with testing.”

Even so, the contradictory test results that the governor received show
that there is considerable room for improvement. His office said that
“out of an abundance of caution,” the governor would be tested again
in two days.

Julie Bosman, Maggie Haberman and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed
reporting.
