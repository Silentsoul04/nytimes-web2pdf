Gov. Mike DeWine tested negative for the coronavirus hours after a
positive rapid-result test had prevented him from welcoming President
Trump to Ohio on Thursday, a whiplash reversal that reflected the
nation's increasingly complex state of testing.

In a high-profile example of a new testing frontier, Mr. DeWine first
received an antigen test, which allows for results in minutes, not days,
but has been shown to be
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html}{less
accurate}. The positive result came as a ``big surprise,'' said Mr.
DeWine, a Republican, who had not been experiencing symptoms other than
a headache.

Later on Thursday, he was tested using a more standard procedure known
as polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., an accurate but time-intensive
method that requires samples to be processed at a laboratory. His wife,
Fran, and staff members also tested negative.

``We feel confident in the results,'' the governor's office said in a
statement late Thursday, noting that the negative result had been
processed twice. ``This is the same P.C.R. test that has been used over
1.6 million times in Ohio by hospitals and labs all over the state.''

The puzzling results capped a long day for Mr. DeWine, 73, who drove
three hours up Interstate 71 to meet with Mr. Trump in Cleveland. He had
hoped to discuss testing, a key issue that has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/virus-testing-delays.html}{plagued
the response to the virus in the United States}. But first, he had to be
tested himself as part of a routine White House screening.

After the unwelcome news, the president stood alone outside Marine One
and praised Mr. DeWine as ``a very good friend of mine,'' while Mr.
DeWine left to get the secondary test and returned to quarantine at his
home in Cedarville, Ohio.

Several people have tested positive as part of regular screenings meant
to protect the president,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/politics/louie-gohmert-positive-coronavirus-mask.html}{including
Representative Louie Gohmert}, a Texas Republican who has frequently
refused to don a face covering in the Capitol. Campaign staff members
who attended the president's rally in Tulsa, Okla., in June also
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-campaign-coronavirus-tulsa.html}{tested
positive}.

The immediate result Mr. DeWine received during the White House
screening
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/virus-testing-delays.html}{stands
in contrast to the experience of many Americans}, who have had to wait
hours to be tested for the virus and continue to face turnaround times
that stretch for days and even weeks.

Public health experts say that widespread, rapid testing is necessary
for quarantining and contact tracing to effectively control the virus.
But the United States has consistently struggled to test as frequently
as needed. The country has recently averaged about 700,000 tests per
day, nowhere near the
\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EhUfmT6ayG3ERxX-wZUmB2wtIEOhRAmP/view}{millions
of tests that some models recommend}.

Experts are increasingly arguing that the best chance to catch the most
outbreaks is through large numbers of less accurate tests. But there are
drawbacks: Antigen tests will miss some people who would test positive
by P.C.R., with some past antigen tests missing up to half the
infections they looked for.

Mr. DeWine was the second governor to publicize a positive test, after
Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/us/oklahoma-governor-coronavirus-stitt.html}{tested
positive for the virus last month}.

A mild-mannered career politician, Mr. DeWine spent decades in public
office --- as a county prosecutor, state senator, congressman,
lieutenant governor, U.S. senator and state attorney general --- largely
out of the national spotlight, until the pandemic turned him into
something of a social media sensation. At times breaking with his party
to take a more assertive approach on public health, Mr. DeWine was the
first governor to shut down schools, and he issued an early stay-at-home
order in March.

His daily 2 p.m. news briefings, in which he took on a professorial air,
speaking alongside graphs and charts while wearing round glasses and
\href{https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1247586451623227394?s=20}{colorful
ties representing Ohio universities}, spawned a fan club this spring.
The briefings, known as
\href{https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2020/05/wine-with-dewine-an-indispensable-refuge-in-our-day.html}{``Wine
With DeWine,''} inspired T-shirts and wine glasses with the motto ``It's
2 o'clock somewhere.''

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    seems likely, for at least several months.} There have been
    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}
    immune molecules called antibodies, which are

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

But his approach also drew an uproar from
\href{https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200416/yoursquove-seen-photo-of-ohio-protesters-herersquos-story-behind-it}{protesters
who gathered outside the State Capitol} and from members of his own
party. Amid the stay-at-home order and business closures, Republicans
accused his administration of
\href{https://twitter.com/Rob_McColley/status/1256325645920907264?s=20}{``micromanaging''
residents} and
\href{https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/some-push-open-economy-dewine-says-plan-the-works-but-threat-not-over/uTxhHQuX3r4LJzjBVACyDK/}{pumping
up coronavirus statistics to scare Ohioans}.

As new daily cases in Ohio surged this summer, ballooning to more than
1,000 a day, more than the state's previous peak in April, Mr. DeWine
again took on a more urgent tone. ``Don't we all want to be around to
meet our future children, our future grandchildren?'' he said during a
televised state address last month. ``To attend their baptism, to watch
our kids and grandkids graduate from school?''

He later issued a statewide mask order, drawing familiar criticism.
Before the governor's negative test on Thursday, a Republican state
representative, Nino Vitale, posted a photo of Mr. DeWine wearing a face
covering with the news he had tested positive: ``I thought masks
worked?''

Mr. DeWine pushed back against critics on Thursday, saying he had
received several ``not so nice'' text messages suggesting that wearing a
face covering did not matter. ``Look, we know it does,'' he said.

Ohio is among eight states that this week made a bipartisan pact to buy
four million antigen tests, with the hope of detecting outbreaks more
quickly. The governors are negotiating to buy the tests from two medical
companies --- Becton, Dickinson \& Company and the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/health/antigen-testing-fda-coronavirus.html}{Quidel
Corporation} --- whose tests
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html}{could
produce false negative results} between 15 and 20 percent of the time.

Speaking to reporters after his positive test, Mr. DeWine said that he
had considered the possibility of an inaccurate result but that that
would not change his desire to pursue a variety of testing options for
the state, including more rapid testing.

``It's a constant re-evaluation,'' he said. ``Collectively, we know more
about the virus today than we did in March. Same way with testing.''

Even so, the contradictory test results that the governor received show
that there is considerable room for improvement. His office said that
``out of an abundance of caution,'' the governor would be tested again
in two days.

Julie Bosman, Maggie Haberman and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed
