*Good morning.*

**For the first time in the university’s history, Chicano or Latino
students made up the biggest group of Californians** **[admitted to the
freshman class of the University of California, at 36
percent](https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/factsheets/2020/fall-2020-admission-table-2-1.pdf).**

**Yesterday, we introduced you to two of those students. And today,
we’re introducing you to a couple
more:**

## Erick Tobar

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Six years ago, Dora and Erick Tobar — now 17 and 21 — moved to the Bay
Area after living in Guatemala.

Their father, whom they lived with while their mother lived in the San
Rafael area and cleaned houses, had been killed not long before.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It was the hardest day I ever lived,” Mr. Tobar said. He remembers
vividly hearing gunshots as he headed to an uncle’s house, followed by
the horror of learning that his father and uncle had been gunned down.

At first, the siblings stayed in Guatemala with relatives. But it became
too difficult, so their mother brought them to join her.

In the United States, Mr. Tobar said school was a top priority, but when
their mother had to stop working for health reasons, it was up to them
to keep the family afloat.

For Mr. Tobar, that meant working at a carwash and an elder care home
while finishing high school and, more recently, attending community
college.

*\[Read the* [*first part of this
series*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/us/university-california-latino-students.html?smid=tw-share)*.\]*

There wasn’t much time to hang out with friends or for extracurricular
activities.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This year, Mr. Tobar will start school at U.C. Davis.

“I want to get into a U.C.,” he recalled thinking, “so I can prove to
myself I have the capacity to do it.”

He wants to become a certified public accountant. Eventually, he said,
he wants to continue on to graduate degrees and start businesses, like a
cafe with his brother.

His sister, Ms. Tobar, credited her older siblings for helping her take
advantage of opportunities to volunteer and travel.

In high school, Ms. Tobar visited Arizona for a solo backpacking trip
and helped build houses in the Dominican Republic.

She got into several colleges, including U.C. Merced. But Ms. Tobar will
instead attend San Francisco State University, because it has a criminal
justice major.

“As a Latina, I want to show women they can also work as a police
officer,” she said.

Ms. Tobar said that she understood why protests erupted calling for
justice for Black and, in California especially, Latino victims of
police violence.

*\[Read about* [*calls to defund the
police*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/us/ca-defund-police.html)
*in California.\]*

But she said she believed that “there are officers who want to take care
of us and make sure we’re safe.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ultimately, Ms. Tobar said she planned to become an agent for the F.B.I.
before starting her own security company.

She was inspired, she said, in part by the loss of her father.

Both Tobar siblings said their mother has watched their ascent proudly.

## Dalia Rangel Perez

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Recently, it’s been hot in Thermal, the small Coachella Valley community
where Dalia Rangel Perez, 18, has been gearing up to start her career at
U.C. Berkeley.

“The weather is around 120 right now,” she said late last month,
speaking from the trailer where she lives with her family.

She thinks about her parents, who are essential farmworkers, and others
like them.

“It’s incredibly difficult,” she said. “It’s heart wrenching.”

Ms. Rangel Perez grew up with the language of farmworker activism in her
home, she said — her father, brother and sister all work with United
Farm Workers — and it’s shaped her desire to become an immigration
lawyer.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Her family immigrated from Mexicali when she was 3.

At first, they lived in a labor camp not unlike the ones where many
farmworkers still live, packed together and vulnerable.

Ms. Rangel Perez said her memories are vague of her first home in
California, but she recalled “the whites of the walls,” and that there
was “nothing except for a mattress,” for her family of five.

Later, when they lived in a one-room trailer, she remembered roaches
almost like pets, everyone sleeping on the same bed, “our skin being
kind of like a marshmallow being melted into each other,” when it was
summer.

“I hated it,” she said.

Ms. Rangel Perez said she’s sad she won’t be able to get to campus soon
to start her first semester. She plans to stay with her sister in
Bakersfield to study, since she doesn’t have internet access at home in
Thermal.

She still hasn’t been to Berkeley. And although she’s nervous about
being in a new environment, Ms. Rangel Perez looks forward to seeing it
for herself.

  - **Schools in the Sacramento region and across the state are weighing
    whether to take advantage of a complex waiver process** that would
    allow some elementary schools in some counties to reopen for
    in-person instructions. One extra confounding factor is that —
    thanks to a technical problem — the state [is not adding or taking
    counties off its county monitoring

  - And more than half of the members of the State Legislature **signed
    on to a call to Gov. Gavin Newsom to immediately pay unemployment

  - The timing couldn’t be more on the nose: **With the Chinese-owned
    TikTok mired in a geopolitical morass, Facebook-owned Instagram
    released Reels,** a direct competitor that allows users to create
    and share 15-second videos. \[[The New York

  - The idea of the lone culinary auteur is eroding, as the food world
