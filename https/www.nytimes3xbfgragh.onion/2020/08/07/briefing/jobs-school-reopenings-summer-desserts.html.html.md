**1. The U.S. economic recovery slowed in July** as faltering businesses
reduced the pace of hiring.

[Employers added 1.8 million jobs in
July](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/07/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/us-employers-added-1-8-million-jobs-in-july-despite-a-coronavirus-surge),
well below the 4.8 million boost in jobs in June. That means that less
than half of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April have been
restored. But economists warn that recovering the remaining ground will
be a challenge.

The latest figures from the Labor Department come as lawmakers [failed
to reach a deal on a coronavirus relief
package](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/world/covid-19-news.html?#link-232a7bee)
that would extend unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July.

Both the White House and top Democrats said they remained deeply divided
after 10 days of crisis negotiations. President Trump’s advisers said
they would recommend that he bypass Congress and act on his own through
a series of executive orders, as soon as this weekend. It was not clear
what power Mr. Trump might have to move unilaterally to extend jobless
aid or otherwise redirect federal relief money as he sees
fit.

**2. Without a new pandemic relief measure,** 30 million to 40 million
tenants are at risk of being evicted in the coming month.

According to a report by dozens of academics and housing advocates, a
broad swath of renters had until recently been protected by the $600 a
month in supplemental unemployment payments, but many are now falling
behind. The bills are piling up just as [several federal, state and
local eviction moratoriums are
expiring](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/business/economy/housing-economy-eviction-renters.html).

number of them live in states with the lowest benefit levels. An extra
$600 a week smoothed out sharp differences in benefits among
states.

**3. New York State schools can reopen,** Gov. Andrew Cuomo said,
solidifying plans to make New York City one of the few big U.S. cities
to hold in-person classes.

Under the governor’s announcement, [schools can decide to
open](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/nyregion/cuomo-schools-reopening.html)
as long as they are in a region where the average rate of positive tests
is below 5 percent. Most of the state, including New York City, has
maintained a positivity rate of about 1 percent.

Many educators spent their summers planning how to safely reopen
classes. But with the pandemic surging across much of the country, those
plans are shelved. Now educators are spending the little time they have
left [to improve online
instruction](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/us/remote-learning-fall-2020.html),
which failed to reach and engage many children in the spring.

school](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/coronavirus-students.html).

**4. Russia continues to meddle** in the election to aid President
Trump, using a range of measures to denigrate Joe Biden, [intelligence
officials
said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/us/politics/russia-china-trump-biden-election-interference.html).

In the first public assessment of the 2020 campaign, William Evanina,
the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center,
cited efforts coming out of pro-Russia forces in Ukraine to damage Mr.
Biden and Kremlin-linked figures who “are also seeking to boost
President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.”

At the same time, the officials said China preferred that Mr. Trump be
defeated in November and was weighing whether to take more aggressive
actions in the
election.

**5. We’re still unpacking the implications** of **** the Trump
administration’s executive orders on WeChat and TikTok.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The orders, signed late last night, appear to [seek a ban on the two
smartphone
apps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html)from
operating in the U.S. or interacting with U.S. companies because of
national security concerns. [Intelligence officials have detected no
such
threat](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/us/politics/tiktok-security-threat.html).

The order essentially sets a 45-day deadline for an acquisition of
TikTok, which is in talks with Microsoft, by a U.S. company. That means
the White House is [effectively negotiating — in public — a sale between
a foreign
company](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/technology/trump-tiktok-wechat.html)
and an American company, our colleague Shira Ovide explains in On Tech.

With much of the Chinese internet locked behind the Great Firewall,
[WeChat is one of the few digital
bridges](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/business/trump-china-wechat-tiktok.html)
connecting China to the rest of the world. Light on details, the Trump
decree could prove cosmetic, crushing or something in
between.

**7. Five months into the coronavirus crisis,** New York City is slowly
creeping back to life.

But with a season of relief comes a season of grief. Dodai Stewart, an
editor on our Metro desk and lifelong New Yorker, traced the pandemic
from the day she packed up her desk (and left behind two boxes of Girl
Scout cookies) to a summer of unrest and protests — [proof that “New
York had not been
conquered.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/style/coronavirus-nyc-historic-season.html?)

The first half of the year has been the emotional equivalent of an

But it’s vital to have some stress-reducing strategies available that

a few ways to get unstuck from your
