\emph{In each installment of The Artists, T highlights a recent or
little-shown work by a Black artist, along with a few words from that
artist putting the work into context. This week, we're looking at a
video by Akeem Smith, which will be part of his show
``}\href{https://redbullarts.com/newyork/news/akeem-smith-no-gyal-can-test/}{\emph{No
Gyal Can Test}}\emph{'' at Red Bull Arts in New York in late September.
Smith's work often takes inspiration from his experience working with
his family's fashion house, the Ouch Collective, and from the Jamaican
dancehall community.}

\textbf{Name:} Akeem Smith

\textbf{Age:} 28

\textbf{Based in:} Brooklyn, N.Y. and Kingston, Jamaica

\textbf{Originally from:} Brooklyn, N.Y. and Kingston, Jamaica

\textbf{When and where did you make this work?} This artwork draws on my
video and photo archive of Jamaica's dancehall scene from 1985 through
the early 2000s. I have been building this archive over the last 12
years, and this exhibition, which will finally open this September at
Red Bull Arts New York, has always been part of my thinking. For the
past nine months, I've been back and forth between Kingston and New York
finishing up this work and the exhibition.

\textbf{Can you describe what is going on in the work?} This excerpt,
which features archival documentation, highlights, at a lumbering and
hypnotic clip, the character's **** singular, mesmeric power, as she
revels in a ritualistic haze that transforms dance onlookers into
devotees. I'm isolating and playing with the idea of the gaze. Western
culture talks a lot about the male gaze, but what about the colonial
gaze or the female gaze? The optics of this piece are meant to
illustrate the power of a female gaze, the power of commanding and
demanding attention.

\textbf{What inspired you to make this work?} I believe spontaneous
moments of cohesion can manifest something potent, something powerful. A
lot can happen in those transformative moments, and the schematics of
how they occurred are often overlooked. With this work, I'm exploring
how this uncanny phenomenon unfolds through simultaneous lived
experiences. By juxtaposing a multitude of realities and perspectives,
I'm looking to decentralize history, to illustrate that there is not one
primary story, but many that coalesce.

\textbf{What's the work of art in any medium that changed your life?}
The tension between the playfulness and social critique in Andy Warhol's
``\href{https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/42835/1/invisible-artworks-andy-warhol-yves-klein-david-hammons-kerry-james-marshall}{Invisible
Sculpture}'' (1985) is always stuck in my mind. For me, it represents
art's unlimited potential.
