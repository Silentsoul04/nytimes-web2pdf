<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Friday on
Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 other senior officials
in Hong Kong and mainland China over their roles in cracking down on
political dissent.

The move comes after Beijing announced in June that it was imposing a
[national security law in Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html)
to grant security agencies expansive powers.

The sanctions are the first against officials in Hong Kong and mainland
China over suppression of [pro-democracy
protests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/world/asia/why-are-hong-kong-protesters.html)
and dissent in the territory. Last month, President Trump [signed an
executive
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-news-conference.html)
seeking to punish China for its repression in Hong Kong.

“The Chinese Communist Party has made clear that Hong Kong will never
again enjoy the high degree of autonomy that Beijing itself promised to
the Hong Kong people,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a
statement on Friday. “The United States will therefore treat Hong Kong
as ‘one country, one system,’ and take action against individuals who
have crushed the Hong Kong people’s freedoms.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Pompeo was referring to “one country, two systems,” the term widely
used to describe the promise that China made in an international treaty
signed with Britain in 1984 that Hong Kong would remain autonomous for
50 years after its transition from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

Treasury Department officials said Ms. Lam was being penalized because
she was “directly responsible” for enacting Beijing’s policies that
stifle dissent in Hong Kong.

Others facing sanctions include Chris Tang, the commissioner of the Hong
Kong Police Force, and Stephen Lo, who led the police department until
2019 and oversaw the arrest of 4,000 pro-democracy protesters that led
to over 1,600 people being injured, according to Treasury Department
officials. Many of the protesters were released on bail hours after
their arrests.

Also facing penalties are the leaders of China’s liaison office to Hong
Kong and of its Hong Kong and Macau affairs office, both of which enact
Beijing’s policies in the territory. The most senior Chinese official
named is Xia Baolong, who oversees the Hong Kong and Macau affairs
office, which is under the State Council, China’s cabinet. Mr. Xia is
believed to be trusted by Xi Jinping, China’s leader.

The chief of the liaison office, Luo Huining, is the most senior
mainland official in Hong Kong. The Treasury Department also named Zheng
Yanxiong and Eric Chan, two officials taking up senior posts established
by the new national security law.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The actions announced on Friday are symbolic to a degree, since it is
unclear if any of the 11 individuals have assets or property in the
United States that would be frozen under the measure.

The officials are prohibited from traveling to the United States.

Ms. Lam addressed the threat of facing sanctions during a news
conference last month, saying she would “laugh it off.”

“I’m not worried,” she said. “I don’t have assets in the United States
and don’t really yearn to go to the U.S.”

Dali L. Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said
the sanctions appeared to be “very targeted.”

“It’s much more about sending a message and demonstrating that the
administration is acting on something that is in violation of and
impinging on the freedom and the democratic potential of Hong Kong,” he
said.

Pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong in June 2019, and the police
soon began taking increasingly hard-line measures to try to suppress
them, firing tear gas and using batons to beat demonstrators in subway
cars and alleyways. Those tactics escalated the protests, becoming the
focal point of grievances.

The Trump administration has taken a series of measures in recent months
that have heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing.
Administration officials say they are largely taking reciprocal actions
that counter bad behavior by the Chinese Communist Party.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Thursday, Mr. Trump [signed two executive
orders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html)
barring American residents and corporations from making any transactions
with the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps within 45 days, saying the
use of the services posed a national security risk because they do not
keep user data private. Officials did not detail what the ban would
entail. WeChat is widely used in China, and halting the use of the app
in the United States would be onerous for anyone trying to keep in touch
with people in China or make transactions with Chinese businesses.

Last month, the administration [imposed
sanctions](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F07%2F09%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Ftrump-china-sanctions-uighurs.html)
on senior Chinese officials, including a member of the Communist Party’s
ruling Politburo, over human rights abuses against the largely Muslim
Uighur ethnic minority in the Xinjiang region. Officials have also [shut
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html)
the Chinese Consulate in Houston, citing economic espionage efforts by
diplomats; banned some students affiliated with Chinese military
institutions from traveling to the United States; and arrested officers
or affiliates of the People’s Liberation Army in the United States on
accusations of visa fraud.

The Trump administration has also imposed visa restrictions on Chinese
journalists in the United States and effectively expelled dozens of
them. That has incited Beijing to take harsh actions on American
journalists, including expelling employees of The New York Times, The
Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.

In May, the administration [imposed a new 90-day
limit](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/us/politics/china-journalists-us-visa-crackdown.html)
on stays for Chinese citizens who are in the United States on a
journalism visa. This required all such journalists to apply for a visa
renewal before Thursday.

U.S. officials are not expected to renew many of the visas, which would
lead to expulsions in the coming days.

Except for starting a trade war in 2018, Mr. Trump [was reluctant to
take hard
actions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/politics/trump-china-bolton.html)
against China during much of his time in office. He constantly praised
China’s leader and pleaded with Mr. Xi for help on re-election. But he
has soured on that relationship since the coronavirus spread across the
United States, devastating the economy and his prospects for
re-election.

Since Beijing announced the new national security law for Hong Kong,
American officials have debated how to persuade Chinese officials to
roll it back or how to penalize the Chinese government.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last month, Mr. Trump signed an executive order ending the special
status that the United States grants Hong Kong in diplomatic and trade
relations. U.S. officials are now beginning to treat the territory like
mainland China.

At the time, some administration officials had wanted Mr. Trump to
announce that his government would impose sanctions on Ms. Lam and other
officials in Hong Kong and China. The president declined to do so then.

The current flurry of actions against China dovetails with a core part
of Mr. Trump’s campaign strategy. His aides are trying to show Mr. Trump
is hitting China hard to shift the national conversation from his
[failures on managing the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/coronavirus-us.html)
and the economy.

The outbreak was first detected in central China, and recently, Mr.
Trump has blamed Chinese officials for failing to contain it, though he
[praised](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1243407157321560071?lang=en)
Mr. Xi’s efforts this winter.

Some of the China hawks in the administration are trying to [set the two
nations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/asia/us-china-trump-xi.html)
on a course for long-term confrontation and ensure that relations remain
in a state of open rivalry even if the presumptive Democratic candidate,
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., wins the November election.

“This administration is weaving together a tapestry of actions, almost
like they’re trying to cement a stand that, regardless of what happens
in the elections, would not be taken down easily,” Mr. Yang said.

Elaine Yu and Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong.
