The federal government on Wednesday announced the first of many major
deals to buy vaccines from two U.S.-based multinational drug companies:
Pfizer and Moderna.

There will be “millions” of doses, Anita Anand, the cabinet minister
responsible for the deal, said at a news conference. She did not offer
any more details. But she and another cabinet minister said the
government was negotiating deals with other vaccine makers, including
some in Canada.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The catch in all of this is that neither Pfizer nor Moderna, nor anyone
else, actually has a proven vaccine. The situation is similar to what
happened with the Salk polio vaccine in the mid-1950s. As I[wrote in
last week’s
newsletter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/world/canada/leone-farrell-chemist.html),
to speed up that vaccine, the federal government gambled and placed a
bulk order to start production at Connaught Laboratories before trials
on patients had proved that it was safe and effective.

Connaught, which played a crucial role in bringing the Salk vaccine to
production, was the only game in Canada back then. This time around,
many more companies are vying to make the coronavirus vaccine. The World
Health Organization counts[28 possible
vaccines](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines)now
undergoing trials. Many more, including some Canadian candidates, are in
earlier phases.

To guide its vaccine shopping, as well as its investments in Canadian
vaccines and vaccine production, the federal government has turned to [a
panel of
experts](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/corporate/covid-19-vaccine-task-force)with
backgrounds in science, medicine, public health and vaccine
manufacturing.

As bets go, choosing Pfizer and Moderna is relatively conservative. Late
last month, both companies began the first large-scale trials of their
candidate vaccines in the United States.

Trials*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html)*\]*

But earlier in the week, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health
officer, warned against [making too many assumptions about the power of
vaccination](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1772035651845) to end the
current pandemic.

At this stage, she said, vaccines are not “the silver bullet solution.”

She said many vaccines for other viruses only lessen the consequences of
infection; they don’t prevent it.

As a result, she said, public health officials are working on the
assumption that many of the measures now in place will be around for
upward of two years.

Reggie Lo, a professor emeritus at the University of Guelph who focuses
on vaccine development, told me this week that the first vaccine
candidates, which may not be the most effective ones, may appear by the
end of the year, but scaling up their production to inoculate billions
will be a formidable challenge.

</div>

He also stressed that with the exception of smallpox, other deadly
viruses have not been wiped out by decades of vaccination.

“The public needs to deal with this ‘forever,’” Dr. Lo said in an email.
“Anyone who thinks the epidemic is over with development of a vaccine
failed to grasp the enormity of the problem.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

His father, he said, was usually good spirited at home. But one
afternoon in 1955 when Mr. Martin went into his library, his father was
unusually distracted and testy. He was told to leave and go see his
mother.

From her, Mr. Martin learned that his father was grappling with perhaps
the most difficult decision of his life: whether to continue with plans
to vaccinate Canada. A [batch of vaccines made by Cutter
Laboratories,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/) an
American company, had been determined to be defective and ended up
infecting 40,000 children. About 200 of them were left paralyzed, and 10
died.

As a result, the United States suspended polio vaccination for several
months, a decision that led to infections, deaths and paralysis.
Ultimately, the elder Mr. Martin was convinced that Connaught’s vaccine
was safe, and Canada continued its inoculations without incident.

The stakes, if anything, are greater now as the world rushes to produce
a coronavirus vaccine. We all may be called to have patience and
realistic
expectations.
