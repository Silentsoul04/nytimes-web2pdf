`Silver
Bullet'}\label{canada-has-placed-its-first-vaccine-order-but-dont-expect-a-silver-bullet}}

Before the federal government announced an order for millions of doses
of a still unproven vaccine, its top doctor sounded a note of caution.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/ian-austen}{\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2019/07/18/reader-center/author-ian-austen/author-ian-austen-thumbLarge.png}}

For Canadians anxiously craving an inoculation against the coronavirus,
this week brought both optimism and words of sobering caution.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/07/27/us/07canadaletter-moderna/27virus-briefing-lede-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

The federal government on Wednesday announced the first of many major
deals to buy vaccines from two U.S.-based multinational drug companies:
Pfizer and Moderna.

There will be ``millions'' of doses, Anita Anand, the cabinet minister
responsible for the deal, said at a news conference. She did not offer
any more details. But she and another cabinet minister said the
government was negotiating deals with other vaccine makers, including
some in Canada.

The catch in all of this is that neither Pfizer nor Moderna, nor anyone
else, actually has a proven vaccine. The situation is similar to what
happened with the Salk polio vaccine in the mid-1950s. As
I\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/world/canada/leone-farrell-chemist.html}{wrote
in last week's newsletter}, to speed up that vaccine, the federal
government gambled and placed a bulk order to start production at
Connaught Laboratories before trials on patients had proved that it was
safe and effective.

Connaught, which played a crucial role in bringing the Salk vaccine to
production, was the only game in Canada back then. This time around,
many more companies are vying to make the coronavirus vaccine. The World
Health Organization
counts\href{https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines}{28
possible vaccines}now undergoing trials. Many more, including some
Canadian candidates, are in earlier phases.

To guide its vaccine shopping, as well as its investments in Canadian
vaccines and vaccine production, the federal government has turned to
\href{https://nrc.canada.ca/en/corporate/covid-19-vaccine-task-force}{a
panel of experts}with backgrounds in science, medicine, public health
and vaccine manufacturing.

As bets go, choosing Pfizer and Moderna is relatively conservative. Late
last month, both companies began the first large-scale trials of their
candidate vaccines in the United States.

and Pfizer Begin Late-Stage Vaccine Trials}}\emph{{]}}

Assuming all goes well, Ms. Anand said, the first deliveries should
appear next year.

But earlier in the week, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health
officer, warned against
\href{https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1772035651845}{making too many
assumptions about the power of vaccination} to end the current pandemic.

At this stage, she said, vaccines are not ``the silver bullet
solution.''

She said many vaccines for other viruses only lessen the consequences of
infection; they don't prevent it.

As a result, she said, public health officials are working on the
assumption that many of the measures now in place will be around for
upward of two years.

Reggie Lo, a professor emeritus at the University of Guelph who focuses
on vaccine development, told me this week that the first vaccine
candidates, which may not be the most effective ones, may appear by the
end of the year, but scaling up their production to inoculate billions
will be a formidable challenge.

He also stressed that with the exception of smallpox, other deadly
viruses have not been wiped out by decades of vaccination.

``The public needs to deal with this `forever,''' Dr. Lo said in an
email. ``Anyone who thinks the epidemic is over with development of a
vaccine failed to grasp the enormity of the problem.''

Last week's newsletter prompted the former Prime Minister Paul Martin to
call me. His father, also Paul Martin, was, as federal health minister,
the main player in Canada's rollout and participation in development of
the Salk vaccine.

The younger Mr. Martin, who was infected with polio as a child, had a
memory of that time that captures the uncertainty around vaccines.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that

    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest

    frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the
    coronavirus typically
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9}{produce}

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

His father, he said, was usually good spirited at home. But one
afternoon in 1955 when Mr. Martin went into his library, his father was
unusually distracted and testy. He was told to leave and go see his
mother.

From her, Mr. Martin learned that his father was grappling with perhaps
the most difficult decision of his life: whether to continue with plans
to vaccinate Canada. A
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/}{batch of
vaccines made by Cutter Laboratories,} an American company, had been
determined to be defective and ended up infecting 40,000 children. About
200 of them were left paralyzed, and 10 died.

As a result, the United States suspended polio vaccination for several
months, a decision that led to infections, deaths and paralysis.
Ultimately, the elder Mr. Martin was convinced that Connaught's vaccine
was safe, and Canada continued its inoculations without incident.

The stakes, if anything, are greater now as the world rushes to produce
a coronavirus vaccine. We all may be called to have patience and
realistic expectations.
