# Coronavirus Live Updates: As U.S. Stimulus Talks Near Collapse, Trump Eyes Executive Orders

New York’s governor said schools can reopen for in-person instruction,
but he left the details up to the districts. Africa surpasses a million
confirmed cases, though the real number may be higher.

As the U.S. stimulus talks falter again, Trump’s advisers say they would
tell him to act on his own.

Crisis negotiations between the White House and top Democrats teetered
on the brink of collapse on Friday, as both sides said they remained
deeply divided on an economic recovery package and President Trump’s
advisers said they would recommend that he bypass Congress and act on
his own to provide relief.

It was not clear what power Mr. Trump might have to move unilaterally to
extend jobless aid or otherwise redirect federal relief money as he sees
fit, since Congress controls spending. But the announcement by Mark
Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and Steven Mnuchin, the
Treasury secretary, that they were counseling him to do so reflected the
failure of 10 days of marathon talks to reach a bipartisan compromise to
pump more aid into the slowing economic recovery.

It came after another unproductive meeting between the administration
officials and Democratic leaders, which ended with no agreement and no
additional talks scheduled.

Democrats, who had earlier said they would be willing to lower their
spending demands to $2 trillion from $3.4 trillion, said the White
House, needed to return with a higher overall price tag, after Mr.
Trump’s negotiators declined to accept that offer. Republicans have
proposed a $1 trillion plan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The House is Democratic, they need a majority of Democratic votes in
the Senate,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the
minority leader, emerging with Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the meeting.
“Meet us in the middle — for God’s sake, please — for the sake of
America, meet us in the middle.”

In a tweet, President Trump indicated he was ready to move on from the
talks. “Pelosi and Schumer only interested in Bailout Money for poorly
run Democrat cities and states. Nothing to do with China Virus\! Want
one trillion dollars. No interest. We are going a different way\!” [he
wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1291842540023558146?s=20).

Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Meadows demanded that Democrats agree to lower the
amount of aid for state and local governments, and provide more
specifics about how they were proposing to revive lapsed unemployment
benefits.

“There’s both a top-line issue but also policy issues,” Mr. Mnuchin said
after the meeting, which lasted more than an hour in Ms. Pelosi’s
office. “I don’t want to speculate as to whether there is an agreement
or not. We will continue to try to get an agreement that’s in the best
interest of the people, and that’s why we’re here.”

While the executive orders have not yet been finalized, Mr. Meadows said
it was likely that action would come over the weekend.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is not a perfect answer — we’ll be the first ones to say that,” he
said. “But it is all that we can do and all the president can do within
the confines of his executive power, and we’re going to encourage him to
do it.”

Schools across New York [can reopen for in-person instruction this
fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/nyregion/cuomo-schools-reopening.html),
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Friday, solidifying New York’s role as [one of
the few states in
America](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening.html)
that has a coronavirus transmission rate low enough to bring children
back into classrooms — not only in its rural communities but also in the
country’s biggest city.

Just a few months after New York City became a global center of the
pandemic, the governor opened the door for millions of students across
the state to return to classrooms, even as most public school students
in the country will start the school year remotely.

Under the governor’s announcement, schools can decide to open as long as
they are in a region where the average rate of positive tests is below 5
percent over a two- weeks period, based on reporting from all the
state’s counties. Most of the state, including New York City, has
maintained a positivity rate of about 1 percent. Mayor Bill de Blasio
has said [schools can only open in the
city](https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1291777208953036804) if the
positivity rate is below 3 percent.

But Mr. Cuomo’s announcement does not guarantee that school buildings in
the state’s roughly 700 local districts will actually reopen in the
coming weeks. It is now up to local politicians and superintendents to
decide whether to reopen, and how to do so. Their in-person reopening
plans must also be approved by the state’s education and health
departments in the coming weeks.

Though Mr. Cuomo [has frequently wielded his
power](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/12/nyregion/schools-cuomo-de-blasio-nyc-coronavirus.html)
over school closures throughout the pandemic, in some cases
contradicting Mr. de Blasio on key decisions, he has signaled that his
role in the debate over reopening will be limited to setting the
threshold for a safe reopening, and unilaterally shutting down schools
if that threshold is reached.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The governor directed districts on Friday to publicly post their plans
for testing teachers and students after the school year begins — a
demand from the teachers’ union that New York City has not released
significant details on. Mr. Cuomo also asked all districts to post their
protocols for when someone in a school tests positive. Mr. de Blasio
outlined the city’s plan for that last week: Just two cases in different
classrooms of the same school could force its closing for two weeks.

And Mr. Cuomo said school districts must hold more virtual meetings with
parents and teachers throughout August to answer questions.

Mr. Cuomo is leaving most of the other details about how to actually
reopen safely to individual school districts. Districts across the state
are tentatively planning to reopen late in August or early next month.
New York City, the nation’s largest school district and the only major
district planning to reopen even part-time, is scheduled to start school
on Sept. 10.

[Many
teachers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/teacher-union-school-reopening-coronavirus.html)
and parents across the state have expressed alarm about returning to
school buildings as the virus has spiked in other states. But families
across New York say they are desperate for schools and child care
centers to open so that they can return to work. About 75 percent of New
York City students are low-income and many of their parents are
essential workers or employees who cannot work from home.

New York City and other districts across the state are still finalizing
strategies that allow for social distancing in school buildings, trying
to find enough nurses to staff school buildings, and upgrading or
replacing ventilation systems in classrooms.

Here are some other key education developments:

  - In some places in the United States, including Georgia, Indiana,
    Mississippi and Tennessee, **students have begun some school as
    early as last week**, with quarantines quickly following. The Times
    [spoke to students about their
    experiences](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/coronavirus-students.html).
    One who tested positive said she “was a little scared.”

  - The health officer of **Montgomery County, Md.**, Dr. Travis Gayles,
    backed away from a confrontation with Gov. Larry Hogan on Friday,
    rescinding an order prohibiting private schools from in-person
    instruction. The governor had countermanded the order on Monday and
    the issue was headed to federal court. A statement by the county
    said Dr. Gayles continued to “strongly advise schools against
    in-person learning.”

  - **Johns Hopkins University** and **Princeton University** became the
    latest academic institutions to rescind plans for in-person classes
    this fall, announcing that they would instead conduct undergraduate
    instruction entirely online because of the virus’s effect on their
    surrounding communities.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

  - **Hannah Watters**, the 15-year-old student at North Paulding High
    School in Dallas, Ga., who received a five-day suspension for
    posting photos of packed hallways on the first day back to classes,
    said Friday that administrators had [lifted the
    suspension](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/north-paulding-high-school-coronavirus-georgia.html).
    “My mom has always told me that she won’t get mad at us if we get in
    trouble as long as it’s ‘good trouble,’” Hannah said in an
    interview, invoking the famous phrase of Representative John Lewis,
    the civil rights leader who was laid to rest in Atlanta last week.

  - Some educators say students and parents can expect much less
    in-person instruction than was initially hoped for this school year.
    Teachers are finding themselves unprepared, leading to questions
    about whether schools [missed a chance
    to](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/us/remote-learning-fall-2020.html)**[fix

As California surpassed 10,000 coronavirus deaths this week, the head of
the state’s Health and Human Services Agency, Dr. Mark Ghaly, said a
breakdown in the main disease reporting system had undercounted as many
as 300,000 test results.

“Our data system failed, and that failure led to inaccurate case
numbers,” Dr. Ghaly said.

The malfunctions in the data system were compounded in recent days by
huge backlogs in testing — in some California counties results are
taking more than two weeks to process — muddying the overall picture of
the virus’s progression in the nation’s most populous state.

The breakdown dates to July 25, when a server failed, and the agency
separately stopped receiving data from one of the largest labs in the
state, Dr. Ghaly said. The missing data, which could amount to thousands

With well over 500,000 cases and 10,042 deaths,
[California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html)
has the third highest coronavirus death toll in the United States,
behind [New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html),
which has had more than 32,000 deaths, and [New
Jersey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html)
with over 15,000, according to a New York Times database. On a per
capita basis, California ranks 29th in reported coronavirus deaths.

Despite the undercounting of cases, officials say they believe the
overall encouraging trends reported by Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier in the
week still hold. Mr. Newsom had reported a decline of more than 20
percent in the seven-day average of cases.

“We believe that the trend has been stabilizing and coming down,” Dr.
Ghaly said, an assessment partly based on hospitalization rates, which
are calculated using separate data systems.

The American economy gained **** 1.8 million jobs last month, even as
the coronavirus surged in many parts of the country and renewed
restrictions caused some businesses to close for a second time.

Still, the increase reported Friday by the Labor Department was well
below the 4.8 million jump in jobs in June and a sign that momentum is
slowing after a burst of economic activity in late spring. The
unemployment rate fell to 10.2 percent.

“The easy hiring that was done in May and June has been exhausted,” said
Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “With many
companies not running at full capacity, it becomes harder to get that
incremental worker back in.”

The gain of 1.8 million jobs is heartening but represents only a small
fraction of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April, when all but
essential businesses closed.

The report from the Labor Department follows the expiration of federal
supplemental unemployment benefits of $600 a week late last month,
payments that kept many households afloat while buoying the economy.

Africa has passed [the milestone of one million confirmed cases of the
virus](https://africacdc.org/covid-19/), despite efforts by many
governments to keep people at home at great cost to their livelihoods.
The continent has reported at least 22,000 deaths.

The spread of the virus has happened more slowly than some experts
anticipated, although most African countries have low levels of testing.
They have relatively few deaths, too, according to the official numbers,
something often attributed to their large numbers of young people.

“It took Africa nearly five months to hit 500,000 Covid-19 cases, but
about a month to double that number,” said Patrick Youssef, the regional
director for Africa of the International Committee of the Red Cross, in
a statement.

Governments locked down early, but quickly realized that people did not
have enough money to stay home and that if they did not ease
restrictions, millions would suffer.

The actual one million caseload may have been reached on the continent
weeks or even months ago, hidden by extremely low rates of testing for
the virus. Also, fear of the stigma associated with being diagnosed with
the virus and a plethora of conspiracy theories that mean many doubt its
very existence have probably kept a number of infected people from
reporting their symptoms, experts said.

More than half the confirmed cases are in South Africa, the African
country hit hardest by far, and one that has done comparatively
extensive testing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Caroline Tatua, a senior health coordinator with the International
Rescue Committee, said the lack of testing — and therefore reliable data
— was hampering countries’ efforts to fight the virus.

“We are hitting a million, but we know that that doesn’t get close to
the true picture of what we are really facing,” she said in an
interview. “Without knowing the true picture, we’re not sure whether the
response we’re mounting is sufficient, or what we should be doing.”

Indicators that the spread of the virus could be more extensive than
official figures suggest include increased mortality from respiratory
diseases and the high percentage of infected health workers.

The latest coronavirus outbreak in Vietnam, which followed more than
three months with no confirmed cases of local transmission, is driven by
a variant of the coronavirus that is far more infectious than the
variants that previously circulated in the country, health officials
said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scientists have [urged
caution](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/science/coronavirus-mutation-genetics-spike.html)
in concluding that a variant of the virus is more infectious. While some
believe a mutation circulating widely since February gave it a
biological edge, others believe more evidence is needed to differentiate
any potential effect from other factors like lockdowns, travel patterns
and luck.

Vietnamese officials pointed to the fast spread of the country’s most
recent outbreak. It had gone months without a single death from the
coronavirus, and its fast, firm reaction to the virus was praised for
keeping infections in check. But an outbreak that appears to have
originated in the central city of Danang last month has sent the virus
to other regions.

On Friday, health officials announced that new cases had been found in
two more provinces and that about 300 infections were tied to the Danang
outbreak.

Research by the Vietnamese C.D.C. and a local medical research institute
found that while the viral mutation detected in Danang did not lead to
more severe disease, it was more infectious. Each person could spread
the new variant to five or six people, rather than one or two people
with earlier variants, Nguyen Thanh Long, the acting health minister,
said at a government
meeting.

[Some](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/science/coronavirus-mutation-genetics-spike.html)
[research](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20166082v1)
has suggested that a variant of the virus may infect more people. But
the size of any effect is unknown, and other researchers have argued
that [current evidence is
insufficient](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674\(20\)30817-5.pdf)
to make such a claim.

Vietnam has now recorded 10 deaths from the coronavirus, although the
total caseload remains below 900. Domestic tourists who visited Danang
are undergoing mass testing, and Danang officials plan to test every
city resident for the virus.

For most of the year, Sturgis, S.D., is a relatively quiet city of 7,000
residents tucked beside a 1.2 million-acre forest, with a motorcycle
museum as its signature attraction. But each summer, Sturgis transforms
as bikers descend for an immense motorcycle rally.

This year’s festival may attract about 250,000 people despite an uptick
in virus cases across the state, city officials say, leading to fears it
could become a super-spreader event.

The 10-day rally, which begins Friday, [may be the country’s largest
public gathering since the pandemic
began](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/sturgis-motorcyle-rally-coronavirus.html),
and it comes amid widespread opposition. More than 60 percent of
residents favored postponing the event, according to a city-sponsored
survey.

“We should have postponed or canceled the rally last March,” said Terry
Keszler, a Sturgis City Council member, echoing the concerns that have
divided his community.

City officials faced pressure from businesses, people outside the city
and threats of litigation, Mr. Keszler said. Still, they cut back on
advertising and canceled city-sponsored events, including the opening
ceremony.

Over the past week, there has been an average of [84 coronavirus cases a
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/south-dakota-coronavirus-cases.html)
in South Dakota, a 31 percent increase over the previous two weeks. And
some say the surge might grow worse: The city plans to offer coronavirus
testing for its residents once the rally concludes on Aug. 16. South
Dakota is among several states that did not put in place a lockdown or a
mandatory mask requirement.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Little could be done to stop the event, said Doreen Allison Creed, the
Meade County commissioner who represents Sturgis. Ms. Creed said the
county lacked the authority to shut down the rally because much of it
takes place on state-licensed campgrounds.

“We are either going to be a great success story or failure,” Ms. Creed
said.

Since the start of the pandemic, child welfare workers in the United
States have been exempt from stay-at-home orders because they have the
legal responsibility to take emergency custody of abused children and,
when necessary, place them in foster care.

Yet leaders at the federal, state and local levels [have pushed these
workers to carry out their duties from
home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/us/virus-child-abuse.html)
as much as possible to limit the virus’s spread. The consequences are
now rippling across California, which has the [highest rate of child
poverty](https://edsource.org/2018/child-poverty-drops-in-california-but-is-still-the-nations-highest/596285)
in the nation when the cost of living is taken into account.

In Fresno County, about a third of the child welfare staff went on leave
as the pandemic spread. Even those who remained on the job generally did
work they could manage without leaving their homes.

The death of one infant in the county was discovered more than 30 days
after a hotline began receiving several tips raising urgent concerns
about the well-being of the baby and his twin brother. For the next
month, as the virus took off and California declared a stay-at-home
order in mid-March, the child welfare agency did almost nothing other
than asking the twins’ mother to take a drug test, which she failed to
do, records show.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Child welfare officials have determined that the death was the result of
neglect.

The child welfare agency for Los Angeles County, the largest in the
nation, has locked its doors, and the agency’s leaders sent home
virtually all employees.

Many abused children whom the agency deemed to be living under “high” or
“very high” risk of renewed abuse were not visited for months, records
and interviews show. Before the pandemic, child welfare workers in Los
Angeles were required to at least try visiting children within five days
of a new abuse allegation. Now they are allowed to take up to 10 days to
respond to most new reports of mistreatment.

“We are in completely uncharted territory, and it concerns me greatly,”
said Bobby Cagle, the director of the child welfare agency for Los
Angeles County.
