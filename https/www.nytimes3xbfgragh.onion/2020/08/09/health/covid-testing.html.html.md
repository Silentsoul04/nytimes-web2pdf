Several states are trying to increase coronavirus testing with faster

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, who last week [tested positive for the
coronavirus, then negative and then negative
again](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/mike-dewine-coronavirus.html),
said on CNN on Sunday that his roller-coaster ride should not be reason
for people to think “that testing is not reliable or doesn’t work.”

His first test result was positive, when he was screened with a rapid
testing method on Thursday before President Trump arrived in Ohio for
campaign appearances.

Mr. DeWine was given [an antigen
test](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/us/covid-test-accuracy-governor-dewine-ohio.html)
made by Quidel, one of two companies that have received [emergency use
authorization from the Food and Drug
Administration](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics-euas#individual-antigen)
for coronavirus antigen tests.

These tests, while fast and convenient, are known to be less accurate
than PCR tests, which were used to retest Mr. DeWine twice on Thursday
and [once more on
Saturday](https://twitter.com/MikeDeWine/status/1292192192312770561).
All three PCR tests turned up negative, confirming that Mr. DeWine was
not infected with the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I don’t think that DeWine’s results were surprising, per se,” said
Andrea Prinzi, a clinical microbiologist and diagnostics researcher at
the Anschutz Medical Campus in Colorado. “We know that the performance
of antigen testing is not as accurate as PCR testing.”

The Ohio governor’s experience, however, may raise concerns about how
much states will rely on antigen tests as they seek to augment the forms
of testing, like PCR, that are in short supply or that are mired in
laboratory backlogs, unable to generate results in a timely fashion to
help assess caseloads and dole out treatments.

Mr. DeWine, a Republican, is one of seven governors who announced last
week that they were [banding
together](https://governor.maryland.gov/2020/08/04/governors-of-maryland-louisiana-massachusetts-michigan-ohio-and-virginia-announce-major-bipartisan-interstate-compact-for-three-million-rapid-antigen-tests/)
to buy 3.5 million rapid coronavirus tests, including antigen tests, to
ramp up
production.

Daniel Tierney, the press secretary for Mr. DeWine, noted in an email
that the states involved were considering “multiple companies and
multiple testing types,” but did not specify further.

On Sunday, Mr. DeWine said he had already been in touch with Gov. Larry
Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, to talk about the states’ agreement to
use their collective “purchasing power” for testing and other supplies.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If anyone needed a wake-up call with antigens, how careful you have to
be, we certainly saw that with my test,” Mr. DeWine said. “And we’re
going to be very careful in how we use it.”

A spokesman for Mr. Hogan, Michael Ricci, echoed that sentiment: “We are
taking this one step at a time.”

Accurate test results are crucial for curbing the spread of disease.
False positives, like the one Mr. DeWine received, can set off an
unnecessary period of self-isolation, depriving people of access to
their workplaces or their own families. False negatives, on the other
hand, can hasten the spread of disease from unwittingly infected people.

PCR tests, like the ones used to determine Mr. DeWine’s health status,
are often the best bet for avoiding incorrect results. But these tests
are in [short supply
nationwide](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-testing-supply-shortage.html)
as manufacturers and laboratories struggle to meet the increase in
demand that has accompanied recent surges in infections. Turnaround
times for results have stretched past two weeks in some parts of the
country, rendering the information useless for anxious people who need
to know their status immediately so they can self-isolate as needed and
stop the virus from spreading further.

“Honestly, PCR tests were not designed for this type of mass
screening/testing,” Ms. Prinzi said. PCR tests, she added, function best
in laboratory environments that are well stocked with chemicals,
high-tech machines and specially trained personnel. Their
high-maintenance ingredient lists and relatively hefty price tags aren’t
terribly compatible with quickly getting answers to large numbers of
people.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

Rapid tests, on the other hand, can [catch a majority of active
infections if administered
frequently](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html),
even if they’re less accurate, many experts have argued.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Compared with PCR tests, antigen tests are more likely to return a false
negative result, mistaking an infected person as virus-free. Quidel’s
test, for instance, can miss up to 20 percent of the cases that PCR
detects.

Notably, Mr. DeWine’s antigen test produced the opposite error: a false
positive that incorrectly indicated he had been
infected.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

But Mr. DeWine might not have been have been the ideal candidate for an
antigen test, said Karissa Culbreath, the scientific director of
infectious disease, research and development at TriCore Reference
Laboratories in New Mexico. Such tests usually perform better on samples
that contain high levels of virus, which tend to come from sicker
patients and people at higher risk of transmitting the infection. When
given within the first five days after coronavirus symptoms start,
Quidel’s false negative rate [may drop below 5
percent](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200717005579/en/Quidel%E2%80%99s-Sofia%C2%AE-SARS-Antigen-FIA-Updates-EUA),
according to the company’s [intended use
statement](https://www.quidel.com/sites/default/files/product/documents/EF1438902EN00.pdf).

Mr. DeWine, however, had not experienced symptoms, [aside from a
headache](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/mike-dewine-coronavirus.html).

“If we’re testing outside of that intended use, we might expect false
positives or false negatives,” Dr. Culbreath said, referring to the
five-day window that follows the onset of symptoms.

Allocating tests to people who fit that criteria, she added, will also
eliminate the need for scores of follow-up tests, especially while many
suspected cases across the nation remain undiagnosed.

“Tests are not interchangeable in their usefulness,” Dr. Culbreath said.
“We need to look at this as a tool belt and identify the right tool for
the job.”

On Sunday, Mr. DeWine did note that antigen tests function especially
well as “screening” tests, [expediently delivering information to
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html)
while their results are confirmed — if necessary — by the more accurate
PCR tests.

He added that it was incumbent upon the companies developing the tests
to demonstrate their accuracy, and that the experience would not deter
him from expanding testing in his state.

“We could use additional money for testing,” Mr. DeWine said. “We have
doubled our testing the last four weeks. We need to double it, and then
double it again.”

Ohio was [among the first states to reopen in
May](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html),
but as cases ticked up in mid-June and July, Mr. DeWine signed a
statewide [mandatory mask
mandate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)
and asked several counties to limit gatherings of any size. There have
been at least 99,969 cases and 3,668 deaths in Ohio since the beginning
of the pandemic, according to a [New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/ohio-coronavirus-cases.html).

The status of testing in the United States is far from ideal, Ms. Prinzi
said. But for now, it’s time to make do with the materials we have, she
said. “We can argue about diagnostic accuracy all day, but this is a
huge public health crisis right now,” she added.

Flaws and all, antigen tests are “a necessary part of our management of
the pandemic,” Dr. Culbreath said. “But we have to be very intentional
about how we use these tests.”
