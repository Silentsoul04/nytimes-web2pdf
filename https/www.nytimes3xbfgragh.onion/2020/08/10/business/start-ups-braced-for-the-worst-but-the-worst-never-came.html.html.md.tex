When the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&module=styln-coronavirus\&region=TOP_BANNER\&context=storylines_menu}{coronavirus
pandemic}first hit in March, many technology start-ups braced themselves
for The End, as business dried up, venture capitalists warned of dark
times ahead and restructuring experts predicted the beginning of a
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/technology/virus-start-ups-pummeled-layoffs-unwinding.html}{great
unwinding}'' after a decade-long boom.

Five months later, those doomsday warnings have not translated into the
drastic shakeout that many had expected.

Funding for young companies has stayed robust, particularly for the
larger start-ups. Some of them, like the stock trading app
\textbf{Robinhood} and \textbf{Discord}, the social media site, have
pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars in new capital in recent
months, boosting their valuations. And
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/technology/ipo-pandemic.html}{initial
public offerings of tech companies}have come roaring back, alongside a
surging stock market.

``Things generally are substantially better than our worst fears 90 days
ago,'' said Rich Wong, an investor at \textbf{Accel}, a Silicon Valley
venture capital firm.

Still, it's been a hectic period for some firms. Getaround, a car
sharing start-up, started the year by laying off 150 employees and
scaling back some operations. Two months later, with the spread of the
coronavirus, business got even worse, with further layoffs.

But in May, business bounced back when people began using the start-up's
cars to get on the road again. Getaround's revenue in the United States
for the year is now 40 percent above where it was a year ago. Last
month, it brought back all of its furloughed employees and started
hiring again.

``We have seen a very, very fast recovery,'' said Sam Zaid, Getaround's
chief executive, adding that he was now raising more cash. ``It's been a
bit of a wild ride.''
