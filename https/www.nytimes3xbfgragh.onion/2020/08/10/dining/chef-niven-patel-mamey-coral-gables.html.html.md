A return to indoor dining may be far off, but he just opened a new,

CORAL GABLES, Fla. — The last week in July was an especially stressful
one for Niven Patel, and for Floridians in general.

It began with Mr. Patel’s decision to permanently close one of two
locations of [Ghee Indian Kitchen](https://www.gheemiami.com/), the
Miami-area restaurant that brought the chef national acclaim. The week
ended with South Florida
[bracing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/florida-hurricane-isaias-coronavirus.html)
for the arrival of [Hurricane
Isaias](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/isaias-storm-updates.html),
just as the state recorded its fourth straight day of record reported
deaths from Covid-19.

In the midst of all of this — while still adjusting to having become a
father to twin daughters in June — Mr. Patel was busy with final
preparations for the opening of a new restaurant called
[Mamey](https://www.thesishotelmiami.com/taste/mamey/). Doing so in a
pandemic, he conceded, is “pretty insane.”

Mr. Patel, 36, is one of Miami’s best-known and promising young chefs —
in May, Food & Wine magazine anointed him one of the country’s [10 Best
New
Chefs](https://www.foodandwine.com/chefs/best-new-chefs-2020-niven-patel).
At a time when many high-end restaurateurs are putting their careers and
businesses on pause in the face of spiraling health and economic crises,
Mr. Patel is forging ahead — in his quiet, cautious way — with Mamey, in
an attempt to salvage what was shaping up to be a banner year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new restaurant, which opened last Wednesday in Coral Gables, serves
food and drinks only for takeout, delivery and limited outdoor dining,
in keeping with Miami-Dade County’s ban on indoor service. But even with
those restrictions, Mr. Patel was eager to
act.

“It’s honestly been very mentally refreshing, to get into the kitchen
and start creating new dishes that we’ve envisioned now for a year and a
half,” he said. “Where at Ghee it’s been about survival, this is new.”

Mr. Patel has had big plans. Mamey, which takes its name from a fruit
popular in Latin America and South Florida, was originally scheduled to
open in the spring, along with another restaurant, Orno, both of them in
[Paseo de la Riviera](https://www.paseodelariviera.com/), a new
development in Coral Gables that includes apartments and the [THesis
Hotel](https://www.paseodelariviera.com/thesis-hotel/).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The openings were put on hold in March, when city and county officials
shut down Miami-area restaurants; so was that of a permanent location
for
[Erba](https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/restaurants/article236003993.html),
a pasta restaurant owned by Mr. Patel that had a popular run as a pop-up
in 2019. The photo shoot for a Food & Wine article on the top chefs was
also in March — a day after Mr. Patel laid off all 64 of his employees.
“It’s why I’m not smiling,” he said.

Two of those workers were farmers who tended to [Rancho Patel, the
two-acre
farm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/14/dining/florida-chef-niven-patel-backyard-farm.html)
that surrounds his family’s house in Homestead, about 30 miles south of
Coral Gables. Weeds have since taken over the swath of tilled land in
the backyard where he grew produce and herbs for Ghee Indian Kitchen.

“We can do some serious damage with this plot,” Mr. Patel said as he
kicked at rocks in the soil one evening. He recently hired [Roberto
Grossman](https://www.tinyfarmmiami.com/), a farmer in Homestead, to
revive Rancho Patel. “We just need to put some love back into
it.”

A bright spot at Rancho Patel has been the tropical fruit that
flourishes in the blazing-hot Florida summer and that Mr. Patel
harvests, with the help of his father in-law. Much of it — including
mangoes, lychees and guanábana — will show up in the food and cocktails
at Mamey, whose opening is the first step in providing the chef a larger
canvas to showcase the full range of his
talent.

But Mr. Patel was born in Valdosta, Ga., and raised in Jacksonville,
Fla. He made a name for himself locally while cooking New American food
as chef de cuisine at [Michael’s Genuine](https://michaelsgenuine.com/),
the flagship restaurant of Michael Schwartz, a star Miami chef, after
working in a restaurant on Grand Cayman, in the Caribbean.

“My whole background doesn’t have anything to do with Indian food,” Mr.
Patel said. “I get most excited about exploring all this other kind of
food.”

Mamey’s menu combines ideas from the cuisines of island nations — “We
don’t want boundaries,” Mr. Patel said — but with an emphasis on the
Caribbean.

At a menu tasting for his corporate partners in Mamey’s dining room a
week before the opening, the chef introduced a dish of plantains as a
personal favorite. Brown and custardy, they had been roasted in ghee,
and finished with pickled onions and fresh cilantro. The chef noted how
the flavors of Jamaican jerk were subtly expressed in the spiced yogurt
beneath the fruit.

Mohamed Alkassar, director of operations for [Nolan Reynolds
International](https://www.nrinternational.com/), the company that
developed Paseo de la Riviera, sat at the end of a long table in a room
behind Mamey’s bar. “What I like about Chef’s food the most, it’s the
simplest dish on the menu that ends up surprising me the most,” he
said.

Mr. Alkassar, 33, had his laptop open to renderings of what the
restaurant will look like by next week, after all of the design elements
are in place: Foliage covers the ceiling above low-hanging light shades
in the two dining rooms, and potted palm trees appear where boxes of
takeout containers were stacked chest-high.

“It was a big investment — a couple hundred thousand dollars — when we
were making the last finishing touches on Mamey,” Mr. Alkassar said.
“One of the conversations we had to have is, do we make that final
investment? When we’re not even going to open for inside dining?”

He said the company’s decision to proceed with Mamey and Orno, which is
now scheduled to open early next year with a menu focused on local
ingredients cooked in a wood-burning oven, was a vote of confidence in
Mr. Patel, as well as in the hotel. The development is across the street
from the University of Miami, which begins in-person classes on
Monday.

The school’s students and faculty, Mr. Alkassar said, “are a big part of
our revenue model, for both the hotel and the restaurants.”

Mr. Patel runs the hotel’s food and beverage programs in partnership
with Nolan Reynolds. The team developed multiple business plans for
Mamey over the spring and summer, as Miami-area restaurants struggled to
navigate changing government restrictions.

The menu was rewritten with takeout in mind. Mr. Patel and his staff
tested how dishes would perform by putting them in cardboard to-go boxes
and waiting 15 minutes.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“You want to be eating ceviche five minutes after you made it, not 45
minutes,” he said.

Mamey’s playful, bright-flavored food is reminiscent of the culturally
omnivorous, fruit-forward cuisine championed in Miami by chefs like
[Norman Van Aken](https://normanvanaken.com), [Cindy
Hutson](https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/restaurants/article244354337.html)
and [Douglas Rodriguez](https://chefdouglasrodriguez.com) in the 1990s
and early 2000s. That often busy, Latin-Caribbean-inspired cooking was a
dominant style in local fine dining in the 2010s, when chefs like Mr.
Schwartz and Michelle Bernstein grabbed attention with simpler dishes at
more modest, bistrolike restaurants.

With Mamey, Mr. Patel joins a new generation of chefs — Michael Beltran,
the 34-year-old chef-owner of [Ariete](https://arietecoconutgrove.com/),
is another prominent example — who are reorienting Miami fine dining
around cuisines brought to South Florida over the years by immigrants
from Latin America and the Caribbean. They’re doing so at a moment when
others are looking at the cooking of Miami’s recent past with fresh
eyes.

“When I started, I said, ‘I’m not going to put fruit on anything,’” said
Ms. Bernstein, 51, a Miami native whose restaurant in Little Havana,
[Café La Trova](https://www.cafelatrova.com/), is temporarily closed
because of the coronavirus. “I’m old enough where I’ve come around. Now
I can’t wait to brown butter and put mango in it.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Patel describes Mamey’s menu in practical terms. “The food fits in
with the demographics of the area,” he said. “Plus, I spent
two-and-a-half years in the Cayman Islands. I really love that cuisine.”

His colleagues invariably bring up his calm demeanor and lack of ego as
defining characteristics. Mr. Patel speaks quietly. His taste for
brightly colored socks — one afternoon at Racho Patel, he wore a green,
avocado-themed pair — may be the loudest thing about him.

“He’s very collected,” Mr. Schwartz said. “That struck me the first time
I met him. A lot of young chefs are kind of frenetic and chaotic.”

Mr. Patel’s even temper has certainly been tested during the pandemic.
In June, after seven years of trying to start a family, he and his wife,
Shivani, welcomed twin daughters into their home. Ms. Patel, a co-owner
of Aya Hospitality, stepped away from the restaurants to care for the
newborns, who were carried by a surrogate.

The babies’ arrival also raised the level of concern that Mr. Patel
could be exposed to the coronavirus through work — and could bring it
into the house he shares with his in-laws.

“We’re trying to create a culture of being safe,” Mr. Patel said. “One
person not being safe outside of work could affect the entire
enterprise.”

Brenda Perez took a job as a server at Mamey in part, she said, because
of the cautious way Mr. Patel has managed the original Ghee. The chef
ended indoor dining at the restaurant in early July, just before the
county mandated it.

“The way they responded to the virus this entire time has been very
responsible,” said Ms. Perez, 37, whose boyfriend works at Ghee. “They
care about their employees and how they feel.”

In June, as the coronavirus outbreak in Florida grew more worrisome, Mr.
Patel and Mr. Alkassar asked Mr. Piazza, the restaurant group’s
executive chef, to quarantine at home. Mr. Piazza’s wife had just tested
positive for the coronavirus, as had their nanny and the nanny’s
husband.

“When this happened, Niven was like, ‘Stay home,’” Mr. Piazza said.

Even after tests for his wife came back negative, though, the team
insisted that Mr. Piazza remain home, to guarantee a healthy chef in
case others fell sick.

Mr. Piazza, whom Mr. Patel refers to as “my right hand,” has spent the
time testing recipes and writing (and rewriting) menus for Mamey.

“‘The hotel is a big deal for a lot of people,’” Mr. Piazza said Mr.
Patel told him. “‘You’re the only guy who I would trust here if
something happened to
me.’”

Mr. Patel’s team was still making adjustments on opening night. Salsa
verde was added to the piri piri roast chicken. At the last minute, Mr.
Patel decided to tuck a gerbera daisy into every branded takeout bag.
With the THesis Hotel booked to over 60 percent capacity in its first
week of business, there was even talk of growing Mamey’s staff of 34
employees.

Mr. Alkassar stood near the outdoor pool bar on the hotel’s third floor,
where diners ate protected from the rain. He has opened more than 20
restaurants, he said, and despite all the challenges, he can’t remember
another opening that went as smoothly as Mamey’s.

To prove his point, he pulled up a string of texts between Mr. Patel and
himself on his smartphone. One from Mr. Patel read, “Thanks for letting
me always just be who I am.”

Mamey, in the THesis Hotel, 1350 South Dixie Highway, Coral Gables,
