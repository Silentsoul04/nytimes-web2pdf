WASHINGTON — Governors across the United States struggled on Monday with
how to make good on [President Trump’s
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/08/us/politics/trump-stimulus-bill-coronavirus.html)
that their economically battered states deliver billions more in
unemployment benefits to jobless residents.

Democrats were harshly critical of [Mr. Trump’s
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/10/business/economy/trump-payroll-tax-holiday.html),
which he signed on Saturday night after talks with Congress on a broad
new pandemic aid package collapsed. But even Republican governors said
the order could put a serious strain on their budgets and worried it
would take weeks for tens of millions of unemployed Americans to begin
seeing the benefit.

Congress initially provided a $600-a-week supplement to unemployment
benefits when the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of the United
States in March. But that benefit lapsed on July 31, after talks between
the White House and Congress broke down. Republicans had pushed for a
$400 supplemental benefit, Democrats said it was not enough, and so on
Saturday Mr. Trump ordered the $400 benefit — but said it was contingent
on states to come up with $100 of that on their own.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York told reporters on Monday that Mr.
Trump’s directive would cost his state about $4 billion by the end of
the year, making it little more than a fantasy. He said that no New
Yorker would see enhanced unemployment benefits because of the
president.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This only makes a bad situation worse,” Mr. Cuomo said. “When you are
in a hole, stop digging. This executive order only digs the hole
deeper.”

His comments were echoed by Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat
like Mr. Cuomo, who said Mr. Trump’s order would cost his state $1.5
billion through the end of the year.

“It’s not workable in its current form,” Mr. Beshear said. “It’s
something virtually no state can afford.”

“We could do it,” Mr. Hutchinson said in an interview. “It would be a
readjustment of priorities and take some time.” He added, “That’s not
ideal.”

Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican and an ally of Mr. Trump, said
his staff was still working through what to do about unemployment
benefits. “We’re digging in on that issue,” he said.

And Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Republican, said the order
would cost his state $26 million a week.

“The question of whether or not West Virginia will be able to pay that,
whether or not West Virginia will willingly pay that, I would tell you
hands down, period — period — we’re going to pay that,” Mr. Justice said
during a news conference. “We cannot let our people that are sitting out
there with no job wondering what in the world they are going to do, sit
out there and wilt on the vine.”

Still, Mr. Justice said he remained hopeful that the federal government
would decide to cover the whole cost of the program, and that lawmakers
would strike a deal. “We hope Congress will quit being a bunch of
political babies,” he said.

In the meantime, Mr. Trump appeared to be making cascading changes to
the policy on the fly, with the result that some unemployed people could
receive only a $300 supplemental benefit per week. Officials in the
office of Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, said they were told
late Sunday by the Labor Department that there was a new option that
allowing unemployed workers to claim the additional $300 per week
without the state kicking in an extra $100.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. DeWine opted to just take the federal money. “It’s a lot quicker to
implement and get the benefits to Ohioans at no additional cost to the
state,” said Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Mr. DeWine.

Several other states confirmed on Monday that they had received the same
option from the Labor Department, although how many would actually get
it remained an open question on Monday evening, when Mr. Trump told
reporters that he would waive the 25 percent match in certain cases.

“We just had a meeting with the governors, and they were very anxious to
get money for the people in their states,” Mr. Trump said at a White
House briefing. “We can terminate the 25 percent, or we don’t have to do
that. So we will see what it is — depends on the individual state — but
a lot of money will be going to a lot of people very quickly.”

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was with the president at the
briefing, said the benefit would begin to go out to unemployed workers
within the next week or two. But it was also unclear how long that
federal benefit would last, with some experts estimating it would be
just a few weeks because the administration could direct only existing
funding.

As the governors wrestled with Mr. Trump’s order, talks on a
congressional aid package remained at a standstill. Several House and
Senate members have scattered across the country unless they are called
back to vote on an agreement. They spent the day trading barbs over who
was to blame for the logjam.

In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Mr. Mnuchin, who has been
negotiating for the Trump administration, declined to comment on
specifics but said that the White House remained ready to make a
deal.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

He urged Democrats to consider a limited package focused on areas of
agreement such as funding for schools — an entreaty Democrats have
repeatedly rejected, arguing that the toll of the pandemic warrants a
sweeping, broad package and urging Republicans to consider more than
doubling their $1 trillion proposal.

“There’s a deal to do if the Democrats are reasonable and want to
compromise,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “If their attitude is we’d rather give

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told reporters
on Monday that progress was incumbent on administration officials
deciding “to change and meet us in the middle” and “not say it’s their
way or no way.”

“The Democratic position is that we want to devote enough resources to
defeat the virus and see the American people through this crisis,” Mr.
Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor.

Republicans, who face stark divisions within their own conference over
the scope of another relief package, accused Democrats of prioritizing
longstanding political goals over reaching a compromise for aid.

“They think they have political leverage over the president of the
United States, and so they’re willing to personally increase the pain
for vulnerable families unless they get their way on matters not related
to Covid-19,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader,
said on the Senate floor Monday afternoon. “Democrats said, ‘Our way or
the highway.’”

[Unemployment remains stubbornly
high](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/business/economy/unemployment-claims.html),
even after states lifted restrictions and allowed stores, restaurants
and other industries to reopen. The government reported last week that
nearly 1.2 million workers had filed new claims for state unemployment
benefits, the lowest weekly total since March, but still high by
historical standards. Economists estimate that about 30 million people
are still collecting unemployment.

Even before Mr. Trump’s actions on Saturday, several state and local
governments, reeling from lost tax revenue as a result of the
pandemic-induced economic collapse, were already lobbying Congress to
allocate billions more in relief. A $2.2 trillion
[stimulus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/13/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus.html)
law approved in March set aside a $150 billion pot of money for state
and local governments, but the funds came with cumbersome restrictions
and prevented municipalities with less than 500,000 people from directly
receiving relief.

State tax revenue was down more than 20 percent in May from a year
earlier, according to [data from 46
states](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2020/07/01/monthlystrh_may2020.pdf)
compiled by Lucy Dadayan, a researcher at the Urban Institute. She
estimated revenues could fall by $200 billion in the 2020 and 2021
fiscal years. State and local governments have already cut more than 1
million jobs during the crisis, and many economists fear more layoffs if
the federal government does not provide billions in aid.

In the $3.4 trillion legislation that House Democrats approved in May,
lawmakers allocated close to $1 trillion for state, local and tribal
governments, and top Democrats have continued to hold firm in their
insistence that those governments need substantial relief. Some
lawmakers have coalesced around a bipartisan proposal that would provide
$500 billion in new relief, in addition to loosening flexibility on how
the previously allocated money is spent.

But Republicans, arguing that much of that money had not yet been spent,
did not include any new aid for states in their own $1 trillion
proposal, with some local governments reporting a delay in getting
relief from their state governments. The Treasury Department’s inspector
general’s office reported in late July that states had spent only about
one-quarter of the aid provided, but some state officials and experts
said the report did not account for money that was already earmarked for
spending.

Mr. Trump, who has largely sidelined himself during talks on Capitol
Hill, asserted that Democrats were ready to make a deal and touted a
rise in the stock market on Monday. He also called for cutting capital
gains taxes and more unspecified tax cuts for the middle class.
