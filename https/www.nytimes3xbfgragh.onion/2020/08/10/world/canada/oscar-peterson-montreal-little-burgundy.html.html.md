# Should Montreal Subway Honor Polarizing Priest or Jazz Genius?

</div>

A fight to rename a metro stop pits those who want to celebrate a
revered Black musician against those who want to retain the name of a
priest who espoused equal rights for Francophone Quebecers — and also
anti-Semitism.

MONTREAL — Steps away from Montreal’s historically Black neighborhood of
Little Burgundy, the handsome gray-stone house where the Canadian jazz
virtuoso Oscar Peterson grew up sits conspicuously empty.

There is no city plaque on the house designating it a landmark, nor any
street named after Mr. Peterson, a dazzling, finger-flying pianist and
20th-century musical giant whom Duke Ellington called [“the maharajah of
the
keyboard](https://www.amazon.ae/Oscar-Peterson-Maharaja-Keyboard-Biography/dp/1599860481).”

But Naveed Hussain, a 36-year-old nurse, thinks something more should be
done to honor the musician — while removing what he views as an
anachronistic blight, close by the musician’s childhood home.

Inspired by a global reckoning in support of Black rights, he
[wants](https://www.change.org/p/ville-de-montr%C3%A9al-change-lionel-groulx-metro-station-and-rename-it-oscar-peterson-metro-station?recruiter=20620186&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&utm_term=signature_receipt&recruited_by_id=5f8fd560-f07c-012f-fc7c-4040aa777426&utm_content=fht-22876605-en-ca%3Av12)
to rename the Lionel-Groulx subway station, which memorializes [a
polarizing Roman Catholic
priest](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lionel-adolphe-groulx)
and historian who championed the rights of Francophone Quebecers in
English-dominated Canada, but who also [espoused virulent anti-Semitism
and fascist
sympathies](http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/docs/jews/Anti-SemitismandQuebecNationalists.html).

“The metros and monuments in this city are irrelevant to our current
times and glorify imperialists and conquerors and, in the case of Lionel
Groulx, someone who suggested certain immigrants didn’t have a place in
Quebec society,” Mr. Hussain said. “Oscar Peterson is a symbol of
unity.”

Mr. Hussain, who lived for a time in Little Burgundy, said he was
fighting for nothing less than the soul of the city, eager for the
subway station to reflect the contributions of Canadians of color.

But his push has given rise to a backlash and a counterpetition by those
who contend that Mr. Groulx deserves his place in the city’s pantheon.

Especially for some older, French-speaking residents, Mr. Groulx is a
towering figure of the first half of the 20th century whose insistence
on equality for Francophone Quebecers deserves to be remembered.

“Leave the metro alone — it is a thank you for what this man gave to
Quebec,” said Annie Roux, 60, a life coach and astrologer who has lived
next door to the station for several years.

The naming skirmish has become an emblem of a long-simmering cultural
battle over the toponymy of a city that was colonized by both France and
Britain, where street names honoring 19th-century British monarchs sit
alongside grand boulevards renamed after 20th-century Québécois
nationalists.

Mr. Hussain said it was a fitting tribute to Montreal’s multiculturalism
that someone like him, a Canadian-Muslim with Pakistani roots, was
challenging the celebration of a man with anti-Semitic views in order to
honor [a Black jazz
great](https://www.banffcentre.ca/oscar-peterson-canadian-jazz-legend)

Awards](https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/oscar-peterson/13621)

Mr. Hussain’s petition to rename the subway station (which hyphenates
Mr. Groulx’s first and last name) has received nearly 25,000 signatures
— although some commentators on the counterpetition criticized a
“witch hunt” against major figures of the past.

His campaign had also pitted modernizers against conservationists and
scholars who argue that the names of subways, streets and statues should
be preserved as historical records.

Cities across the world, from [Bristol,

honoring historical figures who advocated slavery or held racist views.

On a recent day in Little Burgundy, once known as “The Harlem of The
North,” local residents lamented that the social history of Black
Quebecers was noticeably absent or underplayed in Quebec’s history
books, popular culture and urban spaces, and overshadowed by the
struggle of white, French-speaking Quebecers for their own rights.

“If you are brown or Black in Quebec, you are seen as the Other,” said
Charlene Hunte, head of outreach at [the Union United
Church](http://www.unionunitedchurchmtl.ca/), which Mr. Peterson
attended. Montreal, she observed, didn’t have a single subway station
named after women or ethnic minorities. “Black history is being erased,”
she
said.

In Quebec, a majority Francophone province, Mr. Hussain’s attempt to
rebrand the popular transport hub has intensified enduring debates over
language, memory and the legacy of colonialism.

Writing in Le Devoir, a leading Montreal-based newspaper, [Luc-Normand
Tellier](https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/tellier.luc-n/)**,** an
emeritus professor of urban studies at [Université du Québec à
Montréal](https://uqam.ca/), argued that Lionel-Groulx station should
keep its name because of the pivotal role its namesake played in shaping
the French identity of Quebec.

He suggested renaming the city’s McGill subway station after Mr.
Peterson, since [James
McGill,](https://www.mcgill.ca/about/history/meet-james-mcgill) an
18th-century Scottish businessman whose name adorns McGill University,
owned six Black slaves. “Such a gesture would, at once, underline how
slavery was intolerable while honoring the contribution of Blacks to
Montreal society,” he wrote.

For others, like [Eric
Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc0tDCt5JbY), who made a
documentary film about anti-Semitism in Quebec, the support to keep the
station’s name reflected an unwillingness to acknowledge “pro-fascist
sympathies” in Quebec in the 1930s through the postwar period.

Experts agree that Mr. Groulx was a divisive figure who had expressed
anti-Semitic views. But those views, they say, weren’t his central
preoccupation and needed to be examined within the context of the
prevailing social mores of his times.

Youssef Amane, a spokesman for Montreal’s mayor, Valérie Plante, said
there was a moratorium on renaming subway stations. He noted, however,
that Mr. Peterson had been honored with a park in Little Burgundy as
well as a mural.

“There is more to be done to honor the contributions of the Black
community,” Mr. Amane added.

In the late 19th century, Black migrants from across Canada, the United
States and the Caribbean came to Little Burgundy to work.

During Prohibition in the United States, the area became a center for
jazz, with boogie-woogie rhythms and booze both flowing freely.

Today, blocky social housing is being gradually supplanted by upmarket
restaurants, designer condominiums and other signs of gentrification.
The Negro Community Center, the heart of the community since 1927, was
demolished a few years ago and is now an empty
lot.

[Oliver Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2gqbO8_i0), 86, a
celebrated Canadian jazz pianist from Little Burgundy, who was mentored
by Mr. Peterson and went on to play Carnegie Hall, said renaming the
station after his old friend would help cement the neighborhood’s
legacy.

“Wherever I have traveled, whether in Puerto Rico or China or Australia,
everyone knows the name Oscar Peterson,” he said.

He said Mr. Peterson, the son of a West Indian immigrant who worked as a
sleeping car railway porter, was deeply shaped by Little Burgundy.
During the height of its popularity from 1930 to 1950, people across the
racial divide flocked to the famous Black-owned [Rockhead’s Paradise
jazz
club](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rockheads-paradise)
to hear him and other jazz greats like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald
and Louis Armstrong play.

“It was the best show in town,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Peterson has received many accolades, including being honored with a
Canadian postage stamp. But if there was any reluctance to rename a
station after him in Montreal, Mr. Jones said, it was probably because
he was an Anglophone and had moved to Ontario.

“Maybe they just picked the wrong station since Lionel Groulx is a hero
for French Canadians,” he said.

[Myrna Lashley](https://www.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/faculty/myrnalashley), an
expert on race relations and assistant professor at McGill University,
supports renaming the station after Oscar Peterson. But she argued that
cities struggling with what to do with statues and other memorials that
can’t be renamed should install explanatory plaques to educate the
public about past wrongs.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We can’t start tearing everything down or we will have nothing left,”
she said.

As for Mr. Hussain, he’s not backing down.

“Imagine if we were talking about Celine Dion, the city would be tearing
up an entire street to honor her,” he said. “The same should happen for
Oscar Peterson.”
