When Vladimir Putin announced Tuesday that Russia had approved a
coronavirus vaccine — with no evidence from large-scale clinical trials
— vaccine experts were worried.

“I think it’s really scary. It’s really risky,” said Daniel Salmon, the
director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins
University.

Dr. Salmon and other experts said that Russia is taking a dangerous step
by jumping ahead of so-called Phase 3 trials, which can determine that
the vaccine works better than a placebo and doesn’t cause harm to some
people who get it.

Unlike experimental drugs given to the sick, vaccines are intended to be
given to masses of healthy people. So they must clear a high bar of
safety standards. If hundreds of millions of people get a vaccine, even
a rare side effect could crop up in thousands of people.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over the course of the past century, researchers have developed
increasingly powerful ways to test vaccines for safety and
effectiveness. Some of those lessons were learned the hard way, when a
new vaccine caused some harm. But [vaccines are now among the safest
medical products in the
world](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/18/health/you-should-get-vaccinated.html)
thanks to the intense rigor of the clinical trials tracking their safety
and effectiveness.

This testing typically begins before a single person has received a new
vaccine, when researchers inject it into mice or monkeys to see how they
respond.

If those animal studies turn out well, researchers then enlist a few
dozen volunteers for a Phase 1 trial, in which all volunteers get the
experimental vaccine.

Doctors typically keep these volunteers under observation to make sure
they don’t have any immediate negative reactions, and to see whether
they make antibodies against a pathogen. It’s not uncommon for people to
feel achiness in their muscles or even a mild fever, but these mild
symptoms typically don’t last long.

If Phase 1 trials do not turn up serious safety problems, then
researchers usually move to a Phase 2 trial, in which they inject
hundreds of people and make more detailed observations.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The first clinical trials on coronavirus vaccines started in March, and
[now there are 29
underway](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html),
with more to launch soon. Companies such as AstraZeneca, Moderna,
Novavax and Pfizer are beginning to share optimistic early results: So
far, they have only detected mild or moderate symptoms and no severe
side effects. Volunteers have also produced antibodies to the
coronavirus, in some cases more than are produced by people who have
recovered from an infection.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But no matter how promising these early results, Phase 3 trials can
fail.

The timing of Russia’s announcement makes it “very unlikely that they
have sufficient data about the efficacy of the product,” said Natalie
Dean, a biostatistician and infectious disease expert at the University
of Florida who has [warned against rushing the vaccine-approval
process](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-vaccine-efficacy-trials.html).
Dr. Dean noted that even vaccines that have produced promising data from
early trials in humans have [flopped at later
stages](https://www.fda.gov/media/102332/download).

In a large, randomized control trial, researchers give the vaccine or a
placebo to tens of thousands of people, and wait for them to encounter
the virus in the real
world.

“Then you wait to see, do they get sick or not. Do they die or not?”
said Dr. Steven Black, a vaccine expert with the Task Force for Global
Health. If a vaccine is effective, fewer vaccinated volunteers will get
sick than the ones who received the placebo.

The Russian researchers have not yet begun that crucial test.

In June, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and
Microbiology at the Health Ministry of the Russian Federation
[registered](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04437875?term=Gamaleya&draw=2&rank=2)
a combined Phase 1 and 2 trial on a vaccine called Gam-COVID-Vac Lyo.
The researchers planned to test it on 38 volunteers.

They said that the vaccine was made from an adenovirus — a harmless cold
virus — carrying a coronavirus gene, similar to what AstraZeneca and
Johnson & Johnson are using in their vaccines. The technology is still
relatively new: The first adenovirus vaccine for any disease was
approved for Ebola in June.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since then, Russian officials have claimed that they would be moving the
vaccine quickly into manufacturing. Mr. Putin’s announcement on Tuesday
made it official. Yet the institute has never published its Phase 1 and
2 trial data.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

At Mr. Putin’s announcement, Russia’s Minister of Health, Mikhail
Murashko, [declared](https://www.interfax.ru/russia/721241) that “all
the volunteers developed high titers of antibodies to COVID-19. At the
same time, none of them had serious complications of immunization.”

That is the sort of result you’d expect from a Phase 1 trial. It doesn’t
tell you if the vaccine actually works.

“This is all beyond stupid,” said John Moore, a virologist at Weill
Cornell Medical College in New York City. “Putin doesn’t have a vaccine,
he’s just making a political
statement.”

On Tuesday, the Russian institute put up a
[website](https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-vaccine/clinical-trials/)
claiming that a Phase 3 trial would begin the next day involving more
than 2,000 people in Russia as well as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi
Arabia, Brazil and Mexico.

All other Phase 3 trials of coronavirus vaccines currently underway are
more than ten times larger than that, with 30,000 volunteers apiece.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Nicole Lurie, a former assistant secretary for preparedness and
response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and
currently an adviser at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations, said the lesson that the U.S. government should draw from
Mr. Putin’s announcement is clear.

“This is exactly the situation that Americans expect our government to
avoid,” she said.

## A faster process

Along with determining whether the vaccine protects people, Phase 3
trials can reveal uncommon side effects that may not have shown up in
the comparatively small number of volunteers who enrolled in the earlier
phases.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

Just because someone gets sick or dies after getting a vaccine, however,
doesn’t necessarily show that the vaccine was the culprit. By comparing
large groups of people who received the vaccine versus the placebo,
researchers can identify unusual clusters of cases in the vaccinated
participants.

Along the way, vaccine developers share these results in reports to
government regulators and in peer-reviewed papers for scientific
journals. Outside experts then evaluate the data from Phase 3 trials and
give their recommendation to the F.D.A., which then decides whether to
approve a vaccine for widespread use.

“It’s not enough for me to say I have a great product,” said Dr. Salmon.
“Before you use it, you need other people to really look at the data and
be convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks.”

And even after a vaccine is licensed, researchers still keep an eye on
it to make sure it’s safe. As millions of people get a vaccine, even
rarer side effects may emerge over time. It’s also possible that certain
groups of people, such as children or the elderly, turn out to face
risks from a vaccine that weren’t immediately clear from the Phase 3
trials.

Regulators can then make adjustments to the vaccine — changing the dose,
for example — to make it safer.

In July, a team of researchers at Tel Aviv University reviewed licensed
vaccines in the United States over the past 20 years and
[concluded](https://doi.org/10.7326/M20-2726) they were “safe, with no
important post-approval safety
issues.”

Putting in safeguards slows the development of vaccines. In recent
years, new outbreaks such as Ebola, SARS and pandemic flu strains have
spurred vaccine makers to look for ways to speed the process without
sacrificing safety.

Now, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, they’re putting those ideas
into practice.

One way to safely accelerate vaccine trials is for regulators to prepare
in advance to analyze each batch of data, so that they can cut down the
time between trials. Vaccine manufacturers have already been
demonstrating to regulators that they can make coronavirus vaccines
safely on an industrial scale, long before the vaccines themselves have
made it through clinical trials.

But researchers are still figuring out how SARS-CoV-2, the name of the
virus that causes Covid-19, makes us sick and evades the immune system.

Adding to the complexity, vaccine makers are testing out just about
every technology they can for a Covid-19 vaccine. Some of the
experimental vaccines are based on old designs, but others have never
been approved for use in humans for any disease.

Dr. Black and his colleagues have been working with CEPI, a nonprofit
organization that is accelerating the development of vaccines, on a new
set of safety procedures for some Covid-19 vaccines, including those
developed by AstraZeneca, CureVac and Novavax.

The researchers have come up with a set of potential medical
complications that vaccine trials should pay particular attention to.
They have addressed the possibility that the vaccine could actually make
people prone to worse cases of Covid-19, for example. Fortunately, the
research so far shows no sign that this is happening.

CEPI is coordinating the sharing of data among vaccine developers. By
pooling the safety data from different vaccine developers, Dr. Black
said, CEPI will be able to detect rare side effects that they might not
have even considered as possible risks.
