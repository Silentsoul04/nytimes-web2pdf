For a century, scientists have known how honeybees drink nectar. They
lap it up.

They don’t lap like cats or dogs, [videos of whose mesmerizing drinking
habits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/science/100000003273592/how-dogs-drink.html)have
been one of the great rewards of high speed video. But they do dip their
hairy tongues rapidly in and out of syrupy nectar to draw it up into
their mouth. For the last century or so, scientists have been convinced
that this is the only way they drink nectar.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scientists have now discovered bees can also suck nectar, which is more
efficient when the sugar content is lower and the nectar is less
viscous. High-speed video of bees drinking a nectar substitute in a lab
shows that not only do honeybees have this unexpected ability, they can
go back and forth from one drinking mode to another.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Jianing Wu, an engineering and biophysics specialist, at Sun Yat-sen
University in Guangzhou, China, and the senior researcher on the
experiment, said that while honeybees excel at feeding on highly
concentrated nectar, “we find that they can also flexibly switch the
feeding strategy from lapping to suction.” He and his colleagues
[reported the results on Wednesday in the journal Biology
Letters.](http://%0A22%0A23%0A24%0A25%0A26%0A27%0A28%0A29%0A30%0A31%0A32%0A33%0A34%0A35%0A36%20feeding%20strategy,%20nectar%20intake%2037%0Ahttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0449)

[David Hu, a professor at the Georgia Institute of
Technology](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/05/science/hu-robotics.html),
who supervised some of Dr. Wu’s earlier research but was not involved in
this experiment, said: “We thought that insects’ mouths were like tools
in your kitchen drawer (straw, fork, spoon), e.g., with single uses.”

“Wu showed that honeybee tongues are like a Swiss army knife, able to
efficiently drink many type of nectar,” Dr. Hu said.

Alejandro Rico-Guevara, who runs the Behavioral Ecophysics Lab at the
University of Washington, Seattle and studies [nectar feeding in
birds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/08/science/the-hummingbirds-tongue-how-it-works.html),
also worked on the project. He said this flexibility in nectar drinking
behavior means that although bees prefer the more syrupy nectars, they
can efficiently feed from flowers whose nectar is more watery. “This has
implications at many different scales, from pollination, for our food,
all the way to the role they have in natural ecosystems,” he said.

What Dr. Rico-Guevara found most interesting was that the bees are so
sensitive to the viscosity of the nectar that “they switch at the exact
point you would expect, to get the best reward for the energy invested.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The honeybee tongue is adapted perfectly to lapping syrupy nectars. Once
the tongue is dipped into thick nectars, Dr. Wu explained,
“approximately 10,000 bristles covering the tongue erect
simultaneously at a certain angle for trapping the nectar.” The bee then
pulls its tongue back into its proboscis, which is really a part of its
mouth, and a pumping mechanism in the head sucks the nectar off the
tongue.

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A slowed-down video shows how the
bee tongue deploys its bristles as it laps up nectar. Video by Wu et
al.</span>](https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/11/08/science/11tb-bees-bristles-image/11tb-bees-bristles-image-superJumbo.png)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the viscosity changes so that the nectar is less thick, the bees
let their tongues stay in the nectar and sucked it up into their mouths,
apparently using the same pumping mechanism.

Dr. Hu said, “The result makes perfect sense because honeybees are
already known as generalists.” They are not limited to feeding on only
one type of flower like some other species of bee.

The bees have been flexible all along. It was the scientists who were
stuck on one idea.
