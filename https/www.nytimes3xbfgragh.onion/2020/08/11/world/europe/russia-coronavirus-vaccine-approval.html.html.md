MOSCOW — Russia has become the first country in the world to approve a
vaccine for the coronavirus, President Vladimir V. Putin announced on
Tuesday, though global health authorities say the vaccine has yet to
complete critical, late-stage clinical trials to determine its safety
and effectiveness.

Mr. Putin, who told [a cabinet meeting on
Tuesday](https://www.interfax.ru/russia/721241) morning that the vaccine
“works effectively enough,” said that his own daughter had taken it. And
in a congratulatory note to the nation, he thanked the scientists who
developed the vaccine for “this first, very important step for our
country, and generally for the whole world.”

The major powers are locked in a global race for a vaccine that
President Trump, Mr. Putin and China’s president, Xi Jinping, are
treating as a proxy war for their personal leadership and competing
national systems. The United States, with an effort called Operation
Warp Speed, and China have poured billions into the pursuit, and health
officials worry that Russia is trying to snatch a victory by cutting
corners.

By skipping large-scale clinical trials, [the Russian dash for a vaccine
has raised widespread
concern](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/health/russia-covid-19-vaccine-safety.html)
that it is circumventing vital steps — [and potentially endangering
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/health/russia-covid-19-vaccine-safety.html)
— in order to score global propaganda points.

Russia’s vaccine sped through early monkey and human trials with
apparent success. But Moscow was cautioned just last week by the World
Health Organization not to stray from the usual methods of testing a
vaccine for safety and efficacy.

Beyond that, the United States, Canadian and British governments have
all accused Russian state hackers of trying to [steal vaccine
research](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/us/politics/vaccine-hacking-russia.html).
Russian officials have denied the accusations, and say their vaccine is
based on a design developed years ago by Russian scientists to counter
the Ebola virus.

A vaccine is seen as the most likely avenue for defeating the novel
coronavirus and alleviating a worldwide health crisis that [has
killed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
at least 734,900 people and decimated national economies. Western
regulators have said repeatedly that they do not expect a vaccine to
become widely available before the end of the year at the earliest.

Around the world, more than 30 vaccines — out of a total of [more
than 165 under
development](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
— are now in various stages of human trials. Currently, eight vaccines
have entered the final phase of mass human testing, including ones
produced by Moderna in the United States, Oxford University and
AstraZeneca in Britain and several Chinese companies.

Some of those Chinese companies have been [accused of cutting corners
themselves](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/china-vaccine-coronavirus.html).
One offered the vaccine to employees at the national oil company, while
another has teamed up with the People’s Liberation Army to conduct human
trials.

In Moscow, the announcement was greeted with a mixture of national pride
and nagging doubts by Russians who have been schooled by experience to
treat such boasts with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Lidiya Ivleva, 70, a retired nurse out for a walk in a Moscow park
Tuesday afternoon, embodied both sentiments. While calling the vaccine
“a great achievement” for Russian scientists, she said she would not
rush to get it herself because of the “hasty” testing.

“Those who fear the pandemic more will take it first, and good for
them,” she said. If in a year or so it is clearly shown to be safe,
she said, then she will reconsider.

Vaccines generally go through three stages of human testing before being
approved for widespread use. The first two phases test the vaccine on
relatively small groups of people to see if it causes harm and
stimulates the immune system. The last phase, known as Phase 3, compares
the vaccine to a placebo in tens of thousands of people.

The Russian scientific body that developed the vaccine, the Gamaleya
Institute, has yet to conduct Phase 3 trials.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

That final phase, however, is the only way to know with statistical
certainty whether a vaccine can prevent an infection, and how effective
it is. And because it tests a much larger group of people, a Phase 3
trial can also detect more subtle adverse effects of a vaccine that
earlier trials could not.

The Russian vaccine uses two strains of adenovirus that typically cause
mild colds in humans. Scientists genetically modified them to cause
infected cells to make proteins from the spike of the new coronavirus,
officials have said.

The approach is similar to the one used in a vaccine developed by Oxford
University and AstraZeneca that is [now undergoing Phase III
tests](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-what-we-know-about-the-demographic-makeup-of-the-covid-19-vaccine-trials)
in Britain, Brazil and South Africa.

The W.H.O. is in close contact with the Russian authorities and
discussing proper procedures, Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the
organization, told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday. But he emphasized
that obtaining the organization’s seal of approval would require
“rigorous review of safety and efficacy data” derived from clinical
trials.

The Russian Ministry of Health did not respond to detailed written
questions sent last week about human trials and research into
potentially harmful side
effects.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?

The Gamaleya Institute developed the Russian vaccine using a human cell
line first cultured in 1973 — the same line used in the
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Like a number of other cell lines used in
medical research and vaccine manufacturing, it began with cells taken
from an aborted fetus, [raising
objections](https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Canada-COVID-19%20Vaccine%20letter%20May%2021st%202020_updated%20%28002%29.pdf)from
abortion opponents that may come into sharper focus if the vaccine is
used widely.

Russia’s announcement of a potential vaccine well ahead of the Western
timeline of the end of the year could provide a welcome respite for Mr.
Putin from a string of bad news.

Over the past year he has seen a steady decline in his approval ratings,
which had soared to more than 80 percent after the annexation of Crimea
in 2014. Now, with Russian troops bogged down in Syria and Libya,
foreign adventures have lost their appeal for most Russians.

Mr. Putin has also stumbled in domestic affairs. He was
[uncharacteristically
passive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/world/europe/russia-putin-coronavirus.html)
in the spring as Russia erupted into one of the world’s hot spots for
the coronavirus pandemic. And he has had no answers for the economic
malaise enveloping the country, as the pandemic has flattened prices for
oil and other natural resources that are the main engine of the Russian
economy.

Russia has already used the vaccine race as a propaganda tool, even in
the absence of published scientific evidence to support its claims as
the front-runner. The vaccine, for example, was branded [Sputnik
V](https://sputnikvaccine.com/), recalling the Soviet Union’s launch of
a first satellite, beating the United States.

For the last several months, state television has promoted the idea that
Russia is leading the competition. In May, it reported that the first
person in the world to be vaccinated against the virus was a Russian
researcher who had injected himself even before monkey trials had been
completed.

Russia also tested the vaccine on soldiers, raising concerns about
consent, though the Ministry of Defense said that all the soldiers had
volunteered.

Kirill Dmitriev, the head of a government-controlled fund that invested
in the vaccine, denied in a conference call with journalists on Tuesday
that Russia had cut corners on testing, or that it had stolen
intellectual property to get ahead.

Mr. Dmitriev said Russia relied on a formidable legacy of research into
viruses and vaccines in the Soviet Union, and had focused on established
technologies, like the approach already used for the Ebola vaccine.

He contrasted that history with the Trump administration’s Operation
Warp Speed program, which is financing research by Pfizer and Moderna
for a genetic vaccine and supporting a variety of other [experimental
technologies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/09/business/coronavirus-vaccine-inovio.html?action=click&module=News&pgtype=Homepage).
The Russian vaccine, he said, is “more proven, on a larger number of
people, than any of the new technologies that people are trying.”

On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced a $1.5 billion agreement
with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of its
coronavirus vaccine, which entered a late-stage, Phase 3 clinical trial
last month, [the first to that
mark](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html)
in the United States.

If successful, the vaccine could become a geopolitical boon for Russia,
recalling the Soviet Union’s mass exports of cheap vaccines to the
developing world during the Cold War. Russia has already received orders
for 1 billion doses from 20 countries and plans to manufacture the
vaccine in Brazil, India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Cuba, according
to the Gamaleya Institute.

If Russian scientists have taken an unorthodox route to the coronavirus
vaccine, it would not be the first time. Back in the 1950s, a team of
researchers [tested a promising, and ultimately successful, polio
vaccine on their own
children](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/world/europe/vaccine-repurposing-polio-coronavirus.html).
