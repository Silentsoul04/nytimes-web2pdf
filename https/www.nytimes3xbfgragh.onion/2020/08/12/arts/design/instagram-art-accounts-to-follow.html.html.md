It’s August; an attempt at a fall culture season beckons, somehow, but a
sense of great fragmentation persists. On Instagram I see artists and
culture workers in Europe behaving more or less normally for the season
— that is to say, on vacation. Elsewhere, new horrors have taken over
— as in Beirut, where in the wake of a cataclysmic warehouse
explosion, artists are sifting through the rubble of devastated
gathering spaces and galleries.

And then there’s the United States, where symptoms of collapse are all
over the culture, and maybe also, hopefully, some signs that we can
build a society with more mutual care once we emerge. It’s hard to avoid
[doomscrolling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/technology/coronavirus-doomscrolling.html).
Yet amid the algorithm’s torrential spew, beauty still insists on
breaking out — in images and insights that honor our communities as we
all try to push through, and ones that remind us of other places and
possibilities.

The Los Angeles photographer [Kwasi
Boyd-Bouldin](http://www.kwasiboydbouldin.com/) interprets his city
through the broad streetscapes and utilitarian low-rise architecture in
which the working-class and immigrant people who keep the place
functioning proceed through the day. It’s a local’s look, keen to the
poetry of auto-body shops and money-transfer agencies, to signs that
hang askew and beat-up vehicles and always the sharp, unyielding
sunlight. Before the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Boyd-Bouldin was not
photographing people directly as much as seeking their traces, like an
archaeologist, in his stark cityscapes. But on the second account he has
put up this year, @thepublicwork, you’ll see people — his kind of
Angelenos, those just getting by — as they navigate their ordinary
chores in this terrain. These “snapshots from the lost world,” as he
calls them in one brief essay, are reminders of community. “Our casual
interactions with one another were a reflection of the human condition
in its purest form,” he
[writes](http://thepublicwork.com/2020/07/recent-nostalgia/). “It’s one
of the most valuable aspects of daily life taken from us by this
pandemic.”

Some 40 artists in multiple mediums make up the [Art
Collective](https://communityaccessart.org/) at Community Access, an
organization in New York that provides housing and support services for
people living with mental health conditions. Some are highly trained
working artists with decades of material; others have found in the
studio a fresh, vital outlet. The work can be stunning, like a recent
[collage by Zeus Hope](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCZJVdJFdM1/)
incorporating vintage newspaper with a jazz solo’s serrated energy, or
the paintings of John Smith themed on the New York City subway. The
pandemic has meant restrictions on studio work for a group that, in the
last year, has been increasingly visible with exhibitions, both physical
and online; fortunately, its Instagram feed continues to share not only
the art (and links to an online gallery for pieces that are for sale)
but also glimpses of this dynamic crew’s productive life and rich
individual stories.

When Zarina Muhammad and Gabrielle de la Puente started [The White
Pube](https://www.thewhitepube.co.uk/), their caustic but dead-serious
criticism platform, they were students at Central Saint Martins, the art
school in London, who had come face to face with the art world’s
political and institutional biases. Five years later, the duo, based in
Liverpool and London, have grown a big following without sacrificing
their rollicking, text-messagey style, nor their rigor and curiosity.
This is accountability work, often lambasting major British museums and
celebrity artists, but fundamentally constructive, with care for
community arts organizations and underrepresented voices. The pair, and
occasional co-conspirators, have a rich archive of criticism on their
website, but their Instagram feed is a great point of contact. Britain
is their main arena, but their perspective travels nicely.

Based in Casablanca, Morocco, the bimonthly
[Diptyk](https://www.diptykmag.com/) is a rare bird in today’s media
landscape: a high-quality art magazine from the global South that has
managed to go the distance since it began in 2009. The perspective is
both Moroccan and cosmopolitan, covering artists and events across
Africa and the Mediterranean basin. What I appreciate about regional
publications like this one is the way they reorient my perspective,
shifting the center away from the usual hubs of global art and finance.
Diptyk is published in French, and you won’t find it on American
newsstands, but its Instagram feed is a rich resource for art discovery,
elegantly selected with lots of links to explore.

The [Zeitz MOCAA](https://zeitzmocaa.museum/), in Cape Town, opened in
2017 in a spectacular converted granary, with the aim to become Africa’s
top contemporary-art venue. After wobbly beginnings, a leadership
overhaul brought in the star Cameroonian curator [Koyo
Kouoh](https://www.instagram.com/madamekoyo/) to run the place, and with
her, sharper programming and fresh energy. The coronavirus has hit South
Africa hard, shutting museums indefinitely, but Zeitz MOCAA has been
busy online, offering digital panels, children’s activities and even
dance parties. And Ms. Kouoh and her team are keeping the intellectual
flame burning with an excellent series of Instagram Live interviews with
fellow curators from across Africa as well as with artists like Wangechi
Mutu, archived on the museum’s
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDJltdsHMhBhgl_y6MMEcyQ/videos)
channel.
