# Charleston Tourism Is Built on Southern Charm. Locals Say It’s Time to Change.

</div>

A powerful visitors’ bureau has pushed the South Carolina city to the
top of “best” lists by selling gentility. Critics say that has come at
the expense of history and the city’s Black population.

The week that George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers,
the Charleston, S.C., Convention & Visitors Bureau introduced a campaign
to assure tourists that despite the coronavirus pandemic, Charleston — a
city that has topped must-go travel lists for years — was ready to
welcome them back.

The program asked hotels and restaurants to take a “White Glove Pledge,”
which would assure guests a high level of commitment to hygiene. The
campaign’s logo was a white-gloved hand holding a tray. The unwitting
reference to the servitude of plantation life came at a moment when
Black Lives Matter protests were beginning to fill streets in cities
across the
nation.

“The white glove pledge could not have been any less well-conceived,”
said[Steve
Palmer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/31/dining/steve-palmer-restaurant-addiction.html),
the managing partner of the Charleston-based Indigo Road Hospitality
Group, which employs about 1,000 people in 20 restaurants and bars in
four Southern states and Washington, D.C.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Days later, the Black Lives Matter protests reached Charleston and
turned violent. Nearly 125 buildings in the core of the city were
damaged.

The next morning, Helen Hill, the chief executive of the Charleston Area
Convention & Visitors Bureau, who has been marketing the city for more
than 30 years, sent an email to the bureau’s members, praising people
who emerged the next morning to clean up.

“They are sweeping and not weeping\!” she wrote, without acknowledging
the pain that had spurred the protests. “Please remind your staff who
handles social media to post only uplifting and positive content.
Remember our audience is bigger than local\!”

To many who make their living from the 7.4 million people who visit the
Charleston region every year, Ms. Hill’s response seemed tone deaf at
best and, at worst, laid bare what has for years been simmering just
below the surface of the city’s genteel antebellum image: the delicate
balance between the narrative promoted by the powerful visitors’ bureau
and the city’s history as the capital of the North American slave trade.
That balance could no longer hold.

The tension between the two story lines is not new. In recent years, the
mostly white leadership of the city and the tourism industry have worked
to highlight the region’s African-American heritage. The visitors’
bureau added a deeply reported section on Charleston’s African-American
history to its website. And after more than two decades of planning and
fund-raising, the city in 2022 will open the [International
African-American
Museum](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/28/arts/charleston-international-african-american-museum.html)on
Gadsden’s Wharf, which had been the first stop for as many as 100,000
Africans — an estimated 40 percent of the people captured and brought to
America to be sold into slavery.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But as cultural institutions across the country take a more cleareyed
look at interpreting history in the wake of the Black Lives Matter
movement, the push to change how Charleston tells its own story has
taken on a new urgency.

The bureau, with an annual budget of $18 million and the ability to help
direct [$8 billion in tourism
dollars](https://www.postandcourier.com/business/visitors-to-charleston-broke-records-again-exceeding-7-2-million-last-year/article_7e0c7d14-57b0-11e9-a912-671dd61d9f4a.html)to
specific businesses, is being asked to do more to tell a more realistic
tale and to support Black-owned business, many of which have been priced
out of the city as its tourism industry has grown.

“There has been a deliberate effort by very powerful industries and
organizations to sanitize and whitewash Charleston and show a ‘safe’ and
white and palatable Charleston,” said Mika Gadsden, founder of the
[Charleston Activist
Network](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/CharlestonActivistNetwork/),
a media platform that focuses on Black and Gullah experiences.

She has become one of the most vocal critics of the C.V.B., as the
visitors' bureau is known, saying that its attempt to soften the city’s
history of enslavement with a big serving of genteel Southern charm has
worn thin, particularly during a painful moment for many of the people
who keep the tourism industry moving in Charleston.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Hill, who has worked for the C.V.B. for almost 34 years and has seen
the city become a popular tourist destination, said that her cheery
email after the protests was not unlike what she sends out after a
hurricane. The idea was to show the can-do spirit of the city in the
face of disaster. It was misconstrued to make it seem like she and the
C.V.B. don’t care about racial justice, she said.

The agency has been working to leave the “magnolias and moonlight”
Charleston narrative behind for 15 years, Ms. Hill said. The effort
became more urgent after nine Black people [were
murdered](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/18/us/church-attacked-in-charleston-south-carolina.html)
by a white supremacist at Mother Emanuel AME Church five years ago.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The agency worked to promote and educate tourists about the city’s
history of slavery, so much so that it has been criticized for
capitalizing on Black people’s pain, she said. Finding the right balance
is challenging, with criticism coming from people who think it isn’t
focusing enough on the Black experience and those who think it’s
overcorrecting, she said.

Still, she said, the C.V.B. can do more.

“We’ve learned through this period of time that we have to do a better
job of getting the story out to the people that are in Charleston about
what we are doing,” Ms. Hill said. “We realize we’ve got to let our
locals know what we’re doing, especially, especially around this issue.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.V.B. has previously been called out for having few Black members,
a criticism Ms. Hill has responded to by saying that the agency has 31
Black-owned businesses as members out of more than 800.

The agency’s budget comes from three sources: Charleston’s share of a
state accommodations tax, a state grant that matches industry
contributions and contributions from businesses, which pay $700 a year
to be part of the C.V.B. For the past two years, Black business owners
have been allowed to join for $300.

Kwadjo Campbell, president of JC & Associates, a firm that works on
development for African-Americans in Charleston, and K.J. Kearney, the
founder of [Black Food Fridays,](https://www.blackfoodfridays.com/) an
online campaign that encourages people to patronize Black-owned
restaurants on Fridays, said that the C.V.B. hasn’t done enough to
connect with Black Charlestonians.

“We haven’t seen a change in dollars going to Black businesses,” Mr.
Campbell said. “We haven’t seen dollars come through from the C.V.B. The
way this will work is if there are real partnerships and conversations.
Helen’s got to listen to Black people in this sector. She has got to
share the wealth.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Being part of the C.V.B. helps businesses connect more with large tour
groups. Members are promoted on the [Explore Charleston
website](https://www.charlestoncvb.com/) and in social media channels.
When tourists inquire about things to do in the city or where to eat,
they are directed to C.V.B. members. The C.V.B. spends a third of its
budget advertising in magazines like Condé Nast Traveler, which has
named Charleston as its No. 1 destination in the United States for nine
consecutive years.

“The C.V.B. has such power and influence and not just locally,” said
Allyson Sutton, a co-owner of Sightsee Shop, a store and coffee bar in
the Elliotborough neighborhood in downtown Charleston. She and her
husband, who are both white, [recently
resigned](https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/why-our-business-resigned-from-the-charleston-visitors-bureau/Content?oid=31714396)from
the C.V.B. in protest.

“For this organization to have a $20 million operating budget, a huge
social media following and a website they invest a lot of money into,
and for the bulk of that content to whitewash history, not promote the
incredible Black culture we have now and to not at the very least use
its platforms to say ‘Black Lives Matter’ is incredibly disappointing,”
Ms. Sutton
said.

## Plantations and tours

One point of frustration is the agency’s [promotion of plantation
weddings](https://www.charlestonweddingguide.com/weddingplanner/venues~153/plantations-parks~772/)
on its website, where people can take a quiz that matches them with a
venue.

Getting married on the grounds of a plantation has long been sold as a
romantic experience. But critics say that celebrating on plantation
grounds where Black people were tortured, killed and, in many cases,
buried, dishonors their history.

Olivia Williams is a historical interpreter at [McLeod
Plantation,](https://www.ccprc.com/1447/McLeod-Plantation-Historic-Site)
whose tours focus on the quarters where enslaved people lived rather
than the grand home that belonged to the white family. Ms. Williams’s
tours focus specifically on enslaved women.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m able to make connections between the history of these women and
treatment of Black women and how that treatment hasn’t changed,
especially in the wake of Breonna Taylor and the treatment of Black
trans women that we hear about,” she said.

She said both the C.V.B. and other historic sites could take a cue from
McLeod and tell the stories of the enslaved more accurately, making
Black experiences more central.

“The narrative many plantations have been telling, that the city has
been telling, is a simple one,” she said. “It’s not easy transitioning
from this one narrative that seems to have worked in bringing people
here to a difficult one, but it has to happen.”

McLeod stopped allowing people to book weddings on its property in 2019
(weddings that were already scheduled for future dates will still take
place). In December, the Knot Worldwide, one of the biggest [online
wedding-planning
platforms](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/elisabethdonnelly/zola-the-knot-weddings-millennials)
in the United States, and Pinterest, the image sharing site, said they
would no longer promote images that romanticize plantations.

Ms. Hill said that many plantations tell the story of slavery well and
shouldn’t be excluded from the C.V.B. site.

“There’s this whole thought that somehow you shouldn’t have celebratory
things happening at this beautiful outdoor venue,” she said. “We just
feel really strongly that we want to support our attractions because
they have worked so hard, and if they decide that they want to use their
special facility for weddings, we’re going to support them.”

Stephanie Burt, a travel writer and host of [The Southern Fork
podcast,](https://www.thesouthernfork.com/) has been one of a growing
chorus of people lobbying for changes at the visitors’ bureau. In its
drive to market Charleston, the agency has smothered the city’s history,
she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The focus is tourism at any cost and it doesn’t matter if we are
drowning in Covid or are telling the wrong story about slavery,” she
said. “The tourism industry is decimating African-American communities
and flattening nuance and
narrative.”

Indeed, the influx of expensive hotels and tourist shops has driven up
the cost of living in Charleston and sent the working class — many of
whom are African-American — to less expensive parts of the region.

Since the 1980s, the racial makeup of Charleston has flipped. Once, two
out of every three residents was Black. Now, the city is about 72
percent white.

“Charleston’s viability has come at the expense of Black folks,” Ms.
Gadsden said.

In recent years, the C.V.B. has been unpopular among locals who believe
that it is pushing for tourism at any cost. There have been
yearslong[battles](https://www.postandcourier.com/news/an-old-debate-over-cruise-ships-churns-as-a-new-ship-calls-charleston-harbor-home/article_013274d2-7674-11e9-b1c8-7b88d7ccc5c7.html)
over allowing large cruise ships to dock in the city, complaints about
constant bachelorette and bachelor parties and pushback against the
opening of new hotels in residential areas.

## Food’s role

Restaurants have played a major part in making Charleston a destination
city. The modern Southern food movement, which blew up the cornpone
national perception of Southern eating popularized by cooks like Paula
Deen, and made stars out of the region’s restaurants, was built in large
part in the kitchens of Charleston restaurants like
[Husk](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/02/09/dining/09notebook.html),

and [Rodney Scott’s

While some in the city’s food community worked to better tell the
narrative of the region’s Gullah Geechee food traditions and support
Black chefs, many restaurant owners paid their dues to the visitors’
bureau and didn’t question how the city was being promoted, Mr. Palmer,
of Indigo Road Hospitality, and others in the industry said.

The latest push for social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement
shifted the tone. The Charleston Wine + Food Festival, which works with
the visitors’ bureau and last year attracted nearly 12,000 travelers and
national television coverage,
[announced](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBgMUP-D_34/) in June it would
no longer host events at plantations. In addition, unless the city
removed from Marion Square a 12-foot-tall bronze statue of John C.
Calhoun, a former U.S. vice president who was one of the 19th century’s
most prominent defenders of slavery, the festival would no longer stage
its events there.

(Pressure had been mounting for the statue’s removal for years, and the
city [took it
down](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/us/charleston-statue-removal-calhoun-trnd/index.html)
on June 24. The food festival organizers recently announced they would
not hold the 2021 festival, usually scheduled for March, citing the
pandemic.)

Festival organizers took criticism from people who thought politics were
outside the event’s purview, and others who [called the move
performative](https://www.postandcourier.com/blog/raskin_around/charleston-wine-food-festival-blasted-by-activists-for-taking-easiest-stance-on-racism/article_cc7bdd44-b017-11ea-9cd1-230f31744846.html)
and argued that the organizers should do a better job in the way they
treat people of color they ask to participate, both as volunteers at the
festival and as guest cooks and winemakers.

Gillian Zettler, the executive director of the festival, said the
nonprofit organization had since last fall been examining issues of
diversity and inclusion, including diving deeper into the history of
venues it selects for the festival, creating a more diverse board and
developing deeper relationships with South Carolina’s Black hospitality
professionals who have been historically underrepresented at the event.

The organization also has pledged to make the festival more accessible
to African Americans and other people of color.

B.J. Dennis, a chef whose ancestors come from a Gullah Geechee community
in Wando, outside Charleston, has worked with the festival to curate
events that more accurately explore the Gullah Geechee food traditions
developed by West Africans who were enslaved along the southeastern
Atlantic coast.

He has long been an advocate for telling a more complete story about
Charleston, and says he [has
watched](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/07/dining/charleston-restaurants.html)
with a heavy heart as many Black-owned restaurants have been priced out
of the core of the city. But he remains skeptical that Charleston is
really ready to tell its truth.

“I think people are more aware and have been put on notice with the
movement,” he said, “but as far as change, people got to want to
change.”

“To get the plantation narrative to move from the ‘Gone With the Wind’
narrative to telling the true story of plantations, which is really the
story of concentration camps, is not going to come easy,” he said. “But
for every two of your blue-blooded faithful customers you may lose by
telling the truth, you may gain 10 to 20 followers who will want to hear
the real story.”
