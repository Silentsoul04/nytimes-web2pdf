<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

*Good morning.*

Well, you know what this is going to be about.

[Senator Kamala Harris of California is Joe Biden’s running
mate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/kamala-harris-vp-biden.html).

She is a barrier-breaking candidate for a lot of reasons — not least
among them: She is the first Black woman and the first Asian-American
woman to be a major party’s vice-presidential nominee. She is also, [as
we mentioned last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/biden-vp-karen-bass-kamala-harris.html),
the first Californian on a major national ticket in a long time — and
the most recent ones have been Republicans, not Democrats.

The announcement has already set off wild speculation about whom [Gov.
Gavin Newsom will
tap](https://calmatters.org/politics/2020/08/kamala-harris-replacement-newsom-california-senate/)
to replace her (more on that in a minute).

What else does this portend for [Californians and
California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/harris-biden-geography-balance.html)
politics? My fellow Los Angeles-based colleagues [Adam
Nagourney](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/adam-nagourney) and
[Jennifer Medina](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/jennifer-medina)
took a minute to weigh in:

**This is a big pick for California, but Mr. Biden winning California
has never been much of a question. How much do you think Ms. Harris’s
status as a Californian will factor into the campaign going forward?**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Adam:** We think that [geography is not a big deal in veep
choices](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/harris-biden-geography-balance.html)
any more. If there was ever any doubt about that, it probably ended with
this selection. She won’t deliver California, because if there’s any
state Biden doesn’t have to worry about, this is it. Gender and race
have trumped (forgive the word\!) geography in these selections. The
last time it mattered was probably John F. Kennedy picking Lyndon Baines
Johnson in 1960.

**Jennifer:** ** California partisans seemed thrilled to have one of
their own on the ticket, perhaps because so many are used to the state
being effectively irrelevant in presidential politics. The Trump
campaign will undoubtedly try to paint her as an extreme liberal from
California, as the president did during a news conference from the White
House Tuesday. But in California, much of the criticism aimed at Ms.
Harris has been from progressives [who say that she is not liberal
enough](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/11/us/kamala-harris-progressive-prosecutor.html).

*\[Read their full story about how* [*geography has taken a back
seat*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/harris-biden-geography-balance.html)
*to other parts of identity.\]*

**What does Ms. Harris’s selection over[Representative Karen
Bass](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/politics/karen-bass-vice-president-biden.html),
in particular, tell you about whom Mr. Biden hopes to appeal to? (Not to
oversimplify, but Ms. Harris has a** **[law enforcement
background](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-policing.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article),
whereas,** **[as you reported in your
profile](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/politics/karen-bass-vice-president-biden.html),
Ms. Bass has deep credentials as a community organizer.)**

**Adam:** Ms. Bass was a higher-risk choice, as became clear as more of
her record came out. She came up as a community activist, and had ties
to the left that Mr. Trump would have seized on.

**Jennifer:** Ms. Harris has been popular among suburban and
college-educated women — her selection shows that the Biden campaign is
focusing on appealing to moderates, rather than the more liberal wing of
the party who pushed for Ms. Bass in the final weeks of the selection
process.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**[As we’ve
reported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/biden-vp-karen-bass-kamala-harris.html),
this is going to set off a major game of musical chairs in California
politics. If you had to bet, who’s going to replace her in the Senate?**

**Adam:** I avoid the prediction business\! But we’re hearing Ms. Bass
for Senate. Here’s a conspiracy theory for you: Mr. Newsom picks Mayor
Eric Garcetti, just to make absolutely sure Mr. Garcetti doesn’t think
of primary-ing him in a few years.

**Jennifer:** ** Also never predict\! But within minutes of the
announcement, I had texts from politicos around the state throwing out
names that included Ms. Bass, Mr. Garcetti, as well as State Senator
Maria Elena Durazo, former Senate majority leader Kevin de Leon and
Attorney General Xavier Becerra (who was appointed by then-Gov. Jerry
Brown after Ms. Harris won her Senate seat). Needless to say, there will
be a lot of jockeying in the coming months.

**If they win, who else do you think will be tapped for positions in the
administration?**

**Jennifer:** See above on predictions\!

**What are your biggest questions going forward about how this will
affect California politics?**

**Jennifer:** One thing I will watch for: Which California leaders spend
time on the (virtual) campaign trail stumping for the Biden-Harris
ticket. That might — might\! — give us a clue to the answers of your
questions about the future too. (And as any California booster will
remind us: California is where America’s future happens first.)

Last night, but also tonight and through Aug. 26, if you go someplace
dark and open, away from city lights and traffic, you may be able to
catch a glimpse of a [Perseid meteor
shower.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/science/perseid-meteor-shower.html?)

During the display’s peak, between 160 and 200 meteors will streak
through Earth’s atmosphere every hour.

There’s something soothing about the idea of gazing into the heavens and
thinking about the rest of the universe.

And California is blessed with lots of beautiful places below a dark
sky, like in Sonoma County, where [The Press Democrat made this
guide](https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/how-to-watch-the-perseid-meteor-shower-2020/).
