It took Mr. Galante decades before he felt comfortable sharing the
horrors he witnessed during the Holocaust. He died of the coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

BUENOS AIRES --- It took David Galante 50 years to speak publicly of the
horrors he witnessed at Auschwitz. But once he did, he made it his
life's calling to make sure people did not forget about the Holocaust,
traveling and speaking about the crimes perpetrated by the Nazis.

The event that changed him was the release of the movie ``Schindler's
List'' in 1994. The realization that people would want to hear his
story, he often said, was his
``\href{https://www.conclusion.com.ar/sin-categoria/sobrevivi-a-auschwitz-para-contar-lo-que-paso-alli-y-evitar-que-se-repita/01/2017/}{true
liberation}.''

``The feeling of having kept quiet for 50 years was also a type of
prison,'' said Martín Hazan, Mr. Galante's godson, who wrote a 2007 book
about Mr. Galante called ``Un Día Más De Vida'' (``One More Day of
Life'').

Mr. Galante died of complications of Covid-19 on July 27 at Hospital
Italiano de Buenos Aires, Mr. Hazan said. He was 96.

David Galante was born on April 7, 1924, on the Greek island of Rhodes,
which was then controlled by Italy. He was one of seven children of
Abraham Galante and Rebecca Israel Benditcha, and grew up in the
island's tight-knit Jewish community. He attended a Jewish school. His
father ran a women's clothing store.

In 1936 his sister Sarah moved to Rhodesia (now part of Zimbabwe and
Zambia) and in 1937 his brother Hizkya moved to Argentina.

When World War II started, Rhodes seemed like an oasis for Mr. Galante,
but food soon became scarce, and his father had to close his store.

Then, in September 1943, Italy surrendered and Germany occupied the
island. Jews were put on ships to Greece and later onto trains for a
12-day ride to Auschwitz.

``We were innocent in every sense of the word because we didn't have a
notion of what was going on in the world,''
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GNGerlidHI}{Mr. Galante said in a
1996 interview with the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires}. ``We started
to see the cruelty of the Nazis.''

Once at Auschwitz, the men and women were separated. Mr. Galante would
never again see his parents and three sisters, Rosa, Juana and Matilde.
He was tattooed with a number, B7328, and then separated from his
brother Moshe, who ended up in another concentration camp,
Bergen-Belsen.

One day a guard kicked Mr. Galante into a fire, causing severe burns.
Knowing that a trip to the infirmary could be synonymous with death, he
kept working. But as the burns became infected he had no choice. His
stay in the infirmary, however, turned out to be a blessing in disguise:
Officers evacuated the camp, forcing anyone who was deemed healthy to
walk in a death march. Thousands died of cold, hunger and illness or
were shot along the way. Mr. Galante, in his hospital bed, had remained
behind.

When Russian soldiers arrived eight days later, on Jan. 27, 1945, and
liberated the camp, he weighed 84 pounds --- 48 pounds less than when he
had arrived. By the time he returned to Rhodes, his home was
unrecognizable. So he went to Rome after learning that his brother Moshe
was alive there. Deciding never to separate again, the two brothers went
to Argentina to be with their brother Hizkya. David first worked at a
textile wholesaler there, then set up a bicycle-parts factory.

He married Raquel Eskenazi in 1957. She was hospitalized with Covid-19
in July; by the time she recovered, she found out that her husband had
died.

In addition to his wife, Mr. Galante is survived by his daughter,
Sandra; his son, Ezequiel; and two grandchildren.

Mr. Galante was often asked why it had taken him so long to share his
story. In part, he said, it had to do with survivor's guilt.

``For many years I felt fear, guilt for having been spared while my
family wasn't, anguish for those tremendous memories,'' he said at a
ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the Holocaust in 1995. ``And I
also felt shame. But I feel a profound need to transmit to future
generations an experience that should never again be repeated.''
