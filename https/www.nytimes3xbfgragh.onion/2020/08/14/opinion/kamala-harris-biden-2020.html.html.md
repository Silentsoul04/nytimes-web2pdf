As a prosecutor she can make you tremble. But as a trailblazer can she

When I saw on Wednesday morning that [Kamala
Harris](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/technology/kamala-harris-disinformation.html)
had released a short video marking and celebrating her selection as Joe
Biden’s running mate, I clicked — eagerly and instantly. I wanted to
continue riding my wave of excitement about all the firsts: first woman
of color on a major party’s presidential ticket, first Black woman
specifically, first Asian-American.

By the time I finished the video, that wave had crashed.

OK, that’s an overstatement. But as I listened to her flat, desultory
recitation of her biography and philosophy, I did feel a sense of
frustration, and it was familiar. I’d wrestled with the same letdown
during the Democratic primary, when the experience of Harris didn’t live
up to the idea of Harris. She often skipped or skimmed over facets of
her background that she would have benefited from dwelling on. She
frequently zoomed past the poetry to the prose, more a steely lawyer
rattling off lists than a soulful leader serving up inspiration.

Harris the prosecutor can find the holes in your argument and make you
tremble. But can Harris the history-making vice-presidential candidate
find the cracks in your heart and make you cry?

That’s certainly not a requirement — most politicians not named Barack
Obama fail to do that — and I’m not complaining per se. As [I wrote when
the news
broke](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/opinion/kamala-harris-biden-running-mate.html),
her presence on the Democratic ticket makes total sense in terms of the
experience that she possesses, the values that she represents and the
contrast that she helps Biden draw between his politics of inclusion and
Donald Trump’s politics of division.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I’m articulating a wish, one that’s tied to my belief that a decent
future for this country hinges on an end to Trump’s presidency and my
concern that Biden and Harris use every arrow in their quivers to defeat
him. I’m venting a worry that Harris doesn’t fully use one of her
arrows. She did poorly in the Democratic primary because, yes, [her
campaign was a
mess](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html).
But she also did poorly because she never discovered the right, stirring
way to tell and sell her story.

I want her to discover it on Wednesday night, when she speaks at the
Democratic National Convention (or however we’re describing its virtual
facsimile). I want her to hold on to it between then and Nov. 3, because
I want to call her the vice president of the United States soon after
that.

Although Trump would cringe at the following thought and never
understand it, Harris reflects this country’s ideals and its reality
much better than he does. “Her story’s America’s story,” Biden said when
he and she first appeared together as running mates on Wednesday
afternoon. He’s right, and I want her to embrace that and flesh it out
at every turn.

She’s the biracial daughter of immigrants: Jamaican father, Indian
mother, both beckoned to this country of newcomers and transplants.
Growing up in California’s Bay Area, [she was
bused](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/30/us/politics/kamala-harris-berkeley-busing.html)
to an elementary school in a richer, whiter neighborhood than her own,
so she knows the fact of segregation and the dream of integration from
the road she traveled.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She understands how families, despite their best intentions, fray. Her
parents divorced, and when her mother found teaching and research work
in Montreal, she moved for her middle and high school years to that
largely white, French-speaking city. For college she went to Howard, a
historically Black university in Washington, D.C., that allowed her to
appraise America — its past, present and future — from a different
vantage point. From there she forged her own path, with her own rules.
She didn’t marry until she was 49. Her husband is white and Jewish and
she’s [a stepmother to his two
children](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a27422434/kamala-harris-stepmom-mothers-day/).

What a rich mix of influences: as multiracial, multiethnic and
multicultural as the country in which her parents wisely invested their
hopes. What a portrait of life as it’s lived, with all sorts of swerves.

In her public remarks she makes references to some of this, but they’re
usually just that — references. After she [mentioned school
busing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-busing.html)
(“that little girl was me”) to attack Biden in a primary debate for his
opposition to it, I went back and looked at [the big
speech](https://www.ktvu.com/news/transcript-kamala-harris-kicks-off-presidential-campaign-in-oakland)
that she’d given to kick off her presidential campaign. Busing was
nowhere to be found. In fact her speech didn’t have all that much
biographical detail, period, at least if you edited out the professional
stuff. It was strikingly impersonal.

I recently read much of her memoir, “The Truths We Hold: An American
Journey,” published shortly before that speech, and came away with the
same impression. She gives you less of her history than you expect, not
more. She steers away from emotion, not toward it.

Maybe that’s what a woman aiming for top jobs in a man’s world has to
do. Maybe that’s even more incumbent on a woman of color. A scintilla
too angry and you’re unhinged. A soupçon too misty and you’re
unraveling.

It’s worth noting that when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
stood in the House last month to [call out the misogynistic
remarks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sexism-congress.html)
of a male colleague, she twice stressed that she was speaking from the
perspective of principle, not of upset. “I want to be clear that
Representative Yoho’s comments were not deeply hurtful or piercing to
me,” she said, adding that she was made of tougher stuff than that. She
later reiterated that she “was not deeply hurt or offended.” To be at
all emotional, she had to establish that she was unemotional.

A male lawmaker wouldn’t have felt that need. John Boehner, the House
speaker from 2011 to 2015, certainly didn’t: He was [famous for
weeping](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/09/25/john-boehner-crying-emotional-speaker-house/72799814/)
at the drop of an amendment. If Nancy Pelosi behaved as soggily, she’d
be savaged.

But in [the book “The
Firsts,”](https://www.workman.com/products/the-firsts) about the women
who entered Congress in record-breaking numbers after the 2018 midterms,
Jennifer Steinhauer of The Times notes that several of those newcomers
did permit themselves to tear up at appropriate times — for example,
when discussing an issue that had greatly affected them or their loved
ones — and it came across as authentic, not weak. Maybe the world is
changing for the better. Or maybe there’s more allowance for women in
House seats than for women in even higher posts.

The Kamala Harris I’ve met and chatted with informally, in person, is
warmer and more winning than the version I’ve watched on the stump. More
transparent. More accessible.

And I saw flashes of her on Wednesday afternoon, during [that appearance
with Biden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymyY7jez0rM), when her huge
smiles suggested that she couldn’t contain her exhilaration. She
shouldn’t try. Her story is genuinely exhilarating.

Storytelling is everything. Trump won the presidency with a story about
America that appealed to many Americans. It mixed imaginary villains
with real ones, lies with truths. But he told it expansively. He told it
effectively.

Obama’s rise was rooted in his own story, in the eloquence with which he
spoke of Kenya and Kansas and how their commingling inside him was the
American dream. I can’t count the number of times, on his path to the
White House, that he put a lump in my throat.

Harris’s story is the rival of Obama’s. She just has to give it a
comparably mythic shimmer. I know “that little girl” was her. But I want
to know more *about* her, and I want to hear her voice.
