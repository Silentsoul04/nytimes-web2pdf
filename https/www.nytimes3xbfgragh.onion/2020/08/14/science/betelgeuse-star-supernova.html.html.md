# This Star Looked Like It Would Explode. Maybe It Just Sneezed

The mysterious dimming of the red supergiant Betelgeuse is the result of
a stellar exhalation, astronomers say.

Apparently a star can sneeze.

That is [what happened to
Betelgeuse](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/01/09/science/betelgeuse-supernova-fading.html),
the red supergiant star that marks the armpit of Orion the Hunter,
according to Andrea Dupree, associate director of the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. She and an international
team of astronomers described that conclusion [in a
paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aba516)
published this week in Astrophysical Journal.

Betelgeuse, one of the brightest and most prominent stars in the winter
sky, began [dramatically and mysteriously
dimming](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/09/science/astronomy-supernova-betelgeuse.html)
in the fall of 2019, dwindling to less than half its normal brightness.
By February 2020, it was the faintest that it had been since
measurements began more than 150 years ago, according to Dr. Dupree.

“The dimming was obvious to everyone when looking at the constellation
Orion,” she said. “It was very weird. Betelgeuse was almost missing,”

Some astronomers and excitable members of the public wondered if the
star was [about to
explode](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/01/09/science/betelgeuse-supernova-fading.html)
as a supernova. Such aging stars are notoriously cranky and moody,
sputtering out bursts of gas and dust as their cores evolve and change.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Something like that was happening to Betelgeuse last year, Dr. Dupree’s
team now reports. Observations in ultraviolet light with the [Hubble
Space
Telescope](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/science/hubble-telescope-30th-birthday.html)
revealed gobs of dense hot gas shooting out through the upper parts of
atmosphere of Betelgeuse at speeds of 200,000 miles an hour, “almost
like a sneeze,” Dr. Dupree said.

At the same time a robot telescope called Stella — [the STELLA Robotic
Observatory](https://www.aip.de/en/research/facilities/stella/), in
Tenerife, Spain — recorded the surface of the star pulsating outward,
helping to propel the hot gas.

The surface of Betelgeuse, like that of the sun, is covered with big
blobs of rising and falling gas, called convection cells, that transmit
energy from the interior. “We suspect that there was a confluence of a
big convective cell on the surface and also the outward radial velocity
that acted together to eject this material,” Dr. Dupree said in an
email.

Radial velocity measurements showed that the surface, or photosphere,
was moving out during 2019. From May to August, Betelgeuse was near the
sun and out of view, she said: “And in September we saw this bright hot
dense material moving out from the southern part of the star.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Once the gas had gone a few million miles from the star, it [cooled into
a dust
cloud](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/14/science/betelgeuse-pictures-supernova.html)
that obscured the southern part of Betelgeuse.

In an email, Edward Guinan of Villanova University, who has been
tracking Betelgeuse, called the new Hubble data “fantastic,” and said
Dr. Dupree’s theory was “a good working hypothesis.” He added: “But I
don’t entirely agree that the ‘Mystery’ is now solved.”

He noted that alternative explanations could explain the dimming: giant
sunspots, perhaps, or gigantic rising convection cells tens of millions
of miles across, radiating away their heat and energy and then cooling,
turning over and sinking again.

Adding to the mystery is that Betelgeuse, after regaining its normal
luminosity this May, has started to dim again. Betelgeuse has long been
known to vary in brightness — although not so extremely as this year —
in accordance with a 420-day cycle of pulsation in its size, so this new
fading is occurring early, for reasons unclear.

That the star will eventually blow up is certain. Betelgeuse, sometimes
pronounced “beetle-juice,” and also known as Alpha Orionis, is at least
10 times and maybe 20 times as massive as the sun. If it were placed in
our solar system, its fiery gases would engulf everything out to
Jupiter’s orbit.

The star is a so-called red supergiant in the last violent stages of its
evolution. It has already spent millions of years burning primordial
hydrogen and transforming it into the next lightest element, helium.
That helium is burning into more massive elements. Once the core of the
star becomes solid iron, sometime within the next 100,000 years, the
star will collapse and then rebound in a supernova explosion, probably
leaving behind a dense nugget called a neutron star.

Whatever Betelgeuse is going to do, it might have already done; we are
just waiting for the news. The star is some 725 light-years away, so the
light visible from Earth today, whether rising or falling, left the star
around the year 1300.

“No one knows how a star behaves in the weeks before it explodes,” Dr.
Dupree said. “And there were some ominous predictions that Betelgeuse
was ready to become a supernova. Chances are, however, that it will not
explode during our lifetime. But who knows?”

Dr. Guinan said: “I am really looking forward to seeing what the star
will do this season. It will be fun to
see.”
