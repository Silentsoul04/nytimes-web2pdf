That didn’t take long. The new trade deal between Canada, the United
States and Mexico was barely a month old when President Trump, during a
tour of a Whirlpool appliance factory, announced that he’d again placed
[tariffs on aluminum from
Canada.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/business/economy/trump-canadian-aluminum-tariffs.html)

Canada, in turn, [will impose retaliatory

month against a wide variety of things made from aluminum in the United
States, although there is no sign the countermeasure will prompt a
retreat by Mr. Trump.

Last week, many Canada Letter readers emailed questions about the
president’s latest move, and several offered scathing opinions about it.

I put some of your questions to [Chad P. Brown, an economist and trade
analyst](https://www.chadpbown.com) at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics in Washington. Our conversation has been edited
for length and clarity.

### Should Canadians, collectively, take this personally?

> Maybe yes, if you wanted to feel like you should be special and not be
> mistreated this way. But if you’re like, “We should just be treated
> like everybody else,” well, you’re being treated no better, no worse
> than other countries.
> 
> There are good arguments that you should be treated better. But,
> unfortunately, this is the Trump administration’s approach.

### What’s behind this move?

> Are there big political gains for President Trump heading up to
> November in picking on Canada? It’s hard to see how that would be.
> 
> If anything, this is a way that he’s differentiating himself from
> \[former\] Vice President Biden. Joe Biden has indicated he would work
> more closely with allies on trade issues.
> 
> There are certainly political gains to picking on China, to be seen as
> being be tough on China.
> 
> The underlying trade issue with aluminum is Chinese overcapacity.
> 
> That being said, there’s nothing in the trade agreement between the
> Trump administration and China tackling the subsidies
problem.

### When President Trump [imposed aluminum tariffs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/31/us/politics/trump-aluminum-steel-tariffs.html) on Canada in 2018, he predicted a resurgence of the industry in the U.S. Did that happen?

> There wasn’t a revival. But it’s completely explained by the fact that
> the United States is just not a low cost place to be able to smelt
> aluminum.
> 
> It’s massively energy intensive. And so countries that are really good
> at it have access to very inexpensive, high quality, long term sources
> of energy like Canada and its hydro.
> 
> Where the United States is well positioned is in producing
> manufactured products that rely on that primary metal. So we buy it
> from Canada for a very low price and we turn it into the kinds of
> things that consumers want to buy.
> 
> It looks to me like the biggest negative effect is going to be on the
> American aluminum industry, paradoxically.
> 
> Primary aluminum from Canada is the bulk of their costs. And it’s now
> more expensive because of these tariffs. But they’re also being hurt
> because Canada chose to retaliate over a lot of finished American
> aluminum products. They’re going to have to lower their prices if they
> want to continue to sell into the Canadian market or else they’re
> going to lose market
share.

### Is there anything Canada can do to reverse the tariffs or will it just have to wait things out until November?

> We’re all waiting for the election. It will tell us if it’s more of
> the same. Or if it’s going to be something different.
> 
> If it’s a President Biden, we’re not sure what that something
> different will be. But one would hope that it would be a bit more
> rational with respect to economic interests and certainly with respect
> to treatment of American allies than what we’ve seen for the last
> three and a half years out of the Trump
administration.

### This isn’t an ideal way to begin the new, three country trade deal, is it?

> Basically it tells you everything you need to know about what
> President Trump really cares about when it come to trade agreements.
> Which is: He doesn’t really care about what’s in them at all. He just
> wants them for optics’ sake.
> 
> Trade analysts knew all along. But, I’m not sure that even with this
> action that point is going to be made clearly enough to the American
> public. It still thinks that somehow President Trump actually cares
> about the details of trade agreements and that he knows what is
> bothering American workers, what’s really ailing them. President Trump
> has convinced them that it has something to do with trade. But it
> really
doesn’t.
