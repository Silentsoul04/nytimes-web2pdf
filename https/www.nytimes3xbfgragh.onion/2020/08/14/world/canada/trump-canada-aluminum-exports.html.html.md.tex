\section{Looking Behind Trump's Latest Attack on Canada's Aluminum
Exports}\label{looking-behind-trumps-latest-attack-on-canadas-aluminum-exports}}

We spoke with an economist in Washington about the U.S. president's
latest trade salvo against his neighboring trade partner.

That didn't take long. The new trade deal between Canada, the United
States and Mexico was barely a month old when President Trump, during a
tour of a Whirlpool appliance factory, announced that he'd again placed
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/business/economy/trump-canadian-aluminum-tariffs.html}{tariffs
on aluminum from Canada.}

Canada, in turn,
\href{https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/consultations/2020/notice-intent-impose-countermeasures-action-against-united-states-response-tariffs-canadian-aluminum-products.html}{will
impose retaliatory tariffs}next month against a wide variety of things
made from aluminum in the United States, although there is no sign the
countermeasure will prompt a retreat by Mr. Trump.

Last week, many Canada Letter readers emailed questions about the
president's latest move, and several offered scathing opinions about it.

I put some of your questions to \href{https://www.chadpbown.com}{Chad P.
Brown, an economist and trade analyst} at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics in Washington. Our conversation has been edited
for length and clarity.

Maybe yes, if you wanted to feel like you should be special and not be
mistreated this way. But if you're like, ``We should just be treated
like everybody else,'' well, you're being treated no better, no worse
than other countries.

There are good arguments that you should be treated better. But,
unfortunately, this is the Trump administration's approach.

Are there big political gains for President Trump heading up to November
in picking on Canada? It's hard to see how that would be.

If anything, this is a way that he's differentiating himself from
{[}former{]} Vice President Biden. Joe Biden has indicated he would work
more closely with allies on trade issues.

There are certainly political gains to picking on China, to be seen as
being be tough on China.

The underlying trade issue with aluminum is Chinese overcapacity.

That being said, there's nothing in the trade agreement between the
Trump administration and China tackling the subsidies problem.

There wasn't a revival. But it's completely explained by the fact that
the United States is just not a low cost place to be able to smelt
aluminum.

It's massively energy intensive. And so countries that are really good
at it have access to very inexpensive, high quality, long term sources
of energy like Canada and its hydro.

Where the United States is well positioned is in producing manufactured
products that rely on that primary metal. So we buy it from Canada for a
very low price and we turn it into the kinds of things that consumers
want to buy.

It looks to me like the biggest negative effect is going to be on the
American aluminum industry, paradoxically.

Primary aluminum from Canada is the bulk of their costs. And it's now
more expensive because of these tariffs. But they're also being hurt
because Canada chose to retaliate over a lot of finished American
aluminum products. They're going to have to lower their prices if they
want to continue to sell into the Canadian market or else they're going
to lose market share.

We're all waiting for the election. It will tell us if it's more of the
same. Or if it's going to be something different.

If it's a President Biden, we're not sure what that something different
will be. But one would hope that it would be a bit more rational with
respect to economic interests and certainly with respect to treatment of
American allies than what we've seen for the last three and a half years
out of the Trump administration.

Basically it tells you everything you need to know about what President
Trump really cares about when it come to trade agreements. Which is: He
doesn't really care about what's in them at all. He just wants them for
optics' sake.

Trade analysts knew all along. But, I'm not sure that even with this
action that point is going to be made clearly enough to the American
public. It still thinks that somehow President Trump actually cares
about the details of trade agreements and that he knows what is
bothering American workers, what's really ailing them. President Trump
has convinced them that it has something to do with trade. But it really
doesn't.
