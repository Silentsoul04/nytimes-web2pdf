RIO DE JANEIRO — The chaotic response to the coronavirus in Brazil,
where it has killed more than [105,000
people](https://covid.saude.gov.br/), made the country’s experience a
cautionary tale that many around the world have watched with alarm.

But as the country’s caseload soared, vaccine researchers saw a unique
opportunity.

With sustained widespread contagion, a deep bench of immunization
experts, a robust medical manufacturing infrastructure and thousands of
vaccine trial volunteers, Brazil has emerged as a potentially vital
player in the global scramble to end the pandemic.

Three of the most promising and advanced vaccine studies in the world
are relying on scientists and volunteers in Brazil, according to the
World Health Organization’s report on the progress of vaccine research.

The embattled government hopes its citizens could be among the first in
the world to be inoculated. And medical experts are imagining the
possibility that Brazil could even manufacture the vaccine and export it
to neighboring countries, a prospect that fills them with something that
has been in short supply this year: pride.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m very optimistic,” said Dimas Covas, the director of the Butantan
Institute, an internationally renowned biopharmaceutical producer that
is partnering with China’s Sinovac on one of the studies that has
reached the third stage of research, during which potential vaccines are
tested on 9,000 people.

“Brazil will be one of the first countries to have the vaccine.”

Some 5,000 Brazilians have also been recruited to support a vaccine
trial conducted by AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish pharmaceutical company
in partnership with Oxford University. An additional 1,000 volunteers in
Brazil were recruited to test a vaccine developed by New York-based
Pfizer.

Researchers need countries with large enough outbreaks to assess whether
a vaccine will work. Some volunteers are given the potential vaccine
while others are given a placebo, but they have to be in a place where
enough virus is circulating to test the vaccine’s efficacy.

Brazil, where the virus has infected more than three million people, has
clear conditions for these trials. And it will be the only country other
than the United States to be playing a major role in three of the
leading studies as an unparalleled quest for a vaccine has led to
unusually fast regulatory approvals and hastily brokered partnerships.

Still, it is far from certain, experts say, that the vaccine trials
underway in Brazil will win the
race.

Countries across the world are vying to be among the first to get access
to a vaccine that will be in demand by billions of people. In India, one
of the country’s wealthiest families [is taking a
gamble](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html)
by mass producing the Oxford vaccine in hopes that it will be the first
to clear safety and regulatory hurdles.

Russia [this week approved a homemade
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine-approval.html)
which has not yet met the final tests for safety and efficacy. If it
works, it could position the country to claim it developed the world’s
first effective coronavirus vaccine.

Brazil’s explosive caseload has made it the second hardest-hit nation in
the world after the United States. While other countries in the region
have higher per capita rates, experts have assailed President Jair
Bolsonaro’s cavalier handling of the crisis.

The president, who caught the virus in July, has called it a “measly
flu” and sabotaged calls for quarantines and lockdowns. He also
appointed an Army general with no medical experience to run the health
ministry after two ministers clashed with the president over his disdain
for science-based approaches.

Because of the country’s disorganized response to the virus, Brazilians
have been subjected to travel bans, neighbors have militarized border
crossings and unions representing medical workers recently asked the
International Criminal Court to charge Mr. Bolsonaro for crimes against
humanity, arguing that he has given the virus free
rein.

Brazil has a universal public health care system with one of the best
immunization programs in the developing world, which has enabled it to
contain outbreaks of yellow fever, measles and other pathogens.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in recent years, as the economy has contracted, the program has
suffered, dogged by budget cuts. It has also had to fight disinformation
campaigns that have found a rapt audience on social media.

In 2019, for the first time in 25 years, Brazil didn’t fulfill its
vaccination goal for any of the shots it routinely administers.

A coronavirus breakthrough could galvanize the country’s vaccine sector.
It could also invigorate its scientific institutions, which employ world
class scientists but have been reeling after years of budget cuts that
have weakened the public health care system and dented the country’s
reputation as a research powerhouse.

Katherine O’Brien, the director of immunization at the World Health
Organization, welcomed Brazil’s investments in manufacturing vaccines
for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. But she said bilateral
deals like the ones Brazil is involved in were still a gamble.

“Some countries are going to be lucky, entering into contracts with a
candidate that’s going to demonstrate efficacy,” Dr. O’Brien said.
“Other countries are going to pursue deals with candidates that are
going to fail and they’ll get
nothing.”

Home to about 210 million people, Brazil has the capacity to make
roughly 500 million vaccines per year. Under the current coronavirus
vaccine deals Brazil has stakes in, Brazilian vaccine plants would
initially handle the final stages of vaccine production after importing
the raw materials, and later produce them entirely.

Brazil has signed two deals to get preferential access to a vaccine.
One, between the São Paulo state’s Butantan Institute and Sinovac, would
provide Brazilians with 120 million doses of the vaccine by early 2021.
The second one, between the federal government’s Bio-Manguinhos and
AstraZeneca, guarantees access to 100 million doses of the vaccine by
the beginning of next
year.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your

Both deals include a technology transfer agreement that would allow
Brazil to later manufacture vaccines on its own. Government officials
hope to start vaccinating some Brazilians by the first semester of 2021,
though an exact date depends on the results of ongoing studies and a
future approval process with the local regulatory agency.

Carla Domingues, an epidemiologist who ran the country’s immunization
program until last year, said disinformation campaigns about
immunization have hobbled efforts to protect people from HPV, a sexually
transmitted infection.

“Unfortunately, this trend that we have been seeing in other countries
for many years is now here in Brazil,” she said. “And we haven’t managed
to reverse
it.”

Yet recruiting volunteers for the ongoing studies in Brazil has not been
a challenge, said Soraya Smaili, the president at the Federal University
of São Paulo, which is involved in the AstraZeneca and Oxford study.

“It has not been hard to find volunteers,” she said. “People have
stepped forward and everyone wants to be part of the solution. This has
been a lovely social movement.”

Denise Abranches, a dental surgeon who has spent months treating
coronavirus patients with mouth sores in intensive care units, was among
the first to volunteer for a vaccine. She said her only fear was not
getting in line soon enough to get a shot.

“I see this as a way for us to regain a leadership role” in the global
scientific community, she said. “The world is looking at us for answers
and this is a vaccine that could help everyone in the world.”

Maurício Zuma, the director at Bio-Manguinhos, one of the manufacturers
that hopes to produce Covid-19 vaccines in Brazil, said that after the
country meets its internal demand, he hopes to export vials to
neighboring countries that also have been struggling with large
caseloads.

“Our intention is to take part in a movement of solidarity,” he said.
“If we manage to produce the vaccine here and end up with a surplus,
we’re obviously going to make sure it’s used in other countries in Latin
America.”

But as researchers celebrate Brazil’s role in the global vaccine race,
they have also felt compelled to remind citizens that the good news
won’t single-handedly put an end to the suffering the virus has
unleashed in the country.

“They should not assume that that’s it and they are done,” said Maria
Elena Bottazzi, a vaccine developer at Baylor College of Medicine.
“There is still a lot of work that Brazil needs to do to strengthen
their public health infrastructure to reduce the transmission of the
virus.”
