Taylor Swift dominates the Billboard album chart once again this week,
while Cardi B lands perhaps the raunchiest No. 1 single in history.

Swift's
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review.html}{Folklore},''
which was released last month with less than 24 hours' notice, remains
the No. 1 album for a third time, with the equivalent of 136,000 sales
in the United States, according to Nielsen, barely changed from last
week. But the mix of data within that composite number shows how Swift's
rollout plan helped her stay at the top.

For its first two weeks, the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-billboard-chart.html}{array
of collectible physical versions} of the album that Swift offered fans
were available only through her website. So when ``Folklore'' came out,
a whopping 73 percent of its opening-week total was attributed to copies
sold as a full package. In
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/10/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-billboard.html}{Week
2}, with streams still strong but CD and vinyl copies not yet in stores,
complete albums made up just 23 percent of the total.

In Week 3, with physical albums finally available from sellers like
Target --- which offered
\href{https://www.target.com/c/taylor-swift/vinyl/-/N-54u4cZvevia}{exclusive
versions}, as it has in the past --- the sales ticked up again.
According to Nielsen, 67,000 of its total this week, or nearly half,
came from sales of the album, while the number of streams dropped by a
third, to 90 million.

Also this week, Juice WRLD's ``Legends Never Die'' is No. 2, Pop Smoke's
``Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon'' is No. 3 and Rod Wave's ``Pray
4 Love'' is No. 4. The country star Luke Bryan opened at No. 5 with his
new album, ``Born Here Live Here Die Here.''

On the Hot 100 singles chart, Cardi B's
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/arts/music/playlist-cardi-b-megan-thee-stallion.html}{WAP},''
featuring Megan Thee Stallion, opened at No. 1 with 93 million streams
in the United States, which
\href{https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9435213/cardi-bs-wap-debuts-no-1-hot-100}{Billboard
said} is the most for any track in its debut week. The song, a paean to
female sexual desire, is almost certainly the most graphic and explicit
song ever to reach the top --- although much of its traffic came from a
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=28\&v=hsm4poTWjMs\&feature=emb_logo}{censored
YouTube video} that, while certainly suggestive, was perhaps more PG-13
than X-rated.
