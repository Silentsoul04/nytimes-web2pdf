Health experts in New York City thought that coronavirus cases would be
rising again by now. Their models predicted it. They were wrong.

New York State has managed not only to control its outbreak since the
devastation of the early spring, but also to contain it for far longer
than even top officials expected.

Now, as other places struggle to beat back a resurgence and cases climb
in former success-story states like California and Rhode Island, New
York’s leaders are consumed by the likelihood that, any day now, their
numbers will begin rising.

The current levels of infection are so remarkable that they have
surprised state and city officials: Around 1 percent of the roughly
30,000 tests each day in the city are positive for the virus. In Los
Angeles, it’s 7 percent, while it’s 13 percent in Miami-Dade County and
around 15 percent in Houston.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The virus is simply no longer as present in New York as it once was,
epidemiologists and public health officials said.

“New York is like our South Korea now,” said Dr. Thomas Tsai of the
Harvard Global Health Institute.

But nothing is static about the viral outbreak, experts cautioned. The
question now is whether the state, where 32,000 people have died of the
virus, can keep from being overwhelmed by another wave, as threats loom
from arriving travelers, struggles with contact tracing and rising cases
just over the Hudson River in New Jersey.

April.

State officials shut down schools and businesses, sacrificing jobs and
weakening the economy to save lives. Adherence to mask wearing has been
strong. Many vulnerable New Yorkers are still sheltering in their
apartments. Others decamped to second homes.

And, critically, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio reopened
cautiously, deciding in late June against allowing indoor dining and
bars after seeing those activities connected to outbreaks in other
states.

“People in New York have taken matters much more seriously than in other
places,” said Dr. Howard Markel, a historian of epidemics at the
University of Michigan. “And all they’re doing is reducing the risk.
They’re not extinguishing the
virus.”

Still a resurgence is all but inevitable, public health experts said.

Local beaches have filled on hot weekend days. Diners flock to outdoor
restaurants with plywood patios. More than 1.2 million people took the
subway on a recent Tuesday, down dramatically compared to a year ago,
but more than double what it was on a Tuesday in May.

The same models that predicted an increase in New York City for the
summer now see a rise coming in the early fall. Life can be lived
outside for now, but will move indoors as the weather cools — just as
the flu season is ramping up. Schools are set to open in September.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And confidence in the good numbers themselves could breed complacency
about masks and distancing. Already, the city has seen a number of
[large illicit dance
parties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/08/nyregion/nyc-illegal-parties.html)
and a worrisome spike in cases in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

“I’m not optimistic about a sustained end to Covid-19 in New York,” said
Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the Pandemic Resource and Response
Initiative at Columbia University. “Even though we had that horrible
peak in April, when we were the epicenter, there are still millions of
people who are vulnerable.”

Among the biggest threats, officials and epidemiologists said, were
out-of-state travelers, who continue to arrive in New York despite a
state-mandated [14-day
quarantine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-states-quarantine.html).

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The governor instituted the quarantine requirement for anyone coming to
[New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/nyregion/ny-quarantine-rules.html)
from a state with high infection rates. Eight states were initially
affected; the list has since grown to 31 states, Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands.

More than 160,000 people have been subject to the quarantine since the
start of June, state officials said. But enforcement of the order is
near-impossible, and the state could not say how many have actually
quarantined.

About 20 percent of new positive cases in New York City have been
connected to out-of-state travel, city officials said, with Florida,
Georgia and New Jersey the top departure points. Last week, Mr. de
Blasio said drivers entering the city could be pulled over at random to
be informed of the state’s quarantine rules.

The majority of those reached by the city’s contact tracers have [not
shared the names of anyone they might have
infected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/nyregion/new-york-contact-tracing.html):
More than 12,500 people who tested positive did not give their contacts
to the city, [out of about 22,000
total](https://hhinternet.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/2020/08/test-and-trace-data-metrics-20200803.pdf).
Those who did shared an average of between two and three contacts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But city officials could not say how many of those testing positive for
the virus were already known to contact tracers — in other words, how
many new cases had a connection to a previous positive case. That is
considered by infectious disease experts to be a key metric for gauging
how under control an outbreak is.

Dr. Jay Varma, the mayor’s senior adviser for public health, said the
city’s program had prevented “thousands” of new infections, based on the
number of people identified as symptomatic contacts who said they were
in quarantine. Just over 200 people have isolated themselves in a
city-funded hotel since the start of June.

“I don’t think it’s correct to insinuate that the work that we’re doing
is not having an impact when you clearly see the impact in terms of
disease numbers in New York,” Dr. Varma said.

Patterns of infection around the state suggest New Yorkers, like most
Americans, are chafing under pandemic
restrictions.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

In New York City, neighborhoods with the highest rate of infection are
increasingly found in Manhattan — Hell’s Kitchen or the Financial
District, for example, which are home to wealthier residents — in
addition to the parts of the Bronx and Queens that have long been hard
hit.

“My concern is complacency,” the city’s former top public health
official, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, said in an interview last month. Dr. Barbot
[resigned this month and voiced “deep
disappointment”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/nyregion/oxiris-barbot-health-commissioner-resigns.html)
with Mr. de Blasio’s response to the pandemic.

She said the most important factor in New York’s success so far has been
broad acceptance of masks and social distancing, adding, “I think it
would be foolish of us to not plan for an inevitable second wave.”

Fatigue with the rules has already sparked localized outbreaks in parts
of the state: a high school graduation in Chappaqua that resulted in the
infections of 28 people; a July 4 party in Albany that drew 200 people.

Pediatricians in Westchester County became alarmed when families
recently began seeking coronavirus tests in order to go to children’s
parties where proof of a negative test was required to attend.

“Unfortunately, people still really don’t understand what the testing
means,” said Dr. Sherlita Amler, the county’s health commissioner. “It’s
just a moment in time. It’s not a get-out-of-jail card.”

While antibody surveys have suggested [one in five New York City
residents may have already been
exposed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html),
public health officials do not believe herd immunity is behind the low
numbers, or could be relied on in the future.

What may protect New Yorkers who decide to buck the rules and gather in
groups without masks is the fact that so many of their neighbors are
still masking up, said Dr. Barbot.

“If a new infection gets introduced into the community, it will be a
terminal transmission, meaning that it won’t go any further,” she said.
“More people wearing face coverings seems to be in line with that.”
She cautioned that it was a theory and the data is not yet there.

And even at the currently low levels, the number of new virus cases in
New York City — 386 reported positive on Tuesday out of 46,185 tested,
according to state data — is still too great for its contact tracers to
effectively determine where people are becoming infected, said Dr.
Barbot. The new norms of behavior have to continue for the foreseeable
future, she said.

“I think that we are changing the culture,” said Dr. Howard Zucker, the
state health commissioner, adding that social distancing and masks are
now almost “a reflex.”

Such changes have been evident from new behaviors. In Westchester
County, where indoor dining is allowed, patrons are opting to eat
outside. Some restaurants still only offer outdoor seating.

“When the weather turns colder, that will be the test of whether people
are comfortable dining indoors,” said Noam Bramson, the mayor of New
Rochelle, which had [the first reported cluster in New York in
March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html).
The city of 80,000 had 33 active cases at the end of July, he said, down
from more than 1,000 in the spring.

The ways New York has contained the virus are varied, and together offer
a preview of what life may look like for months if not years to come.

“The work force is going to be different for a while,” said Jim
Malatras, who has been advising Governor Cuomo on the virus response. He
wondered aloud when and how things like gyms or movie theaters would be
able to open safely in the state. (On Monday, the governor announced
[gyms would be allowed to
open](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/nyregion/nyc-gyms-reopening.html)
with limited capacity on Aug. 24.)

“We’re taking it slow,” he added. “Dave Matthews isn’t performing at
Madison Square Garden anytime soon.”
