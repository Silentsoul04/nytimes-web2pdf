*At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, with travel restrictions in
place worldwide, we launched a new series —* [*The World Through a
Lens*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/the-world-through-a-lens)
*— in which photojournalists help transport you, virtually, to some of
our planet’s most beautiful and intriguing places. This week, Barry L.
Schwartz shares a collection of images from the central Italian region
of Umbria.*

-----

In 2017, a few months after we got married, my wife, Maggie, and I took
a six-week trip — part honeymoon, part yearslong delayed vacation.
Leaving California, our first stop was in Brooklyn to see Maggie’s
oldest friend, who we all knew was not going to survive a cancer that
had returned after many years. It was a good visit.

Next, we flew to Barcelona and drove to a small coastal town, Sitges.
While there, I learned that one of my oldest friends had just died, also
from cancer, also at the end of a series of treatments.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A few days later we flew to Florence, driving a few hours south to
Panicale, a small hilltop town in Umbria. A friend — Steve Siegelman, a
food writer in California — had lent us his renovated brick-and-stone
rowhouse in what he jokingly refers to as the “new neighborhood,”
because it was built in the 1500s, while the town’s main center, the
piazza, dates back to the 10th century.

Steve had discovered Panicale on a trip with his parents years before.
Rural hilltop towns all over Europe have been [emptying out for
decades](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/07/t-magazine/abandoned-italian-towns.html)
as people move away to make a living, leaving houses to be bought by
Americans, Britons and Germans as primary or second homes. They, along
with the locals, help keep Panicale
alive.

Early on, we badly needed to do our laundry. The washing machine in the
basement could not be convinced to do the job, resulting in texts to
Steve in California asking whom to call for help. He wrote back that his
local fixer would get a plumber over at some point; in the meantime, he
put us in contact with an expat couple, dear friends of his, Elida and
Guenter, a half-mile away, with an olive grove and a brick house
overlooking a valley. They immediately invited us to come for a meal and
to use their laundry machines, which were set into a hillside like a
wine
cellar.

Steve supplies his guests with a 21-page manual: how the house works,
where to go, whom to call for advice and help. At the time, there were
three grocers in town, and we were instructed to buy from each, as
everyone in town did, partly to keep them in business and partly because
everyone is so nice. (Iolanda’s had great fresh fruits and
vegetables.)

Unlike Maggie, I had never been to Italy. Raised in Los Angeles, I’ve
had a lifelong obsession with authenticity, an elusive quality in my
hometown. It was a balm to find cobblestone streets and peeling plaster
walls that were not aged by artificial means, and to buy ordinary fruits
and vegetables, not
“heirlooms.”

One place in particular I documented at all times of the day: a spot

The wall provided an overlook to the agricultural plain to the north

the altar had been. The piano belonged to [Dalia Lazar, a visiting

the family of George Gershwin and shipped to Panicale for the year of
her residency. The museum was the only place large enough for the piano,
and the building was used for concerts. Later that day we heard Ms.
Lazar practicing as we walked
