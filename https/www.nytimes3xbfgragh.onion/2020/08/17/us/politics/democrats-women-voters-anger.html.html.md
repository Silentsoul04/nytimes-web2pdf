President Bill Clinton introduced America to the “soccer mom,” anxiously
shuttling her children across swing state suburbs in her minivan.
President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign found another cutesy
moniker, dubbing those voters worried about terrorism after the attacks
of Sept. 11 “security moms.”

President Trump’s handling of the pandemic is generating an entirely
different sentiment, one not traditionally bestowed upon female voters
or mothers.

“I am a rage mom,” said Senator Patty Murray, the highest-ranking woman
in Senate leadership. “Well, a rage nana, at this point, as my
granddaughter would say.”

With millions of American families facing an uncertain start to the
school year, the struggle for child care, education and economic
stability is fueling a political uprising, built on the anger of women
who find themselves constantly — and indefinitely — expected to be
teacher, caregiver, employee and parent.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the pandemic roars on, voters across America remain [deeply angry and
worried](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/us/politics/election-coronavirus-protests-unemployment.html)
about the future. But the vocal outrage from women, in particular, is
clear on protest lines and in polling data. Women were more likely than
men to report having participated in protests over the past two years,
and mothers with children in the home were twice as likely as fathers to
report participating in a protest, according to a Kaiser Family
Foundation poll from June.

Now, the rage moms are railing in Facebook groups about school shutdowns
and in teacher union meetings about reopening without proper protection
from the virus. They’re also packing virtual town halls with
frustrations about schools, child care and the lack of leadership.

“There’s nobody giving us solutions,” said Kim Lopez, a mother of three
in Glendale, Ariz., and part-time financial assistant, who is still
unsure what her children’s schooling will look like this year. Ms. Lopez
said she never considered herself political until this summer, when she
brought her children to a small Black Lives Matter protest in the
Phoenix suburbs. “It’s as if they don’t care what happens to families.”

Ms. Lopez is exactly the kind of voter Democrats hope will push them to
victory in November, and they are aiming to turn that frustration with
government inaction into a vote against Mr. Trump.

Last month, the Biden campaign kicked off a “Moms for Biden” group. On
Zoom, one person after another spoke of fears and frustrations. Asked to
name the most pressing issue for her, one mother couldn’t narrow it
down. Instead, she simply said “less worry.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Voters are likely to hear more about those child care concerns at the
Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, with remarks from
many of the party’s most influential female politicians, including their
new vice-presidential nominee, Senator Kamala
Harris.

The broader focus on caregiving issues marks a significant shift in the
political climate of even a few months ago, when Senator Elizabeth
Warren made child care a centerpiece of her campaign in the Democratic
presidential primary.

At campaign events six months ago, Ms. Warren’s proposals for universal,
government-funded child care would elicit nods primarily from mothers in
the crowd, she said, followed by quiet conversations in the selfie line
with women about their personal struggle balancing work and child care.

During a virtual town hall meeting she held last month, however, more
than half of the questions from the audience of 70,000 people were about
schools, child care and working parents.

“Right now, I think women have just had it up to their eyeballs,” Ms.
Warren said in an interview. “They no longer feel isolated and one-off
in how they couldn’t figure out how to make the system work, and
recognize the system is broken, and nobody’s making it work.”

Ms. Warren added: “They’re fired up. And I love it.”

The pandemic is the spark but the backlash against Mr. Trump has been
burning since the day after his inauguration, when millions of women
joined protests across the country. Their fire has endured through
\#MeToo, waves of teachers’ strikes led by predominantly female unions,
the outcry against school shootings, and Black Lives Matter
demonstrations, a movement started largely by female racial justice
activists. For the second election cycle in a row, a record-breaking
number of female candidates are running for federal office. Mr. Biden’s
selection of Ms. Harris was widely seen as a nod to the energy women
have given the Democratic Party during the Trump era.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Women are mobilized on a bigger scale than we’ve seen in a generation
at least,” said Annelise Orleck, a historian at Dartmouth College who
studies women’s political activism. “Women are organizing all across the
spectrum.”

The activism is diffuse and multiracial, reflecting political battles
that working class women have long waged for better health care, schools
and child care. In some ways, more affluent suburban women are simply
waking up to the untenable choices poorer women and women of color have
faced for generations.

While the anger is loudest on the left, Democrats hope to capitalize on
indications that the rage reaches across party lines. The rebellion by
white college-educated women against Mr. Trump helped Democrats win key
swing districts in 2018, giving the party control of the House. In
recent weeks, support for Mr. Trump has begun to drop among white
non-college educated women and older women — two more ideologically
moderate groups that bolstered his winning coalition four years ago. The
gender split among suburbanites is striking: In a recent [Washington
Post/ABC News
poll](https://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1214a22020Election.pdf),
Mr. Biden leads by 24 points among suburban women and just four points
among suburban men, a statistical dead heat.

“I am so full of rage,” said Alida Garcia, the vice president of Fwd.us,
an immigration advocacy group and mother of 1-year-old twins. “We are
exhausted.”

Last month, Mr. Biden announced a sweeping [$775 billion caregiving
proposal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/politics/biden-workplace-childcare.html)
that would cover care for young children, older adults and family
members with disabilities. He often invokes his experience as a single
father caring for his two young sons after his first wife and daughter
were killed in a car
crash.

Mr. Biden has repeatedly described caregiving as an economic necessity
that deserves sustained support, a marked shift in political rhetoric on
a topic that was often seen by politicians as a special interest, not an
issue to put at the center of a campaign. Other Democratic politicians,
too, have begun more forcefully addressing caregiving concerns. Last
week, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sponsored a webinar on “How
to Organize a Child Care Collective.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Parents with minor children make up about one-third of the country’s
work force, according to the Brookings Institutions. In 2018, 23.5
million working parents relied upon school and child care programs while
they went to work.

“For the last 10, 20 years, this has been sidelined and siloed as just a
women’s issue,” said Brigid Schulte, who runs the [Better Life
Lab](https://www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/) at New America, a
research group. “It’s not and it never has been.”

Throughout American history, women have wielded an image of maternal
respectability to push for labor reforms, temperance, stoke fears of
communist infiltration in the 1950s and other political causes.

In recent years, mothers-turned-activists have begun political
organizations, including Moms Rising, Vote Like a Mother and Moms Demand
Action, a gun control advocacy organization. The majority of volunteers
with Indivisible, a liberal advocacy group that helped propel several
Democrats to Congress in 2018, are women, and the topic of child care
has become a de facto part of many meetings across the country.

“There isn’t a single thing you can offer up to women now, whether it’s
text banking, leadership training, organizing skills, that’s not
immediately oversubscribed,” said Cecile Richards, the head of
Supermajority, an organization founded last year with the goal of
mobilizing female voters. “It is this extraordinary moment when women
are in the ascendancy and finally the issues that women have to deal
with every day are at last in the public conversation in a way that they
have not been in any time I remember.”

Ms. Richards says Supermajority planned for 800 women to sign up for a
recent organizing training it offered. It got 1,800 responses in the
first week.

“Moms definitely know how to multitask,” said Smitha Chadaga, who has
spent a career working as an internist in a hospital and became
politically active after the 2016 election, when her children asked if
their family would have to leave the United States. (Dr. Chadaga’s
parents immigrated from India and her husband’s family came from
Nicaragua.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to her work and her involvement with an Indivisible group in
Portland, Ore., Dr. Chadaga is caring for her two boys, ages 8 and 10.
It is impossible to miss the heightened interest and anger of mothers,
she said.

“The fact that we do not value child care, that we don’t value early
education, this is not something that Covid created — it’s something
that Covid exposed,” she said. “The moms and parents around me are all
feeling that very same thing.”

While Democrats have proposed the most ambitious plans to tackle child
care, there are some signs that Republicans, too, are facing pressure to
address the issue. Last month, the House passed two bills that would
provide more than $220 billion in funding for child care centers and tax
credits. Each bill had support from more than a dozen Republicans, a
notable number in a deeply polarized Congress.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, another primary candidate who made child
care a central part of her presidential bid, said she constantly hears
from people who are worried about child care.

“It wasn’t easy for most parents that I’ve talked to. To have no access
to child care is crippling,” she said. She hopes the crisis point
reached by many families during the pandemic will create political
momentum for policies like paid leave, universal early childhood
education and universal sick days.

For Ms. Murray, the activism is both hopeful and a bittersweet reminder
of just how much has stayed the same over three decades.

“I came here, as a senator, as the first working mother. I am now, a
generation later, watching my daughter and son deal with the same
issue,” Ms. Murray said. “This pandemic has ripped wide an open wound
that families have struggled with for a long time.”
