The eight N.B.A. teams that did not qualify for the season's restart at
Walt Disney World in Florida can create bubbles and hold voluntary group
workouts at their team facilities beginning in mid-September, the league
and its players' union announced on Tuesday.

The provision applies to teams like the Knicks and the Golden State
Warriors, who were no longer in contention for the playoffs when the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/11/sports/basketball/nba-season-suspended-coronavirus.html}{N.B.A.
suspended its season on March 11}because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/sports/basketball/nba-restart-disney-world.html}{league
resumed play} in July with 22 teams in an isolated campus at Disney
World near Orlando, Fla., that has thus far not yielded any positive
coronavirus tests after players and staff left quarantine.

The announcement by the league is an indication that the N.B.A. has
faith in its approach and feels comfortable expanding it, even as the
pandemic continues to affect lives daily in the United States. Like the
Florida restart, this plan would be implemented in phases, including a
quarantine period before workouts. It would require players and staff to
stay ``in a campuslike environment under controlled conditions,''
according to the statement released by the N.B.A., and to undergo daily
testing for the coronavirus.

The eight teams affected are the Knicks, Warriors, Minnesota
Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, Atlanta Hawks, Detroit Pistons,
Chicago Bulls and the Charlotte Hornets. The league said that all eight
teams could also invite up to five players who currently are not signed
to a league contract but were assigned to the team's G League affiliate.

The news release said that it would be up to the teams to create campus
environments in their own home cities and that it is not mandatory for
players to attend. This new agreement would open the door for teams to
have intrasquad scrimmages and group conditioning sessions.

It is not clear where the home city campuses would be. The Knicks
declined to comment. The team recently hired
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/sports/basketball/nba-knicks-coach-tom-thibodeau.html}{Tom
Thibodeau} as its newest head coach.

In
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/sports/basketball/coronavirus-nba-disney-world-restart.html}{the
plan for the Florida restart}, the N.B.A. allowed 22 teams to take part:
the eight teams slated for the playoffs in each conference, as well as
six teams that were within six games of the eighth seeds in their
conferences. They played eight seeding games to complete the regular
season and to determine which 16 teams made the playoffs and where they
would be seeded. The playoffs began Monday.
