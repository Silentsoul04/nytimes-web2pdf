WASHINGTON --- Hoping to appeal to female voters, President Trump said
on Tuesday that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/trump-susan-b-anthony-pardon.html}{he
would posthumously pardon Susan B. Anthony}, the women's suffragist who
was arrested in 1872 after voting illegally and assessed a \$100 fine.

The pardon came on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th
Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.

``She was never pardoned. Did you know that? She was never pardoned,''
Mr. Trump said. ``What took so long?''

Mr. Trump had teased the pardon as he traveled on Air Force One on
Monday, telling reporters he was going to erase the conviction of
someone ``very, very important.''

Many of Mr. Trump's other pardons and grants of clemency have been of
people whose cases resonate with him or allies, like his longtime
political adviser, Roger J. Stone Jr., who was convicted on several
charges stemming from the investigation into possible conspiracy between
the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly been accused of sexual harassment or
assault and who has often
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/16/us/politics/trump-women-insults.html}{made
degrading comments} about women, is facing a deep gender gap in his
campaign against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. On Tuesday,
surrounded by several female supporters, Mr. Trump declared that ``women
dominate the United States'' and complained that the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/us/unemployment-coronavirus-women.html}{coronavirus
had darkened the economic picture for women}.

A female Democratic official in New York --- the state where Ms. Anthony
was arrested --- greeted the news of her pardon with the immediate
demand that it be rescinded.

``She was proud of her arrest to draw attention to the cause for women's
rights, and never paid her fine,'' New York's lieutenant governor, Kathy
Hochul,
\href{https://twitter.com/ltgovhochulny/status/1295721863340077082?s=21}{wrote
on Twitter}. ``Let her Rest In Peace,
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Ftwitter.com\%2FrealDonaldTrump}{@realDonaldTrump}.''
