# Notre Dame, Michigan State Shifting Online as Campus Outbreaks Grow

</div>

After 147 people tested positive for the coronavirus, Notre Dame said it
would shift to remote instruction for at least two weeks. Michigan State
told undergraduates not to come to campus.

A week into the fall semester, the University of Notre Dame announced on
Tuesday that it would move to online instruction for at least the next
two weeks in an attempt to control a growing coronavirus outbreak, and
could move to shut down campus entirely.

“If these steps are not successful, we will have to send students home,
as we did last spring,” Notre Dame’s president, the Rev. John I.
Jenkins, said in a video address to students, noting that he had been
inclined to take that step before consulting with local health
officials.

The announcement came as universities across the country are struggling
to control fast-growing outbreaks among returning students. On Monday,
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [moved all of its
undergraduate classes
online](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/unc-chapel-hill-covid.html),
also a week into the fall semester. And Michigan State on Tuesday
shifted its reopening plans, telling students not to return for the
start of classes in two weeks.

At Notre Dame’s campus near South Bend, Ind., 12,000 undergraduate and
graduate students were tested before they could return to campus on Aug.
3 to start classes a week later. The few dozen who tested positive were
told to stay home. Yet by Tuesday, the school reported that at least 147
people [had tested
positive](https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/) for the virus
over the last two weeks.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Eighty of those confirmed cases were added this week, Notre Dame said.
All but one were students. None are hospitalized.

The university said 927 people had been tested since Aug. 3, leaving the
school with a nearly 16 percent positivity rate.

“The virus is a formidable foe,” Father Jenkins said. “For the past
week, it has been winning.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A university spokesman said a significant number of the confirmed cases
were connected to two off-campus parties where students, mostly seniors,
did not wear masks or practice social distancing. Most of those who have
tested positive live in off-campus housing, the spokesman, Paul J.
Browne, said. Those students have now begun to infect students who did
not attend the gatherings.

In addition to moving classes online, Notre Dame will close public
spaces on campus and restrict dormitories to residents. Students who
live in off-campus housing have been barred from campus and must
“associate with housemates only,” Father Jenkins said, with a limit on
gatherings reduced from 20 to 10 people.

Father Jenkins had previously defended the decision to reopen, [saying
in a New York Times
Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/opinion/notre-dame-university-coronavirus.html):
“We believe we can keep our campus environment healthy.” The university
brought students back two weeks early, eliminated the fall break and
planned to end the semester at Thanksgiving.

U.N.C., with 30,000 students, also started classes on Aug. 10, and by
Monday, 177 students had tested positive for the coronavirus and another
349 students were forced to quarantine because of possible exposure. At
least four clusters had been identified in student housing, including
one at a
fraternity.

### Schools Reopening ›

#### Back to School

Updated Aug. 20, 2020

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.

  -   - Much more is [expected of America’s school
        nurses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/us/schools-reopening-nurses-covid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup)
        during the pandemic, but many schools don’t have one.
      - A vast majority of parents have resigned themselves to [going it

        according to a new survey for The New York Times.
      - Alabama is betting that a [robust student testing and technology
        program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/business/alabama-uab-coronavirus-tests.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup)
        will be enough to hinder outbreaks on college campuses.
      - We want to hear from teachers making difficult choices. How are
        you thinking about the start of the school year? [Tell us

A day later, Michigan State’s president [sent a
letter](https://president.msu.edu/communications/messages-statements/2020_community_letters/2020-08-18-plans-change.html)
telling undergraduate students who had planned to live in campus housing
to stay home. He said that most of the university’s courses were already
being offered remotely, and that it would make all of them available
online before school starts in two weeks, with some exceptions for
graduate students.

“It has become evident to me that, despite our best efforts and strong
planning, it is unlikely we can prevent widespread transmission of
Covid-19 between students if our undergraduates return to campus,” the
president, Dr. Samuel L. Stanley Jr., wrote on Tuesday. He cited
outbreaks at other universities as a large part of his decision.

Criticism and worry continue to plague other colleges hoping to offer
in-person learning this fall. In the last few days, widely circulated
images of young people congregating without masks near campus in
[Tuscaloosa,
Ala.,](https://abc3340.com/news/coronavirus/social-media-images-of-lines-outside-tuscaloosa-bars-draws-ire-of-alabamas-ad)
home of the University of Alabama, and around [Dahlonega,
Ga](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/watch/?v=905235006636836)., home
of the University of North Georgia, have raised concerns about students’
cavalier attitudes to social distancing measures.

Virginia Tech’s president, Tim Sands, sent a letter to students on
Tuesday pleading with them to be responsible or risk outbreaks like
those on other campuses.

“For those who may wish to take a break — perhaps by hosting or
attending a party with individuals not in your ‘pod’ — please don’t,” he
wrote, adding, “There will be a day in the not-too-distant future when a
degree of normalcy will return.”
