Grow}\label{notre-dame-michigan-state-shifting-online-as-campus-outbreaks-grow}}

After 147 people tested positive for the coronavirus, Notre Dame said it
would shift to remote instruction for at least two weeks. Michigan State
told undergraduates not to come to campus.

A week into the fall semester, the University of Notre Dame announced on
Tuesday that it would move to online instruction for at least the next
two weeks in an attempt to control a growing coronavirus outbreak, and
could move to shut down campus entirely.

``If these steps are not successful, we will have to send students home,
as we did last spring,'' Notre Dame's president, the Rev. John I.
Jenkins, said in a video address to students, noting that he had been
inclined to take that step before consulting with local health
officials.

The announcement came as universities across the country are struggling
to control fast-growing outbreaks among returning students. On Monday,
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/unc-chapel-hill-covid.html}{moved
all of its undergraduate classes online}, also a week into the fall
semester. And Michigan State on Tuesday shifted its reopening plans,
telling students not to return for the start of classes in two weeks.

At Notre Dame's campus near South Bend, Ind., 12,000 undergraduate and
graduate students were tested before they could return to campus on Aug.
3 to start classes a week later. The few dozen who tested positive were
told to stay home. Yet by Tuesday, the school reported that at least 147
people \href{https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/}{had tested
positive} for the virus over the last two weeks.

Eighty of those confirmed cases were added this week, Notre Dame said.
All but one were students. None are hospitalized.

The university said 927 people had been tested since Aug. 3, leaving the
school with a nearly 16 percent positivity rate.

``The virus is a formidable foe,'' Father Jenkins said. ``For the past
week, it has been winning.''

A university spokesman said a significant number of the confirmed cases
were connected to two off-campus parties where students, mostly seniors,
did not wear masks or practice social distancing. Most of those who have
tested positive live in off-campus housing, the spokesman, Paul J.
Browne, said. Those students have now begun to infect students who did
not attend the gatherings.

In addition to moving classes online, Notre Dame will close public
spaces on campus and restrict dormitories to residents. Students who
live in off-campus housing have been barred from campus and must
``associate with housemates only,'' Father Jenkins said, with a limit on
gatherings reduced from 20 to 10 people.

Father Jenkins had previously defended the decision to reopen,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/opinion/notre-dame-university-coronavirus.html}{saying
in a New York Times Op-Ed}: ``We believe we can keep our campus
environment healthy.'' The university brought students back two weeks
early, eliminated the fall break and planned to end the semester at
Thanksgiving.

U.N.C., with 30,000 students, also started classes on Aug. 10, and by
Monday, 177 students had tested positive for the coronavirus and another
349 students were forced to quarantine because of possible exposure. At
least four clusters had been identified in student housing, including
one at a fraternity.

A day later, Michigan State's president
\href{https://president.msu.edu/communications/messages-statements/2020_community_letters/2020-08-18-plans-change.html}{sent
a letter} telling undergraduate students who had planned to live in
campus housing to stay home. He said that most of the university's
courses were already being offered remotely, and that it would make all
of them available online before school starts in two weeks, with some
exceptions for graduate students.

``It has become evident to me that, despite our best efforts and strong
planning, it is unlikely we can prevent widespread transmission of
Covid-19 between students if our undergraduates return to campus,'' the
president, Dr. Samuel L. Stanley Jr., wrote on Tuesday. He cited
outbreaks at other universities as a large part of his decision.

Criticism and worry continue to plague other colleges hoping to offer
in-person learning this fall. In the last few days, widely circulated
images of young people congregating without masks near campus in
\href{https://abc3340.com/news/coronavirus/social-media-images-of-lines-outside-tuscaloosa-bars-draws-ire-of-alabamas-ad}{Tuscaloosa,
Ala.,} home of the University of Alabama, and around
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/watch/?v=905235006636836}{Dahlonega,
Ga}., home of the University of North Georgia, have raised concerns
about students' cavalier attitudes to social distancing measures.

Virginia Tech's president, Tim Sands, sent a letter to students on
Tuesday pleading with them to be responsible or risk outbreaks like
those on other campuses.

``For those who may wish to take a break --- perhaps by hosting or
attending a party with individuals not in your `pod' --- please don't,''
he wrote, adding, ``There will be a day in the not-too-distant future
when a degree of normalcy will return.''
