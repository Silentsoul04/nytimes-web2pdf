A chance encounter in an elevator showed the candidate's easy rapport
with a fan, striking a chord on social media.

It was an accidental viral moment for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/joe-biden}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}, at a time when his quest for the Democratic nomination
seemed to be flagging. En route to an interview last year with the
editorial board of The New York Times,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/us/politics/Joe-Biden-accepts-democratic-nomination.html}{Mr.
Biden} found himself in an elevator with Jacquelyn, a 31-year-old
security guard who shyly admitted she was star-struck.

``I love you,'' Jacquelyn told the former vice president. ``I do. You're
like my favorite.'' Mr. Biden, smiling, asked if she had a camera. The
two posed for a selfie on her smartphone.

It was a fleeting exchange that happened to be captured by a film crew
for ``The Weekly,'' an FX show produced in collaboration with The Times.
Mr. Biden did not receive
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/19/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-elizabeth-warren-new-york-times-endorsement.html}{the
paper's endorsement} during the Democratic primary --- that went to
Senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren --- but his easy rapport
with Jacquelyn struck a chord on social media.

On Tuesday night, Jacquelyn --- who was identified using her middle
name, Brittany, because Biden aides said she had declined to make her
last name public --- made a more deliberate appearance before a national
TV audience. The Biden campaign selected her as the first person to
enter Mr. Biden's name into nomination for president at the Democratic
National Convention, introducing her as ``a working American who met Joe
Biden in a most unexpected place --- the elevator where she worked.''

``I take powerful people up on my elevator all the time,'' Jacquelyn
told viewers in a prerecorded segment. ``When they get off, they go to
their important meetings. Me? I just head back to the lobby. But in the
short time I spent with Joe Biden, I could tell he really saw me, that
he actually cared, that my life meant something to him.''

She spoke before an open elevator, though not the one in the Times
building where she met the former vice president. ``Joe Biden has room
in his heart for more than just himself,'' she said, describing Mr.
Biden as ``my friend.''

Jacquelyn's appearance at the convention underscored some of the themes
the Biden team is keen to promote this week, including his support among
working Americans, and Black women in particular. And her appearance
nodded to what advisers believe is Mr. Biden's chief political strength,
a sense of empathy and ease with Americans from many walks of life.

Jacquelyn is employed by The Times as a security guard. She has no role
in the newspaper's journalism **** or editorial page, and she is not
bound by rules that prohibit many of the company's employees from
engaging in political activity.

For Jacquelyn, the Tuesday cameo marked the culmination of an unusual
and unexpected role in a national campaign.

``I never thought I would be in a position to do this,''
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-security-guard-blurted-i-love-you-to-joe-biden-in-an-elevator-one-viral-video-later-she-will-nominate-him-for-president/2020/08/18/df652f04-e178-11ea-b69b-64f7b0477ed4_story.html}{she
told The Washington Post}, which first reported on her role on Tuesday.
``I never thought I was worthy enough to do this.''
