\hypertarget{whos-speaking}{%
\subsection{Who's speaking}\label{whos-speaking}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Jill Biden},
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
  R. Biden Jr.}'s wife and the former second lady. An English professor
  at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale, Dr. Biden broke
  ground by continuing to work during her tenure as second lady.
\item
  Representative \textbf{Lisa Blunt Rochester} of Delaware. She is a
  co-chairwoman of Mr. Biden's campaign and was also a member of his
  vice-presidential vetting committee.
\item
  Former President \textbf{Bill Clinton}. A perennial star of Democratic
  conventions, he has only a brief speaking slot this time. It's
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/bill-clinton-convention.html}{a
  sign both of how much the party has shifted ideologically} and of the
  re-evaluation of sexual misconduct allegations against him.
\item
  \textbf{John Kerry}, the former secretary of state and 2004 Democratic
  presidential nominee. He was one of Mr. Biden's highest-profile
  supporters during the primary.
\item
  Representative \textbf{Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez} of New York. She is
  one of the most prominent members of the party's progressive wing, and
  her small role in the convention --- she will have just 60 seconds to
  speak --- frustrated some on the left.
\item
  Senator \textbf{Chuck Schumer} of New York, the minority leader. Along
  with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, he is currently battling with
  the Trump administration over coronavirus relief and funding for the
  Postal Service.
\item
  \textbf{Sally Yates}, the former acting attorney general. A holdover
  from the Obama administration, she
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html}{was
  fired} by President Trump in 2017 after she refused to defend his
  executive order banning travel from predominantly Muslim countries.
