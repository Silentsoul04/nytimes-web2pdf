## Notre Dame is temporarily moving classes online to control an outbreak.

The [University of Notre
Dame](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/notre-dame-coronavirus.html)
announced on Tuesday that it would move to online instruction for at
least the next two weeks in an attempt to control a growing coronavirus
outbreak and would shut down the campus entirely if those measures
failed to stop the spread.

“If these steps are not successful, we will have to send students home,
as we did last spring,” Notre Dame’s president, the Rev. John I.
Jenkins, said in a video address to students, noting that he had been
inclined to take that step before consulting with health officials.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The school will also close public spaces on campus and restrict
dormitories to residents.

On Tuesday, the school reported that at least 147 people on campus [had
tested positive](https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/) since
students began returning on Aug. 3 for the start of classes a week
later. Eighty of those confirmed cases were added on Tuesday.

“The virus is a formidable foe,” Mr. Jenkins said. “For the past week,
it has been winning.”

On Monday, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill became the
first large university in the country to [shut down
classes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/unc-chapel-hill-covid.html)
after students had returned. The school moved all undergraduate courses
online after 177 students tested positive and another 349 students were
forced to quarantine because of possible
exposure.

[U.N.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/sports/ncaafootball/unc-football-acc-online-classes.html),
with 30,000 students, started classes on Aug. 10, the same day that
courses resumed at Notre Dame, a campus of 8,600 students near South
Bend, Ind. Notre Dame tested all of its students before they returned to
campus, with 33 positive results.

On Tuesday, Ithaca College in upstate New York said that it would extend
remote learning through the fall semester, despite initial plans to
bring students back to campus in waves starting this month. In a
[statement](https://www.ithaca.edu/news/revised-plan-fall-opening),
Shirley M. Collado, the president of the college, called the reversal
“an agonizing decision” but said that “bringing students here, only to
send them back home, would cause unnecessary disruption in the
continuity of their academic experience.”

Michigan State’s president [sent a
letter](https://president.msu.edu/communications/messages-statements/2020_community_letters/2020-08-18-plans-change.html)
Tuesday telling undergraduate students who had planned to live in campus
housing to stay home. He said the university would make all of its
courses available online before school starts in two weeks, with
exceptions for some colleges and graduate students. And Virginia Tech’s
president, Tim Sands, sent a letter to students pleading with them to be
responsible or risk outbreaks like those on other campuses.

Across the United States, [Greek life has come under particular
scrutiny](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/coronavirus-fraternities-sororities.html)
amid reports of outbreaks at fraternities and sororities. On Tuesday,
health officials in Riley County, Kan., [reported a new
outbreak](https://www.rileycountyks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1178) of
cases associated with the Phi Delta Theta fraternity at Kansas State
University — 13 members tested positive — and recommended quarantine for
anyone who had been in contact with those infected.

In the last few days, widely circulated images of young people
congregating without masks near campus in [Tuscaloosa,
Ala.,](https://abc3340.com/news/coronavirus/social-media-images-of-lines-outside-tuscaloosa-bars-draws-ire-of-alabamas-ad)
home of the University of Alabama, and around [Dahlonega,
Ga](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/watch/?v=905235006636836)., home
of the University of North Georgia, have raised concerns about students’
cavalier attitudes to social distancing measures

A [Notre
Dame](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2020/08/18/notre-dame-coronavirus-students-positive)
spokesman said a significant number of its cases were connected to two
off-campus parties where students, mostly seniors, did not wear masks or
practice social distancing. Most of those who have tested positive live
in off-campus housing, the spokesman, Paul Brown, said.

Both North Carolina and Notre Dame said athletic teams were unaffected.
Notre Dame is ordinarily an independent in football but is planning to
play this fall in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which also counts North
Carolina as a member. Unlike the [Pac-12 and the Big
Ten](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/sports/ncaafootball/big-ten-postpones-football-season.html),
the A.C.C. has not yet abandoned its fall season.

Beyond the immediate matter of whether sports like football should be
played this autumn, this week’s approach by North Carolina could
ultimately factor into debates over players’ rights and whether the
hyphen in “student-athlete” might be more properly replaced with “or.”

“The optics aren’t very good, if you take the principle that all college
athletes are students first,” said Walter Harrison, a former president
of the University of Hartford who once was chairman of the committee
that evolved into the N.C.A.A.’s top governing
body.

In virtual addresses leading up to [the formal nomination of Joseph R.
Biden Jr. for the
presidency](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/roll-call-pass-dnc.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)
on Tuesday night, the party faithful who spoke on the second night of
the Democratic National Convention expanded the event’s focus beyond the
coronavirus crisis.

But while the bulk of the speeches addressed themes like national
security, presidential accountability and continuity between past and
future leaders of the party, the virus still made a few high-profile
cameos:

  - **Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee** invited Democrats to come to his
    city once the coronavirus crisis had passed. “Unlike the president,
    we never made fun of face masks,” he said. “We understand why we
    can’t be together this week, and we hope you do too.”

  - **Former President Bill Clinton** accused President Trump of
    downplaying the virus crisis, and of collapsing under the pressure
    of a real management challenge. “At a time like this, the Oval
    Office should be a command center,” he said. “Instead, it’s a storm
    center. There’s only chaos. Just one thing never changes — his
    determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame. The buck
    never stops there.”

  - **Jill Biden**, Mr. Biden’s wife and a former high school English
    teacher, expressed heartache over the losses from the coronavirus,
    as well as the frustration and fear it was inspiring among parents
    of schoolchildren. “Like so many of you, I’m left asking, ‘How do I
    keep my family safe?’” she said.
    
    The convention’s central event — its roll call vote — was
    drastically revamped to accommodate the constraints imposed by the
    pandemic. This year, it consisted of a series of pretaped recordings
    of delegates listing their vote tallies, replacing the iconic and
    photogenic ritual of delegates shouting their state’s numbers into a
    hand-held microphone.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Earlier this summer, Trump administration officials hailed a new
strategy for catching coronavirus infections: [pooled
testing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-pooled-testing.html).

The decades-old approach combines samples from multiple people to save
time and [precious testing
supplies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-testing-supply-shortage.html).
Federal health officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Adm. Brett Giroir
said pooling would allow for constant surveillance of large sectors of
the community, and said they hoped it would be up and running nationwide
[by the time students returned to
school](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-pooled-testing.html).

But now, when the nation desperately needs more tests to get a handle on
the virus’s spread, this efficient approach has become worthless in many
places, in part because there are simply too many cases to catch.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Pooled testing only works when the vast majority of batches test
negative, among other drawbacks with the procedure. If the proportion of
positives is too high, more pools come up positive — requiring each
individual sample to then be retested, wasting precious chemicals.

Nebraska’s state public health laboratory, for example, was a pooling
trailblazer when it began combining five samples a test in mid-March,
cutting the number of necessary tests by about half.

But the lab was forced to halt its streak on April 27, when local
positivity rates — the proportion of tests that turn up positive —
surged past 10 percent. With that many positives, there was little
benefit in pooling.

“It’s definitely frustrating,” said Dr. Baha Abdalhamid, the assistant
director of the laboratory. In combination with physical distancing and
mask wearing, pooling could have helped keep the virus in check, he
added. But the pooling window, for now, has slammed shut.

Still, the strategy has made significant headway in some parts of the
country. In New York, where test positivity rates [have held at or
below 1 percent since
June](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-covid-19-infection-rate-below-1-percent-tenth-straight-day),
universities, hospitals, private companies and public health labs are
using the technique in a variety of settings, often to catch people who
aren’t feeling sick, said Gareth Rhodes, an aide to the governor and a
member of his virus response team. Last week, the State University of
New York was cleared to start [combining up to 25 samples at
once](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-testing-initiatives-improve-covid-19-detection-control-across-new).

Elsewhere in the U.S.:

  - More than 43,200 new cases and more than 1,340 new deaths were
    reported across the country on Tuesday. Officials in **Kentucky**
    reported 19 additional deaths today, a single-day record, for a
    total of 859 deaths in that state since the pandemic began.

  - After an outcry over cost-cutting moves at the **Postal Service**
    that prompted allegations that the Trump administration was trying
    to disenfranchise voters who planned to mail in their ballots for
    the 2020 election, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said Tuesday that
    [those operational changes would be
    suspended](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/postal-service-suspends-changes.html)
    until after the 2020 election. Mr. DeJoy, [a major donor to
    President
    Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/politics/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy.html),
    said in a
    [statement](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2020/0818-postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-statement.htm)
    that he was suspending the changes “to avoid even the appearance of
    any impact on election mail.” The changes included reducing post
    office hours, removing postal boxes and eliminating overtime for
    mail carriers.

  - **Idaho**, one of the states where new cases peaked this summer, is
    doing [the least amount of
    testing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html)
    in the country necessary to understand and contain the virus,
    according to [a New York Times
    database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html).
    The United States is testing 52 percent of what it should be to slow
    the spread of the virus, according to [a model developed by Harvard
    researchers](https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/),
    and Idaho is hitting just 16 percent of the daily testing it needs
    to be doing.

  - The **S\&P 500** [closed at a record high on
    Tuesday,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus)
    a remarkable display of investor optimism despite an economic
    decline that has sent unemployment soaring. Technology stocks played
    a big role in the gains, which were also fueled by the trillions of
    dollars pumped into financial markets by the Federal Reserve and
    enormous spending by the government to protect American workers and
    businesses from the worst of the downturn.

  - Senate Republicans on Tuesday began circulating text of a narrow
    **coronavirus relief package** that would[revive extra unemployment
    benefits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/republicans-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html)at
    half the original rate, shield businesses from lawsuits related to
    the virus and provide funding for testing and schools. The draft
    measure appears to be an effort to break through the political
    stalemate over providing another round of economic stimulus to
    Americans during the pandemic. But it is unlikely to alter the
    debate in Washington, where Democrats have repeatedly rejected
    previous Republican offers as insufficient. The new bill would spend
    less money, in fewer areas, than those earlier offers.

  - Covid-19 strike teams [apply an emergency response model
    traditionally used in natural
    disasters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/health/Covid-nursing-homes.html)
    like hurricanes and wildfires to combating **outbreaks in long-term
    care facilities**. Composed of about eight to 10 members from local
    emergency management departments, health departments, nonprofits,
    private businesses — and at times, the National Guard — the teams
    are designed to bring more resources and personnel to a disaster
    scene.

  - The eight **N.B.A.** teams that did not qualify for the season’s
    restart at Walt Disney World in Florida last month [can create
    bubbles and hold voluntary group

He added that the vaccine doses would be manufactured domestically for
its citizens, and that his office was working to secure early access for
countries in Southeast Asia and those in Australia’s “Pacific family.”

Australia has also signed a $17.9 million deal with the U.S. medical
technology company Becton Dickinson to supply needles and syringes.

Mr. Morrison said that Australia had so far invested $185 million in
coronavirus vaccines, but did not specify the value of the AstraZeneca
deal. Local news reports have estimated that the country’s overall plan
to acquire vaccines would be worth [billions of
dollars](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-18/australia-locks-in-oxford-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-deal/12571454).

The partnership between
[Oxford](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html)
and AstraZeneca is among the most closely watched coronavirus vaccine
efforts in the world. It was also the first to enter Phase III trials,
and several countries — including Britain and the United States — have
already agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for a total of two
billion doses even before the vaccine’s efficacy has been proven.

On Wednesday, Mr. Morrison cautioned that there was “no guarantee that
this, or any other, vaccine will be successful,” and that his government
was casting its net wide to find a vaccine.

Australia has reported 23,773 cases and 438 deaths. A recent outbreak in
Melbourne, the country’s second-largest city, led to a lockdown with
some of the toughest restrictions in the world.

The Philippines largely reopened for business on Wednesday, against the
advice of some health experts.

The Philippines has nearly 170,000 confirmed coronavirus cases,
including nearly 30,000 that were reported in the past week, [according
to a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries).
Its total caseload is the highest in Southeast Asia.

Under the rules that took effect on Wednesday, more industries were
allowed to open, limited church services were allowed to resume, and
restaurants welcomed dine-in customers. The rules apply in and around
Manila, the capital, and several outlying provinces, a region that has
been under various stages of lockdown since March.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Almost all industries will reopen, except for those that attract mass
gatherings” like amusement parks, said Harry Roque, a spokesman for
President Rodrigo Duterte.

The easing of the lockdown was designed to revive a flagging economy
that has taken a beating from the virus and that has officially slipped
into recession in the second quarter. Mr. Duterte’s government has
insisted that the majority of those infected in recent weeks have shown
mild symptoms.

But health experts have warned that lifting lockdowns too quickly would
lead to more cases and deaths. Nearly all of Manila’s hospitals are
under severe strain.

“It’s really counterintuitive to reopen the economy amidst the steep
rise of cases and the presence of fully loaded hospitals,” Dr. Anthony
Leachon, a former adviser to Mr. Duterte’s government on the pandemic,
said in an interview.

Businesses are caught in the middle, and some are now reopening — again
— in desperation.

“We need to survive,” said Ben Razon, the owner of the Oarhouse
restaurant and bar in central Manila, as he reopened on Wednesday. He
last closed for a lockdown that began on Aug. 3.

Mr. Razon said the restaurant’s regular crowd had evaporated in recent
months because of nighttime curfews, forcing him to adjust to daytime
dining.

“I have had to assist my own crew from savings out of my own pocket in
order for us to stay together as a small enterprise and be able to
resume once regular operating hours resume,” he added. “In the meantime,
we have to help each other.”

In other developments around the world:

  - **South Korea** reported 297 new infections on Wednesday, its
    highest daily rise since March. Kim Gang-lip, a senior health
    official, warned that new infections in and around Seoul, the
    capital, could lead to “massive nationwide transmission.” The
    country of about 51 million people has reported more than 16,000
    confirmed infections during the pandemic, including more than 1,300
    in the past week, according to a Times database.

  - **Sweden** has temporarily recalled its diplomats from North Korea,
    citing increasing difficulties with travel and diplomatic postings,
    in part because of the pandemic. The Swedish embassy remains open
    with local staff, and “Sweden is engaged in dialogue with North
    Korea on these subjects,” a spokesman for the Swedish Ministry for
    Foreign Affairs said.

  - A tropical cyclone that passed near **Hong Kong** on Tuesday night
    created an added complication for travelers, disrupting flights and
    delaying the results of virus tests that are conducted on arrival
    before passengers begin their compulsory 14-day quarantine.
    Collection points for the saliva samples that people are required to
    take on their 10th day in quarantine were also suspended.

  - **Greece** has locked down two facilities for migrants where new
    infections have been traced, after another overcrowded reception
    center was put under lockdown last week, the government said. The
    infections are part of a recent spike in the number of cases in
    Greece, which has weathered the pandemic relatively well so far,
    with just over 7,200 confirmed cases and 230 deaths. But the
    authorities this week introduced new restrictions to address local
    outbreaks and have warned of more measures if the upward trend
    continues.

  - Countries putting their own interests ahead of others in trying to
    ensure supplies of a possible coronavirus vaccine are making the
    pandemic worse, the director general of the **World Health
    Organization** said on Tuesday, Reuters reported. “No one is safe
    until everyone is safe,” the agency’s leader, Dr. Tedros Adhanom
    Ghebreyesus, said during a briefing in Geneva. The organization also
    said the pandemic was now being driven by young people, many of whom
    were unaware they were infected, posing a danger to vulnerable
    groups.

## Possibly exposed? Don’t quarantine and keep working, Tennessee school districts tell teachers.

Teachers in at least six Tennessee public school districts who may have
been exposed to coronavirus can be required to teach in person anyway,
under policies approved by their districts.

The districts, located in six counties in eastern and central Tennessee,
are adapting C.D.C. guidelines for essential workers, according to Beth
Brown, president of the Tennessee Education Association, a teachers’
organization. District officials did not immediately respond to messages
seeking comment.

Under C.D.C. guidelines, most people are supposed to go into quarantine
for 14 days after possible exposure. But the school districts say
teachers may be expected to forego quarantine and keep working as long
as they do not show symptoms, provided that “additional precautions are
implemented to protect them and the community.”

Researchers have found that people who have caught the virus can spread
it before they show symptoms, or without ever developing them.

John C. Bowman, executive director of Professional Educators of
Tennessee, another teachers’ organization, said he expected more
districts to adopt the same policies, because of a shortage of
substitute teachers to cover for any who are quarantined. And he said he
expected to see some teachers quit their jobs because of the policies.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“Teachers are afraid,” Mr. Bowman said. “You can open up the school
buildings all day long — that’s the easy part. But without healthy
educators and staff available, they’re just buildings.”

Some schools in Tennessee have been open for almost three weeks, and a
few have seen virus-related disruptions. In [Putnam
County](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2020/08/09/80-students-quarantined-putnam-county-tn-after-exposure-covid-19/3330778001/),
at least 80 students have been quarantined because of a potential
coronavirus exposure, and a middle school and a high school in Maury
County postponed reopening by a few days because teachers were in
quarantine.

The Tennessee Departments of Health and Education issued a joint letter
to school superintendents in the state on Tuesday requiring that school
districts adhere to mandatory measures for “critical infrastructure”
school staff who have been exposed to the coronavirus. The measures
include wearing a face covering at school, maintaining six feet of
distance from others, and quarantining when not attending
school.

With more than 400 shops, the Singapore Changi Airport would be the
fourth-largest mall by the number of tenants if it were in the United
States.

The combination of an often affluent and captive audience has made
airport commercial square footage some of the most lucrative in the
world. But the pandemic has [crushed the commercial calculus at
airports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/business/airport-remodeling-coronavirus-safety.html),
and no one is sure what comes next.

The leading airport for concession and retail sales in the United States
is Los Angeles International, with revenue of $3,036 a square foot,
according to a 2018 report from Airport Experience News. By comparison,
the average mall retailer is around $325 per square foot, according to
2017 data from CoStar.

But that’s all gone now, said Alan Gluck, a senior aviation consultant
at ICF. “In general, sales are in the toilet,” he said.

The very amenities that once made airports a standout for profit are the
same things that are proving to be challenging.

So far, the pandemic has not paused terminals planned or in progress in
the United States. Projects already underway, including [at La Guardia
Airport](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/nyregion/new-la-guardia-airport-terminal.html)
in New York and in smaller markets like Lafayette, La., are moving
ahead, but taking a wait-and-see approach on adjustments.

New terminal construction should focus on space not just for the
coronavirus but other respiratory illnesses, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,
the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.

New terminals needed to allow enough space for people to spread out,
offer high-efficiency particulate air filtration and distribute free
masks. He would also like to see more health screening at airports.

“You can’t throw up your hands and say it is impossible,” Dr. Fauci
said.

The number of known deaths in prisons, jails and other correctional
facilities among prisoners and correctional officers has surpassed
1,000, [according to a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#clusters)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The number of deaths in state and federal prisons, local jails and
immigration detention centers — which stood at 1,002 on Tuesday morning
— has increased by about 40 percent during the past six weeks,
according to the database. There have been nearly 160,000 infections
among prisoners and guards.

The actual number of deaths is almost certainly higher because jails and
prisons perform limited testing on inmates, including many facilities
that decline to test prisoners who die after exhibiting symptoms
consistent with the coronavirus.

[A recent
study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768249) showed
that prisoners are infected at a rate more than five times the nation’s
overall rate. The death rate of inmates is also higher than the national
rate — 39 deaths per 100,000 compared to 29 deaths per 100,000.

The Times’s database tracks coronavirus infections and deaths among
inmates and correctional officers at some 2,500 prisons, jails and
immigration detention centers.

The nation’s largest known virus cluster is at San Quentin State Prison
in California, where more than 2,600 inmates and guards have been
sickened and 25 inmates have died after a botched
[transfer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/us/san-quentin-prison-coronavirus.html)
of inmates in May. “It’s the perfect environment for people to die in —
which people are,” said Juan Moreno Haines, an inmate at San
Quentin.

Faced with a recent resurgence of cases, officials in France have made
mask wearing mandatory in business spaces across the country, [pleading
with people not to let down their
guard](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/world/europe/france-coronavirus.html)
and jeopardize the hard-won gains made against the virus during a
two-month lockdown this spring.

The government on Tuesday announced the mandate for mask wearing in
business spaces, building on mask policies that had been in place.
France “cannot wait for the health situation to get worse,” Elisabeth
Borne, the French labor minister,
[wrote](https://twitter.com/Elisabeth_Borne/status/1295727473448161282)
on Twitter. “With our business partners, we want to take every
precaution to avoid the propagation of the virus, to protect workers and
guarantee the continuity of economic activity.”

The signs of a new wave of infection emerged over the summer as people
began resuming much of their pre-virus lives, traveling across France
and [socializing in
cafes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/world/europe/coronavirus-paris-cafe-reopen-france.html),
restaurants and parks. Many, especially the young, have visibly relaxed
their vigilance.

In recent days, France has recorded [about 3,000 new infections every
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/france-coronavirus-cases.html),
roughly double the figure at the beginning of the month, and the
authorities are investigating an increasing number of clusters.

Thirty percent of the new infections are in young adults, ages 15 to 44,
according to a [recent
report](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-et-traumatismes/maladies-et-infections-respiratoires/infection-a-coronavirus/documents/bulletin-national/covid-19-point-epidemiologique-du-13-aout-2020).
Since they are less likely to develop serious forms of the illness,
deaths and the number of patients in intensive care remain at a fraction
of what they were at the [height of the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/world/europe/france-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=6).
Still, officials are not taking any
chances.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“The indicators are bad, the signals are worrying, and the situation is
deteriorating,” Jérôme Salomon, the French health ministry director,
told the radio station [France
Inter](https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/l-invite-de-8h20-le-grand-entretien/l-invite-de-8h20-le-grand-entretien-14-aout-2020)

France has suffered more than [30,400 deaths from the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/france-coronavirus-cases.html)
— one of the world’s worst tolls — and experienced an economically
devastating
[lockdown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/world/europe/paris-coronavirus-lockdown.html?searchResultPosition=18)
from mid-March to mid-May. Thanks to the lockdown, however, France
succeeded in stopping the spread of the virus and lifted most
[restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/world/europe/france-coronavirus-lockdown-aperue.html?searchResultPosition=4)
at the start of summer.

The course of the pandemic in Europe has followed a somewhat similar
trend, with [Spain also reporting new local
clusters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-reopening.html).
But important disparities exist among countries. In the past week, as
France reported more than 16,000 new cases, Britain reported 7,000, and
Italy 3,000, according to
[data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries)
collected by The
Times.

The young people crowded into the pool, standing shoulder to shoulder,
as they listened to a D.J. No one was wearing a mask, and no one seemed
to care.

The scene would be incredible anywhere, but was especially so in this
case. It was in Wuhan, the city in central China where the coronavirus
pandemic began late last year.

A [series of photographs and
videos](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1295345558270488577) posted by
Agence France-Presse captured the moment on Saturday night, when
hundreds of people attended a pool-party rave that would have been
unthinkable only months ago.

The images seemed to touch a nerve in a world where lockdowns remain in
place, where fear of public spaces and entertainment venues remains
high, and where the idea of wading into a public pool is tantalizingly
off limits to millions of people.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

It was also another example of how life is slowly returning to normal in
China, even in its hardest-hit city, as other countries — even those
that coped well with the first wave, like South Korea and New Zealand —
struggle with new outbreaks.

Shanghai Disneyland
[reopened](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/business/shanghai-disneyland-reopens.html)
in May, while movie theaters reopened across China last month. The
step-by-step return of the country’s cultural life has not ignited any
significant new outbreaks, though the government remains extraordinarily
vigilant.

China on Tuesday reported no new locally transmitted cases of the virus
on the mainland for the second consecutive day.

The pool party in Wuhan took place at Maya Beach Water Park in
conjunction with a musical festival at an adjacent amusement park called
Wuhan Happy Valley. They reopened in June, two months after the city’s
76-day lockdown was lifted, although in a nod to coronavirus
precautions, the parks have limited capacity by 50 percent.

The parks have been holding [Saturday night

New York City [will require
that](https://twitter.com/NYCMayorCounsel/status/1295754462049509377)
hotels and short-term rental companies make travelers from dozens of
states fill out forms with their personal information before they can
have access to their rooms, or provide proof they had already done so,
Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday. Those travelers were already
[required by the state to quarantine for 14
days](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory) and to
fill out [the state’s health
form](https://forms.ny.gov/s3/Welcome-to-New-York-State-Traveler-Health-Form),
but the new measure, which goes into effect Friday, is another attempt
at ensuring compliance with [the rules that many are
flouting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/nyregion/coronavirus-quarantine-nyc.html)
in the city.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Both hotels and guests could be subject to fines of up to $2,000 for
ignoring the rule, according to a spokeswoman for the mayor. People who
had recently traveled to areas outside the city accounted for 15 to 20
percent of cases in the city over the past month, according Dr. Jay
Varma, one of the mayor’s health advisers. Mr. de Blasio urged New
Yorkers to avoid traveling to places restricted by New York State unless
it was necessary.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo [said Tuesday that travelers from Alaska and
Delaware](https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1295781030457221121)
will now also be required to quarantine for 14 days, joining a list of
31 other states as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

“If you have a choice in travel, don’t go where the problem is,” Mr. de
Blasio said, adding that “because, of course, if you go there there’s a
chance you bring that disease back.”

New York State’s list changes each week, which has forced some college
students to abandon longstanding travel plans and [quickly find
accommodations to serve out the
quarantine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/nyregion/college-reopening-quarantine-coronavirus.html).
More than 59,000 private-college students in New York come from states
on the list **** as of Tuesday, according to the Commission on
Independent Colleges and Universities.

Elsewhere in the New York area:

  - The number of **[apartments for rent in New York
    City](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/nyregion/nyc-vacant-apartments.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)**
    has soared to the highest rate in more than a decade, a sign that a
    notable number of residents have left the city because of the
    outbreak, at least temporarily, potentially creating a new obstacle
    to reviving the local economy. The surge in supply has driven down
    rental costs across the city and forced landlords to offer generous
    concessions, including up to three months’ free rent and paying the
    expensive fees brokers command.

<!-- end list -->

  - New York City will not open **gyms** before Sept. 2, the mayor said
    Tuesday as the city needs more time to complete the inspections
    required under new state guidance. The state had said that gyms
    could open as early as Aug. 24, but the mayor said that city
    officials have been focused on reopening schools and child care
    centers. [The state’s guidance on
    gyms](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/Gyms_and_Fitness_Centers_Summary_Guidelines.pdf)
    also clarified that rules on capacity and mask wearing applied in
    apartment building gyms, and said that buffs, bandannas and gaiters
    could not be used as face coverings in gyms statewide.

  - The compensation packages of museum directors [are drawing
    scrutin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/arts/design/museum-leader-salaries-pay-disparity.html)y

    **[New
    Jersey](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1295758529014509569)**

    Alaska and Delaware, as well as dozens of other states and two
    territories, [though compliance is voluntary in New

## A series of new reports clarify susceptibility to Covid-19 and a possible new direction for treatment.

STUDIES ON HIGH-RISK WORK PLACES

Workers in factories, warehouses and building sites are at especially
high risk of infection as American businesses reopen, [according to a
new report from government public health
researchers.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6933e3.htm?s_cid=mm6933e3_w)

The new analysis, published by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, helps clarify which economic sectors pose the greatest
danger, at a time when states are bracing for a possible new phase of
the epidemic in the fall.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The C.D.C. report, along with two other just-published findings — one
analyzing Covid-19 hospitalizations, the other deaths — also sheds light
on racial disparities in the shape and the impact of the U.S. epidemic.

Black and Latino people were far more likely than non-Hispanic white
people to [be hospitalized for
Covid-19](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769369?mc_source=MTExMDY2Ojo6NDc2NmI5NDJmZjI1NGU2MWE3MmI0NzA0MGJlZDg0NTQ6OnYzOjoxNTk3Njg1Mjg0Ojox),
one study found. But ethnicity [was not related to the risk of later
dying](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2769387?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=081820)
of the disease, the other study concluded. Both were posted by the
medical journal JAMA.

REMDESIVIR

A large federal study that found an experimental antiviral drug,
remdesivir, can hasten the recovery of hospitalized Covid-19 patients
[has begun a new phase of
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/health/Covid-treatments-remdesivir.html).

Researchers will examine whether adding another drug — beta interferon,
which has already been approved to treat multiple sclerosis and mainly
kills viruses, but can also tame inflammation — would improve
remdesivir’s effects and speed recovery even more.

In a large clinical trial, sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health, [remdesivir was shown to modestly shorten recovery
time](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-remdesivir.html)
by four days on average, but it did not reduce deaths.

RARE IMMUNE SYNDROME

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome**,** the severe illness that strikes
some children with the coronavirus, is distinct from both Kawasaki
disease and from Covid-19 in adults, according to a new study.

Most children infected with the coronavirus have mild symptoms, if any
at all. But on very rare occasions, some develop so-called MIS-C,
characterized by widespread inflammation in the heart, lungs, brain,
skin and other organs. In the United States, there were 570 confirmed
cases of the syndrome and 10 deaths as of Aug. 6.

The study, [published
Tuesday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1054-6) in Nature
Medicine, analyzed immune cells in 15 boys and 10 girls, aged 7 to 14
years, with the syndrome.

When the children were acutely ill with MIS-C, their immune cells
behaved differently than they did in adults with Covid-19. The pattern
also differs from that seen in Kawasaki disease, a similarly rare
inflammatory condition in young children.

As of Aug. 3, children account for 7.3 percent of U.S. coronavirus
cases, but make up about 22 percent of the overall population. The
actual proportion of infected children is likely to be higher, because
testing is still focused primarily on adults with
symptoms.

## Idaho, facing hundreds of new cases a day, is the state furthest behind its testing target.

Idaho, one of the states where new cases peaked this summer, is doing
[the least amount of
testing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html)
in the country necessary to understand and contain the virus across the
state, according to [a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html).
Testing is critical to reducing the spread of the virus.

[Harvard
researchers](https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/)
developed a formula to determine how many daily tests a specific state
should be doing to slow the spread of the virus. The researchers said
that, at the very least, there should be enough daily tests to assess
anyone with flulike symptoms, plus an additional 10 people for any
symptomatic person who tests positive.

The United States is testing only 52 percent of what it should be to
slow the spread of the virus, according to the Harvard model, and Idaho
is hitting just 16 percent of the daily testing it needs to be doing.
The state also has a 16 percent positivity rate, and the [World Health
Organization has
said](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/07/07/why-arizonas-percent-positive-tests-highest-country/5386600002/)
a positivity rate has to be under 5 percent for at least two weeks to
signal that a spread is under control. (That figure is based on the
assumption that the state or region is meeting their testing target.)

Idaho is also among the states that have reported the highest number of
[new cases per 100,000
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
over the past seven days, even as the number of new cases there has
slowed.

The state’s response to the virus, led by Gov. Brad Little, a
Republican, came under fire in the [earliest days of the
pandemic](https://www.idahostatesman.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/words-deeds/article241471176.html)
for [not doing
enough](https://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/editorials/article241458021.html)
to stop the spread of the virus. In late March, Idaho saw an average of
about 16 new cases a day, compared with the current average, over a
seven-day period, of more than 400 a day. Idahoans were told on
[March 25 to stay at
home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html),
and the state started reopening in phases on May 1.

But cases started to mount in mid-June, as happened across several
states. The [amount of testing in Idaho has increased since the onset of
the virus, but delays in getting results have hurt efforts to contain
the
spread](https://www.idahostatesman.com/article244586032.html).

## Americans’ homebound reality rewards big retailers like Walmart, but forces job cuts at Boeing.

The radical disruptions in the rhythms of American life caused by the
pandemic continued to ripple through the business world this week, with
big retailers like Walmart and Home Depot reporting booming sales, and
aerospace giant Boeing planning further job cuts as the airline industry
continues to suffer.

Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, saw its second-quarter sales
rise 9.3 percent, driven by continuing strong demand for food and
general merchandise, the company reported Tuesday. The company’s
e-commerce sales alone grew 97 percent, more than double what the
company had been averaging in recent years. And despite rising costs
related to the pandemic, the retailer also generated
larger-than-expected profit.

It was one of the clearest signs of the consolidation in the retail
industry triggered by the pandemic, as many other retailers have
struggled or failed in recent months.

Homeowners with time on their hands for renovations appear to have also
given a boost to Home Depot, where [same-store sales
rose](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#home-depot-reports-surge-in-second-quarter-sales)
more than 23 percent in the quarter from May to July. The
home-improvement and hardware retailer also saw an increase in profits,
earning $4.3 billion in the second quarter compared with $3.5 billion
during the same period last year.

But a homebound nation continues to cause trouble for the commercial air
industry. On Monday, Boeing’s chief executive said that the company
would offer [a second round of
buyouts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#boeing-is-planning-deeper-job-cuts-ceo-says),
adding to the 10 percent cut the company [announced in
April](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/business/boeing-layoffs-coronavirus.html).

Mr. Calhoun did not specify how many jobs Boeing was hoping to cut. The
new buyouts will help limit involuntary layoffs and will be offered to
employees who work in parts of the company most affected by the
pandemic, like Boeing’s commercial airplane and services businesses.

While recent federal data shows air travel is recovering again after
stalling in July, the number of people flying each day is still less
than a third of what it was a year ago. Industry executives expect that
figure to remain depressed until a coronavirus vaccine is widely
available.

## Sororities and fraternities pose a virus-fighting challenge for colleges.

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, officials [abruptly
called off in-person classes on
Monday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/unc-chapel-hill-covid.html)
after identifying four clusters in student housing facilities, including
one at the Sigma Nu fraternity.

The New York Times has identified [at least 251 cases of the virus tied
to fraternities and
sororities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/coronavirus-fraternities-sororities.html)
at colleges and universities across the United States.

At the University of California, Berkeley, 47 cases were identified in a
single week in early July, most of which were connected to the Greek
system. In Mississippi, a significant outbreak in Oxford, home to the
state’s flagship university, was partially blamed on fraternity parties.
At the University of Washington’s Seattle campus, at least 165 of the
290 cases identified by the school have been associated with its Greek
Row.

As students return to campus, there have been virus outbreaks at
residence halls and other university housing as well. More than 13,000
students, faculty and staff members at colleges have been infected with
the coronavirus, according to a Times database of cases confirmed by
schools and government agencies.

But fraternities and sororities have been especially challenging for
universities to regulate. Though they dominate social life on many
campuses, their houses are often not owned or governed by the
universities, and have frequently been the site of excessive drinking,
sexual assault and hazing. That same lack of oversight, some experts
say, extends to controlling the virus. Even on campuses that are
offering online instruction only, people are still living in some
sorority and fraternity houses.

“Fraternity and sorority homes have long functioned as a kind of ‘no-fly
zone’ for university administrations,” said Matthew W. Hughey, a
professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who has studied
Greek life and social inequality on campuses. “The structure that’s
already been set up makes them harder to control when it comes to the
transmission of disease.”
