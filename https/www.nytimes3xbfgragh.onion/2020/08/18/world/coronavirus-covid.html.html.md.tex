The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/notre-dame-coronavirus.html}{University
of Notre Dame} announced on Tuesday that it would move to online
instruction for at least the next two weeks in an attempt to control a
growing coronavirus outbreak and would shut down the campus entirely if
those measures failed to stop the spread.

``If these steps are not successful, we will have to send students home,
as we did last spring,'' Notre Dame's president, the Rev. John I.
Jenkins, said in a video address to students, noting that he had been
inclined to take that step before consulting with health officials.

The school will also close public spaces on campus and restrict
dormitories to residents.

On Tuesday, the school reported that at least 147 people on campus
\href{https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/}{had tested positive}
since students began returning on Aug. 3 for the start of classes a week
later. Eighty of those confirmed cases were added on Tuesday.

``The virus is a formidable foe,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ``For the past
week, it has been winning.''

On Monday, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill became the
first large university in the country to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/unc-chapel-hill-covid.html}{shut
down classes} after students had returned. The school moved all
undergraduate courses online after 177 students tested positive and
another 349 students were forced to quarantine because of possible
exposure.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/sports/ncaafootball/unc-football-acc-online-classes.html}{U.N.C.},
with 30,000 students, started classes on Aug. 10, the same day that
courses resumed at Notre Dame, a campus of 8,600 students near South
Bend, Ind. Notre Dame tested all of its students before they returned to
campus, with 33 positive results.

On Tuesday, Ithaca College in upstate New York said that it would extend
remote learning through the fall semester, despite initial plans to
bring students back to campus in waves starting this month. In a
\href{https://www.ithaca.edu/news/revised-plan-fall-opening}{statement},
Shirley M. Collado, the president of the college, called the reversal
``an agonizing decision'' but said that ``bringing students here, only
to send them back home, would cause unnecessary disruption in the
continuity of their academic experience.''

Michigan State's president
\href{https://president.msu.edu/communications/messages-statements/2020_community_letters/2020-08-18-plans-change.html}{sent
a letter} Tuesday telling undergraduate students who had planned to live
in campus housing to stay home. He said the university would make all of
its courses available online before school starts in two weeks, with
exceptions for some colleges and graduate students. And Virginia Tech's
president, Tim Sands, sent a letter to students pleading with them to be
responsible or risk outbreaks like those on other campuses.

Across the United States,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/coronavirus-fraternities-sororities.html}{Greek
life has come under particular scrutiny} amid reports of outbreaks at
fraternities and sororities. On Tuesday, health officials in Riley
County, Kan.,
\href{https://www.rileycountyks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1178}{reported
a new outbreak} of cases associated with the Phi Delta Theta fraternity
at Kansas State University --- 13 members tested positive --- and
recommended quarantine for anyone who had been in contact with those
infected.

In the last few days, widely circulated images of young people
congregating without masks near campus in
\href{https://abc3340.com/news/coronavirus/social-media-images-of-lines-outside-tuscaloosa-bars-draws-ire-of-alabamas-ad}{Tuscaloosa,
Ala.,} home of the University of Alabama, and around
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/watch/?v=905235006636836}{Dahlonega,
Ga}., home of the University of North Georgia, have raised concerns
about students' cavalier attitudes to social distancing measures

A
\href{https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2020/08/18/notre-dame-coronavirus-students-positive}{Notre
Dame} spokesman said a significant number of its cases were connected to
two off-campus parties where students, mostly seniors, did not wear
masks or practice social distancing. Most of those who have tested
positive live in off-campus housing, the spokesman, Paul Brown, said.

Both North Carolina and Notre Dame said athletic teams were unaffected.
Notre Dame is ordinarily an independent in football but is planning to
play this fall in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which also counts North
Carolina as a member. Unlike the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/sports/ncaafootball/big-ten-postpones-football-season.html}{Pac-12
and the Big Ten}, the A.C.C. has not yet abandoned its fall season.

Beyond the immediate matter of whether sports like football should be
played this autumn, this week's approach by North Carolina could
ultimately factor into debates over players' rights and whether the
hyphen in ``student-athlete'' might be more properly replaced with
``or.''

``The optics aren't very good, if you take the principle that all
college athletes are students first,'' said Walter Harrison, a former
president of the University of Hartford who once was chairman of the
committee that evolved into the N.C.A.A.'s top governing body.

In virtual addresses leading up to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/roll-call-pass-dnc.html?action=click\&module=Spotlight\&pgtype=Homepage}{the
formal nomination of Joseph R. Biden Jr. for the presidency} on Tuesday
night, the party faithful who spoke on the second night of the
Democratic National Convention expanded the event's focus beyond the
coronavirus crisis.

But while the bulk of the speeches addressed themes like national
security, presidential accountability and continuity between past and
future leaders of the party, the virus still made a few high-profile
cameos:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee} invited Democrats to come to
  his city once the coronavirus crisis had passed. ``Unlike the
  president, we never made fun of face masks,'' he said. ``We understand
  why we can't be together this week, and we hope you do too.''
\item
  \textbf{Former President Bill Clinton} accused President Trump of
  downplaying the virus crisis, and of collapsing under the pressure of
  a real management challenge. ``At a time like this, the Oval Office
  should be a command center,'' he said. ``Instead, it's a storm center.
  There's only chaos. Just one thing never changes --- his determination
  to deny responsibility and shift the blame. The buck never stops
  there.''
\item
  \textbf{Jill Biden}, Mr. Biden's wife and a former high school English
  teacher, expressed heartache over the losses from the coronavirus, as
  well as the frustration and fear it was inspiring among parents of
  schoolchildren. ``Like so many of you, I'm left asking, `How do I keep
  my family safe?''' she said.

  The convention's central event --- its roll call vote --- was
  drastically revamped to accommodate the constraints imposed by the
  pandemic. This year, it consisted of a series of pretaped recordings
  of delegates listing their vote tallies, replacing the iconic and
  photogenic ritual of delegates shouting their state's numbers into a
  hand-held microphone.

Earlier this summer, Trump administration officials hailed a new
strategy for catching coronavirus infections:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-pooled-testing.html}{pooled
testing}.

The decades-old approach combines samples from multiple people to save
time and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-testing-supply-shortage.html}{precious
testing supplies}. Federal health officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci
and Adm. Brett Giroir said pooling would allow for constant surveillance
of large sectors of the community, and said they hoped it would be up
and running nationwide
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/health/coronavirus-pooled-testing.html}{by
the time students returned to school}.

But now, when the nation desperately needs more tests to get a handle on
the virus's spread, this efficient approach has become worthless in many
places, in part because there are simply too many cases to catch.

Pooled testing only works when the vast majority of batches test
negative, among other drawbacks with the procedure. If the proportion of
positives is too high, more pools come up positive --- requiring each
individual sample to then be retested, wasting precious chemicals.

Nebraska's state public health laboratory, for example, was a pooling
trailblazer when it began combining five samples a test in mid-March,
cutting the number of necessary tests by about half.

But the lab was forced to halt its streak on April 27, when local
positivity rates --- the proportion of tests that turn up positive ---
surged past 10 percent. With that many positives, there was little
benefit in pooling.

``It's definitely frustrating,'' said Dr. Baha Abdalhamid, the assistant
director of the laboratory. In combination with physical distancing and
mask wearing, pooling could have helped keep the virus in check, he
added. But the pooling window, for now, has slammed shut.

Still, the strategy has made significant headway in some parts of the
country. In New York, where test positivity rates
\href{https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-covid-19-infection-rate-below-1-percent-tenth-straight-day}{have
held at or below 1 percent since June}, universities, hospitals, private
companies and public health labs are using the technique in a variety of
settings, often to catch people who aren't feeling sick, said Gareth
Rhodes, an aide to the governor and a member of his virus response team.
Last week, the State University of New York was cleared to start
\href{https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-testing-initiatives-improve-covid-19-detection-control-across-new}{combining
up to 25 samples at once}.

Elsewhere in the U.S.:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  More than 43,200 new cases and more than 1,340 new deaths were
  reported across the country on Tuesday. Officials in \textbf{Kentucky}
  reported 19 additional deaths today, a single-day record, for a total
  of 859 deaths in that state since the pandemic began.
\item
  After an outcry over cost-cutting moves at the \textbf{Postal Service}
  that prompted allegations that the Trump administration was trying to
  disenfranchise voters who planned to mail in their ballots for the
  2020 election, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said Tuesday that
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/postal-service-suspends-changes.html}{those
  operational changes would be suspended} until after the 2020 election.
  Mr. DeJoy,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/politics/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy.html}{a
  major donor to President Trump}, said in a
  \href{https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2020/0818-postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-statement.htm}{statement}
  that he was suspending the changes ``to avoid even the appearance of
  any impact on election mail.'' The changes included reducing post
  office hours, removing postal boxes and eliminating overtime for mail
  carriers.
\item
  \textbf{Idaho}, one of the states where new cases peaked this summer,
  is doing
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html}{the
  least amount of testing} in the country necessary to understand and
  contain the virus, according to
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html}{a
  New York Times database}. The United States is testing 52 percent of
  what it should be to slow the spread of the virus, according to
  \href{https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/}{a
  model developed by Harvard researchers}, and Idaho is hitting just 16
  percent of the daily testing it needs to be doing.
\item
  The \textbf{S\&P 500}
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus}{closed
  at a record high on Tuesday,} a remarkable display of investor
  optimism despite an economic decline that has sent unemployment
  soaring. Technology stocks played a big role in the gains, which were
  also fueled by the trillions of dollars pumped into financial markets
  by the Federal Reserve and enormous spending by the government to
  protect American workers and businesses from the worst of the
  downturn.
\item
  Senate Republicans on Tuesday began circulating text of a narrow
  \textbf{coronavirus relief package} that
  would\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/republicans-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html}{revive
  extra unemployment benefits}at half the original rate, shield
  businesses from lawsuits related to the virus and provide funding for
  testing and schools. The draft measure appears to be an effort to
  break through the political stalemate over providing another round of
  economic stimulus to Americans during the pandemic. But it is unlikely
  to alter the debate in Washington, where Democrats have repeatedly
  rejected previous Republican offers as insufficient. The new bill
  would spend less money, in fewer areas, than those earlier offers.
\item
  Covid-19 strike teams
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/health/Covid-nursing-homes.html}{apply

  create bubbles and hold voluntary group workouts} at their team
  facilities beginning in mid-September, the league and its players'
  union announced on Tuesday. The announcement by the league is an
  indication that the N.B.A. has faith in its approach and feels
  comfortable expanding it, even as the pandemic continues to affect

The Australian government has signed a deal with the drugmaker
AstraZeneca to secure a potential coronavirus vaccine, and promised to
offer it free to its 25 million citizens if clinical trials were
successful.

The vaccine,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/world/covid-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{a
partnership between the British-Swedish drug maker and Oxford
University}, is in Phase III clinical trials. As of July, more than
10,000 participants in Britain, Brazil and South Africa had received
doses.

``The Oxford vaccine is one of the most advanced and promising in the
world, and under this deal we have secured early access for every
Australian,'' Prime Minister Scott Morrison
\href{https://www.pm.gov.au/media/new-deal-secures-potential-covid-19-vaccine-every-australian}{said}
in a statement on Wednesday.

He added that the vaccine doses would be manufactured domestically for
its citizens, and that his office was working to secure early access for
countries in Southeast Asia and those in Australia's ``Pacific family.''

Australia has also signed a \$17.9 million deal with the U.S. medical
technology company Becton Dickinson to supply needles and syringes.

Mr. Morrison said that Australia had so far invested \$185 million in
coronavirus vaccines, but did not specify the value of the AstraZeneca
deal. Local news reports have estimated that the country's overall plan
to acquire vaccines would be worth
\href{https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-18/australia-locks-in-oxford-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-deal/12571454}{billions
of dollars}.

The partnership between
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html}{Oxford}
and AstraZeneca is among the most closely watched coronavirus vaccine
efforts in the world. It was also the first to enter Phase III trials,
and several countries --- including Britain and the United States ---
have already agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for a total
of two billion doses even before the vaccine's efficacy has been proven.

On Wednesday, Mr. Morrison cautioned that there was ``no guarantee that
this, or any other, vaccine will be successful,'' and that his
government was casting its net wide to find a vaccine.

Australia has reported 23,773 cases and 438 deaths. A recent outbreak in
Melbourne, the country's second-largest city, led to a lockdown with
some of the toughest restrictions in the world.

GLOBAL ROUNDUP

The Philippines largely reopened for business on Wednesday, against the
advice of some health experts.

The Philippines has nearly 170,000 confirmed coronavirus cases,
including nearly 30,000 that were reported in the past week,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\#countries}{according
to a New York Times database}. Its total caseload is the highest in
Southeast Asia.

Under the rules that took effect on Wednesday, more industries were
allowed to open, limited church services were allowed to resume, and
restaurants welcomed dine-in customers. The rules apply in and around
Manila, the capital, and several outlying provinces, a region that has
been under various stages of lockdown since March.

``Almost all industries will reopen, except for those that attract mass
gatherings'' like amusement parks, said Harry Roque, a spokesman for
President Rodrigo Duterte.

The easing of the lockdown was designed to revive a flagging economy
that has taken a beating from the virus and that has officially slipped
into recession in the second quarter. Mr. Duterte's government has
insisted that the majority of those infected in recent weeks have shown
mild symptoms.

But health experts have warned that lifting lockdowns too quickly would
lead to more cases and deaths. Nearly all of Manila's hospitals are
under severe strain.

``It's really counterintuitive to reopen the economy amidst the steep
rise of cases and the presence of fully loaded hospitals,'' Dr. Anthony
Leachon, a former adviser to Mr. Duterte's government on the pandemic,
said in an interview.

Businesses are caught in the middle, and some are now reopening ---
again --- in desperation.

``We need to survive,'' said Ben Razon, the owner of the Oarhouse
restaurant and bar in central Manila, as he reopened on Wednesday. He
last closed for a lockdown that began on Aug. 3.

Mr. Razon said the restaurant's regular crowd had evaporated in recent
months because of nighttime curfews, forcing him to adjust to daytime
dining.

``I have had to assist my own crew from savings out of my own pocket in
order for us to stay together as a small enterprise and be able to
resume once regular operating hours resume,'' he added. ``In the
meantime, we have to help each other.''

In other developments around the world:

\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Possibly exposed? Don't quarantine and keep working,
Tennessee school districts tell
teachers.}\label{possibly-exposed-dont-quarantine-and-keep-working-tennessee-school-districts-tell-teachers}}

Teachers in at least six Tennessee public school districts who may have
been exposed to coronavirus can be required to teach in person anyway,
under policies approved by their districts.

The districts, located in six counties in eastern and central Tennessee,
are adapting C.D.C. guidelines for essential workers, according to Beth
Brown, president of the Tennessee Education Association, a teachers'
organization. District officials did not immediately respond to messages
seeking comment.

Under C.D.C. guidelines, most people are supposed to go into quarantine
for 14 days after possible exposure. But the school districts say
teachers may be expected to forego quarantine and keep working as long
as they do not show symptoms, provided that ``additional precautions are
implemented to protect them and the community.''

Researchers have found that people who have caught the virus can spread
it before they show symptoms, or without ever developing them.

John C. Bowman, executive director of Professional Educators of
Tennessee, another teachers' organization, said he expected more
districts to adopt the same policies, because of a shortage of
substitute teachers to cover for any who are quarantined. And he said he
expected to see some teachers quit their jobs because of the policies.

``Teachers are afraid,'' Mr. Bowman said. ``You can open up the school
buildings all day long --- that's the easy part. But without healthy
educators and staff available, they're just buildings.''

Some schools in Tennessee have been open for almost three weeks, and a
few have seen virus-related disruptions. In
\href{https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2020/08/09/80-students-quarantined-putnam-county-tn-after-exposure-covid-19/3330778001/}{Putnam
County}, at least 80 students have been quarantined because of a
potential coronavirus exposure, and a middle school and a high school in
Maury County postponed reopening by a few days because teachers were in
quarantine.

The Tennessee Departments of Health and Education issued a joint letter
to school superintendents in the state on Tuesday requiring that school
districts adhere to mandatory measures for ``critical infrastructure''
school staff who have been exposed to the coronavirus. The measures
include wearing a face covering at school, maintaining six feet of
distance from others, and quarantining when not attending school.

With more than 400 shops, the Singapore Changi Airport would be the
fourth-largest mall by the number of tenants if it were in the United
States.

The combination of an often affluent and captive audience has made
airport commercial square footage some of the most lucrative in the
world. But the pandemic has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/business/airport-remodeling-coronavirus-safety.html}{crushed
the commercial calculus at airports}, and no one is sure what comes
next.

The leading airport for concession and retail sales in the United States
is Los Angeles International, with revenue of \$3,036 a square foot,
according to a 2018 report from Airport Experience News. By comparison,
the average mall retailer is around \$325 per square foot, according to
2017 data from CoStar.

But that's all gone now, said Alan Gluck, a senior aviation consultant
at ICF. ``In general, sales are in the toilet,'' he said.

The very amenities that once made airports a standout for profit are the
same things that are proving to be challenging.

So far, the pandemic has not paused terminals planned or in progress in
the United States. Projects already underway, including
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/nyregion/new-la-guardia-airport-terminal.html}{at
La Guardia Airport} in New York and in smaller markets like Lafayette,
La., are moving ahead, but taking a wait-and-see approach on
adjustments.

New terminal construction should focus on space not just for the
coronavirus but other respiratory illnesses, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,
the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.

New terminals needed to allow enough space for people to spread out,
offer high-efficiency particulate air filtration and distribute free
masks. He would also like to see more health screening at airports.

``You can't throw up your hands and say it is impossible,'' Dr. Fauci
said.

The number of known deaths in prisons, jails and other correctional
facilities among prisoners and correctional officers has surpassed
1,000,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html\#clusters}{according
to a New York Times database} tracking deaths in correctional
institutions.

The number of deaths in state and federal prisons, local jails and
immigration detention centers --- which stood at 1,002 on Tuesday
morning --- has increased by about 40 percent during the past six weeks,
according to the database. There have been nearly 160,000 infections
among prisoners and guards.

The actual number of deaths is almost certainly higher because jails and
prisons perform limited testing on inmates, including many facilities
that decline to test prisoners who die after exhibiting symptoms
consistent with the coronavirus.

\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768249}{A
recent study} showed that prisoners are infected at a rate more than
five times the nation's overall rate. The death rate of inmates is also
higher than the national rate --- 39 deaths per 100,000 compared to 29
deaths per 100,000.

The Times's database tracks coronavirus infections and deaths among
inmates and correctional officers at some 2,500 prisons, jails and
immigration detention centers.

The nation's largest known virus cluster is at San Quentin State Prison
in California, where more than 2,600 inmates and guards have been
sickened and 25 inmates have died after a botched
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/us/san-quentin-prison-coronavirus.html}{transfer}
of inmates in May. ``It's the perfect environment for people to die in
--- which people are,'' said Juan Moreno Haines, an inmate at San
Quentin.

country.Credit...Charles Platiau/Reuters

Faced with a recent resurgence of cases, officials in France have made
mask wearing mandatory in business spaces across the country,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/world/europe/france-coronavirus.html}{pleading
with people not to let down their guard} and jeopardize the hard-won
gains made against the virus during a two-month lockdown this spring.

The government on Tuesday announced the mandate for mask wearing in
business spaces, building on mask policies that had been in place.
France ``cannot wait for the health situation to get worse,'' Elisabeth
Borne, the French labor minister,
\href{https://twitter.com/Elisabeth_Borne/status/1295727473448161282}{wrote}
on Twitter. ``With our business partners, we want to take every
precaution to avoid the propagation of the virus, to protect workers and
guarantee the continuity of economic activity.''

The signs of a new wave of infection emerged over the summer as people
began resuming much of their pre-virus lives, traveling across France
and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/world/europe/coronavirus-paris-cafe-reopen-france.html}{socializing
in cafes}, restaurants and parks. Many, especially the young, have
visibly relaxed their vigilance.

In recent days, France has recorded
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/france-coronavirus-cases.html}{about
3,000 new infections every day}, roughly double the figure at the
beginning of the month, and the authorities are investigating an
increasing number of clusters.

Thirty percent of the new infections are in young adults, ages 15 to 44,
according to a
\href{https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-et-traumatismes/maladies-et-infections-respiratoires/infection-a-coronavirus/documents/bulletin-national/covid-19-point-epidemiologique-du-13-aout-2020}{recent
report}. Since they are less likely to develop serious forms of the
illness, deaths and the number of patients in intensive care remain at a
fraction of what they were at the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/world/europe/france-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=6}{height
of the pandemic}. Still, officials are not taking any chances.

    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according

``The indicators are bad, the signals are worrying, and the situation is

Inter} last week. ``The fate of the epidemic is in our hands.''

France has suffered more than
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/france-coronavirus-cases.html}{30,400
deaths from the virus} --- one of the world's worst tolls --- and

from mid-March to mid-May. Thanks to the lockdown, however, France
succeeded in stopping the spread of the virus and lifted most

trend, with

The young people crowded into the pool, standing shoulder to shoulder,
as they listened to a D.J. No one was wearing a mask, and no one seemed
to care.

The scene would be incredible anywhere, but was especially so in this
case. It was in Wuhan, the city in central China where the coronavirus
pandemic began late last year.

A \href{https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1295345558270488577}{series of
photographs and videos} posted by Agence France-Presse captured the
moment on Saturday night, when hundreds of people attended a pool-party
rave that would have been unthinkable only months ago.

The images seemed to touch a nerve in a world where lockdowns remain in
place, where fear of public spaces and entertainment venues remains
high, and where the idea of wading into a public pool is tantalizingly
off limits to millions of people.

It was also another example of how life is slowly returning to normal in
China, even in its hardest-hit city, as other countries --- even those
that coped well with the first wave, like South Korea and New Zealand
--- struggle with new outbreaks.

Shanghai Disneyland
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/business/shanghai-disneyland-reopens.html}{reopened}
in May, while movie theaters reopened across China last month. The
step-by-step return of the country's cultural life has not ignited any
significant new outbreaks, though the government remains extraordinarily
vigilant.

China on Tuesday reported no new locally transmitted cases of the virus
on the mainland for the second consecutive day.

The pool party in Wuhan took place at Maya Beach Water Park in
conjunction with a musical festival at an adjacent amusement park called
Wuhan Happy Valley. They reopened in June, two months after the city's

New York City
\href{https://twitter.com/NYCMayorCounsel/status/1295754462049509377}{will
require that} hotels and short-term rental companies make travelers from
dozens of states fill out forms with their personal information before
they can have access to their rooms, or provide proof they had already
done so, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday. Those travelers were already
\href{https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory}{required
by the state to quarantine for 14 days} and to fill out
\href{https://forms.ny.gov/s3/Welcome-to-New-York-State-Traveler-Health-Form}{the
state's health form}, but the new measure, which goes into effect
Friday, is another attempt at ensuring compliance with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/nyregion/coronavirus-quarantine-nyc.html}{the
rules that many are flouting} in the city.

Both hotels and guests could be subject to fines of up to \$2,000 for
ignoring the rule, according to a spokeswoman for the mayor. People who
had recently traveled to areas outside the city accounted for 15 to 20
percent of cases in the city over the past month, according Dr. Jay
Varma, one of the mayor's health advisers. Mr. de Blasio urged New
Yorkers to avoid traveling to places restricted by New York State unless
it was necessary.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo
\href{https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1295781030457221121}{said
Tuesday that travelers from Alaska and Delaware} will now also be
required to quarantine for 14 days, joining a list of 31 other states as
well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

``If you have a choice in travel, don't go where the problem is,'' Mr.
de Blasio said, adding that ``because, of course, if you go there
there's a chance you bring that disease back.''

New York State's list changes each week, which has forced some college
students to abandon longstanding travel plans and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/nyregion/college-reopening-quarantine-coronavirus.html}{quickly
find accommodations to serve out the quarantine}. More than 59,000
private-college students in New York come from states on the list ****
as of Tuesday, according to the Commission on Independent Colleges and
Universities.

STUDIES ON HIGH-RISK WORK PLACES

Workers in factories, warehouses and building sites are at especially
high risk of infection as American businesses reopen,
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6933e3.htm?s_cid=mm6933e3_w}{according
to a new report from government public health researchers.}

The new analysis, published by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, helps clarify which economic sectors pose the greatest
danger, at a time when states are bracing for a possible new phase of
the epidemic in the fall.

The C.D.C. report, along with two other just-published findings --- one
analyzing Covid-19 hospitalizations, the other deaths --- also sheds
light on racial disparities in the shape and the impact of the U.S.
epidemic.

Black and Latino people were far more likely than non-Hispanic white
people to
\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769369?mc_source=MTExMDY2Ojo6NDc2NmI5NDJmZjI1NGU2MWE3MmI0NzA0MGJlZDg0NTQ6OnYzOjoxNTk3Njg1Mjg0Ojox}{be
hospitalized for Covid-19}, one study found. But ethnicity

not related to the risk of later dying} of the disease, the other study
concluded. Both were posted by the medical journal JAMA.

REMDESIVIR

A large federal study that found an experimental antiviral drug,
remdesivir, can hasten the recovery of hospitalized Covid-19 patients
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/health/Covid-treatments-remdesivir.html}{has
begun a new phase of investigation}.

Researchers will examine whether adding another drug --- beta
interferon, which has already been approved to treat multiple sclerosis
and mainly kills viruses, but can also tame inflammation --- would
improve remdesivir's effects and speed recovery even more.

In a large clinical trial, sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-remdesivir.html}{remdesivir
was shown to modestly shorten recovery time} by four days on average,
but it did not reduce deaths.

RARE IMMUNE SYNDROME

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome**,** the severe illness that strikes
some children with the coronavirus, is distinct from both Kawasaki
disease and from Covid-19 in adults, according to a new study.

Most children infected with the coronavirus have mild symptoms, if any
at all. But on very rare occasions, some develop so-called MIS-C,
characterized by widespread inflammation in the heart, lungs, brain,
skin and other organs. In the United States, there were 570 confirmed
cases of the syndrome and 10 deaths as of Aug. 6.

The study,
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1054-6}{published
Tuesday} in Nature Medicine, analyzed immune cells in 15 boys and 10
girls, aged 7 to 14 years, with the syndrome.

When the children were acutely ill with MIS-C, their immune cells
behaved differently than they did in adults with Covid-19. The pattern
also differs from that seen in Kawasaki disease, a similarly rare
inflammatory condition in young children.

As of Aug. 3, children account for 7.3 percent of U.S. coronavirus
cases, but make up about 22 percent of the overall population. The
actual proportion of infected children is likely to be higher, because
testing is still focused primarily on adults with symptoms.

Idaho, one of the states where new cases peaked this summer, is doing
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html}{the
least amount of testing} in the country necessary to understand and
contain the virus across the state, according to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html}{a
New York Times database}. Testing is critical to reducing the spread of
the virus.

\href{https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/}{Harvard
researchers} developed a formula to determine how many daily tests a
specific state should be doing to slow the spread of the virus. The
researchers said that, at the very least, there should be enough daily
tests to assess anyone with flulike symptoms, plus an additional 10
people for any symptomatic person who tests positive.

The United States is testing only 52 percent of what it should be to
slow the spread of the virus, according to the Harvard model, and Idaho
is hitting just 16 percent of the daily testing it needs to be doing.
The state also has a 16 percent positivity rate, and the
\href{https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/07/07/why-arizonas-percent-positive-tests-highest-country/5386600002/}{World
Health Organization has said} a positivity rate has to be under 5
percent for at least two weeks to signal that a spread is under control.
(That figure is based on the assumption that the state or region is
meeting their testing target.)

Idaho is also among the states that have reported the highest number of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{new
cases per 100,000 people} over the past seven days, even as the number
of new cases there has slowed.

The state's response to the virus, led by Gov. Brad Little, a
Republican, came under fire in the
\href{https://www.idahostatesman.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/words-deeds/article241471176.html}{earliest
days of the pandemic} for
\href{https://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/editorials/article241458021.html}{not
doing enough} to stop the spread of the virus. In late March, Idaho saw
an average of about 16 new cases a day, compared with the current
average, over a seven-day period, of more than 400 a day. Idahoans were
told on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html}{March
25 to stay at home}, and the state started reopening in phases on May 1.

But cases started to mount in mid-June, as happened across several
states. The
\href{https://www.idahostatesman.com/article244586032.html}{amount of
testing in Idaho has increased since the onset of the virus, but delays
in getting results have hurt efforts to contain the spread}.

Walmart, but forces job cuts at
Boeing.}\label{americans-homebound-reality-rewards-big-retailers-like-walmart-but-forces-job-cuts-at-boeing}}

The radical disruptions in the rhythms of American life caused by the
pandemic continued to ripple through the business world this week, with
big retailers like Walmart and Home Depot reporting booming sales, and
aerospace giant Boeing planning further job cuts as the airline industry
continues to suffer.

Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, saw its second-quarter sales
rise 9.3 percent, driven by continuing strong demand for food and
general merchandise, the company reported Tuesday. The company's
e-commerce sales alone grew 97 percent, more than double what the
company had been averaging in recent years. And despite rising costs
related to the pandemic, the retailer also generated
larger-than-expected profit.

It was one of the clearest signs of the consolidation in the retail
industry triggered by the pandemic, as many other retailers have
struggled or failed in recent months.

Homeowners with time on their hands for renovations appear to have also
given a boost to Home Depot, where
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\#home-depot-reports-surge-in-second-quarter-sales}{same-store
sales rose} more than 23 percent in the quarter from May to July. The
home-improvement and hardware retailer also saw an increase in profits,
earning \$4.3 billion in the second quarter compared with \$3.5 billion
during the same period last year.

But a homebound nation continues to cause trouble for the commercial air
industry. On Monday, Boeing's chief executive said that the company
would offer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus\#boeing-is-planning-deeper-job-cuts-ceo-says}{a
second round of buyouts}, adding to the 10 percent cut the company
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/business/boeing-layoffs-coronavirus.html}{announced
in April}.

Mr. Calhoun did not specify how many jobs Boeing was hoping to cut. The
new buyouts will help limit involuntary layoffs and will be offered to
employees who work in parts of the company most affected by the
pandemic, like Boeing's commercial airplane and services businesses.

While recent federal data shows air travel is recovering again after
stalling in July, the number of people flying each day is still less
than a third of what it was a year ago. Industry executives expect that
figure to remain depressed until a coronavirus vaccine is widely
available.

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, officials
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/unc-chapel-hill-covid.html}{abruptly
called off in-person classes on Monday} after identifying four clusters
in student housing facilities, including one at the Sigma Nu fraternity.

The New York Times has identified
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/coronavirus-fraternities-sororities.html}{at
least 251 cases of the virus tied to fraternities and sororities} at
colleges and universities across the United States.

At the University of California, Berkeley, 47 cases were identified in a
single week in early July, most of which were connected to the Greek
system. In Mississippi, a significant outbreak in Oxford, home to the
state's flagship university, was partially blamed on fraternity parties.
At the University of Washington's Seattle campus, at least 165 of the
290 cases identified by the school have been associated with its Greek
Row.

As students return to campus, there have been virus outbreaks at
residence halls and other university housing as well. More than 13,000
students, faculty and staff members at colleges have been infected with
the coronavirus, according to a Times database of cases confirmed by
schools and government agencies.

But fraternities and sororities have been especially challenging for
universities to regulate. Though they dominate social life on many
campuses, their houses are often not owned or governed by the
universities, and have frequently been the site of excessive drinking,
sexual assault and hazing. That same lack of oversight, some experts
say, extends to controlling the virus. Even on campuses that are
offering online instruction only, people are still living in some
sorority and fraternity houses.

``Fraternity and sorority homes have long functioned as a kind of
`no-fly zone' for university administrations,'' said Matthew W. Hughey,
a professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who has
studied Greek life and social inequality on campuses. ``The structure
that's already been set up makes them harder to control when it comes to
the transmission of disease.''
