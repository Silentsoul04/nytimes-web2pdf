A fishing vessel that left Seattle in May returned with an unexpected
catch: the first direct evidence in humans that antibodies to the
coronavirus can thwart infection.

More than a hundred crew members aboard the American Dynasty were
stricken by the infection over 18 days at sea. But three sailors [who
initially carried antibodies remained
virus-free,](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20173161v1)
according to a new report.

Although the study is small, it addresses one of the most important
questions in the pandemic: whether the immune response to one bout with
the virus protects against reinfection.

“Knowing the answer to this question is critical for vaccine design and
epidemiology,” [tweeted Jesse
Bloom](https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1294378351809855490), an
evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle and one of the study’s authors.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The study was posted online last week and has not yet been published in
a peer-reviewed journal. Still, the finding set off optimistic chatter
among scientists, who have been relying on monkey studies for evidence
of antibodies’ potency.

“I thought it was very exciting — good enough news that I was telling my
family about it,” said Michal Tal, an immunologist at Stanford
University who was not involved in the work.

Several research teams have reported that an encounter with the virus
triggers a robust immune response in most people, including in those who
may have been only mildly ill. And the vaccine candidates now in trials
also seem to elicit strong neutralizing antibodies, the kind that can
block the
virus.

But the amount of those antibodies needed to prevent the virus from
returning is unclear. Scientists measure neutralizing antibodies in
titers, an indication of their concentration in the blood.

The three sailors who remained protected from the virus had widely
varying titers; two had only moderate quantities, a finding the
researchers said was reassuring.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“People have been so worried about the titers, and the titers going
down,” Dr. Alexander Greninger, a virologist at the University of
Washington in Seattle, said.

The results indicate even moderate titers prevented reinfection in a
situation in which exposure to the virus was high, he said: “These are
attainable titers, right? Hopefully, it’ll be helpful to see, and makes
make me very optimistic about the vaccines.”

The American Dynasty carried 113 men and nine women. All crew members
had been tested for both virus and antibodies as part of a routine
screening before setting sail. (The researchers did not have access to
the results from two members.)

The trawler returned to shore after 18 days at sea when a crew member
became ill enough to need hospitalization. The sailors were tested for
the presence of virus and antibodies again and for up to 50 days after
their return.

The three sailors confirmed to have neutralizing antibodies did not test
positive for the virus during the course of the study; 103 of the
remaining 117 became infected.

These numbers may be small, but they’re highly significant, Dr.
Greninger said.

“A lot of people, when they see this are like, ‘Oh come on, it could be
due to random chance,’” he said. In fact, the likelihood that the
results are just chance is extremely low, he
added.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Other experts agreed. “Just looking at the numbers, it becomes clear
that it’s unlikely that all of these three people were protected by
chance,” said Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Krammer and his colleagues are tracking antibody levels in people
who have recovered from the coronavirus once to see at what point they
might be vulnerable to reinfection. The team began with people in New
York, but the virus is circulating at such low levels in the city now
that Dr. Krammer and his colleagues have had to expand the study to
other locations.

Data from vaccine trials also will identify the antibody titers required
to disarm the virus. But in the meantime, “this is the first evidence in
humans,” Dr. Krammer said. “It made my weekend.”

The study raised other questions. Based on the Abbott Architect assay,
six of the 120 people tested before the boat’s departure had antibodies
to the virus indicating prior exposure.

But when the researchers reanalyzed those samples using more
sophisticated tests, only three of the six were confirmed to have
antibodies, suggesting that three test results were false positives.

The Abbott test is advertised as returning fewer than one false positive
for every 100 samples. “That’s a little concerning that the Abbott may
be a little less specific than we thought,” Dr. Tal said.

The researchers also looked at antibodies in the blood, as most teams
