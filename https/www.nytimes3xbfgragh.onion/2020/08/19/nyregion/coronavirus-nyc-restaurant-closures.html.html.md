# Final Meals at Closing Restaurants: ‘I Will Dream of Those Dumplings’

New Yorkers, losing their favorite spots because of the pandemic, are
returning for one last burger, one more bowl of ramen.

[Bar Sardine](https://www.barsardinenyc.com/), a cozy bistro in
Manhattan’s West Village, has been Maggie Kennelly’s go-to spot since
she moved to New York three years ago. It’s where she introduced her
boyfriend to her father for the first time. It’s where she and her
friends always went for Sunday brunch, sitting at “the sunny booth” by
the large windows.

One day, while waiting for a table, she was able to take a peek at the
host’s tablet, where there were some notes about her in the reservation
system. “It said, ‘She’s very friendly, she likes hugs, her boyfriend
lives in Chicago, and she’s trying to get him to move,’” she recalled,
laughing. “I guess I’m a regular.”

Last week, Maggie Kennelly had her final meal at Bar Sardine. The
restaurant announced that it would be closing at the end of August.

She ordered the usual: a Fedora burger and fries. One of the waiters
brought over Champagne to mark the occasion. For over two hours that
night, she and her boyfriend savored their last dinner at
Sardine.

Ms. Kennelly is one of many New Yorkers saying goodbye to their favorite
restaurants, about [1,200 of which have
closed](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/comptroller-stringer-proposes-save-main-street-initiative-for-small-businesses-fighting-for-survival/)
since March 1, according to a new report from the city. Many of these
places have been staples to New Yorkers for decades, like [La
Caridad 78](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/dining/la-caridad-78-closes.html),
the Cuban-Chinese diner on the Upper West Side, or [the Cupping Room
Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBlInSpjQW7/) in SoHo. Some shut down
for the pandemic and simply never opened again. Others re-emerged for a
short time over the summer, giving outdoor dining a shot — and a chance
for their most loyal customers to say goodbye — before throwing in the
towel.

And while the final meal is an occasion to cherish, it’s also just sad.

“It’s very morbid,” said Gabi Levy, about the final days of [Bali
Kitchen](https://www.balikitchennyc.com/), an Indonesian restaurant in
the East Village that will close for good at the end of
August.

Ms. Levy, 28, was introduced to Bali Kitchen a year and a half ago on
her birthday, when she tried mie goreng, a fried noodle dish, and beef
rendang, a spicy stew, for the first time. “It’s cooked overnight for
sometimes two days, and once it is settled, it is refried in coconut oil
and milk,” she said of the stew. “It blew my mind.” She loved the food
so much she took a cooking class with the owner. A few times during the
shutdown this spring she took an Uber from her apartment in Harlem down
to the small restaurant on East 4th Street to get takeout.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since she found out about Bali Kitchen’s imminent closing, she’s gone
there three times. But the experience has been different.

Although the restaurant stopped regular service on Aug. 1, it has opened
every weekend since, offering improvisational meals, presumably made
with what’s left in the kitchen. “We can’t really order our favorite
foods because he is trying to get rid of all the leftover stocks, so the
only dish you can buy is a hodgepodge of everything on the menu,” Ms.
Levy said.

But her loyalty is unwavering. “If they put 17 things in front of me,”
she said, “I’ll buy all of them.”

Ms. Levy also feels like this is one of her last chances to eat
Indonesian food, as restaurants like Bali Kitchen are becoming harder to
find in the city these days, she said. “It’s not like sushi where you
can just go somewhere else.”

Some restaurants actually experienced an uptick in business after
announcing their closures.

[88 Lan Zhou](https://www.instagram.com/88lanzhou/), a famed dumpling
restaurant in Manhattan’s Chinatown, was supposed to close on Aug. 15.
But when it stopped customer service, it continued to sell its frozen
dumplings — a bag of 50 costs $14. Sales were so successful that the
restaurant announced on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDxcFdAjU3I/) last week that it
was pushing back its closing
date.

Andrea Glass, 23, a graduate student in fashion marketing, has been

can help support them through this difficult time,” she said. “I have
been trying to fight myself to not eat them for every meal.”

Even New Yorkers who have moved away are returning to say goodbye to
their favorite restaurants.

Matthew Kepnes, a travel writer, remembers the day, seven years ago,
when he discovered [Yuba](https://www.yubarestaurant.com/), a no-frills
sushi place in the East Village. “It was 5 o’clock, and it was way too
early for dinner, but I was hungry,” he said. “The restaurant was just
opening, so I went in, sat down,” he recalled. He ordered a crab roll
with jalapeños and lemon. “I was like, ‘Wow, this is really good.’”

From that moment on, Yuba was his place. “I hated my roommate, so
whenever I needed to get out of the house I would go and chill for a
couple of hours and read a book,” said Mr. Kepnes, 39. “I became
Facebook friends with the owner. They know my order. It was never full
for me, they would always find a spot.” He went at least three times a
week, he said.

In late July, Mr. Kepnes, who now lives in Austin, Tex., passed through
New York on a work trip (he had been in Massachusetts before so he
didn’t have to quarantine). One of his first stops was to Yuba, which
had recently announced it would be closing on Aug. 14.

“It was a stroke of luck that I happened to be back before they closed,”
he said. “I would have been really, really sad.”

Fellow restaurateurs, too, are making their own pilgrimages.

Jamie Erickson, 37, who runs a catering company and cafe called
[Poppy’s](https://www.poppyscatering.com/), made sure to stop by [the
Good Fork](https://www.goodfork.com/), a restaurant in Red Hook,
Brooklyn, run by the chef and cookbook author Sohui Kim, on its last day
of service.

“I took a walk down Van Brunt Street with my daughter in the stroller
and enjoyed Sohui’s famous pork-and-chive dumplings, and crispy tofu
with kimchi and fried eggs,” she said.

“I will dream of those dumplings.”
