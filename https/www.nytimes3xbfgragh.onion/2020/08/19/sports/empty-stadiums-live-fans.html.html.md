Live sports are back. Live fans are (mostly) not.

You can catch some spectators projected digitally at N.B.A. games or
cardboard cutouts “seated” in Major League Baseball stadiums. But it’s
not the same.

The echoing “DEE-FENSE” chant can’t be heard in arenas or on TV
broadcasts. Players don’t hear the roar for a home run, and there is no
chest-pounding for thousands of adoring fans.

As live sports began returning in the United States, The New York Times
asked sports fans to share what they missed about going to games.
Responses were both wistful and hopeful.

Readers said they longed for the simple pleasure of a minor league
baseball game with family and the euphoria of witnessing a hometown team
advance to the playoffs. Many expressed hope that it would someday feel
normal again to hug strangers after a sweet victory or a devastating
defeat.

## The Whole City Believed in the Team

After over seven innings of palpable tension and despair in the crowd,
[Juan Soto’s base-clearing
hit](https://www.mlb.com/video/soto-s-hit-clears-bases-for-lead) to give
the Nationals the lead against the Milwaukee Brewers in their National
League wild-card game last year was like throwing a Molotov cocktail
into a fireworks factory.

I’ve never been so elated at a game, and I’ve never seen a crowd go as
crazy as the Nationals fans did that night. I still rewatch Soto’s hit
and still can’t believe that the Nationals won that night, let alone the
World Series a few weeks later. I can’t imagine a moment like that
having the same impact without the 40,000 people there experiencing the
same emotions.

Everyone was chanting “Beat L.A.” as we left the ballpark. It felt like
the whole city believed in the team.

## Missing Hoarse Voices and 60,000 Fans

In late January, my 9-year-old son and I attended the San Francisco
49ers’ N.F.C. championship game, which led them to the Super Bowl. We
had the most amazing time and we did not sit down for a single defensive
play as the 49ers dominated the Green Bay Packers.

We woke up the next morning with hoarse, raspy voices from screaming and
cheering. It’s hard to believe now that earlier this year we were
closely packed in with more than 60,000 people and not remotely
concerned.

Before I had children, I worked in the front office of two Major League
Baseball teams. Fans in attendance, both from my personal and past
professional experiences, are a huge part of the game. I miss sports
with all my heart … from my son’s Little League team to the San
Francisco Giants’ season.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak

#### Sports and the Virus

Updated Aug. 20, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - While live sports are back, spectators are not in most cases.
        [Readers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/sports/empty-stadiums-live-fans.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup)
        comment on what they were missing as fans in the stands.
      - The Canadian Football League [became the latest
        casualty](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/sports/cfl-season-canceled.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup)
        of the pandemic, canceling its 2020 season after repeated
        efforts to play an abbreviated schedule fell through.
      - The United States Open tennis tournament will have the weakest
        women’s field in its history after second-ranked [Simona Halep
        withdrew](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/sports/tennis/us-open-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup).

I wish I had recorded more of the crowd reaction: Kids cheering at the
fireworks, crisp high-fives between strangers, grown men gruffly
embracing each other and pretending not to notice the tears.

Watching the truncated 60-game season in 2020 is both comforting and
alienating. Elvis Andrus is still at shortstop and Eric Nadel still
calls the games on the radio, but who will cheer and high-five and hug
and cry if the Rangers make it all the way?

## Missing Getting Off Work to Check for Tickets

I took this photo on Nov. 22 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn when the
Nets were playing the Sacramento Kings. One of my good friends is a
Kings fan, and as a Los Angeles Lakers fan I went to boo the Kings\!
*(Editor’s note: The Nets won, 116-97.)*

I love going to sports events at Barclays. You can get great seats for
some games on resale apps, and the energy, food and entertainment are
amazing.

Even though the bubble is happening, as a fan you don’t feel the same
energy of a close game at the arena. At Barclays, I even got to see one
of my students perform with the Brooklyn Nets Beats Drumline.

I also think of the workers and other entertainers at live sporting
events and how this option for them has disappeared. I’m rooting for the
Lakers in the bubble, but I definitely wish it was live, so fans, and
even spectators on TV, could feel the energy.

## A Poignant Win in Person

The last athletic event I attended was the 2019 Iron Bowl. Auburn won,
48-45, against Alabama in front of a home crowd.

As an Auburn graduate, it was a thrilling victory, but it was also
especially poignant in that it was the last game I went to with my
mother, who found out in September that she had peritoneal mesothelioma.
She would later pass away in February.

This particular game will always hold a special place in my heart, not
because of the awesome win, but because it was one of the last times I
felt normal with my family.

## Unbridled Joy

As a lifelong fan this — the day the Philadelphia Eagles won their first
Super Bowl — was the greatest day of my life. The relief, the disbelief,
the unbridled joy, the absolute ecstasy is completely unmatched. Being
able to be there in person was beyond words.

And yet a perfectly turned double play, the excitement of someone
stealing home or Ray Allen’s perfect jump shot all elicit the exact same
feeling, just in a much smaller dose.

That feeling, the community of fans, and enjoying it all with family are
what make sports so magical.

## An Atmosphere That Can’t Be Emulated

Starting in 2019, my two friends and I began an annual reunion where we
meet at a city of our choosing to watch a Major League Soccer game. The
first was in Seattle in April 2019, when the Seattle Sounders faced Real
Salt Lake. Seeing the north end supporters’ group drumming, clapping and
singing gave me goose bumps.

Seeing soccer games pick back up in Germany is great, but the atmosphere
that supporters’ groups bring to the stadium can’t be emulated.

I’m hopeful I’ll be able to see this in full swing before long.
