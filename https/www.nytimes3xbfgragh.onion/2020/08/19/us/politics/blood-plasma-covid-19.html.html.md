WASHINGTON — Last week, just as the Food and Drug Administration was
preparing to issue an emergency authorization for blood plasma as a
Covid-19 treatment, a group of top federal health officials including
Dr. Francis S. Collins and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci intervened, arguing that
emerging data on the treatment was too weak, according to two senior
administration officials.

The authorization is on hold for now as more data is reviewed, according
to H. Clifford Lane, the clinical director at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases. An emergency approval could still be
issued in the near future, he said.

Donated by people who have survived the disease, antibody-rich plasma is
considered safe. President Trump has hailed it as a “beautiful
ingredient” in the veins of people who have survived Covid-19.

But [clinical trials have not
proved](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/trump-plasma.html)
whether plasma can help people fighting the coronavirus.

Several top health officials — led by Dr. Collins, the director of the
National Institutes of Health; Dr. Fauci, the government’s top
infectious disease expert; and Dr. Lane — urged their colleagues last
week to hold off, citing [recent
data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359v1)
from the country’s largest plasma study, run by the Mayo Clinic. They
thought the study’s data to date was not strong enough to warrant an
emergency approval.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The three of us are pretty aligned on the importance of robust data
through randomized control trials, and that a pandemic does not change
that,” Dr. Lane said in an interview on Tuesday.

The drafted emergency authorization leaned on the history of plasma’s
use in other disease outbreaks and on animal research and a spate of
plasma studies, including the [Mayo Clinic’s
program](https://www.uscovidplasma.org/), which has given infusions to
more than 66,000 Covid-19 patients thanks to financing from the federal
government.

An F.D.A. spokeswoman declined to comment, but Mr. Trump reacted
angrily, suggesting the decision was politically
motivated.

“You have a lot of people over there who don’t want to rush things
because they want to do it after November 3,” he said referring to
Election Day, as he proclaimed without evidence that convalescent plasma
helped “way over 50 percent” of Covid-19 patients infused with it.

Plasma, the pale yellow liquid leftover after blood is stripped of its
red and white cells, has been the subject of [months of intense
enthusiasm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/trump-plasma.html)
from scientists, celebrities and Mr. Trump, part of the administration’s
push for coronavirus treatments as a stopgap while pharmaceutical
companies race to complete dozens of clinical trials for coronavirus
vaccines.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Emergency authorizations, which do not require the same level of
evidence as a full F.D.A. approval would, have been a fraught subject
for the government during the pandemic. The agency gave one to the
malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine only to [rescind it
months
later](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html)
after the drugs were found to be ineffective against the coronavirus,
and potentially harmful. An emergency authorization for blood plasma
would most likely ease the clerical burdens on hospitals in conducting
infusions.

Senior health officials have privately expressed concern about the rapid
growth of the Mayo program and the perceived rush to declare plasma
effective without the affirmation of results from randomized trials,
which scientists have long relied on as the gold standard of evidence.
Skyrocketing enrollment in the program has prompted a debate among
researchers about what kind of empirical certainty is needed in treating
patients in a public health emergency.

An emergency approval now would “change the way people view trials,”
said Dr. Mila B. Ortigoza, an infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U.
Langone Health who started a trial with colleagues at Montefiore Medical
Center.

“We want to make sure that when we say it works, we are confident, with
indisputable evidence,” she said. “We’re dealing with patients’ lives
here.”

Unlike the malaria drugs, plasma, which has been used [since
the 1890s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4781783/) to
treat infectious diseases, has earned the attention of a highly
credentialed community of microbiologists and immunologists eager to
prove its usefulness. The Mayo Clinic has already published analysis on
tens of thousands of patients in its expanded access program showing
that plasma is safe.

The most recent [batch of
data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359v1)from
the program included more than 35,000 Covid-19 patients, many of them in
intensive care and on ventilators, and suggested that plasma
administered within three days of a diagnosis reduced mortality rates.
When calculated a month after the infusions, the death rate of patients
who received plasma within three days of diagnosis was lower (21.6
percent) than it was for those who received plasma later (26.7 percent).

But the study did not have a control group of patients given a placebo
to compare with those given plasma, making it difficult for scientists
to assess whether the treatment really worked. And given the limited
supply of plasma, it is not clear how realistic treating patients within
three days of diagnosis would be.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The program’s enrollment has surged to more than 30 times as high as
initially expected, complicating the ability of scientists to recruit
sick patients to randomized trials.

It “ballooned to a degree that, you know, is becoming unmanageable,” Dr.
Lane said.

Statisticians at the F.D.A. are now examining the Mayo data to better
understand what factors other than the treatment might have influenced
patient responses, such as higher-quality care in the hospital, Dr. Lane
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

A research team from Houston Methodist hospitals also [published
preliminary
results](https://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002-9440\(20\)30370-9/fulltext)
from a plasma trial last week. Their study of hospitalized Covid-19
patients in the American Journal of Pathology reported that a group of
136 patients who received the treatment were more likely to be alive
four weeks later compared with 251 patients who did not receive it. That
study found a statistically significant benefit only when patients were
treated within three days of admission and when the plasma contained a
high concentration of antibodies.

The Houston study was not randomized, meaning that all of the patients
enrolled received the treatment and none received a placebo. (The
researchers later compared their outcomes to records from other Covid-19
patients who were not in the study but were matched to be similar to
them.)

A surge in cases in Texas this summer quickly brought the hospital
system to its enrollment cap, and doctors there have not been able to
provide the experimental treatment since mid-July. If the F.D.A. gave an
emergency authorization, doctors at the hospital could possibly begin
administering it again, said Dr. Eric Salazar, the study’s principal
investigator.

But an emergency authorization could have the unintended effect of
[making it harder for rigorous clinical
trials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/trump-plasma.html)
to definitively show whether plasma works. Scientists have struggled to
recruit patients for randomized trials, as many patients and their
doctors — knowing they could get the treatment under the Mayo program —
have been unwilling to risk receiving a placebo.

Last month, one such [trial in the
Netherlands](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.20139857v1)
was stopped when researchers realized that patients given plasma showed
no difference in mortality, length of hospital stay or disease severity
compared with those given a placebo. Most of the patients had already
developed their own antibodies by the time they entered the study, the
researchers noted.

At least 10 randomized trials in the United States have collectively
enrolled only a few hundred people. They have also been stymied by the
waning of the virus outbreak in many cities, complicating the ability of
researchers to recruit sick people. Dr. Collins has encouraged a
strategy of pooling the results from randomized trials, an idea that has
met resistance from some researchers.

Dr. R. Scott Wright, who is helping oversee the Mayo Clinic’s plasma
program, was an early proponent of conducting randomized trials. But he
said in a recent interview that the mechanics of setting up large
studies were complicated by early shortages of plasma, coordination via
videoconference calls and the difficulty of predicting where the virus
would spread next.

If the F.D.A. does grant the emergency authorization, it could make it
even harder to get answers, said Dr. Ortigoza of N.Y.U.

“We will keep going, because we’re in desperate need of a randomized
placebo-controlled trial for convalescent plasma,” she said. “This is
something our country and the world really needs right now.”

Noah Weiland and Sharon LaFraniere reported from Washington, and Sheri
Fink from Houston. Katie Thomas contributed reporting from Chicago.
