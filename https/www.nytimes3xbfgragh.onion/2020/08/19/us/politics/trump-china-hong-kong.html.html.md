WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday suspended or
terminated three bilateral agreements with Hong Kong related to
extradition and tax exemptions, the latest in a series of measures that
escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing.

The move comes after President Trump signed an executive order last
month ending the special status that the United States granted Hong Kong
in diplomatic and trade relations.

The administration has sought to punish China for its attempts to stifle
political dissent in the former British territory. China announced in
June that it was imposing a [national security law in Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html)
to grant security agencies expansive powers, giving Beijing sweeping
authority to crack down on a variety of political actions.

“The Chinese Communist Party chose to crush the freedoms and autonomy of
the people of Hong Kong,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1296126420922634244).
“Because of the CCP’s actions, we are terminating or suspending three
of our bilateral agreements with the territory.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The three agreements cover the transfer of fugitives and convicted
prisoners. They also apply to reciprocal tax exemptions on income from
international shipping, the department said.

In recent months, the Trump administration has taken a series of
financial, diplomatic and technological measures against China, which
experts say is causing relations between the two countries to reach new
lows.

“It’s actually a remarkable set of developments,” said Dali L. Yang, a
political scientist from the University of Chicago. “What we see here is
truly a tug of war in terms of mutual actions against each other.”

In early August, the Trump administration [imposed
sanctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/world/asia/trump-china-hong-kong-sanctions.html)
on Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 other senior
officials in Hong Kong and mainland China over their roles in cracking
down on political dissent.

A day before that, Mr. Trump [signed two executive
orders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html)
barring American residents and corporations from making any transactions
with the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps within 45 days. The orders
cited national security concerns, saying the services do not keep user
data private. Mr. Trump has since given ByteDance, the Chinese owner of
TikTok, [until November to
divest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/business/tiktok-trump-bytedance-order.html)
from its American assets and any data that TikTok had gathered in the
United States.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In early July, the administration [imposed
sanctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/world/asia/trump-china-sanctions-uighurs.html)
on senior Chinese officials, including a member of the Communist Party’s
ruling Politburo, over human rights abuses against the largely Muslim
Uighur ethnic minority in the Xinjiang region.

American officials have also [shut
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html)
the Chinese Consulate in Houston, citing economic espionage efforts by
diplomats to steal scientific research. Some students affiliated with
Chinese military institutions have been banned from traveling to the
United States.

The Trump administration has also imposed visa restrictions on Chinese
journalists in the United States, effectively expelling dozens of them.
In return, Beijing has taken harsh actions on American journalists,
including expelling employees of The New York Times, The Wall Street
Journal and The Washington Post.

The steady drumbeat of measures against China is in line with a core
part of Mr. Trump’s campaign strategy. Political strategists seek to
show the president as tough on the country, to shift the national
conversation from his [failures on managing the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/coronavirus-us.html)
and the economy.

Mr. Trump has previously been [reluctant to strike a hard
stance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/us/politics/bolton-book-trump-impeached.html)
against China during his time in office. Aside from starting a trade war
with the country in 2018, he has repeatedly praised the Chinese leader,
Xi Jinping, even asking Mr. Xi for help in his re-election efforts.

But some China experts say [the two
nations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/asia/us-china-trump-xi.html)
are on a path for long-term confrontation, which may continue even if
the Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr., wins the election in November.

“Some of the actions may be hard to undo,” Mr. Yang said. “We see two
juggernauts getting more antagonistic toward each other.”
