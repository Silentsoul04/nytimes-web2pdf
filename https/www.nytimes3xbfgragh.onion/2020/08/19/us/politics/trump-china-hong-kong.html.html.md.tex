The actions are part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to
punish China for its attempts to stifle political dissent in Hong Kong.

WASHINGTON --- The Trump administration on Wednesday suspended or
terminated three bilateral agreements with Hong Kong related to
extradition and tax exemptions, the latest in a series of measures that
escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing.

The move comes after President Trump signed an executive order last
month ending the special status that the United States granted Hong Kong
in diplomatic and trade relations.

The administration has sought to punish China for its attempts to stifle
political dissent in the former British territory. China announced in
June that it was imposing a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html}{national
security law in Hong Kong} to grant security agencies expansive powers,
giving Beijing sweeping authority to crack down on a variety of
political actions.

``The Chinese Communist Party chose to crush the freedoms and autonomy
of the people of Hong Kong,'' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
\href{https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1296126420922634244}{said on
Twitter}. ``Because of the CCP's actions, we are terminating or
suspending three of our bilateral agreements with the territory.''

The three agreements cover the transfer of fugitives and convicted
prisoners. They also apply to reciprocal tax exemptions on income from
international shipping, the department said.

In recent months, the Trump administration has taken a series of
financial, diplomatic and technological measures against China, which
experts say is causing relations between the two countries to reach new
lows.

``It's actually a remarkable set of developments,'' said Dali L. Yang, a
political scientist from the University of Chicago. ``What we see here
is truly a tug of war in terms of mutual actions against each other.''

In early August, the Trump administration
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/world/asia/trump-china-hong-kong-sanctions.html}{imposed
sanctions} on Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 other
senior officials in Hong Kong and mainland China over their roles in
cracking down on political dissent.

A day before that, Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html}{signed
two executive orders} barring American residents and corporations from
making any transactions with the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps
within 45 days. The orders cited national security concerns, saying the
services do not keep user data private. Mr. Trump has since given
ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/business/tiktok-trump-bytedance-order.html}{until
November to divest} from its American assets and any data that TikTok
had gathered in the United States.

In early July, the administration
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/world/asia/trump-china-sanctions-uighurs.html}{imposed
sanctions} on senior Chinese officials, including a member of the
Communist Party's ruling Politburo, over human rights abuses against the
largely Muslim Uighur ethnic minority in the Xinjiang region.

American officials have also
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html}{shut
down} the Chinese Consulate in Houston, citing economic espionage
efforts by diplomats to steal scientific research. Some students
affiliated with Chinese military institutions have been banned from
traveling to the United States.

The Trump administration has also imposed visa restrictions on Chinese
journalists in the United States, effectively expelling dozens of them.
In return, Beijing has taken harsh actions on American journalists,
including expelling employees of The New York Times, The Wall Street
Journal and The Washington Post.

The steady drumbeat of measures against China is in line with a core
part of Mr. Trump's campaign strategy. Political strategists seek to
show the president as tough on the country, to shift the national
conversation from his
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/coronavirus-us.html}{failures
on managing the pandemic} and the economy.

Mr. Trump has previously been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/us/politics/bolton-book-trump-impeached.html}{reluctant
to strike a hard stance} against China during his time in office. Aside
from starting a trade war with the country in 2018, he has repeatedly
praised the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, even asking Mr. Xi for help in
his re-election efforts.

But some China experts say
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/world/asia/us-china-trump-xi.html}{the
two nations} are on a path for long-term confrontation, which may
continue even if the Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr., wins the election in November.

``Some of the actions may be hard to undo,'' Mr. Yang said. ``We see two
juggernauts getting more antagonistic toward each other.''
