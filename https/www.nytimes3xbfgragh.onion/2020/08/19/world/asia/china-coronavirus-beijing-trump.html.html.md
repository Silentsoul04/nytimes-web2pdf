# Local Officials in China Hid Coronavirus Dangers From Beijing, U.S. Agencies Find

A new U.S. intelligence report says top officials in Beijing were in the

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — Trump administration officials have tried taking a
political sledgehammer to China over the coronavirus pandemic, asserting
that the Chinese Communist Party covered up the initial outbreak and
allowed the virus to spread around the globe.

But within the United States government, intelligence officials have
arrived at a more nuanced and complex finding of what Chinese officials
did wrong in January.

Officials in Beijing were kept in the dark for weeks about the potential
devastation of the virus by local officials in central China, according
to American officials familiar with a new internal report by U.S.
intelligence agencies.

The report concluded that officials in the city of Wuhan and in Hubei
Province, where the outbreak began late last year, tried to hide
information from China’s central leadership. The finding is consistent
with [reporting by news
organizations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html)
and with assessments by China experts of the country’s opaque
[governance
system](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/05/sunday-review/china-military-economic-power.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Local officials often withhold information from Beijing for fear of
reprisal, current and former American officials say.

The new assessment does not contradict the Trump administration’s
criticism of China, but adds perspective and context to actions — and
inactions — that created the global crisis.

President Trump [said in a July 4
speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-2020-salute-america/)
at the White House that “China’s secrecy, deceptions and cover-up”
enabled the pandemic. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
[insisted](https://www.state.gov/my-faith-my-work-my-country/) the
administration was “telling the truth every day” about “the Communist
cover-up of that virus.” Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser,
[said on
Saturday](https://twitter.com/PeterNavarro45/status/1294630610779213824?s=20)
that the pandemic was “perpetrated on America” by the Chinese Communist
Party.

The accusations dovetail with advice from Trump campaign strategists to
look tough on China to try to shift the spotlight from the [president’s
failures on the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html)
and the United States economy, and to paper over his [constant praise of
Xi
Jinping](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/politics/trump-china-bolton.html),
China’s authoritarian leader.

But the broad political messaging leaves an impression that [Mr. Xi and
other top officials
knew](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/08/world/asia/xi-coronavirus-china.html)
of the [dangers of the new
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html)
in the early days and went to great lengths to hide them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The report, originally circulated in June, has classified and
unclassified sections, and it represents the consensus of the C.I.A. and
other intelligence agencies. It still supports the overall notion that
Communist Party officials hid important information from the world, U.S.
officials said. The report says senior officials in Beijing, even as
they were scrambling to pry data from officials in central China, played
a role in obscuring the outbreak by withholding information from the
World Health
Organization.

But the report adds to a body of evidence that shows how the malfeasance
of local Chinese officials appeared to be a decisive factor in the
spread of the virus within Wuhan and beyond.

An internal U.S. government assessment of the differences in fault
between Chinese leaders and local officials potentially has significant
policy implications.

“It makes a huge difference if it was Wuhan or Beijing,” said [Michael
Pillsbury](https://www.hudson.org/experts/724-michael-pillsbury), a
China scholar at the Hudson Institute who informally advises Mr. Trump.

If Mr. Xi was not the main person at fault, he said, then that meant
that top Chinese officials had not engaged in total deceit on the
coronavirus, and American officials had some basis for still trying to
engage in good-faith negotiations with Beijing on issues of mutual
interest.

Though Mr. Pillsbury advocates competing with China, he also supports
diplomacy and sticking to a trade agreement that Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump
signed in January. Some of Mr. Trump’s other advisers, notably Mr.
Navarro, have advocated an [economic
“decoupling”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/business/china-decoupling.html)
with China and [denounced the trade
deal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/business/economy/trump-navarro-china-trade-deal.html).

Mr. Trump oscillates wildly on China. At times, he and other officials
have asserted the idea of a cover-up by China to justify policy
decisions such as [cutting funding to the World Health
Organization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/politics/trump-hong-kong-china-WHO.html).
When the president announced that move in late May, he accused the
W.H.O. of [helping
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/health/virus-who.html)cover
up the initial outbreak, though the organization has denied that.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Separately, Mr. Pompeo, the administration’s most vocal China hawk,
publicly [pushed an unsubstantiated
theory](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/03/us/politics/coronavirus-pompeo-wuhan-china-lab.html)
that the outbreak began with an accidental lab leak in Wuhan and [asked
American spy
agencies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html)
to find evidence.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

U.S. officials commissioned the new intelligence report after a
Department of Homeland Security analysis said that Chinese central
government officials hid the severity of the virus in early January to
hoard medical gear. That earlier report, an unusual attempt by [Homeland
Security intelligence
analysts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/us/politics/brian-murphy-homeland-security-protesters.html)
to examine a foreign power, relied heavily on public trade data, a
senior law enforcement official said. Several news organizations
[reported](https://apnews.com/bf685dcf52125be54e030834ab7062a8) that
finding in early May, as top Trump officials were attacking China over
the virus.

Policymakers asked the entire intelligence community to examine it, and
analysts came up with the new consensus report that aimed to refine and
even correct the Homeland Security assessment.

Alexei Woltornist, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security,
said the agency “does not comment on any allegedly leaked documents.”
The C.I.A. declined to comment.

The Chinese government has said it acted quickly to limit the spread of
the virus and to warn the world. This winter, central authorities
[ousted a few local party
officials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/13/world/asia/china-coronavirus-xi-jinping.html),
indicating they were to blame.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Communist Party leaders oversee an authoritarian system that inhibits
local officials from freely sharing information with national-level
officials, they said, and this has had deadly consequences for the
world. It is a version of the so-called Chernobyl effect, where local
officials avoid telling central authorities about a catastrophic event
until it is far too late, American officials said.

Moreover, officials in Beijing have tried to [spread
disinformation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html)
about the origins of the virus. The C.I.A. has said since at least
February that Chinese central officials were not sharing everything they
knew about the virus — including a [more accurate case
count](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/02/us/politics/cia-coronavirus-china.html)

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective

        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Public reporting has revealed wrongdoing by Chinese officials at all
levels, but in different manners.

In early January, W.H.O. officials began concluding that officials in
Beijing were [hiding
information](https://apnews.com/3c061794970661042b18d5aeaaed9fae), The
Associated Press reported in June, citing internal documents and
recordings. Central officials delayed releasing the complete virus
genome and ordered laboratories to destroy virus samples. At the same
time, they were trying to get more information from reticent Wuhan
officials.

Throughout early January, officials in Wuhan and in the provincial
government tried to [suppress
information](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
on the outbreak, in part because they feared derailing the local annual
Communist Party meeting taking place at the time.

Around mid-January, officials in Beijing began realizing the potential
devastation. On Jan. 13, Thailand said it had discovered a case of the
new coronavirus, alarming Chinese officials, who within a day began
[disseminating internal
warnings](https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9) of a
pending catastrophe, according to documents obtained by The Associated
Press.

A Taiwanese health official who visited a Wuhan hospital with other
outsiders from Jan. 13 to 15 said an official from Beijing told him of
[potential human-to-human
transmission](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/06/taiwanese-official-reveals-china-suspected-human-human-transmission/),
even though local officials were playing down that possibility. Two days
later, the Wuhan health commission announced that a family in the city
had the virus and that “limited human-to-human transmission cannot be
ruled out.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A turning point came when a cluster of cases emerged in the southern
city of Shenzhen, and when medical experts from Beijing visited sites in
Wuhan on Jan. 19. Back in Beijing the next morning, they told senior
officials that there was human-to-human transmission, and Mr. Xi said
later that day that the outbreak “must be taken seriously,” according to
a [state television
report](https://apnews.com/3c061794970661042b18d5aeaaed9fae) that
evening.

On Jan. 23, Beijing ordered an [extraordinary lockdown of
Wuhan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html),
a city of 11 million. The central government also stopped selling masks
and respirators to other countries and [began buying
supplies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/business/masks-china-coronavirus.html)
from around the world. American officials ignored the warning signs, and
the State Department even [flew 18 tons of donated medical
gear](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/19/world/asia/us-china-coronavirus.html)
to China in February.

Chinese state-run news organizations
[published](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/15/world/asia/xi-china-coronavirus.html)
an internal speech on Feb. 15 indicating Mr. Xi had given instructions
on the coronavirus in a meeting of the country’s top political body, the
Politburo Standing Committee, on Jan. 7. But those reports might have
been propaganda with exaggerations or falsehoods written to [counter
foreign news
accounts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/08/world/asia/xi-coronavirus-china.html)
that said Mr. Xi had been absent from the coronavirus relief effort.

The Homeland Security report from May that prompted the new U.S.
intelligence analysis went far in its assertions about Beijing.

“We assess the Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity
of Covid-19 from the international community in early January while it
stockpiled medical supplies by both increasing imports and decreasing
exports,” the document said, according to the law enforcement official.

Homeland Security erred in using trade data to make assumptions about
the actions and strategic intentions of the Chinese government, current
and former officials said.

“This was a rush to judgment that ultimately clouds the dialogue,” said
[Daniel
Hoffman](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/08/542106975/cover-lifted-a-cia-spy-offers-his-take-on-trump-and-russia),
a former senior C.I.A. officer.

Some current and former U.S. officials say Homeland Security officials
might have pushed the report to try to curry favor with the White House
during its anti-China campaign. Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary of
the Department of Homeland Security, has [sought to mesh the agency’s
operations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/politics/trump-homeland-security.html)
with Mr. Trump’s [political
agenda](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/homeland-security-portland.html).

“Across the board, you’re seeing a department that appears to be
utilizing its intelligence and analysis wing to solely support the
president’s mind-set,” said [Juliette N.
Kayyem](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/juliette-kayyem), a former
assistant secretary for the department.

“What people have to remember is: The department serves the homeland,”
she added. “If they cannot rely on its intelligence about a pandemic or
about who’s responsible for violence during a race riot or the
trajectory of a hurricane, what are they there for?”

Gillian Wong contributed reporting from Hong Kong.
