SEOUL, South Korea — Back in 2016, North Korea’s freshly minted leader,
Kim Jong-un, held the country’s first ruling Workers’ Party’s congress
in three decades and laid out an ambitious five-year economic plan to
build what he called a “great socialist country” by 2020.

On Thursday, he admitted that the plan had failed.

One calamity after another has hit North Korea since 2016. Led by the
United States, the United Nations Security Council imposed devastating
economic sanctions to retaliate against the North for its pursuit of
nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Then came the [global
coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/world/asia/north-korea-sanctions-coronavirus.html),
followed by [massive flood damage because of torrential
rain.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/world/asia/north-korea-floods-coronavirus.html)

Mr. Kim now plans to chart a new course.

North Korea on Thursday announced plans to hold a rare Workers’ Party
congress in January to work on a new plan to shore up its economy. Mr.
Kim’s blunt admission of policy shortcomings during a formal party
meeting was an indication of how much the North Korean economy had been
hammered by the triple crises.

Plans to improve the national economy have been “seriously delayed” by
“severe internal and external situations and unexpected manifold
challenges,” the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party concluded
during the meeting in Pyongyang, the capital, the North’s official
Korean Central News Agency reported on Thursday.

It remains rare in North Korea, if not unprecedented, under Mr. Kim’s
rule to openly admit to such failures.

Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, and grandfather Kim Il-sung, who had
ruled before him like infallible, godlike figures, never did. In North
Korea, it had been a capital crime to criticize the policies of the
dynastic Kim regime that has led North Korea since its founding in the
1940s.

But since he came to power, the younger Mr. Kim has broken that
tradition, casting himself as a new type of leader, one who is
ostensibly more forthcoming in admitting and addressing economic
problems of his country. He has often [criticized his state-run
factories and construction
projects](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/20/world/asia/kim-jong-un-north-korea-economy-nuclear-talks.html)
for being unproductive as he tried to rebuild his country’s economy in
defiance of international sanctions.

When he met with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea in 2018, Mr. Kim
admitted his roads and railways were in “embarrassing” condition, South
Korean officials said. In October, North Korea’s state news media
reported that he voiced “sharp criticism” of the “dependent policies” of
his predecessors when he [ordered the
demolition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/23/world/asia/north-korea-tourism.html)
of South Korean hotels and other buildings in a resort complex that the
two countries once operated together.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kim held his major coming-out event as leader when he [held the
party
congress](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/07/world/asia/north-korea-congress.html)
in 2016, [the first such meeting in 36
years.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/06/world/asia/north-korea-congress.html)There,
he adopted his ambitious five-year economic goals. The plan was for Mr.
Kim to celebrate his achievement during the party’s 75th anniversary on
Oct. 10 this year with pomp and spectacle.

But things have hardly transpired as Mr. Kim had hoped.

North Korea had already been struggling under the stranglehold of United
Nations sanctions. Then, last week, the North Korean leader admitted
that his nation was facing<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“two
crises at the same time”: [fighting the spread of the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html)
and coping with extensive flood damage. But he ordered his country not
to accept any international aid for fear that outside help might bring
in Covid-19.

In his no-nonsense assessment during the party meeting on Wednesday, Mr.
Kim said his country faced “unexpected and inevitable challenges” this
year. He also critiqued the “achievements and shortcomings” of his own
government, state news media reported.

When Mr. Kim took power after the death in 2011 of his father and
predecessor, he vowed to ensure that his people, long suffering from
multiple maladies, would “never have to tighten their belt again.” In
2016, when he adopted his economic plan, the North’s economy grew 3.9
percent, the highest since a devastating famine hit the country in the
late 1990s, according to the estimates by the South’s central Bank of
Korea.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The growth was largely the result of ramped-up exports of coal, iron
ore, textiles and fisheries to China. But the United Nations Security
Council banned such exports after the North rapidly expanded its weapons
programs, testing[three intercontinental ballistic
missiles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/30/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test.html)
in 2017, as well as what it said was [a hydrogen
bomb](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/03/world/asia/north-korea-tremor-possible-6th-nuclear-test.html).

As the sanctions tightened, the North’s economy shrank by 3.5 percent in
2017, according to the Bank of Korea. It contracted by 4.1 percent the
following year, with its exports to China plummeting 86 percent.

North Korea’s economy recovered slightly last year, growing 0.4 percent,
as Pyongyang invented ways of easing the pain of the sanctions, such as
smuggling banned cargo [across the Chinese border at
night](http://vod.kbs.co.kr/index.html?source=episode&sname=vod&stype=vod&program_code=T2011-1097&program_id=PS-2019197532-01-000&section_code=05&broadcast_complete_yn=N&local_station_code=00&section_sub_code=06)
or between ships[on the high
seas.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/18/world/asia/north-korea-oil-smuggling.html)
It also exported practically anything not banned by the sanctions: cheap
watches assembled with Chinese components, artificial eyelashes, wigs,
mannequins and soccer balls.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But this year, the coronavirus forced the country to shut down the
border with China, which had accounted for more than 90 percent of the
North’s external trade. North Korea’s exports to China plummeted to $27
million in the first half of this year, a 75 percent drop from a year
ago, according to the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.
Imports from China dropped 67 percent to $380
million.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

As the North’s economic woes deepened, Mr. Kim begun delegating some of
his governing work to his deputies, including to his only sister, [Kim
Yo-jong](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F06%2F17%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fnorth-korea-kim-yo-jong.html),
the South’s National Intelligence Service said on Thursday. She has
increased her voice in the North’s relations with South Korea and the
United States.

“After nine years in power, Kim Jong-un wants to lessen the stress of
governing,” Ha Tae-keung, a South Korean lawmaker affiliated with the
conservative opposition Future United Party, said while briefing
reporters on a closed-door parliamentary hearing from top intelligence
officials. “Another reason is that he wants to spread the blame and
lessen his political risk should policies go wrong.”

But Mr. Ha said that Mr. Kim’s delegation of power did not lessen his
absolute authority or mean that Ms. Kim had been chosen as his
successor. When Mr. Kim stayed out of sight earlier this year,
sparking[rumors](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F04%2F26%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fkim-jong-un-absence-north-korea.html)
that he was incapacitated, Ms. Kim was cited by outside analysts as the
primary candidate to succeed her brother in the dynastic regime.

After he failed to persuade President Trump to lift sanctions during
their meeting in Vietnam in February last year, Mr. Kim said his
government would slog through the sanctions. In his New Year’s message
this year, Mr. Kim asked his people to prepare to “tighten our belts”
again.

So far, he has shown no sign of backing down on his nuclear weapons
program. He vowed to boost his nuclear weapons program further,

Moon<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>— after blaming the South
for failing to increase inter-Korean economic exchanges.

Mr. Moon’s new national security adviser, Suh Hoon, planned to meet Yang
Jiechi, a member of Beijing’s Communist Party Politburo, when the
Chinese official visits the southern South Korean city of Busan on
Friday and Saturday. The two officials were expected to discuss North
Korea and a potential trip to Seoul by China’s top leader, Xi Jinping,
Mr. Moon’s office said.
