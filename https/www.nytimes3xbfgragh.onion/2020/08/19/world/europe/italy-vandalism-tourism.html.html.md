# Italy Wants Its Tourists Back, Unless They Sit on the Statues

</div>

Damaged treasures and broken rules have put the spotlight on the
country’s fragile cultural heritage, and the need to better educate
visitors.

ROME — First, two German [tourists took an unauthorized
dip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOfUmHXjXqg) in the Grand Canal in
Venice, under the Rialto Bridge. Then an Austrian tourist [broke the
toe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/arts/tourist-breaks-sculptures-toes.html?searchResultPosition=1)
of a plaster statue of Napoleon’s sister while posing for a photograph
at a museum in northern Italy. After that, a French tourist was caught
red-handed using a black felt-tip pen to immortalize her stay in
Florence on the city’s famed Ponte Vecchio.

Now Italian officials have set their sights on a young woman who took a
selfie standing atop some newly reopened thermal baths in Pompeii, the
fragile archaeological site.

“An investigation has been opened,” Massimo Osanna, the outgoing
director of the [Pompeii site](http://pompeiisites.org/en/), said,
adding that prosecutors in a nearby city were looking into the events.

The coronavirus pandemic may have [crushed the tourism industry in
Italy](https://www.confcommercio.it/-/niente-turisti-stranieri-crolla-lusso)
this year — delivering a [significant
blow](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/vto/content/oecd-tourism-trends-and-policies-2018-italy)
to the country’s economy — but Italians say that should not give
tourists who do come a free pass to run amok among the country’s
cultural treasures.

“There’s a question of vigilance, but also of the unpreparedness of
visitors,” read an editorial published on Tuesday in the Rome daily La
Repubblica. “What happened in Pompeii shows that the path to educating
those who visit museums is still dotted with difficulties and unforeseen
events,” a nod to countless episodes of vandalism and damage caused to
cultural treasures by visiting tourists. Past attempts to [curb such
behavior](http://nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/07/world/europe/rome-spanish-steps-sit.html)
have not always been successful.

Lawmakers in the lower house of Parliament introduced [a
bill](http://documenti.camera.it/leg18/pdl/pdf/leg.18.pdl.camera.2571.18PDL0107250.pdf)
last month that would toughen penalties for those convicted of
destroying Italy’s artistic patrimony. Culture Minister Dario
Franceschini has been trying to put such a law on the books
[since 2016](https://storico.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Comunicati/visualizza_asset.html_1253809747.html),
but has not managed to get approval from both houses of Parliament.

“We’re not in the Wild West; laws for damaging cultural heritage do
exist,” Mr. Franceschini’s spokesman, Mattia Morandi, said on Tuesday.
But the minister said he hoped that tougher penalties would be a greater
deterrent to people “who might carve their names in the Colosseum or
take mosaics from Pompeii,” not appreciating that they were destroying
something priceless, he said.

“We have to make a better effort to educate tourists to respect our
patrimony, to make them understand where they are,” said Mr. Osanna, who
is to leave Pompeii next month to take up a job at the Culture Ministry
overseeing Italy’s state museums.

Pompeii is a huge site and hard to monitor, he said. “Even increasing
security staff by the hundreds, there will always be some place that you
can access without direct control.”

Instead of limiting access to the site, Mr. Osanna said it would be
better to inform visitors that they were treading on fragile ground that
belonged to all of humanity, “and that any harm done to the site is a
harm done to the world’s patrimony.”

In the case of the statue whose toes were damaged in July, the local
authorities tracked the man using museum visitor logs. Prosecutors will
look through Pompeii’s reservation system to try matching a name to the
photograph that caught the selfie-taking tourist out of bounds. The
incident took place on July 24, but did not make news in Italy until
this past weekend, after it was posted on several social media accounts.

The man who took the photograph, Antonio Irlando, said he thought the
woman might have been unaware she was breaking the rules, as the rope
that was supposed to block the brick stairs to the roof had been untied
and cast to the side.

Mr. Irlando, an architect and president of a local association that
monitors the Pompeii sites, said in an interview that after taking the
photograph, he tried to reach the woman but she had gone by the time he
got to the baths. Instead, he saw another family climbing the steps,
unaware that they were off limits.

“I told them it wasn’t safe,” he said. “Who knows how many others went
up and no one noticed.”

Mr. Irlando said his database was full of “very extreme” photographs of
tourists behaving badly at Pompeii, like walking along the protected
ancient walls of the city, or leaning against frescoes created some
2,000 years ago.

“It’s an atavistic vice,” he said. “If you want other photos of people
who vandalized the site, just let me know.”
