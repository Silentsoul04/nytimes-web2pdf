GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. — The world has caught up to [Gregory
Crewdson](https://gagosian.com/artists/gregory-crewdson/). In his
large-scale photographs, which are produced with a movie crew in bravura
Hollywood style, the people stare off into space, cloaked in solipsistic
misery. The lighting is so portentous and the isolation and hopelessness
so exaggerated that these scenes have always reminded me of Technicolor
film stills from a 1950s melodrama — a kitschy imitation of life.

Until now. In the current locked-down world, which is hollowed out by
economic collapse and fragmented by fear of contagion, Mr. Crewdson’s
overwrought images seem like faithful representations of our frazzled
psychological state. “It’s weird how all my pictures have taken on a new
meaning,” he said.

In a masked interview last month in his Great Barrington studio,
adjacent to the deconsecrated 1890 Methodist church where he lives, he
and Juliane Hiam, his studio manager and romantic partner, hung his
prints, which are more than seven feet wide and four feet high, one by
one on the wall. It was the first studio visit since the pandemic
lockdown in March, and Mr. Crewdson, 57, a stocky, affable man, looked
relaxed in a T-shirt and shorts.

His most recent body of work, a 16-photograph collection he calls [“An
Eclipse of
Moths,”](https://aperture.org/shop/gregory-crewdson-an-eclipse-of-moths/)
will be presented in late September at
[Gagosian](https://gagosian.com/artists/gregory-crewdson/) in Beverly
Hills, and subsequently in Paris and New York. He shot the pictures on
the outskirts of Pittsfield, a depressed town 20 miles north of his home
in the Berkshires.

His central decision when he stages a photograph is selecting the site.
“I spend a lot of time driving around, finding locations that can
accommodate a picture,” Mr. Crewdson said, explaining the elaborate
scouting procedure for his constructed images. “Returning to these
locations, a story will come into my head.” He then describes the
concept to Ms. Hiam, who writes a scenario that will provide a template
for the shoot. “There’s no motivation, no plot,” he said. “I love the
idea of creating a moment that has no before and after. I do everything
I can to make it as powerful as possible.”

The collection’s name alludes to a term for a cluster of the nocturnal
flying insects, which gather around an illumination source, eventually
obscuring it. The hard-bitten figures in his photographs are similarly
attracted — metaphorically to a promise of grace, literally to radiance
— in a quest that ends in self-defeat. Driving home that trope, Mr.
Crewdson brought street lamps into many scenes, fitting them with
special lights that cast an eerie glow.

The region has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic. “On a daily basis
we would see O.D.’s,” Mr. Crewdson said. He and Ms. Hiam recruited local
people to appear in the pictures, and for some, a dejected air and a
vacant stare did not require
acting.

Embellishing his landscapes, he painted billboards and altered the
street signs. He towed in dilapidated cars and installed an old
telephone booth. “We age everything,” he said. “It should all look
slightly broken. We work closely with the town. I asked them not to pave
any streets, cut any grass. It’s all in the effort of making a world
that is beautiful and unsettling. I want it to feel both timeless and of
the moment.” Everything appears to be outmoded, even the overhead
electric wires.

He shot “An Eclipse of Moths,” and previous sequences of
Berkshires-based photographs, during the summer, when the twilight is
prolonged. Conveniently, he is off from his teaching duties at Yale,
where he is the director of graduate studies in photography. “There is a
New England quality in the majesty of some of the trees,” said his
friend Deborah Berke, dean of the Yale School of Architecture. “A
sturdiness and scale and greenness to some of those trees is in high
contrast to the buildings and the cars and the other parts of the
landscape that don’t have that staying power.”

The section of Pittsfield where he staged his pictures is near a General
Electric transformer plant that[poisoned the environment with PCBs but
also employed most of the
town](https://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2016/06/29/ge-and-pittsfield).
Ms. Hiam, who was born in Pittsfield, said, “My parents worked for GE.
Everyone I knew had parents who came here for GE.” Pittsfield was
devastated in 1987 by the closing of the factory, which now looms over
the landscape like a ruined castle in a European
village.

But Mr. Crewdson, who as a boy summered in a cabin in the nearby town of
Becket with his Brooklyn-based family, sees the surroundings from a
different vantage point. “He definitely feels the area is enchanting,”
Ms. Hiam said. “It’s the feeling a vacationer would have — the detached
and enchanted view. When he takes me around to show his locations, I’m
often not seeing what he is seeing yet.”

As Mr. Crewdson shot the pictures two years ago, overseeing a large crew
of technicians and actors, he was afflicted by mysterious maladies. “I’m
not even sure it was conscious in terms of the content of the work, but
one of the central themes for me is brokenness,” he said. “I was having
a series of serious physical ailments that made going through life, let
alone the production, a real chore.” He was short of breath, constantly
fatigued, liable to fall asleep at odd times.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There’s always an unconscious connection between my life and my work,”
he said. “All my work really does start with a psychological state of
looking inward and projecting outward — a tension between something very
intimate and something very removed. I was also just coming out of a
difficult divorce and had moved out of New York, trying to continue my
relationship with my children by constant commuting. At the core, I felt
my body had betrayed me.”

He delayed seeing a doctor until he was in postproduction, and then
learned that he was suffering from severe sleep apnea, waking as
frequently as 50 times an hour during the night. Since then, he has
recovered. He follows a strict daily regimen: abstaining from alcohol,
eating the same two meals (heavy on salmon), swimming in a lake for an
hour and a
half.

Mr. Crewdson’s chosen genre, the constructed photograph, is nearly as
old as photography itself, but for a long time it fell out of favor. As
early as the 1850s in Victorian England, [Henry Peach
Robinson](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/1936/henry-peach-robinson-british-1830-1901/)
and [Oscar G.
Rejlander](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/1650/oscar-gustave-rejlander-british-born-sweden-1813-1875/)
engineered tableaus with actors and stage sets — and even, in a handmade
precursor of digital manipulation, montaged multiple negatives — to
create photographic facsimiles of history paintings or domestic dramas.
But the sentimentality of their images and the subordination of the
camera to the aesthetics of the easel damned those photographers in the
eyes of their modernist descendants.

Over a century later, starting in the late ’70s, [Jeff
Wall](https://gagosian.com/artists/jeff-wall/), who was deeply schooled
in art history and influenced by Conceptual art, brought the constructed
photograph back into critical favor with his large color-transparency
light boxes. Concurrently, but from more of a pop-culture vantage point
(referring to Hitchcock, for instance, rather than Delacroix and Manet),
[Cindy Sherman’s “Untitled Film
Stills”](https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/cindy-sherman-untitled-film-stills-1977-80/)
demonstrated the capability of the constructed photograph to express an
artist’s personal obsessions and (in her case) feminist concerns.

Since then, Mr. Crewdson has been one of many artists, including
[Philip-Lorca diCorcia](https://www.moma.org/artists/7027), [Stan
Douglas](https://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/stan-douglas/biography)
and [Alex Prager](https://www.alexprager.com/), who explore various
approaches to the practice. “They have been developing different models
of production in a way that is unmistakably cinematic,” Roxana Marcoci,
senior curator of photography at MoMA, said in a phone interview. “They
are as attentive to the furniture and the location as to the faces and
bodies of the people they are portraying. You have the aesthetic of the
film
still.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Crewdson is a filmmaker manqué. “Almost from day one, I was
interested in the intersection between movies and a still image,” he
said. “I love movies maybe above all forms of art — the dreamlike
quality of going to a movie and watching the light on the screen and
being intoxicated by how that world seems separate from our world. But I
think in single images, always. I’m dyslexic and have trouble with
linear storytelling.”

Early in his career, in the mid-90s, Mr. Crewdson created and
photographed dioramas of out-of-scale insects and animals in natural
settings that evoked the uncanny hothouse atmosphere of David Lynch’s
movie “Blue Velvet.” As he advanced, he employed actors and film crews
to fabricate scenes with a similar emotional payoff on a grander scale.
During production, fog machines cloud the air and water trucks wet the
streets. Lights beam down from 80-foot-high cranes. Unusually for a
photographer, he employs a camera operator to press the shutter and a
director of photography to arrange the lighting. (Recently, he replaced
his 8 by 10 large-format film camera with a Phase One digital camera,
which, he says, has “100 or 200 times the definition.”) “I’m not
comfortable holding the camera even,” he said. “I’m interested in what I
see in front of me.”

The pictures in “An Eclipse of Moths” traffic less heavily in
otherworldly encounters than in previous sequences, including
[“Cathedral of the
Pines”](https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2016/gregory-crewdson-cathedral-of-the-pines/)
(2016) and [“Beneath the
Roses”](https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2005/gregory-crewdson-beneath-the-roses/)
(2005). Still, they feature such off-kilter human activities as a young
woman bathing in a concrete burial vault, another young woman standing
on a broken-down fair ride called “the Cobra” and holding an erotic
face-off with a shirtless youth in a discarded shipping container, boys
on bicycles close to the abandoned GE plant who are watching a fire burn
in the back of a truck, and a shirtless old man with a shopping cart
full of junk outside a building marked “Redemption
Center.”

The even lighting enhances the dreamlike quality. Everything is in
focus, nothing is blurry. In postproduction, he creates seamless
composites from various takes, so that the reflections in the rain
puddles are as sharp as mirror images and the houses in the distance are
as defined as the foreground buildings.

The son of a psychiatrist who treated patients in the family’s Park
Slope house, Mr. Crewdson likes to describe how as a boy he would lie on
the floorboards of the living room, hoping to hear what was being said
below. “I was trying to listen to something that was hidden or forbidden
in the domestic space,” he explained. He never could make out the
conversation. Like the people in his photographs, these mysterious
strangers tantalized his curiosity but kept their secrets just beyond
his grasp. So the fascination never faded. “I’ve always been drawn to
photography because of its inability to tell the full story,” he said.
“It remains unresolved.”
