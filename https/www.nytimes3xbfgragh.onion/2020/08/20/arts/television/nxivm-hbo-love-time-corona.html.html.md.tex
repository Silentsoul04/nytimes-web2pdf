\section{How Much Watching Time Do You Have This
Weekend?}\label{how-much-watching-time-do-you-have-this-weekend}}

Our TV critic recommends checking out a new stand-up special and an
engrossing documentary about the Nxivm cult.

\textbf{`Rose Matafeo: Horndog'}\\
\textbf{When to watch:} Now, on
\href{https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXwzPRAf5ncPDwgEAAAcY}{HBO
Max}.

If you've ever spent time on forums or in fandoms, or if you just love
love, this stand-up special from the comedian Rose Matafeo is for you.
Matafeo is part of a larger trend of comedians who incorporate videos
and screenshots into their acts, combining their onstage and online
personas, and here it feels seamless and authentic. She describes her
period-tracking app as ``a very sad advent calendar'' and goes in on
various aspects of a tech-consumed life. Her broader thesis is a good
one --- that we are our obsessions but that that does not have to be
bad.

\textbf{`The Vow'}\\
\textbf{When to watch:} Sunday at 10 p.m., on HBO.

This new nine-part documentary is a thorough examination of the
self-empowerment cult Nxivm, whose founder, Keith Raniere, is in prison
for racketeering and sex trafficking. Sarah Edmondson and other former
members of the organization are forthcoming about their sometimes
horrific experiences, but the real asset in ``The Vow'' is how much of
its material comes from participants' near-constant self-documentation
while they were in the group. Videos and recorded phone calls help
create a nuanced look at how abuse and manipulation propagate themselves
in closed systems.

\textbf{`Love in the Time of Corona'}\\
\textbf{When to watch:} Saturday and Sunday at 8 p.m. on Freeform;
starting Monday on Hulu.

I don't recommend this mini-series as a work of narrative television.
But as a demonstration of what's technologically possible under our
current bizarre living situations, it's an intriguing start: It looks
pretty good, it sounds pretty good, and it feels like a ``real'' show,
even if it's a matryoshka doll of spiritual alienation to watch people
on screens watch people on screens talk about isolation. The four
episodes follows four households whose inhabitants are in various states
of love and marriage, and everything was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/arts/television/coastal-elites-connecting-social-distance.html}{filmed
in the actors' actual homes}, with real-life couples portraying the
on-screen couples.
