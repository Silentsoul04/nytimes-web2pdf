The Trump administration has announced measures intended to boost
childhood vaccination rates that have sagged during the coronavirus
pandemic, putting hundreds of thousands at risk of contracting serious
and life-threatening diseases.

The Department of Health and Human Services is giving permission to
[pharmacists nationwide to administer all scheduled
shots](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/08/19/hhs-expands-access-childhood-vaccines-during-covid-19-pandemic.html)
to children as young as 3, including the flu vaccine, a step that makes
immunization more convenient for parents.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday [that a
high-dose flu
shot](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/rr/rr6908a1.htm?s_cid=rr6908a1_w)
aimed at better protecting people 65 and older will guard against four
strains of the virus this year, rather than three. Because the
conventional flu vaccine can be less successful in older people, an
enhanced shot to boost their immune system has been offered in recent
years and this one is stronger than ever.

Protecting against the impending flu season in the United States is
foremost on the minds of public health officials, who worry about the
confluence of cases of flu and Covid-19 hitting hospitals this fall and
winter. On Wednesday, [Massachusetts announced that it will require all
students](https://www.mass.gov/news/flu-vaccine-now-required-for-all-massachusetts-school-students-enrolled-in-child-care-pre),
ranging from 6-month-olds in day care centers to those under 30, to get
flu shots by Dec. 31. It is the first state to institute such a sweeping
requirement for the shot, which is rarely mandated in the U.S.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Massachusetts order includes elementary and secondary school
students who are currently learning remotely. But it allows exceptions
for students with medical and religious exemptions, those who are
home-schooled and those in colleges and universities who learn remotely
and do not set foot on their
campuses.

Usually, public health officials recommend that people get flu shots
between the middle of September and the end of October. Because immunity
can take up to two weeks, the goal would be to have people fully
protected in time for the onset of the holiday season, when travel and
indoor gatherings make the risk of infection with the flu virus
exponentially more likely. Moreover, because immunity wanes over several
months, the hope is that protection could last through early spring,
when a final surge of flu can emerge.

People should get only one flu shot in a given annual flu season, public
health experts say. For children getting [their initial flu
vaccine,](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.htm#:~:text=Some%20children%206%20months%20through,at%20least%204%20weeks%20apart.)
a booster is usually given about four weeks later.

This year, because restrictions imposed by the pandemic have shuttered
workplaces and school health clinics where millions usually get their
shots, officials have loosened their timing recommendations.

Although pharmacies nationwide are ramping up their ability to
administer the shots, access could still be difficult for many people.
In that event, many public health experts say, just get the shot as soon
as you reasonably can.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

People [who are 65 and older are also eligible for a vaccine to protect
against pneumonia](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/index.html),
as are smokers between the ages of 19 and 64. That shot is strongly
recommended this year in particular.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

Supplies of the flu vaccine should not be a problem, because vaccine
manufacturers project they will deliver at least 15 percent more doses
than last year.

[The new emergency
rule](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/default.aspx)
allowing state-licensed pharmacists to give federally scheduled vaccines
to children ages 3 through 18 is supposed to [encourage widespread
immunization](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/default.aspx)
as schools open during the pandemic, and to resolve a patchwork of state
laws that govern shots and age limits.

The Department of Health and Human Services noted that a [federal report
in
May](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e2.htm?s_cid=mm6919e2_w)
said that childhood vaccination rates had dropped precipitously in the
first months of the pandemic. New York City’s numbers had especially
plummeted. At the time, many [parents were afraid to
venture](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/health/coronavirus-measles-vaccines.html)
out to doctors’ offices and many pediatricians restricted their hours to
emergency
cases.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

City](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930a3.htm?s_cid=mm6930a3_w).
[By midsummer, pediatricians’
hours](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6927a2.htm?s_cid=mm6927a2_w)
had largely returned to normal.

Though many public health advocates welcomed the ruling allowing
pharmacists to vaccinate kids, the [American Academy of
Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/Pages/Default.aspx), which
represents pediatricians, decried it as misguided, in large part because
it might short-circuit essential visits to doctors’ offices.

“In the middle of a pandemic, what families are looking for is
reassurance and clinical guidance from the doctors they trust most to
care for their children: pediatricians,” said Dr. Sally Goza, the
organization’s president. “Pediatricians’ offices are open and safe.”

Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the assistant secretary for health, acknowledged
as much. In a statement, Dr. Giroir, a pediatric critical care
physician, said: “As we expand options during the Covid-19 response, we
are also reminding parents, grandparents, and caretakers that there is
no substitute for a critically important well-child visit with a
pediatrician or other licensed primary care provider when available.”

But he also said that he knew firsthand of the devastation to children
and families from disabling and life threatening diseases, making it
important to provide as many ways as possible to get the shots.

“The cornerstone of public health, vaccines, makes these dreaded
diseases preventable,” he said.
