# New York Will Allow Voters to Cast Mail-In Ballots

New York State will allow most voters to cast their ballots by mail in
the November general election, joining [a growing list of
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/11/us/politics/vote-by-mail-us-states.html)
that have expanded mail-in voting to address the potential spread of the
coronavirus at polling places.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, [signed a
bill](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8015) on Thursday
allowing voters to request an absentee ballot if they cannot show up at
a polling location because of the risk of contracting or spreading an
illness, effectively permitting the state’s more than [12 million
registered
voters](https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/county/county_feb19.pdf)
to vote by mail.

But with only 10 weeks until Election Day, the challenges of
administering an election predominantly by mail will be especially
pronounced in New York, following the state’s [uneven
handling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/nyregion/election-absentee-ballots-primary.html)
of its primary just two months ago.

Nearly 40 percent of voters cast mail-in ballots in the state’s June 23
primary — when an executive order authorized wider use of voting by mail
— compared with as few as 4 percent in previous elections. The surge
overwhelmed election officials and resulted in a weekslong delay for
results in many races.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The problems in New York were repeatedly cited by President Trump, who
has sought to [undermine mail-in
voting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/trump-mail-in-voting.html),
which he has falsely disparaged as rife with fraud — even as legitimate
concerns mount over the Postal Service’s [ability to handle large
numbers of
ballots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/politics/postal-service-voting.html).

Election officials [are
anticipating](https://twitter.com/luisferre/status/1293216219550679041)
more than five million absentee ballots in the Nov. 3 presidential
election, or four times the total number of mail-in ballots received in
the June primary, raising the specter that final tallies will not be
known for weeks.

“I don’t think it’s realistic to think you’ll have a quick count this
November,” Peter S. Kosinski, co-chairman of the New York State Board of
Elections, warned during a state legislative hearing last week.

State officials are weighing several changes to election laws and
procedures: Mr. Cuomo signed another bill on Thursday that will allow
voters to apply earlier for a mail-in ballot. Officials are also
developing an online mechanism to apply for mail-in ballots, and changes
are being envisioned to reduce the number of rejected ballots, a
troubling issue in the June primary.

The [deadline to
apply](https://www.elections.ny.gov/votingdeadlines.html) for a mail-in
ballot by mail is Oct. 27, although officials are urging voters not to
wait until the last minute. Ballots need to be postmarked by Election
Day. To lessen the expected influx of mail-in ballots, officials are
encouraging voters to cast their ballots in person at [early polling
sites](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/08/19/nyc-early-voting/), which
open statewide on Oct. 24 and don’t require any advance application.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Election officials will nonetheless face an uphill battle to regain the
confidence of voters who encountered obstacles in their attempt to vote
by mail during the
primaries.

In June, election boards received a record-setting number of requests
for absentee ballots, which [led to huge
backlogs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-mail-ballots-voting.html)
that resulted in many thousands of voters not receiving their ballots in
time to vote. Many reported not receiving a ballot at all.

Voters in New York City returned more than 400,000 mail ballots, more
than 10 times the number of absentee ballots received in recent
elections. But the sheer number of ballots to be counted led to
interminable waits, including in closely contested congressional primary
contests that [were called six weeks after voters cast their
ballots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/nyregion/maloney-torres-ny-congressional-races.html).

The counting process itself was plagued with troubles: More than 80,000
absentee ballots in the city [were deemed invalid because of technical
flaws](https://nypost.com/2020/08/05/84000-mail-in-ballots-disqualified-in-nyc-primary-election/),
meaning that nearly one-fifth of voters who voted by mail were
effectively disenfranchised. Many were disqualified because voters
failed to sign the ballot envelope, for example, while others were
rejected because of a missing postmark or because they were improperly
sealed.

The large number of disqualified ballots in the Democratic primary
between Representative Carolyn B. Maloney and challenger Suraj Patel
prompted Mr. Patel and others to file a lawsuit, leading a federal judge
[to order that some disputed ballots be
counted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-congress-carolyn-maloney-ballots.html).

One of the most perplexing conundrums during the June primary involved
more than 4,800 ballots in Brooklyn that were disqualified because the
Postal Service failed to postmark them — a requisite for a ballot to be
counted if it’s received after Election Day.

The Postal Service has vowed to correct the issues that led to the lack
of postmarks, but it has provided little explanation as to what exactly
went wrong.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent federal court testimony, Michael Calabrese, a manager at the
Postal Service’s[massive Morgan processing
plant](https://www.uspsoig.gov/document/new-york-morgan-processing-and-distribution-center-efficiency)
in Manhattan, conceded that postmarking was “not a 100 percent process”
and that some ballots could have gotten through unmarked.

A spokesman for the agency did not respond to multiple requests for
additional details of the mishap.

To partially address the issue, Mr. Cuomo signed a bill on Thursday that
allows an absentee ballot without a postmark to be counted if it is
received one day after Election Day.

“These actions will further break down barriers to democracy and will
make it easier for all New Yorkers to exercise their right to vote this
November,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.

Until a wave of changes approved in 2019, New York [had been behind
other states in adopting measures like early
voting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/10/nyregion/voting-reform-election-ny.html),
which was underutilized during the June primary. More than 30 states
allow voters to mail in their ballots for any reason.

Absentee ballots will not be mailed automatically to voters in New York,
as will be the case [in at least nine other
states](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-vote-by-mail-in-every-state-11597840923),
including New Jersey and California. Instead, voters in New York will
have to request a mail-in ballot online, over the phone, in person or by
mail.

There are other outstanding issues elections boards will have to grapple
with as November nears, including working more cohesively with the
Postal Service, which state election officials tend to note is not
subject to their oversight.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Postal Service officials have insisted they have the capacity to deliver
ballots to voters in a timely manner so long as election boards don’t
mail ballots to voters too close to the general election. The agency
typically processes and delivers first-class mail, such as ballots,
within two to five days after it is received, even though it has
recommended voters mail their completed ballots at least one week before
the state’s due date.

But in the June primary, the New York City Board of Elections,
overburdened by an influx of ballots, mailed out tens of thousands of
ballots to voters as late as the day before Election Day, increasing the
likelihood that those voters would not receive a ballot in time to vote.

“We met our legal mandate, but some of them got out right under the
wire,” Michael Ryan, the executive director of the New York City Board
of Elections, acknowledged last week.

Election officials in New York are encouraging voters to apply for a
ballot online, as New York City and Erie County did in June, rather than
by mail, to expedite the process of mailing ballots to voters. The
state’s Board of Elections is expected to unveil an online portal by
the end of the month.

To diminish the reliance on the Postal Service, some state lawmakers
[have proposed](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8902)
scattering secure drop boxes across the state where voters can drop
their ballots and have election officials directly collect them — an
idea that is borrowed [from other
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/politics/postal-service-voting.html),
but that Mr. Trump’s campaign has forcefully opposed.

Some New York State election officials have argued that drop boxes could
be superfluous since voters already have the option of dropping off
their mail-in ballots at early voting sites and at polling places on
Election Day.

Following complaints that voters failed to sign the ballot envelope
because of confusing instructions on the envelope, the state Board of
Elections is currently redesigning the envelope to be clearer, according
to Douglas A. Kellner, co-chairman of the board.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

State lawmakers recently passed legislation that would require election
boards to notify voters if their absentee ballot has a missing signature
and provide them with an opportunity to fix the error so their vote can
be counted. But Mr. Cuomo had not signed that bill as of Thursday.

Election officials have raised the alarm about a statewide shortage of
poll workers, most of whom are typically older and susceptible to the
virus. Mr. Ryan has implored the state and the city to make its work
force available, and has even floated the idea of recruiting public
university students.

State officials have also warned of the dire need for additional funding
after depleting almost all of the $24 million allocated in federal and
state funds to administer elections this year.
