It was the first known time that regulators directly interviewed a chief

antitrust violations.

WASHINGTON — Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, answered
questions under oath on multiple days this week as part of [the Federal
Trade Commission’s
inquiry](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/technology/ftc-facebook-investigation.html)
into whether the company broke antitrust laws, the company said on
Thursday.

The interview with Mr. Zuckerberg, [reported earlier by
Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/20/facebook-ceo-interviewed-by-ftc-as-part-of-antitrust-probe-399492),
was the first known time that regulators directly questioned a chief
executive of one of the tech companies being scrutinized for potential
antitrust violations. Either the F.T.C. or the Department of Justice is
also [investigating Google, Apple and
Amazon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/08/technology/antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html).

Interviews with major executives can be a sign that a case is moving
forward or is in an advanced stage. While the F.T.C. has already
interviewed some other senior Facebook executives under oath, others are
scheduled to be interviewed after Mr. Zuckerberg, a person with
knowledge of the matter said. The agency’s interviews with Facebook
employees could stretch well into September, said the person, who would
speak only anonymously because the investigation is private.

The F.T.C. declined to comment.

Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company was “committed to
cooperating with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s inquiry and
answering the questions the agency may have.”

The investigation has focused on whether Facebook bought start-ups like
Instagram and WhatsApp in order to squash young and potentially
dangerous competitors.

One round of document collection wrapped up in the spring. The trade
commission has also contacted the founders of start-ups that Facebook
bought, a sign that the agency is focusing on the company’s acquisition
practices. But the investigation is expected to stretch beyond the
November presidential election.

Mr. Zuckerberg and the other chief executives — Sundar Pichai of Google,
Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Tim Cook of Apple — [testified last month
before a House
panel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html)
investigating their market power. Mr. Zuckerberg was confronted with
emails showing that a Facebook executive had referred to Instagram
during the acquisition process as a “competitive threat.” Mr. Zuckerberg
said Instagram’s runaway success was a result of its acquisition by
Facebook and not preordained.

Facebook says it faces robust competition from other American tech
giants as well as foreign companies like TikTok, the viral video app
owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.
