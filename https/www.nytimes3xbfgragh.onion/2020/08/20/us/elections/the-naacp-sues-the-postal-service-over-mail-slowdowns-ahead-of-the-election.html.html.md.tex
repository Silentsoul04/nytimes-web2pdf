The N.A.A.C.P. is the latest group to file a lawsuit against Postmaster
General Louis DeJoy and the U.S. Postal Service, alleging that recent
slowdowns in mail delivery could have grave consequences for Americans'
right to vote.

As with the recent lawsuit filed by a coalition of state attorneys
general, the N.A.A.C.P. suit asks the court to reverse measures put in
place by Mr. DeJoy that have caused delays in the delivery of
medications, paychecks, benefits, and ballots.

While Mr. DeJoy said on Tuesday he would
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/postal-service-suspends-changes.html}{suspend
cost-cutting moves} until after the election, the N.A.A.C.P. contends
that his announcement only seems to suspend some of the service cuts he
has put into place.

The recent changes are expected to be discussed at a hearing this
afternoon before the Congressional Progressive Caucus where David
Williams, a former postal governor who resigned in April, will testify.

Lawmakers plan to question Mr. DeJoy at a Senate committee hearing on
Friday and at a House oversight hearing on Monday. House lawmakers are
also expected to vote Saturday on legislation that would
\href{https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR8015-RCP116-61.pdf}{reverse
the changes put into place} by Mr. DeJoy and provide \$25 billion for
the beleaguered agency.

The
\href{https://www.naacpldf.org/wp-content/uploads/1-Complaint.pdf}{N.A.A.C.P.'s
complaint}, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., states that
mail-in ballots will be necessary in November to ensure that people can
vote without risking the spread of the coronavirus and notes that
infection and death rates for the virus are disproportionately high
among Black Americans.

It claims that the Postal Service failed to take the required steps
before implementing operational changes, including submitting them to
the Postal Regulatory Commission, an oversight body.

``As the country faces an uphill battle against Covid-19 and systemic
racism, we're witnessing a significant onslaught against our postal
system at a time when prompt mail delivery matters more than ever,
especially for voters of color,'' Derrick Johnson, president of the
N.A.A.C.P., said in a statement.
