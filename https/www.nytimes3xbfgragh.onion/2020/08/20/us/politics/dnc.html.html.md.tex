On Thursday, the fourth and last night of the Democratic National
Convention,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.} will finally take the stage --- \emph{a} stage, anyway,
albeit hundreds of miles from the one in Milwaukee where he would have
accepted the presidential nomination he has sought for more than 30
years.

Also on the docket are four of Mr. Biden's former competitors in the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/us/politics/dnc-what-to-watch.html}{Democratic}
primary: Michael R. Bloomberg, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Andrew
Yang. Scroll down for a full list of speakers.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{whos-speaking}{%
\subsection{Who's speaking}\label{whos-speaking}}

The star of the night will, of course, be former Vice President
\textbf{Joseph R. Biden Jr.}, the Democratic presidential nominee.
Members of his family will also speak. \textbf{Julia Louis-Dreyfus} will
be the night's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/elections/kerry-washington-julia-louis-dreyfus-eva-longoria-and-tracee-ellis-ross-will-mc-the-convention.html}{M.C}.

The other major speakers are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Senator \textbf{Tammy Baldwin} of Wisconsin. A favorite of progressive
  Democrats, she is the first openly gay senator and was seen as a
  vice-presidential contender.
\item
  Former Mayor \textbf{Michael R. Bloomberg} of New York. A former
  Republican turned major gun control benefactor, he ran a hugely
  expensive campaign for the Democratic nomination but was dogged by his
  record on policing.
\item
  Senator \textbf{Cory Booker} of New Jersey, who was also a Democratic
  primary candidate. He focused his campaign on a message of unity and
  was a leader on gun policy: the first candidate in the field to
  propose a licensing requirement, which more than half of his opponents
  ended up supporting.
\item
  Former Mayor \textbf{Pete Buttigieg} of South Bend, Ind. He emerged on
  top at the Iowa caucuses but faded in subsequent primaries and,
  ultimately, endorsed Mr. Biden before Super Tuesday. At just 38, he
  could be a prominent figure in Democratic politics for quite some
  time.
\item
  Senator \textbf{Chris Coons} of Delaware. He holds the Senate seat
  that Mr. Biden once held, and if Mr. Biden wins in November, Mr. Coons
  is likely to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate.
\item
  Senator \textbf{Tammy Duckworth} of Illinois. A popular senator and
  veteran whose legs were amputated after her helicopter was shot down
  in Iraq, she was under consideration to be Mr. Biden's running mate.
\item
  Mayor \textbf{Keisha Lance Bottoms} of Atlanta. She became an
  unexpected contender for the vice-presidential spot as a result of her
  response to Black Lives Matter protests in Atlanta after the killing
  of Mr. Floyd.
\item
  Gov. \textbf{Gavin Newsom} of California. As the leader of the
  nation's most populous state, Mr. Newsom was on the front lines of the
  early response to the coronavirus pandemic and managed to keep
  infection rates in California relatively low at first, though they
  spiked later.
\item
  \textbf{Andrew Yang}, a tech entrepreneur and former presidential
  candidate. He is known for his universal basic income proposal, which
  would have given every adult \$1,000 a month.
