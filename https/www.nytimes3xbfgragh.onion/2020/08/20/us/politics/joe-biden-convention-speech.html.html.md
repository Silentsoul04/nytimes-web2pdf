<div class="css-53u6y8">

WILMINGTON, Del. — Over his near half-century in public life, Joseph R.
Biden Jr. has made many speeches: good speeches, bad speeches, campaign
kickoff speeches and concession speeches, speeches without proper
attribution to original sources, speeches so impossibly Biden that no
one could ever accuse him of lifting anything.

“No one ever doubts that I mean what I say,” Mr. Biden, 77, is fond of
telling audiences. “The problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean.”

What he means to say on Thursday, as he accepts the Democratic
presidential nomination in the most important — and likely most surreal
— address of his career, has been something of a work in progress for
several decades, since he charged onto the national stage as a
29-year-old senator-elect and sparked his first presidential speculation
soon after.

And so, friends said, some elements of his preparation process were to
be expected. There would be consultations with a coterie of family
members and his longest-serving advisers, including his sister Valerie
Biden Owens; his wife, Jill Biden; and his chief strategist, Mike
Donilon. He would cycle through multiple drafts, reflecting a
longstanding habit of tinkering until the end, often by hand.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Biden and his team have also conferred with close friends and others
he admires about themes and narrative arcs. Jon Meacham, the
presidential historian, has been among those contributing to the
process. (The title of a recent book by Mr. Meacham, “The Soul of
America,” has been echoed by Mr. Biden throughout his presidential bid,
including in his campaign slogan.)

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But other parts of the task this week were less familiar. Namely:
planning to deliver remarks with virtually no audience — distressing for
a politician who has long fed off the energy of a crowd — with his top
supporters left to uncork [miniature bottles of
confetti](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/virtual-dnc-donors.html)
(supplied by the Biden team for solo watch parties) amid a pandemic that
[has
claimed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
more than 170,000 American lives.

Mr. Biden’s speech, those close to him say, will be fashioned
accordingly to meet the moment: more sober than jubilant, more
restrained than swaggering, in his most ambitious effort yet to offer
the American people a vision of steady leadership and national unity in
the face of extraordinary crises.

“The times dictate a different type of speech,” said former Gov. Terry
McAuliffe, Democrat of Virginia and a close ally of Mr. Biden’s. “This
is a different speech, this is a different time, than probably any other
time going back to the days of F.D.R. when we were dealing with a world
war and we were dealing with a Depression. This is a very serious
speech.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Asked how long Mr. Biden had been preparing for his Thursday appearance,
Mr. McAuliffe replied, “for his entire
life.”

## Listen to ‘The Daily’: Joe Biden’s 30-Year Quest

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Andy Mills, Rachel Quester and Robert Jimison and edited by MJ Davis Lin and Lisa Tobin

#### The former vice president twice failed to secure the Democratic nomination. Now he has succeeded, how much will his past mistakes affect his bid for the White House?

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
    Tonight when Joe Biden formally accepts the Democratic Party’s
    nomination for president, it will be the culmination of a 30-year
    quest and two failed runs for the office. My colleague, Matt
    Flegenheimer, on a delayed victory that looks nothing like Biden had
    planned.
    
    It’s Thursday, August 20.

  - archived recording  
    \[CHEERING\] America needs someone who can inspire once again in our
    people faith and trust in our government. America needs someone with
    a heart.

michael barbaro

Matt, take us back to when Joe Biden first runs for president. Where
does that story start?

matt flegenheimer

That story starts at a train station in Wilmington, Delaware in June of
1987.

  - archived recording  
    And we thank you, Delaware, for giving us that person, the next
    president of the United States, Joe Biden.

matt flegenheimer

He’s coming in the end of the second term for Ronald Reagan.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    All right, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you\!

matt flegenheimer

He is in his 40s and —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I tell you today that America is a nation at risk.

matt flegenheimer

— he is kind of a generational change candidate.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    The clarion call from my generation is not ‘it is our turn,’ but
    rather, ‘it is our moment of obligation and opportunity.’

matt flegenheimer

He uses the words my generation quite a bit. This idea that after
Reagan, after a lot of stodgy older men —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    We literally have a chance to shape the future, to put our stamp on
    the face and character of America. This is not merely history. It is
    our destiny. \[APPLAUSE\]

matt flegenheimer

That it was time for a kind of breath of fresh air. And he was somebody
who was going to bring that.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    We need a new kind of presidential leadership, a presidential
    leadership that is prepared to tell the hard truths and lead this
    country.

matt flegenheimer

There’s not a signature proposal he’s running on. He’s really not a
12-point plan kind of candidate.

michael barbaro

That sounds like a pretty vague pitch to be making to voters.

matt flegenheimer

It is kind of vague. And he really struggled with articulating a
rationale beyond wanting to be president.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Ladies and gentlemen, there’s much more to say. But I don’t want to
    trespass on my time.

matt flegenheimer

It was not always clear exactly why he was running.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Government can do many things. But in the final analysis, government
    can act little more than as a catalyst. We must demand more of
    ourselves, for nothing will suffice short of a wholesale commitment
    of an entire society.

michael barbaro

And why do you think he was running?

matt flegenheimer

I think he wanted to be president. He is somebody who, by his own
account, talked about that in grade school. He’s somebody was elected to
the Senate at 29, took office shortly thereafter when he turned 30. And
this is a dream he had chased, in some measure, from the moment that he
entered public office. At the same time, he also looked around at the
fields in ‘88 and was unimpressed. They were sort of known derisively —
at the field at that point on the Democratic side — as the seven dwarfs.
It was sort of the put down in the press. And he looked at that group
and said, “Why not Joe Biden?”

michael barbaro

And when he enters this race, who is Joe Biden in this moment? What is
he actually known for, given his career up to that moment?

matt flegenheimer

So despite having been in the Senate at this point for going on three
terms just about, he’s really still known nationally best for being a
kind of tragic figure. He was elected to the Senate in 1972. The
following month, his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. His
two sons were injured. And he was immediately sort of identified in the
public consciousness as a figure of tremendous sympathy and as someone
who had been left to mourn in public by dint of his profession.

michael barbaro

So his early career in Congress is very much defined by this personal
tragedy, as much as any legislative accomplishment?

matt flegenheimer

That’s certainly true.

michael barbaro

So how does this campaign in ‘87 — how does it go?

matt flegenheimer

It goes fine for a while. He is somebody who is doing very well in
fundraising early on. He was drawing crowds even before he entered the
race in some of the early states he was visiting. And I think a lot of
figures within the party saw him as very formidable. And then —

  - archived recording  
    Now to the controversy that has suddenly erupted around the
    Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden.

matt flegenheimer

— he gets himself into trouble.

  - archived recording  
    The charge that he has plagiarized parts of his speeches.

matt flegenheimer

On a couple of occasions, he’s accused of lifting the words of others.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    And I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe
    Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university? Why is
    that my wife, who’s sitting out there in the audience, is the first
    in her family to ever go to college?

matt flegenheimer

The most memorable is at a debate in Iowa —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? Is it because
    I’m the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a
    graduate degree, that I was smarter than the rest?

matt flegenheimer

In Iowa, he is caught using the words of Neil Kinnock, who is a British
politician —

  - archived recording (neil kinnock)  
    Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to
    get to university? What is Glenys the first woman in her family in a
    thousand generations to be able to get to university? Was it because
    all our predecessors were thick?

matt flegenheimer

— and passing them off as his own.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Is it because they didn’t work hard? My ancestors, who worked in the
    coal mines in Northeast Pennsylvania and then would come up after 12
    hours and play football for four hours?

  - archived recording (neil kinnock)  
    Was it because they were weak? Those people who had worked eight
    hours underground and then come up and play football?

matt flegenheimer

He’s quoted Kinnock before on the trail and cited him appropriately. In
this instance, he just says the words as if they are extemporaneous Joe
Biden words. Does not mention Kinnock, no citation.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    No. It’s not because they weren’t as smart. It’s not because it
    didn’t work as hard. It’s because they didn’t have a platform upon
    which to stand.

  - archived recording (neil kinnock)  
    It was because there was no platform upon which they could stand.
    \[APPLAUSE\]

matt flegenheimer

And then it gets picked up in the press.

  - archived recording  
    Biden seemed to be claiming Kinnock’s vision and life as his own.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I should have said, “to paraphrase Neil Kinnock.”

  - archived recording  
    The problem here is that Senator Biden told his audience he’d just
    been thinking about these things. And he failed to give any credit
    at all to his famous British speechwriter.

matt flegenheimer

So this moment begets other moments, unpleasant moments for Joe Biden.

  - archived recording 1  
    CBS News found a tape of a second instance.

  - archived recording 2  
    Biden had appropriated a famous litany from the late Robert Kennedy
    about what the gross national product cannot measure.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    It cannot measure the health of our children —

  - archived recording (robert kennedy)  
    The health of our children —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    — the quality of their education —

  - archived recording (robert kennedy)  
    — the quality of their education —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    — the joy of their play.

  - archived recording (robert kennedy)  
    — or the joy of their play.

matt flegenheimer

There is a story on his record in law school —

  - archived recording 1  
    Joseph Biden admitted today that he committed plagiarism when he was
    in law school. He said it was a mistake, but that it was
    unintentional.

  - archived recording 2  
    He quoted five pages of someone else’s work without proper citation.

matt flegenheimer

Then —

  - archived recording (voter)  
    Question, what law school did you attend? And where did you place in
    that class?

matt flegenheimer

— a video from the spring circulates of him —

  - archived recording (voter)  
    And the other question is, could you quickly —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect.

matt flegenheimer

— essentially telling a voter in New Hampshire who asked about his
academic history, “I probably have a much higher I.Q. than you do, I
suspect.”

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in
    my class to have a full academic scholarship.

matt flegenheimer

And he goes on to exaggerate his record in law school, saying things
like, I was the only one in my class to get a full academic scholarship,
and other things that turned out not to be true. And that combination of
both the exaggeration and the sort of belligerence with a member of the
electorate did not sit well when that clip began circulating in a wider
fashion. And this sort of snowballs unto itself.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    If and when I’ve ever quoted anyone without saying this is their
    quote, it’s either because, in fact, it’s been clearly known by
    everyone what it is, or I honestly did not know I was quoting
    somebody else.

matt flegenheimer

He has always been dogged by this idea, and it’s an insecurity he’s
talked about a lot himself, that he was not necessarily a policy
heavyweight or a brilliant thinker. He didn’t go to an Ivy League
school. And there was something of a chip on his shoulder as a result of
this. And he really thinks he’s been disrespected in the national media,
not taken seriously enough. There’s a cliche on Capitol Hill about
workhorses and show horses. And the perception among a lot of people
watching him is that he’s a show horse.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I took the cases out of the law review article and the footnotes out
    of the law review article. And I thought what I was doing, honestly,
    was the right way to do it.

matt flegenheimer

And so he holds a kind of stop-the-bleeding press conference at the
Capitol, trying to essentially reset his campaign and stabilize himself
as a candidate.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    And I footnoted it.

matt flegenheimer

And it does not go well.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I was wrong. But I was not malevolent in any way.

matt flegenheimer

He comes off defensive, defiant.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    That I did not intentionally move to mislead anybody. I didn’t.

matt flegenheimer

And you can see him really start to see his initial case, which was so
rooted in his own personal integrity, start to fall away. And when that
falls away, there’s not a whole lot left. Because there was not a really
strong policy undergirding this campaign in the first place.

  - archived recording  
    \[PRESS CONFERENCE CHATTER\]

matt flegenheimer

By the fall, there is another thing happening.

  - archived recording (ronald reagan)  
    With great pleasure and deep respect for his extraordinary
    abilities, I today announce my intention to nominate United States
    Court of Appeals Judge Robert H. Bork.

matt flegenheimer

Reagan nominates Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. And there is
immediately an effort on the Democratic side to figure out how they can
best prevent a deeply conservative judge from reaching the court. And
Biden, who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, is
at the helm of that effort.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Those in favor of the Bork nomination will vote aye. Those opposed
    will vote no. The clerk will call the roll.

matt flegenheimer

So his team gets together.

  - archived recording (clerk)  
    Mr. Byrd?

  - archived recording (robert byrd)  
    No.

  - archived recording (clerk)  
    Mr. Metzenbaum?

  - archived recording (howard metzenbaum)  
    No.

matt flegenheimer

And one of his top advisers in the Senate essentially says to him —

  - archived recording (clerk)  
    Mr. DeConcini?

  - archived recording (dennis deconcini)  
    No.

matt flegenheimer

If we lose the Bork fight at this point —

  - archived recording (clerk)  
    Mr. Simon?

  - archived recording (paul simon)  
    No.

matt flegenheimer

— it will be because of us. And if we win, it’ll be in spite of us.

  - archived recording (clerk)  
    Mr. Thurmond?

  - archived recording (strom thurmond)  
    Aye.

matt flegenheimer

And that really resonates with him. He sees his day job as so essential,
not just because he ostensibly cares about the constituency he serves,
but because he has been so ridiculed as a figure of less than
considerable substance. A major Supreme Court hearing is quite the forum
to push back against that idea.

  - archived recording  
    Mr. Hatch?

  - archived recording (orrin hatch)  
    Aye.

  - archived recording  
    Mr. Simpson?

  - archived recording (alan simpson)  
    Aye.

matt flegenheimer

So months before anybody even gets a chance to weigh in at the polls in
Iowa and New Hampshire, Joe Biden is out.

  - archived recording  
    Mr. Grassley?

  - archived recording (chuck grassley)  
    Aye.

matt flegenheimer

He makes the decision himself. He’s going back to the Senate to finish
the Bork fight.

  - archived recording  
    Mr. Humphrey?

  - archived recording (gordon humphrey)  
    Aye.

  - archived recording  
    Mr. Biden?

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    No.

matt flegenheimer

And they win.

  - archived recording  
    The Robert Bork nomination ended today. The Senate voted by an
    overwhelming 58 to 42 margin to reject —

matt flegenheimer

Bork is not confirmed. And Biden has a lot to do with that. And it was a
major victory for him.

michael barbaro

So in order to protect his Senate career, he feels like he needs to end
his bid for president.

matt flegenheimer

He feels like he needs to end his bid for president. And at that point,
it is not at all clear that his bid for president would have gone
particularly well, anyway.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Mr. President, I’d like to make a few points here if I may.

matt flegenheimer

He goes back to the Senate and really resolves to kind of put his head
down and do the work of a senator, and aspires to this sort of legacy of
some of the lions of the Senate that he has gotten to know — fellow
Democrats, like a Ted Kennedy, and also Republicans who he’d really
grown close to over the years.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    So let me tell you, if your moral center is oil, I understand you.
    If your moral center is humanity, there is no comparing the
    restoration of Kuwait with ending of genocide in Bosnia.

matt flegenheimer

He is really pushing this kind of muscular foreign policy idea that
America should be a force for good in the world.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    And what is the message we send to the world if we stand by and we
    say, we’ll let it continue to happen here in this place, but it is
    not in our interest?

matt flegenheimer

He is pushing legislation around violence against women, pushing the
crime bill in the mid-‘90s under President Clinton.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    One of the things I want to do in addition to ending the crime is
    end the political carnage that goes on when we talk about crime.

matt flegenheimer

He is seen as a particularly capable bipartisan figure.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Crime is not Democrat or Republican.

matt flegenheimer

He talks about never questioning anybody’s motive — maybe their
politics, never their motive. And he is seen as kind of an honest broker
among Republicans, certainly in this period.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    And I think there’s a consensus among Republicans in that. Old
    barbed wire Republican conservatives \[INAUDIBLE\] want to hang them
    high, even those folks are saying, hey, we’ve got to deal with the
    root cause of this.

matt flegenheimer

Even if it earns him the disdain sometimes from the more liberal groups.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    And liberal Democrats who used to say, “Let’s look at the
    sociological underpinnings of why this occurred and we have to” —
    they’re now saying, hey, look, we’ve got to take back the streets.
    We’ll make that fight later.

matt flegenheimer

But he really makes a particularly concerted effort in these years when
he is not running for president to bring the kind of heft to the day job
that voters didn’t necessarily see in 1988.

michael barbaro

So when does Biden decide in the midst of this pretty successful
engagement in the Senate that he’s going to try to seek the presidency
again?

matt flegenheimer

It’s something he never lets go of fully. So he thinks about it in 2004,
as George W. Bush is seeking re-election. Decides against it in the end.
But ‘08 is the time when he decides —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Friends, today I filed the necessary papers to become candidate for
    President of the United States.

matt flegenheimer

— he’s ready for the second time.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    And along with my wife Jill and my children Beau, Hunter and Ashley,
    we really look forward to being out there on the campaign trail with
    you and getting a chance to meet you.

matt flegenheimer

And he’s running as a very different candidate, obviously. He’s been in
the Senate for more than 30 years. It’s his sixth term. And he brings
with that a set of experiences he didn’t have in 1988.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I’ve spent the last four years traveling back and forth to Iraq,
    meeting with our soldiers, our generals and our diplomats, and
    trying my level best to convince the president to change course.

matt flegenheimer

This is a moment of unpopular wars going on in the country. And he is
somebody, according to his pitch, who really understands those
challenges because of the work that he’s done in the Senate since his
last campaign.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    The next president of the United States is going to have to be
    prepared to immediately step in and act without hesitation to end
    our involvement in Iraq without further destabilizing the Middle
    East and the rest of the world.

matt flegenheimer

But as it turns out, that kind of experience did not necessarily
resonate widely with voters for a whole host of reasons.

  - archived recording  
    \[CHANTING\] Obama\! Obama\! Obama\! Obama\!

matt flegenheimer

For one —

  - archived recording  
    Obama\! Obama\!

matt flegenheimer

— he is a figure who is running up against a historic moment —

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    Thank you\!

matt flegenheimer

— in this Democratic primary.

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    Generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed —

matt flegenheimer

Barack Obama is running.

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    — that sums up the spirit of a people. Yes, we can. \[CHEERING\]
    Yes, we can.

matt flegenheimer

Hillary Clinton is running.

  - archived recording (hillary clinton)  
    The question isn’t whether we can keep America’s promise, it’s
    whether we will keep America’s promise. \[CHEERING\]

matt flegenheimer

And despite the relative inexperience in the Senate as his colleagues,
the non-historic nature of the Biden campaign as a white man in his 60s
really feels out of step with the times when set against these dynamic
and compelling and particularly history-making candidates against him.
At the same time, we see flashes of the ‘88 campaign Biden come to the
fore very early in this race.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    We’ve got the first sort of mainstream African-American —

  - archived recording  
    Yeah.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    — who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy. I
    mean, that’s a storybook, man.

  - archived recording  
    Yeah.

matt flegenheimer

He also just had a lot of these moments —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I spent last summer going through the Black sections of my town
    holding rallies in parks, trying to get Black men to understand it
    is not unmanly to wear a condom, getting women to understand they
    can say no, getting people in the position where testing matters.

matt flegenheimer

— these moments of sounding out of touch in kind of a cringe-worthy way.
Sort of an uncle at a family gathering saying something that he probably
shouldn’t.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I got tested for AIDS. I know Barack got tested for AIDS. There’s no
    shame in being tested for AIDS. It’s an important thing. Because the
    fact of the matter is, in the community, in the communities engaged
    in denial —

matt flegenheimer

And on the policy side, quite frankly on the most important foreign
policy issue of the day, despite his experience in the Senate that he
touted, he’s on the opposite side of Barack Obama. He voted for the Iraq
war. Obama did not. One of the points that Barack Obama made throughout
is: I may not have the experience on paper, but I do have the wisdom to
avoid a blunder such as that.

michael barbaro

Hm. So at just the moment when Biden thought that he had proven he was
the workhorse and the steady hand and the experienced kind of gray beard
of the Senate, that turned out to be the wrong kind of set of
experiences for the Democratic electorate.

matt flegenheimer

It just did not fit the moment. And there was really never a moment in
that campaign when he felt like a particularly serious threat to take
the nomination. The voters of Iowa render their verdict. And he drops
out almost immediately thereafter. But unlike ‘88, he really doesn’t
embarrass himself either, in the end. He is seen as a sort of affable,
knowledgeable peer among his rivals. But he does have to leave the race.

michael barbaro

So here we have another failed presidential bid. And for the second
time, Biden doesn’t really get all that far in these Democratic
primaries.

matt flegenheimer

No. Two campaigns, zero states won. But what he does get out of this
race is —

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    For months I’ve searched for a leader to finish this journey
    alongside me.

matt flegenheimer

— really earning the respect of the eventual nominee, Barack Obama.

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    Today I have come back to Springfield to tell you that I’ve found
    that leader. \[CHEERING\]

matt flegenheimer

So when the time comes to pick a running mate —

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    A man with a distinguished record, a man with fundamental decency.
    And that man is Joe Biden. \[CHEERING\]

matt flegenheimer

— Barack Obama chooses Joe Biden.

Biden at this point is not seen as particularly likely to seek the
presidency again. He’s obviously in his 60s. He’s run twice and failed.
But we now know there’s a conversation that the two of them have as he’s
offering Biden the running mate slot. And Obama says to him, this is in
Biden’s telling, I hope you see this as the capstone to your career. And
Biden says back to him, and not the tombstone.

michael barbaro

Mm.

matt flegenheimer

But that is set aside for the moment. He goes off into the Obama
campaign. And of course, Obama and Biden win that election.

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned
    from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on
    the streets of Scranton, the vice president-elect of the United
    States, Joe Biden. \[CHEERING\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

So just as after 1988, when Biden threw himself into the role of being a
senator, after he loses that ‘08 race, he really pours himself into the
vice presidency in this case.

matt flegenheimer

Absolutely. He sees himself as the sort of ultimate lieutenant for the
first Black president and takes very seriously the idea that they are
full partners. He wants to be the last person who Obama talks to before
making a major decision. He wants to be in the room where those tough
calls are happening. And I do think there is a parallel to that period
in his Senate life between these presidential runs. He definitely both
absorbs this idea that he should be doing the job he has and not the job
that he might aspire to and seems to believe it. And there is certainly
a belief among those in the Obama White House that he is not necessarily
giving up on those ambitions down the line. But he is not seen as
somebody positioning himself for a run either.

michael barbaro

And is that really the case, Matt? Because my sense is that by the time
Obama is ready to leave office, that ember that is Joe Biden’s perpetual
desire to seek the presidency is glowing pretty brightly.

matt flegenheimer

It is. And it probably never went out. You don’t think about such things
in grade school and relinquish them in your 70s.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

matt flegenheimer

But a couple of things happened late in Obama’s second term. And one of
them is political. Hillary Clinton’s running for president again. She is
effectively clearing the field, it seems. A lot of the Obama operation
is already lining up behind her. Barack Obama makes clear that he sees
her as a pretty suitable heir, potentially. And then tragically, there
is the death of Beau Biden, Joe’s eldest son, his political heir to the
would be Biden dynasty in Delaware. He was the state attorney general.
And it was wrenching. This was someone who had already been left to
grieve so publicly with such raw emotion early in his Senate life. And
for the second time, he is burying a child. So this was just a
particularly searing moment for all those who know and love Joe Biden.
And through some combination of the rawness of that mourning and how far
down the road the Clinton campaign had already gotten, he opts not to
run.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Good morning, folks. Please, please, sit down.

matt flegenheimer

He stands in the Rose Garden beside President Obama. And there’s a
moment at the beginning of that press conference that he says —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Mr. President, thank you for lending me the Rose Garden for a
    minute.

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    It’s a pretty nice place.

matt flegenheimer

And there is this sense watching that, that it was not a place that Joe
Biden would have to himself down the line, that this was probably his
last window to run.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I’ve
    said all along what I’ve said time and again to others, that it may
    very well be that that process, by the time we get through it,
    closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president.
    That it might close. I’ve concluded it has closed.

matt flegenheimer

It was a poignant reminder of all that he had been through prior, and
how he had come to be seen as this kind of avatar of trauma and
resilience and how central that was to his public arc throughout his
career. And to have this bookend this time as vice president was
something that, to Democrats and Republicans, just felt unfair.

michael barbaro

And I remember, Matt, thinking after watching that news conference that
this was his last chance to run for president. I think a lot of people
thought that. But it turned out that his presidential aspirations did
not end in the Rose Garden that day. He ran again in 2020. And after a
roller coaster campaign in which he was up and he was down and for a
moment it looked like he was almost written off, he prevails. And just a
couple of nights ago, he is formally designated the Democratic Party’s
nominee for president. And so I’m curious, in your mind, what he had
going for him in 2020 that he didn’t have in those previous two runs.

matt flegenheimer

Well, in some ways it’s a culmination of those runs and all that he had
experienced in the time since. He is fusing the kind of personal
integrity argument from his ‘88 campaign — his own character, his own
decency — and the experience case he’s making in ‘08, that he is
somebody who has been there, has seen it and knows what to do.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

matt flegenheimer

And it turns out that that combination becomes pretty compelling in
2020. He is somebody who, through the context of this moment, found a
rationale. His advisers would say he met the moment. In some ways, the
moment dictated it. He ran a campaign in the primary premised not
particularly on policy or ideology, but on the idea that the country is
better than this and that this president has to be defeated.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    My fellow Americans, there are moments in our history so grim, so
    heartrending that they’re forever fixed in each of our hearts,
    shared grief.

matt flegenheimer

And his campaign argument, in some ways, hinges almost exclusively on
this idea that he is a figure of unique perspective.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to
    this virus.

matt flegenheimer

In this moment of a pandemic, of a reckoning over racial justice, sort
of overlapping crises and traumas —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I think I know what you’re feeling. You feel like you’re being
    sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest. It’s
    suffocating.

matt flegenheimer

He is holding himself out as somebody who knows how to overcome such
things, because he has.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    This nation grieves with you. Take some solace from the fact we all
    grieve with you.

matt flegenheimer

It’s not as if his biography wasn’t compelling in past races. But it’s
so much more resonant in a moment of collective grief in the country and
of such tremendous trauma and upheaval in people’s daily lives. But at
the same time —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump,
    then you ain’t Black.

matt flegenheimer

— he is still the Joe Biden that audiences have seen and occasionally
chafed at seeing over the years. He is prone to gaffes. He had a handful
of interactions with voters on the trail during the primary —

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    You’re a damn liar, man. That’s not true. And no one has ever said
    that. No one has heard that —

matt flegenheimer

— that I think his campaign instantly regretted. Sort of
confrontational, evocative of that ‘I have a higher I.Q. than you do’
moment from ‘88.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    You said I set up my son to work in an oil company. Isn’t that what
    you said? Get your words straight, Jack.

matt flegenheimer

He’s liable to get carried away in front of a crowd, to exaggerate, to
misstate something on the debate stage. There is no question that those
weaknesses persist.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    And I can get things done. That’s why I’m running. And you want to
    check my shape on let’s do push ups together, man. Let’s run. Let’s
    do whatever you want to do.

matt flegenheimer

So in his first run in ‘88, he talked about how he saw presidential
history in cycles. You had these kind of bursts of progress and
upheaval, followed by these moments of correction where voters wanted to
choose a candidate who could let the country catch its breath. And the
implication then was that he was that candidate, that he was the
generational change, the burst of progress. And the implication now is
that he is the figure who can let America catch its breath. And there is
such a conspicuous passage of time in that. He is not running on
generational change as a 77-year-old man —

michael barbaro

Right.

matt flegenheimer

— in the way that he was 32 years ago. And that passage of time is
evident. You can hear it in his speeches. You can see it in his public
appearances. He has been through a lot. He has done a lot. He has earned
that agedness at this stage of his career.

michael barbaro

Matt, I wonder how it will feel for Joe Biden tonight, after all these
failed attempts, after all his personal tragedy, to finally have this
moment arrive some 30 years after he first tries for it. And I’m sure,
30 years of thinking about trying for it again. He will walk out, I
guess, to a podium. This is virtual. It will be weird. And he will
accept, at last, the Democratic party’s nomination for president. How is
that going to feel for him?

matt flegenheimer

I think like so much in his political career, it’ll be bittersweet. I
mean, think about the scene. He will not be in an arena in Milwaukee. He
will be at a remote location in Wilmington. He will not have a crowd of
people chanting his name. No balloons, no “We love Joe.” And I think
that reflects the moment but is also such a spectacular come down from
the vision of this that he might have had. He’s been thinking about the
presidency for decade after decade.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Today, I announce my candidacy for president of the United States of
    America. \[CHEERING\]

matt flegenheimer

And so much of it won’t look like he expected it to in this moment of
triumph.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    God bless you and thank you.

matt flegenheimer

Both superficially, because of the convention set up, and substantially,
most powerfully for him because Beau Biden won’t be there. In every
version of this speech that he’s imagined in his life up until Beau’s
death, I’m sure Beau Biden in the wings of the arena and helping him
prepare the speech is what he had in mind. And if there’s any
throughline to his public life, it’s this commingling of tragedy and
triumph. And in some ways, it’s a fitting coda to have him accepting the
nomination in a way so radically different from what he had hoped, and
so colored by the national grief and gloom of this moment and of the
country that he hopes to lead.

michael barbaro

Matt, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

matt flegenheimer

Thanks so much for having me.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (hillary clinton)  
    The morning after the last election, I said, we owe Donald Trump an
    open mind and the chance to lead. I meant it. Every president
    deserves that.

michael barbaro

On the third night of the Democratic National Convention, the last
Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton, implored Americans to
replace the man who defeated her in 2016 by electing Joe Biden.

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    I wish Donald Trump knew how to be a president because America needs
    a president right now.

michael barbaro

Later in the night, President Obama, standing before an image of the
United States Constitution, offered himself as a character witness for
his former vice president.

  - archived recording (barack obama)  
    12 years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I didn’t
    know I’d end up finding a brother. Joe and I come from different
    places, different generations. But what I quickly came to admire
    about Joe Biden is his resilience, born of too much struggle, his
    empathy, born of too much grief.

And in the night’s keynote speech, Senator Kamala Harris accepted the
party’s nomination for vice president, calling on the country to
confront structural racism and acknowledging that the challenges facing
her and Biden are enormous.

    So make no mistake, the road ahead is not easy. We may stumble. We
    may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal
    with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths. And we will act
    with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us.

Biden is scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech later tonight.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

To [borrow from Mr.
Biden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/us/politics/100000006624123/biden-bidenisms-debate.html),
that is not — entirely — hyperbole. Before he turned 30, Mr. Biden
kicked off a long-shot Senate bid from a [storied Wilmington
hotel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/hush-hush-preparations-were-underway-at-a-hotel-ballroom-in-delaware.html),
assailing divisiveness and preaching optimism about the capabilities of
the American people. Around five decades later, he is expected to touch
on similar themes in his remarks from a conference center here on
Thursday, less than two miles from the hotel where he began his career
in national politics.

“I would expect him to follow the same process he’s used for years,”
said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a close Biden ally
who said they spoke on Sunday. “You ask outside advisers. Message,
pollsters, political advisers — they give you sort of framing. Then you
go away, and you take a crack at it. Then you share it with the folks
who know you — I mean, literally his sister — with your sister, with
your spouse, with your closest political advisers. They give you some
input. Then you go and think about it some more. And then you give
*your* speech.”

The Biden campaign named two speechwriters, Vinay Reddy and Carlyn
Reichel, involved in the drafting of the candidate’s remarks but did not
discuss the process in detail.

While every prominent political figure becomes a practiced public
speaker through sheer force of repetition, the act is, for Mr. Biden,
almost definitional. Negotiating a stutter since his youth, Mr. Biden
carved out a national reputation built in large measure on the power,
preponderance and more-than-occasional precariousness of his words.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His belief in his own skills as an orator — his ability to persuade, to
move, to own the room — has been a through-line of his public arc, often
leading him to seek his own counsel despite any guidance he might absorb
from advisers.

One former Senate speechwriter recalled Mr. Biden describing their
working relationship like this: “I’m going to compare you to a golf
coach,” Mr. Biden told the aide. “If you try to change my swing, we’re
not going to get along.”

Matt Teper, a top Biden speechwriter during his vice presidency,
suggested Mr. Biden’s attention to detail could border on the obsessive.
“You have an engaged principal,” he said. “You’ve also got someone who,
on a word level, is caring about things that sometimes you’re like,
‘well, let’s leave the commas to me.’ But by and large, his engagement
makes things better.’”

Mr. Teper predicted that the final edits on Thursday would be made as
late as “an hour or two in advance” — or, perhaps, extemporaneously. “He
will change one thing as he delivers it,” Mr. Teper said, “to make it
better.”

Of course, Mr. Biden’s words have not always landed with care. His first
presidential bid, for the 1988 Democratic campaign, ended in a hail of
plagiarism accusations. His next one, 20 years later, [reinforced
perceptions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/02/01/us/politics/01biden.html)
of verbal recklessness almost immediately, when Mr. Biden gave an
interview in which he called Mr. Obama, his fellow competitor, “the
first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean
and a nice-looking guy.”

When Mr. Biden became Mr. Obama’s vice president, his incaution by turns
frustrated White House aides and cemented Mr. Biden’s standing as a kind
of incorrigible tale-telling uncle, prone to exaggeration or profanity
on a live mic. On the campaign trail this cycle, he often wandered
off-script, into meandering asides, [verbal
missteps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/30/us/politics/joe-biden-debate-gaffes.html)
and the occasional [inaccurate

that had to be [walked

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet it is also no coincidence that scores of families have trusted Mr.
Biden with the most sacred speechmaking task: [delivering
eulogies.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/us/politics/joe-biden-funeral-speech.html)
His fluency in grief and resilience was forged through his own grim
fate, burying his first wife and daughter — who died in a car crash just
after his first Senate election — and his son Beau, who died of brain
cancer in
2015.

“They’re very difficult,” said former Senator Ted Kaufman, a longtime
Biden friend and former chief of staff who briefly succeeded him in the
Senate, in an interview this spring about Mr. Biden’s eulogy-writing
process. “It takes a lot out of him emotionally, but also just
physically. It is real — it isn’t like he sits down and does it on the
back of an envelope or something like that. He really concentrates on
these eulogies. He spends time on them. It takes out of whatever else
he’s doing.”

Former Biden speechwriters have said that Mr. Biden was more engaged,
and easier to work with, on eulogies than on virtually any other kind of
speech.

But the skills he has developed when he is at his best as a eulogist —
an ability to communicate empathy and a sense of hope to people
confronting unfathomable loss — may be important preparation for a
nominating speech Mr. Biden makes to a grieving nation confronting an
uncertain future.

“He’s going to show people that he’s going to connect with real people,”
said Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan. “That he
understands that they’re scared.”

Mr. Biden entered convention week fresh off the search for a
vice-presidential contender. While he selected Senator Kamala Harris of
California, he had extensive conversations with a list of candidates
representing a diverse range of personal and political backgrounds, and
a number of Democrats said they expected that process to have also
informed his thinking about how to address the nation.

“I’m sure it did,” said Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of
Delaware and a co-chair of Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential search
committee. “Their personal stories, I think, are representative of
America. I think all of that will feed into the remarks that he gives.
But ultimately I think he’s going to really focus on the resilience of
our country and the future direction we’re going to go in.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though Mr. Biden and his party have never encountered a convention quite
like this, he has been something of a regular through the years for the
in-person affairs.

Since at least as far back as 1980, he has addressed Democratic National
Conventions, accompanied occasionally by presidential rumblings.

While some television networks cut away during his speech that year,
according to an account in The News Journal of Wilmington, his local
supporters never lost faith.

From their perch on the convention floor, delegates from Delaware held a
banner hinting at a future that would have to wait a bit longer than
they had hoped back then: “Biden in ’84.”
