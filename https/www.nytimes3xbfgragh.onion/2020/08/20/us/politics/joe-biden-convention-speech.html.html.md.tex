Life}\label{the-speech-joe-biden-has-been-preparing-for-his-entire-life}}

Some of it is familiar, after almost 50 years in politics. Some of it,
like delivering such a momentous address to a virtual crowd, will be
new.

WILMINGTON, Del. --- Over his near half-century in public life, Joseph
R. Biden Jr. has made many speeches: good speeches, bad speeches,
campaign kickoff speeches and concession speeches, speeches without
proper attribution to original sources, speeches so impossibly Biden
that no one could ever accuse him of lifting anything.

``No one ever doubts that I mean what I say,'' Mr. Biden, 77, is fond of
telling audiences. ``The problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean.''

What he means to say on Thursday, as he accepts the Democratic
presidential nomination in the most important --- and likely most
surreal --- address of his career, has been something of a work in
progress for several decades, since he charged onto the national stage
as a 29-year-old senator-elect and sparked his first presidential
speculation soon after.

And so, friends said, some elements of his preparation process were to
be expected. There would be consultations with a coterie of family
members and his longest-serving advisers, including his sister Valerie
Biden Owens; his wife, Jill Biden; and his chief strategist, Mike
Donilon. He would cycle through multiple drafts, reflecting a
longstanding habit of tinkering until the end, often by hand.

Mr. Biden and his team have also conferred with close friends and others
he admires about themes and narrative arcs. Jon Meacham, the
presidential historian, has been among those contributing to the
process. (The title of a recent book by Mr. Meacham, ``The Soul of
America,'' has been echoed by Mr. Biden throughout his presidential bid,
including in his campaign slogan.)

But other parts of the task this week were less familiar. Namely:
planning to deliver remarks with virtually no audience --- distressing
for a politician who has long fed off the energy of a crowd --- with his
top supporters left to uncork
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/virtual-dnc-donors.html}{miniature
bottles of confetti} (supplied by the Biden team for solo watch parties)
amid a pandemic that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{has
claimed} more than 170,000 American lives.

Mr. Biden's speech, those close to him say, will be fashioned
accordingly to meet the moment: more sober than jubilant, more
restrained than swaggering, in his most ambitious effort yet to offer
the American people a vision of steady leadership and national unity in
the face of extraordinary crises.

``The times dictate a different type of speech,'' said former Gov. Terry
McAuliffe, Democrat of Virginia and a close ally of Mr. Biden's. ``This
is a different speech, this is a different time, than probably any other
time going back to the days of F.D.R. when we were dealing with a world
war and we were dealing with a Depression. This is a very serious
speech.''

Asked how long Mr. Biden had been preparing for his Thursday appearance,
Mr. McAuliffe replied, ``for his entire life.''

  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''
  Tonight when Joe Biden formally accepts the Democratic Party's
  nomination for president, it will be the culmination of a 30-year
  quest and two failed runs for the office. My colleague, Matt
  Flegenheimer, on a delayed victory that looks nothing like Biden had
  planned.

  It's Thursday, August 20.

  {[}CHEERING{]} America needs someone who can inspire once again in our
  people faith and trust in our government. America needs someone with a
  heart.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Matt, take us back to when Joe Biden first runs for president. Where
does that story start?

matt flegenheimer

That story starts at a train station in Wilmington, Delaware in June of
1987.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  And we thank you, Delaware, for giving us that person, the next
  president of the United States, Joe Biden.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He's coming in the end of the second term for Ronald Reagan.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  All right, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you!
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He is in his 40s and ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I tell you today that America is a nation at risk.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

--- he is kind of a generational change candidate.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  The clarion call from my generation is not `it is our turn,' but
  rather, `it is our moment of obligation and opportunity.'
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He uses the words my generation quite a bit. This idea that after
Reagan, after a lot of stodgy older men ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  We literally have a chance to shape the future, to put our stamp on
  the face and character of America. This is not merely history. It is
  our destiny. {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

That it was time for a kind of breath of fresh air. And he was somebody
who was going to bring that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  We need a new kind of presidential leadership, a presidential
  leadership that is prepared to tell the hard truths and lead this
  country.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

There's not a signature proposal he's running on. He's really not a
12-point plan kind of candidate.

michael barbaro

That sounds like a pretty vague pitch to be making to voters.

matt flegenheimer

It is kind of vague. And he really struggled with articulating a
rationale beyond wanting to be president.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Ladies and gentlemen, there's much more to say. But I don't want to
  trespass on my time.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

It was not always clear exactly why he was running.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Government can do many things. But in the final analysis, government
  can act little more than as a catalyst. We must demand more of
  ourselves, for nothing will suffice short of a wholesale commitment of
  an entire society.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And why do you think he was running?

matt flegenheimer

I think he wanted to be president. He is somebody who, by his own
account, talked about that in grade school. He's somebody was elected to
the Senate at 29, took office shortly thereafter when he turned 30. And
this is a dream he had chased, in some measure, from the moment that he
entered public office. At the same time, he also looked around at the
fields in `88 and was unimpressed. They were sort of known derisively
--- at the field at that point on the Democratic side --- as the seven
dwarfs. It was sort of the put down in the press. And he looked at that
group and said, ``Why not Joe Biden?''

michael barbaro

And when he enters this race, who is Joe Biden in this moment? What is
he actually known for, given his career up to that moment?

matt flegenheimer

So despite having been in the Senate at this point for going on three
terms just about, he's really still known nationally best for being a
kind of tragic figure. He was elected to the Senate in 1972. The
following month, his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. His
two sons were injured. And he was immediately sort of identified in the
public consciousness as a figure of tremendous sympathy and as someone
who had been left to mourn in public by dint of his profession.

michael barbaro

So his early career in Congress is very much defined by this personal
tragedy, as much as any legislative accomplishment?

matt flegenheimer

That's certainly true.

michael barbaro

So how does this campaign in `87 --- how does it go?

matt flegenheimer

It goes fine for a while. He is somebody who is doing very well in
fundraising early on. He was drawing crowds even before he entered the
race in some of the early states he was visiting. And I think a lot of
figures within the party saw him as very formidable. And then ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Now to the controversy that has suddenly erupted around the Democratic
  presidential candidate Joseph Biden.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

--- he gets himself into trouble.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  The charge that he has plagiarized parts of his speeches.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

On a couple of occasions, he's accused of lifting the words of others.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  And I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe
  Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university? Why is
  that my wife, who's sitting out there in the audience, is the first in
  her family to ever go to college?
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

The most memorable is at a debate in Iowa ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? Is it because
  I'm the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a
  graduate degree, that I was smarter than the rest?
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

In Iowa, he is caught using the words of Neil Kinnock, who is a British
politician ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (neil kinnock)\\
  Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get
  to university? What is Glenys the first woman in her family in a
  thousand generations to be able to get to university? Was it because
  all our predecessors were thick?
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

--- and passing them off as his own.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Is it because they didn't work hard? My ancestors, who worked in the
  coal mines in Northeast Pennsylvania and then would come up after 12
  hours and play football for four hours?
\item
  archived recording (neil kinnock)\\
  Was it because they were weak? Those people who had worked eight hours
  underground and then come up and play football?
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He's quoted Kinnock before on the trail and cited him appropriately. In
this instance, he just says the words as if they are extemporaneous Joe
Biden words. Does not mention Kinnock, no citation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  No. It's not because they weren't as smart. It's not because it didn't
  work as hard. It's because they didn't have a platform upon which to
  stand.
\item
  archived recording (neil kinnock)\\
  It was because there was no platform upon which they could stand.
  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And then it gets picked up in the press.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  Biden seemed to be claiming Kinnock's vision and life as his own.
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I should have said, ``to paraphrase Neil Kinnock.''
\item
  archived recording\\
  The problem here is that Senator Biden told his audience he'd just
  been thinking about these things. And he failed to give any credit at
  all to his famous British speechwriter.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

So this moment begets other moments, unpleasant moments for Joe Biden.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  CBS News found a tape of a second instance.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  Biden had appropriated a famous litany from the late Robert Kennedy
  about what the gross national product cannot measure.
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  It cannot measure the health of our children ---
\item
  archived recording (robert kennedy)\\
  The health of our children ---
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  --- the quality of their education ---
\item
  archived recording (robert kennedy)\\
  --- the quality of their education ---
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  --- the joy of their play.
\item
  archived recording (robert kennedy)\\
  --- or the joy of their play.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

There is a story on his record in law school ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Joseph Biden admitted today that he committed plagiarism when he was
  in law school. He said it was a mistake, but that it was
  unintentional.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  He quoted five pages of someone else's work without proper citation.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

Then ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (voter)\\
  Question, what law school did you attend? And where did you place in
  that class?
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

--- a video from the spring circulates of him ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (voter)\\
  And the other question is, could you quickly ---
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

--- essentially telling a voter in New Hampshire who asked about his
academic history, ``I probably have a much higher I.Q. than you do, I
suspect.''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in
  my class to have a full academic scholarship.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And he goes on to exaggerate his record in law school, saying things
like, I was the only one in my class to get a full academic scholarship,
and other things that turned out not to be true. And that combination of
both the exaggeration and the sort of belligerence with a member of the
electorate did not sit well when that clip began circulating in a wider
fashion. And this sort of snowballs unto itself.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  If and when I've ever quoted anyone without saying this is their
  quote, it's either because, in fact, it's been clearly known by
  everyone what it is, or I honestly did not know I was quoting somebody
  else.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He has always been dogged by this idea, and it's an insecurity he's
talked about a lot himself, that he was not necessarily a policy
heavyweight or a brilliant thinker. He didn't go to an Ivy League
school. And there was something of a chip on his shoulder as a result of
this. And he really thinks he's been disrespected in the national media,
not taken seriously enough. There's a cliche on Capitol Hill about
workhorses and show horses. And the perception among a lot of people
watching him is that he's a show horse.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I took the cases out of the law review article and the footnotes out
  of the law review article. And I thought what I was doing, honestly,
  was the right way to do it.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And so he holds a kind of stop-the-bleeding press conference at the
Capitol, trying to essentially reset his campaign and stabilize himself
as a candidate.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  And I footnoted it.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And it does not go well.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I was wrong. But I was not malevolent in any way.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He comes off defensive, defiant.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  That I did not intentionally move to mislead anybody. I didn't.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And you can see him really start to see his initial case, which was so
rooted in his own personal integrity, start to fall away. And when that
falls away, there's not a whole lot left. Because there was not a really
strong policy undergirding this campaign in the first place.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}PRESS CONFERENCE CHATTER{]}
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

By the fall, there is another thing happening.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (ronald reagan)\\
  With great pleasure and deep respect for his extraordinary abilities,
  I today announce my intention to nominate United States Court of
  Appeals Judge Robert H. Bork.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

Reagan nominates Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. And there is
immediately an effort on the Democratic side to figure out how they can
best prevent a deeply conservative judge from reaching the court. And
Biden, who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, is
at the helm of that effort.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Those in favor of the Bork nomination will vote aye. Those opposed
  will vote no. The clerk will call the roll.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

So his team gets together.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (clerk)\\
  Mr. Byrd?
\item
  archived recording (robert byrd)\\
  No.
\item
  archived recording (clerk)\\
  Mr. Metzenbaum?
\item
  archived recording (howard metzenbaum)\\
  No.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And one of his top advisers in the Senate essentially says to him ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (clerk)\\
  Mr. DeConcini?
\item
  archived recording (dennis deconcini)\\
  No.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

If we lose the Bork fight at this point ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (clerk)\\
  Mr. Simon?
\item
  archived recording (paul simon)\\
  No.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

--- it will be because of us. And if we win, it'll be in spite of us.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (clerk)\\
  Mr. Thurmond?
\item
  archived recording (strom thurmond)\\
  Aye.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And that really resonates with him. He sees his day job as so essential,
not just because he ostensibly cares about the constituency he serves,
but because he has been so ridiculed as a figure of less than
considerable substance. A major Supreme Court hearing is quite the forum
to push back against that idea.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  Mr. Hatch?
\item
  archived recording (orrin hatch)\\
  Aye.
\item
  archived recording\\
  Mr. Simpson?
\item
  archived recording (alan simpson)\\
  Aye.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

So months before anybody even gets a chance to weigh in at the polls in
Iowa and New Hampshire, Joe Biden is out.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  Mr. Grassley?
\item
  archived recording (chuck grassley)\\
  Aye.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He makes the decision himself. He's going back to the Senate to finish
the Bork fight.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  Mr. Humphrey?
\item
  archived recording (gordon humphrey)\\
  Aye.
\item

  Mr. President, I'd like to make a few points here if I may.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He goes back to the Senate and really resolves to kind of put his head
down and do the work of a senator, and aspires to this sort of legacy of
some of the lions of the Senate that he has gotten to know --- fellow
Democrats, like a Ted Kennedy, and also Republicans who he'd really
grown close to over the years.

America should be a force for good in the world.

  Crime is not Democrat or Republican.

matt flegenheimer

He talks about never questioning anybody's motive --- maybe their

among Republicans, certainly in this period.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

  And I think there's a consensus among Republicans in that. Old barbed

  even those folks are saying, hey, we've got to deal with the root
  cause of this.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

Even if it earns him the disdain sometimes from the more liberal groups.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  And liberal Democrats who used to say, ``Let's look at the
  sociological underpinnings of why this occurred and we have to'' ---
  they're now saying, hey, look, we've got to take back the streets.
  We'll make that fight later.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

But he really makes a particularly concerted effort in these years when
he is not running for president to bring the kind of heft to the day job
that voters didn't necessarily see in 1988.

michael barbaro

So when does Biden decide in the midst of this pretty successful
engagement in the Senate that he's going to try to seek the presidency
again?

matt flegenheimer

It's something he never lets go of fully. So he thinks about it in 2004,
as George W. Bush is seeking re-election. Decides against it in the end.
But `08 is the time when he decides ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Friends, today I filed the necessary papers to become candidate for

  And along with my wife Jill and my children Beau, Hunter and Ashley,
  we really look forward to being out there on the campaign trail with

\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And he's running as a very different candidate, obviously. He's been in
the Senate for more than 30 years. It's his sixth term. And he brings
with that a set of experiences he didn't have in 1988.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I've spent the last four years traveling back and forth to Iraq,
  meeting with our soldiers, our generals and our diplomats, and trying
  my level best to convince the president to change course.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

This is a moment of unpopular wars going on in the country. And he is
somebody, according to his pitch, who really understands those
challenges because of the work that he's done in the Senate since his
last campaign.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

  The next president of the United States is going to have to be

But as it turns out, that kind of experience did not necessarily
resonate widely with voters for a whole host of reasons.

And despite the relative inexperience in the Senate as his colleagues,
the non-historic nature of the Biden campaign as a white man in his 60s
really feels out of step with the times when set against these dynamic
and compelling and particularly history-making candidates against him.
At the same time, we see flashes of the `88 campaign Biden come to the

\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

--- these moments of sounding out of touch in kind of a cringe-worthy
way. Sort of an uncle at a family gathering saying something that he
probably shouldn't.

matt flegenheimer

And on the policy side, quite frankly on the most important foreign
policy issue of the day, despite his experience in the Senate that he
touted, he's on the opposite side of Barack Obama. He voted for the Iraq
war. Obama did not. One of the points that Barack Obama made throughout
is: I may not have the experience on paper, but I do have the wisdom to
avoid a blunder such as that.

michael barbaro

Hm. So at just the moment when Biden thought that he had proven he was
the workhorse and the steady hand and the experienced kind of gray beard
of the Senate, that turned out to be the wrong kind of set of
experiences for the Democratic electorate.

matt flegenheimer

It just did not fit the moment. And there was really never a moment in
that campaign when he felt like a particularly serious threat to take
the nomination. The voters of Iowa render their verdict. And he drops
out almost immediately thereafter. But unlike `88, he really doesn't
embarrass himself either, in the end. He is seen as a sort of affable,
knowledgeable peer among his rivals. But he does have to leave the race.

michael barbaro

So here we have another failed presidential bid. And for the second
time, Biden doesn't really get all that far in these Democratic
primaries.

matt flegenheimer

No. Two campaigns, zero states won. But what he does get out of this
race is ---

matt flegenheimer

--- Barack Obama chooses Joe Biden.

Biden at this point is not seen as particularly likely to seek the
presidency again. He's obviously in his 60s. He's run twice and failed.
But we now know there's a conversation that the two of them have as he's
offering Biden the running mate slot. And Obama says to him, this is in
Biden's telling, I hope you see this as the capstone to your career. And
Biden says back to him, and not the tombstone.

michael barbaro

Mm.

matt flegenheimer

But that is set aside for the moment. He goes off into the Obama
campaign. And of course, Obama and Biden win that election.

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

So just as after 1988, when Biden threw himself into the role of being a
senator, after he loses that `08 race, he really pours himself into the
vice presidency in this case.

matt flegenheimer

Absolutely. He sees himself as the sort of ultimate lieutenant for the
first Black president and takes very seriously the idea that they are
full partners. He wants to be the last person who Obama talks to before
making a major decision. He wants to be in the room where those tough
calls are happening. And I do think there is a parallel to that period
in his Senate life between these presidential runs. He definitely both
absorbs this idea that he should be doing the job he has and not the job
that he might aspire to and seems to believe it. And there is certainly
a belief among those in the Obama White House that he is not necessarily
giving up on those ambitions down the line. But he is not seen as
somebody positioning himself for a run either.

michael barbaro

And is that really the case, Matt? Because my sense is that by the time
Obama is ready to leave office, that ember that is Joe Biden's perpetual
desire to seek the presidency is glowing pretty brightly.

matt flegenheimer

It is. And it probably never went out. You don't think about such things
in grade school and relinquish them in your 70s.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

matt flegenheimer

But a couple of things happened late in Obama's second term. And one of
them is political. Hillary Clinton's running for president again. She is
effectively clearing the field, it seems. A lot of the Obama operation
is already lining up behind her. Barack Obama makes clear that he sees
her as a pretty suitable heir, potentially. And then tragically, there
is the death of Beau Biden, Joe's eldest son, his political heir to the
would be Biden dynasty in Delaware. He was the state attorney general.
And it was wrenching. This was someone who had already been left to
grieve so publicly with such raw emotion early in his Senate life. And
for the second time, he is burying a child. So this was just a
particularly searing moment for all those who know and love Joe Biden.
And through some combination of the rawness of that mourning and how far
down the road the Clinton campaign had already gotten, he opts not to
run.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Good morning, folks. Please, please, sit down.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

He stands in the Rose Garden beside President Obama. And there's a
moment at the beginning of that press conference that he says ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  Mr. President, thank you for lending me the Rose Garden for a minute.
\item
  archived recording (barack obama)\\
  It's a pretty nice place.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

And there is this sense watching that, that it was not a place that Joe
Biden would have to himself down the line, that this was probably his
last window to run.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I've said
  all along what I've said time and again to others, that it may very
  well be that that process, by the time we get through it, closes the
  window on mounting a realistic campaign for president. That it might
  close. I've concluded it has closed.
\end{itemize}

matt flegenheimer

It was a poignant reminder of all that he had been through prior, and
how he had come to be seen as this kind of avatar of trauma and
resilience and how central that was to his public arc throughout his
career. And to have this bookend this time as vice president was
something that, to Democrats and Republicans, just felt unfair.

michael barbaro

And I remember, Matt, thinking after watching that news conference that
this was his last chance to run for president. I think a lot of people
thought that. But it turned out that his presidential aspirations did
not end in the Rose Garden that day. He ran again in 2020. And after a
roller coaster campaign in which he was up and he was down and for a
moment it looked like he was almost written off, he prevails. And just a
couple of nights ago, he is formally designated the Democratic Party's
nominee for president. And so I'm curious, in your mind, what he had
going for him in 2020 that he didn't have in those previous two runs.

matt flegenheimer

Well, in some ways it's a culmination of those runs and all that he had
experienced in the time since. He is fusing the kind of personal
integrity argument from his `88 campaign --- his own character, his own
decency --- and the experience case he's making in `08, that he is
somebody who has been there, has seen it and knows what to do.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

matt flegenheimer

And it turns out that that combination becomes pretty compelling in
2020. He is somebody who, through the context of this moment, found a
rationale. His advisers would say he met the moment. In some ways, the
moment dictated it. He ran a campaign in the primary premised not
particularly on policy or ideology, but on the idea that the country is
better than this and that this president has to be defeated.

matt flegenheimer

So in his first run in `88, he talked about how he saw presidential
history in cycles. You had these kind of bursts of progress and
upheaval, followed by these moments of correction where voters wanted to
choose a candidate who could let the country catch its breath. And the
implication then was that he was that candidate, that he was the
generational change, the burst of progress. And the implication now is
that he is the figure who can let America catch its breath. And there is
such a conspicuous passage of time in that. He is not running on
generational change as a 77-year-old man ---

michael barbaro

Right.

matt flegenheimer

--- in the way that he was 32 years ago. And that passage of time is
evident. You can hear it in his speeches. You can see it in his public
appearances. He has been through a lot. He has done a lot. He has earned
that agedness at this stage of his career.

michael barbaro

Matt, I wonder how it will feel for Joe Biden tonight, after all these
failed attempts, after all his personal tragedy, to finally have this
moment arrive some 30 years after he first tries for it. And I'm sure,
30 years of thinking about trying for it again. He will walk out, I
guess, to a podium. This is virtual. It will be weird. And he will
accept, at last, the Democratic party's nomination for president. How is
that going to feel for him?

matt flegenheimer

I think like so much in his political career, it'll be bittersweet. I
mean, think about the scene. He will not be in an arena in Milwaukee. He
will be at a remote location in Wilmington. He will not have a crowd of
people chanting his name. No balloons, no ``We love Joe.'' And I think
that reflects the moment but is also such a spectacular come down from
the vision of this that he might have had. He's been thinking about the
presidency for decade after decade.

matt flegenheimer

Both superficially, because of the convention set up, and substantially,
most powerfully for him because Beau Biden won't be there. In every
version of this speech that he's imagined in his life up until Beau's
death, I'm sure Beau Biden in the wings of the arena and helping him
prepare the speech is what he had in mind. And if there's any
throughline to his public life, it's this commingling of tragedy and
triumph. And in some ways, it's a fitting coda to have him accepting the
nomination in a way so radically different from what he had hoped, and
so colored by the national grief and gloom of this moment and of the
country that he hopes to lead.

from Mr. Biden}, that is not --- entirely --- hyperbole. Before he
turned 30, Mr. Biden kicked off a long-shot Senate bid from a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/hush-hush-preparations-were-underway-at-a-hotel-ballroom-in-delaware.html}{storied
Wilmington hotel}, assailing divisiveness and preaching optimism about
the capabilities of the American people. Around five decades later, he
is expected to touch on similar themes in his remarks from a conference
center here on Thursday, less than two miles from the hotel where he
began his career in national politics.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/20/us/politics/20orator-02/merlin_162387960_dc993347-0a15-4d6f-90e9-23c9ac34fcdc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

``I would expect him to follow the same process he's used for years,''
said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a close Biden ally
who said they spoke on Sunday. ``You ask outside advisers. Message,
pollsters, political advisers --- they give you sort of framing. Then
you go away, and you take a crack at it. Then you share it with the
folks who know you --- I mean, literally his sister --- with your
sister, with your spouse, with your closest political advisers. They
give you some input. Then you go and think about it some more. And then
you give \emph{your} speech.''

The Biden campaign named two speechwriters, Vinay Reddy and Carlyn
Reichel, involved in the drafting of the candidate's remarks but did not
discuss the process in detail.

While every prominent political figure becomes a practiced public
speaker through sheer force of repetition, the act is, for Mr. Biden,
almost definitional. Negotiating a stutter since his youth, Mr. Biden
carved out a national reputation built in large measure on the power,
preponderance and more-than-occasional precariousness of his words.

His belief in his own skills as an orator --- his ability to persuade,
to move, to own the room --- has been a through-line of his public arc,
often leading him to seek his own counsel despite any guidance he might
absorb from advisers.

One former Senate speechwriter recalled Mr. Biden describing their
working relationship like this: ``I'm going to compare you to a golf
coach,'' Mr. Biden told the aide. ``If you try to change my swing, we're
not going to get along.''

Matt Teper, a top Biden speechwriter during his vice presidency,
suggested Mr. Biden's attention to detail could border on the obsessive.
``You have an engaged principal,'' he said. ``You've also got someone
who, on a word level, is caring about things that sometimes you're like,
`well, let's leave the commas to me.' But by and large, his engagement
makes things better.'''

Mr. Teper predicted that the final edits on Thursday would be made as
late as ``an hour or two in advance'' --- or, perhaps, extemporaneously.
``He will change one thing as he delivers it,'' Mr. Teper said, ``to
make it better.''

Of course, Mr. Biden's words have not always landed with care. His first
presidential bid, for the 1988 Democratic campaign, ended in a hail of
plagiarism accusations. His next one, 20 years later,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/02/01/us/politics/01biden.html}{reinforced
perceptions} of verbal recklessness almost immediately, when Mr. Biden
gave an interview in which he called Mr. Obama, his fellow competitor,
``the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and
clean and a nice-looking guy.''

When Mr. Biden became Mr. Obama's vice president, his incaution by turns
frustrated White House aides and cemented Mr. Biden's standing as a kind
of incorrigible tale-telling uncle, prone to exaggeration or profanity
on a live mic. On the campaign trail this cycle, he often wandered
off-script, into meandering asides,

Yet it is also no coincidence that scores of families have trusted Mr.
Biden with the most sacred speechmaking task:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/us/politics/joe-biden-funeral-speech.html}{delivering
eulogies.} His fluency in grief and resilience was forged through his
own grim fate, burying his first wife and daughter --- who died in a car
crash just after his first Senate election --- and his son Beau, who
died of brain cancer in 2015.

``They're very difficult,'' said former Senator Ted Kaufman, a longtime
Biden friend and former chief of staff who briefly succeeded him in the
Senate, in an interview this spring about Mr. Biden's eulogy-writing
process. ``It takes a lot out of him emotionally, but also just
physically. It is real --- it isn't like he sits down and does it on the
back of an envelope or something like that. He really concentrates on
these eulogies. He spends time on them. It takes out of whatever else
he's doing.''

Former Biden speechwriters have said that Mr. Biden was more engaged,
and easier to work with, on eulogies than on virtually any other kind of
speech.

But the skills he has developed when he is at his best as a eulogist ---
an ability to communicate empathy and a sense of hope to people
confronting unfathomable loss --- may be important preparation for a
nominating speech Mr. Biden makes to a grieving nation confronting an
uncertain future.

``He's going to show people that he's going to connect with real
people,'' said Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan.
``That he understands that they're scared.''

Mr. Biden entered convention week fresh off the search for a
vice-presidential contender. While he selected Senator Kamala Harris of
California, he had extensive conversations with a list of candidates
representing a diverse range of personal and political backgrounds, and
a number of Democrats said they expected that process to have also
informed his thinking about how to address the nation.

``I'm sure it did,'' said Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat
of Delaware and a co-chair of Mr. Biden's vice-presidential search
committee. ``Their personal stories, I think, are representative of
America. I think all of that will feed into the remarks that he gives.
But ultimately I think he's going to really focus on the resilience of
our country and the future direction we're going to go in.''

Though Mr. Biden and his party have never encountered a convention quite
like this, he has been something of a regular through the years for the
in-person affairs.

Since at least as far back as 1980, he has addressed Democratic National
Conventions, accompanied occasionally by presidential rumblings.

While some television networks cut away during his speech that year,
according to an account in The News Journal of Wilmington, his local
supporters never lost faith.

From their perch on the convention floor, delegates from Delaware held a
banner hinting at a future that would have to wait a bit longer than
they had hoped back then: ``Biden in '84.''
