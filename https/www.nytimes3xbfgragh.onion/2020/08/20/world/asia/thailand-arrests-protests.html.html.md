# Thailand Police Arrest Activists, Escalating Protest Crackdown

</div>

Rappers, a lawyer and other government critics have been accused of
sedition, a crime that can carry a 7-year prison sentence.

BANGKOK — His offense was syncopated. And it rhymed.

Dechathorn Bamrungmuang, a member of the Thai collective [Rap Against
Dictatorship](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/15/world/asia/rap-video-thailand-liberate-p.html),
was arrested on Thursday on charges of sedition, human rights lawyers
said, part of a mounting crackdown by a government seemingly allergic to
dissent.

A day earlier, the authorities took into custody for the second time a
lawyer who had publicly called for the [Thai monarchy’s powers to be
reined
in](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/13/world/asia/protests-thailand-king-monarchy.html).
At least six pro-democracy activists were also arrested on Wednesday and
Thursday on charges of sedition, a crime that can carry a seven-year
prison sentence, the organization Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said.
Another rapper was taken in, too. Yet more student activists were served
with papers that appeared to indicate they could be imminently detained.

“The United Nations and concerned governments should speak out publicly
against the rolling political repression in Thailand,” Brad Adams, Asia
director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “Thai youth are
increasingly demanding real progress toward democracy and the rule of
law so they can freely express their visions for the future of the
country.”

The legal actions followed weeks of protests by students that culminated
on Sunday in the [largest street
rally](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/world/asia/thailand-protests-democracy-monarchy.html)
in Thailand since a military coup six years ago. Because of a state of
emergency imposed to control the coronavirus, the protests were
technically illegal. But that did not stop more than 10,000 people from
gathering at Democracy Monument in Bangkok.

On Wednesday, hundreds of students, who have been protesting school
rules like [mandatory
haircuts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/asia/thailand-student-protest-military.html)
and the tradition of prostrating themselves to teachers, gathered at the
Education Ministry in Bangkok, calling for an end to the regimented
strictures of Thai society. They raised three fingers in the air, a
symbol of defiance drawn from the “Hunger Games” films that was once
banned by the junta behind the 2014 coup.

Thailand has held elections over the decades, but meddling by the
military has regularly upended the people’s vote, with a dozen
successful coups since absolute monarchy was abolished in 1932. A former
army chief who led the last coup, Prayuth Chan-ocha, remains prime
minister. Three other retired generals hold cabinet positions.

Mr. Prayuth has said that he is willing to listen to the students. He
has also joked that he would like to execute journalists who veer from
the truth and assailed those who have called for more accountability
over the monarchy.

The junta leaders said protecting the palace was a key reason for their
putsch, and the current government, which took power last year after
elections that independent observers said were flawed, often wraps its
policies in a royal mantle.

in Europe. Since his father died in 2016, he has consolidated his
authority, taking control of royal coffers and army units that

Thailand is bound by strict laws that criminalize criticism of the
monarchy, potentially landing offenders in jail for up to 15 years. In
addition to the lèse-majesté laws, the government has also imprisoned
people for contravening sedition and computer crimes laws. Hundreds of
people have been funneled through so-called attitude adjustment camps
that are run out of military compounds. [Dissidents have
disappeared](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/world/asia/thailand-dissidents-disappeared-military.html),
too, with some of their bodies turning up mutilated.

The transgression of Mr. Dechathorn, who goes by the rap name
Hockhacker, appears to have been a musical performance at a
pro-democracy rally, according to the group of rights lawyers.

In 2018, Rap Against Dictatorship, the Thai musical collective, drew
millions of hits for a widely shared video for a song called “[What My
Country Has Got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZvzvLiGUtw).” The song
referenced a student massacre and called Mr. Prayuth’s government to
account for leading a “country that makes fake promises like loading
bullets, creates a regime and orders us to love it.”

Another song, released this year, took on student hazing. The collective
was awarded the Vaclav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent in 2019.

Sirin Mungcharoen, a pro-democracy activist from Chulalongkorn
University in Bangkok, said she received a police summons on Wednesday
related to a protest in Bangkok on July 18. Ms. Sirin said that she had
attended that student rally, but was not an organizer.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“It’s a way to create fear,” Ms. Sirin said, adding, “I will keep
fighting.”
