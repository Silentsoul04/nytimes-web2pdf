Poison has been a preferred tool of the Russian security service for

MOSCOW — Without the slightest premonition of any issues with his
health, Pyotr Verzilov, a Russian opposition activist, suddenly fell
violently ill two years ago and slipped into a coma, a common problem
for opponents of the Kremlin.

Mr. Verzilov, who is known for staging antigovernment performance art,
displayed the same, mysterious symptoms [that struck Aleksei
Navalny](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/world/europe/navalny-poison-russia.html),
Russia’s most prominent opposition politician, on Thursday as he was on
a flight to Moscow.

“I was in exactly the same condition,” Mr. Verzilov said in an interview
Thursday with Rain TV, an independent Russian television station, of his
monthlong illness in 2018.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Verzilov was kept alive on a ventilator and later flown to Germany
for treatment. Though doctors found no trace of poison, he said that he
is convinced it was the cause, and that the Kremlin was
responsible.

Poison, though redolent of medieval intrigue, has been a favored tool of
Russian intelligence agencies for more than a century. And critics of
the Kremlin and independent analysts say the weapon remains in use
today. While other countries, including the United States and Israel,
have targeted killing programs, they are strictly limited to
counterterrorism efforts. Russia, by contrast, has been accused of
targeting a wide variety of opponents both at home and abroad.

The Soviet Union operated a secret laboratory to research tasteless and
untraceable poisons that were tested on condemned gulag prisoners,
security service defectors have said.

After a series of assassinations and attempted assassinations of
dissidents, journalists, defectors and opposition leaders in Russia and
abroad over the past two decades, researchers have concluded the
post-Soviet government has [turned to its poison
arsenal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/21/world/europe/moscow-kremlin-silence-critics-poison.html)
as a preferred weapon.

Substances that have been identified or suspected in poisonings blamed
on the Russian government include radioactive polonium-210; heavy
metals; gelsemium, a rare Himalayan plant toxin; and Novichuk, a
military nerve agent lethal to the touch.

Lacing a meal or a cup of tea — the last substance Mr. Navalny is said
to have consumed at an airport cafe before falling ill — with poison is
simple and requires no special training, Gennadi V. Gudkov, a former
opposition member of Parliament and onetime colonel in the K.G.B., said
in a telephone interview on Thursday.

“It is easy, and easy to cover your tracks,” he said. “Any person can
use poison.” Poisons can be intended either to kill or to incapacitate a
person with a long and unpleasant illness, he said.

Ukraine’s former pro-Western president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, for
example, was left with his face disfigured after a poisoning with the
industrial pollutant dioxin — most likely concealed in a meal of boiled
crayfish. Mr. Yushchenko attributed the poisoning to Russian agents.

The Kremlin has for years regarded Mr. Navalny as an enemy because of
his investigations into graft by officials. He has been harassed and
jailed numerous times, but only for short periods.

Mr. Navalny was rushed to a Siberian hospital after his flight made an
emergency landing on Thursday because of his sudden illness. Doctors
have not announced a cause.

The state-owned news agency Tass quoted an unidentified law enforcement
source as saying that the authorities were not yet considering the
possibility of a deliberate poisoning. Mr. Navalny’s personal doctor,
Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said he has not seen Mr. Navalny since the illness
began, so he could not say whether poison was the cause. But, he added,
“it looks like it.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If Mr. Navalny were poisoned before or during his flight, it would not
be the first time an opposition figure was targeted while sitting in the
controlled environment of a commercial airplane in Russia.

In 2015, the opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza fell into a
weeklong coma in Moscow. He later said he believed he had ingested a
poison during the in-flight service on an Aeroflot plane.

His symptoms included swelling in his brain and kidney failure. His
wife, Yevgenia, recalled that his arms and legs took on a blue hue, an
alarming, almost cartoonish reaction to poison.

Mr. Kara-Murza said he was poisoned and survived a second time in 2017
while traveling in Russia to show a documentary about another Russian
politician, Boris Y. Nemtsov, who in 2015 was shot and killed on a
bridge in
Moscow.

In 2004, the opposition journalist Anna Politkovskaya was also poisoned
on a domestic flight operated by another airline, Karat. She drank a
poisoned cup of tea, she said. She survived but two years later was shot
and killed in her apartment elevator.

Toxins lethal to the touch have also come to light. The [Arab-born
terrorist Ibn al-Khattab died in 2002 in his mountain hide-out in
Chechnya](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/02/01/world/europe/01torture.html)
after opening a letter laced with a nerve agent.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some toxins may have also slipped from government arsenals and into the
organized crimes wars in Russia in the early post-Soviet period. In
1995, for example, a Russian banker, Ivan K. Kivelidi, died after coming
in contact with a poison deadly to the touch. The cause of his death
might have remained a mystery had his secretary not also died of the
same symptoms, apparently because the poison had been spread on an
office telephone handset.
