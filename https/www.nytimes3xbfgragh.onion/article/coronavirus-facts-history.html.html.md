We don’t really know when the novel coronavirus first began infecting
people. But as we turn a page on our calendars into June, it is fair to
say that [Sars-Cov-2 has been with us now for a full six
months](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html).

At first, it had no name or true identity. Early in January, news
reports referred to [strange and threatening symptoms that had sickened
dozens of people in a large Chinese
city](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html)
with which many people in the world were probably not familiar. After
half a year, that large metropolis, Wuhan, is well-known, as is the
coronavirus and the illness it causes, Covid-19.

In that time, many reporters and editors on the health and science desk
at The New York Times have shifted our journalistic focus as we have
sought to tell the story of the coronavirus pandemic. While [much
remains unknown and
mysterious](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/01/health/coronavirus-mysteries.html)
after six months, there are some things we’re pretty sure of. These are
some of those insights.

Summer is almost here, states are reopening and new coronavirus cases
are declining or, at least, holding steady in many parts of the United
States. At [least 100 scientific
teams](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html?searchResultPosition=6)
around the world are racing to develop a vaccine.

That’s about it for the good news.

The virus has shown no sign of going away: We will be in this pandemic
era for the long haul, likely a year or more. The masks, the social
distancing, the fretful hand-washing, the aching withdrawal from friends
and family — those steps are still the best hope of staying well, and
will be for some time to come.

“This virus just may become another endemic virus in our communities,
and this virus may never go away,” Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director
of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program, warned
last month. Some scientists think that the longer we live with the
virus, [the milder its effects will
become,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html)
but that remains to be seen.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Predictions that millions of doses of a vaccine may be available by the
end of this year may be too rosy. No vaccine has ever been created that
fast.

The disease would be less frightening if there were a treatment that
could cure it or, at least, prevent severe illness. But there is not.
Remdesivir, the eagerly awaited antiviral drug? “Modest” benefit is the
highest mark experts give it.

Which brings us back to masks and social distancing, which have come to
feel quite antisocial. If only we could go back to life the way it used
to be.

We cannot. Not yet. There are just enough wild cards with this disease —
perfectly healthy adults and children who inexplicably become very, very
sick — that no one can afford to be cavalier about catching it. About
[35 percent of infected people have no
symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html)
at all, so if they are out and about, they could unknowingly infect
other people.

Enormous questions loom. Can workplaces be made safe? What about trains,
subways, airplanes, school buses? How many people can work from home?
When would it be safe to reopen schools? How do you get a 6-year-old
with the attention span of a squirrel to socially distance?

The bottom line: Wear a mask, keep your distance. When the time comes in
the fall, get a flu shot, to protect yourself from one respiratory
disease you can avoid and to help keep emergency rooms and urgent care
from being overwhelmed. Hope for a treatment, a cure, a vaccine. Be
patient. We have to pace ourselves. If there’s such a thing as a disease
marathon, this is it.

The debate over whether Americans should wear face masks to control
coronavirus transmission has been settled. Although public health
authorities gave confusing and often contradictory advice in the early
months of the pandemic, most experts now agree that if everyone wears a
mask, individuals protect one
another.

Researchers know that even simple masks can effectively stop droplets
spewing from an infected wearer’s nose or mouth. In a [study published
in April in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2),
scientists showed that when people who are infected with influenza,
rhinovirus or a mild cold-causing coronavirus wore a mask, it blocked
nearly 100 percent of the viral droplets they exhaled, as well as some
tiny aerosol particles.

Still, mask wearing remains uneven in many parts of the United States.
But governments and businesses are beginning to require, or at least
recommend, that masks be worn in many public settings.

There is also growing evidence that some kinds of masks may protect you
from other people’s germs. High-grade N95 masks are cleared by federal
public health agencies because they filter out at least 95 percent of
particles that are 0.3 microns in diameter when properly worn. One study
showed that N95s were able to capture [over 90 percent of viral
particles](https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553\(05\)00911-9/fulltext#articleInformation),
even if the particles were about one-fifth the size of a coronavirus.
Other studies have shown that flat, blue surgical masks block between 50
to 80 percent of particles, whereas [cloth masks block 10 to 30
percent](https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/54/7/789/202744) of
tiny particles.

“Wearing a mask is better than nothing,” said Dr. Robert Atmar, an
infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine. Because the
coronavirus typically infects people by entering their body through the
mouth and nose, covering these areas can act as the first line of
defense against the virus, he said.

Donning a face covering is also likely to prevent you from touching your
face, which is another way the coronavirus can be transmitted from
contaminated surfaces to unsuspecting individuals. And when combined
with hand washing and other protective measures, such as [social
distancing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/us/politics/social-distancing-coronavirus.html),
masks help reduce the transmission of disease, Dr. Atmar said.

The United States knows how to fight wars. But, as the past few months
have shown, the American response to pathogens can easily become a
shambles — even though pathogens kill more Americans than many wars
have.

We have no viral Pentagon. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is more of an F.B.I. for outbreak investigations than a war
machine. For years — under both the Obama and Trump administrations —
its leaders have had to seek clearance for almost every utterance.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the most prominent of the doctors advising the
coronavirus task force, is actually the head of a research institute,
the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, rather than
of the medical equivalent of a combat battalion.

The Surgeon General is essentially an admiral without a crew. He
dispenses health warnings and recommendations, but the Public Health
Services Commissioned Corps, which reports to him, are only about 6,500
strong, and many members have other jobs, often at the C.D.C.

Almost all the front-line troops — the contact tracers, the laboratory
technicians, the epidemiologists, the staff in state and city hospitals
— are paid by state and local health departments whose budgets have
shriveled for years. These soldiers are led by 50 commanders, in the
form of governors, and with that many in charge, it is amazing that any
response moves forward.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The rest of the response is in the hands of thousands of private
militias — hospitals, insurers, doctors, nurses, respiratory
technicians, pharmacists and so on, all of whom have individual
employers. Within limits, they can do what they want. When they cannot
get something they need from overseas, they are largely powerless
without federal logistical help.

As war does to defeated nations, pandemics expose the weaknesses of
their systems. Our patchwork and uncoordinated response has produced
more than 100,000 deaths; surely we can do better.

“The superpowers have their priorities all wrong,” Dr. Michael Ryan, the
head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program, said recently.

“They spend billions on missiles and submarines, and on fighting
terrorism, and pennies on viruses. You can start peace talks with your
enemy. You can change your policies to lessen the threat of terrorism.
But you cannot negotiate with a virus, and we know that new threats are
coming along every year.”

unclear](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/politics/house-simulus-vote.html).)

The vast majority of this spending has been aimed at blunting the
economic pain of small businesses shutting down and people losing their
jobs or being furloughed. Congress also provided additional money for
Medicaid and other social programs.

Hospitals, community health centers and other providers have been
allocated $175 billion to cover the cost of caring for patients with
Covid-19 and for the visits, procedures and surgeries that were canceled
because of the pandemic. In the latest bill, $25 billion was targeted
for coronavirus testing.

Many experts say more funding is needed, but there is ample controversy
over how the money already allocated is being spent and which entities
are getting funds. Various groups like the Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget[are tracking the
spending.](http://www.crfb.org/blogs/covid-money-tracker-policies-enacted-to-date)
By that organization’s calculation, roughly $1.6 trillion has already
been disbursed or committed. The Federal Reserve has also provided more
than $2 trillion in emergency lending, asset purchases and other
activities, it said.

## We have a long way to go to fix virus testing.

The landscape for testing looks far better than it did in the early days
of the outbreak, when [a botched rollout of coronavirus
tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html)
failed to detect the spread of the virus in the United States.

Today, [hundreds of thousands of tests a day are being conducted in the
United States](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily), and in some
areas it is so widely available that public health officials have
complained [they do not have enough
takers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/as-coronavirus-testing-expands-a-new-problem-arises-not-enough-people-to-test/2020/05/17/3f3297de-8bcd-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html).
In Los Angeles, where testing is free to everyone, [a drive-through site
at Dodgers
Stadium](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-26/los-angeles-opens-largest-coronavirus-testing-site-at-dodger-stadiu)
can process 6,000 people a day.

The range of tests available is also expanding. Tests that once required
a health care worker to insert a swab through the nose to the back of
the throat can now be done with a swipe inside the nose, or by spitting
into a cup. A handful of companies [now sell at-home test
kits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/health/fda-in-home-test-coronavirus.html),
and [a test from
Abbott](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/12/us/coronavirus-testing-white-house.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
can detect the virus in as little as five minutes.

In addition to the tests that detect active infections, Americans can
also get tested for antibodies to the virus, which shows whether they
have ever been infected, and could help give a better picture for how
widely the coronavirus has spread in communities.

But despite this progress, the United States still has a long way to go.
Public health experts say that anywhere from [900,000
tests](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/07/851610771/u-s-coronavirus-testing-still-falls-short-hows-your-state-doing)
to [millions a
day](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/paul-romer-on-how-to-survive-the-chaos-of-the-coronavirus)
will be needed to screen hospital patients, nursing home residents and
employees returning to work.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And even as testing is abundant in some areas, it is still hard to come
by in others. Shortages of key supplies needed to run the tests — such
as swabs and chemical reagents — have persisted. The [federal government
has effectively delegated
oversight](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/25/health/coronavirus-testing-trump.html)<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>to the states, creating a patchwork of policies and putting
states in competition with one another. Even tracking the number of
tests conducted has proved difficult, [after the
C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/us/politics/coronavirus-tests-cdc.html)and
several states began lumping tests for the virus as well as antibodies
together, to the bafflement of epidemiologists trying to track active
infections, which the antibody tests do not show.

## We can’t count on herd immunity to keep us healthy.

The idea is simplicity itself: If enough of the population has
antibodies to the novel coronavirus, the virus will hit too many dead
ends to continue infecting people. [That is herd
immunity.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/28/upshot/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html)

That is the great hope for a vaccine. But it may not happen, even if a
vaccine becomes available, as experience with flu vaccines shows.

Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University
of Pennsylvania noted that while vaccines eliminated measles, rubella
and smallpox and almost eliminated polio in the United States, vaccines
against influenza and whooping cough have not stopped outbreaks. (With
some parents declining measles vaccines, the disease is coming back.)

Influenza and whooping cough have spread, even after enough people in a
community have been vaccinated to, in theory, stop the diseases. That’s
because the antibodies that protect people against viruses infecting
mucosal surfaces like the lining of the nose tend to be short-lived.

Vaccines against respiratory diseases are, at best, modestly effective,
agreed Dr. Arnold Monto of the University of
Michigan,

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Since the coronavirus usually starts by infecting the respiratory
system, Dr. Monto suspects that a Covid-19 vaccine would have a similar
effect to a flu vaccine — it will reduce the incidence of the disease
and make it less severe on average, but it will not make Covid-19 go
away.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

He would like the virus to disappear, of course, but a vaccine that
reduces the disease’s spread and severity is a lot better than nothing.

“As an older person, what I want is not to end up on a respirator,” Dr.
Monto said.

## The virus produces more symptoms than expected.

Covid-19 is a viral respiratory illness. Many early descriptions of
symptoms focused on patients being short of breath and eventually being
placed on ventilators. But the virus does not confine its assault to the
lungs, and doctors have identified a number of symptoms and syndromes
associated with it.

In some patients, the virus propels the immune system into overdrive,
causing the lungs to fill with fluid and damaging multiple organs,
including the brain, heart, kidneys and liver.

The first symptoms of an infection are usually a cough and shortness of
breath. But in April [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html)
sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed.

Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
of one’s sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some
cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on the fingers and
toes, but few other serious symptoms.

Severe disease leads to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress
syndrome. The blood oxygen levels plummet, and patients may get
supplemental oxygen or be placed on a machine, called a ventilator, to
help them breathe.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But even without lung impairment, the disease can cause injury to the
kidneys, heart or liver. Critically ill patients are prone to developing
dangerous blood clots in the legs and the lungs. In rare cases, the
disease triggers ischemic strokes that block the arteries supplying
blood to the brain, or brain impairments, such as altered mental status
or encephalopathy.

Death [can result
from](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30558-4/fulltext)
heart failure, kidney failure, multiple organ failure, respiratory
distress or shock.

## We can worry a bit less about infection from surfaces.

The news, when it was reported, added a frightening twist to the threat
from the coronavirus: A study in March in The New England Journal of
Medicine found that under laboratory conditions, the virus can [survive
for up to three
days](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-surfaces-aerosols.html)
on some surfaces, such as plastic and steel, and on cardboard for up to
24 hours.

Other studies reported finding the virus on air vents in hospital rooms
and on [computer mice, sickbed handrails and
doorknobs](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0885_article).

Many people grew worried that by touching a surface that had been
covered in droplets by an infected person, and then touching their own
mouth, nose or eyes, they then would contract the virus.

You should still wear a mask, avoid touching your face in public and
keep washing your hands. But none of these studies tested for live
virus, only for traces of its genetic material. Other scientists
commenting on these studies said virus on these surfaces might degrade
more quickly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said
since March that contaminated surfaces are “not thought to be the main
way” the virus spreads.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The main driver of infection is thought to be directly inhaling droplets
released when an infected person sneezes, coughs, sings or talks. The
C.D.C. recently made changes to its website to make this message even
more explicit.

## We can also worry less about a mutating virus.

In February, three experts on viruses published [an editorial in a
journal headlined](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0690-4)
“We Shouldn’t Worry When a Virus Mutates During Outbreaks.”

But worry we did. As the coronavirus pandemic swept the planet,
headlines and tweets poured forth that the new coronavirus was
undergoing dangerous
[mutations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/health/coronavirus-korber-mutation.html).

Many of these worries were based on a misunderstanding of what it means
when a virus mutates. When an infected cell produces new viruses, it
sometimes makes mistakes in copying the viral genes. Those mistakes are
mutations, and it turns out that most are bad for the viruses, getting
in the way of their ability to hijack our cells.

The viruses that do manage to spread to new hosts have mutations, too.
But those mutations often don’t have any significant effect. The
alterations they bring to a virus’s genes don’t lead to any change in
how the virus works.

Scientists have identified harmless new mutations in different lineages
of the new coronavirus. These lineages are not dangerous new strains.

Some of these lineages have come to be the most common version of the
coronavirus in some countries. Again, that doesn’t mean that they’ve got
some evolutionary edge. There’s a very common phenomenon in nature
called the founder effect: Whatever mutations happen to be common in the
founders of a new population will end up common in their descendants.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is possible for viruses to gain mutations that do affect the way they
work. The new coronavirus will be no different. But the only way to know
if a new mutation is significant or not is to carry out research. It
will take a lot of evidence to reject the more likely hypothesis: that a
new mutation has no importance at all.

Fortunately, it doesn’t look like coronaviruses will be picking up these
new mutations very quickly. Compared with other viruses, scientists have
found, the new coronavirus has a relatively slow rate of new mutations.

That’s a big relief for vaccine makers. Influenza viruses mutate so
quickly that people need to get a new flu shot each year to stay
protected. H.I.V. has so much genetic diversity that an effective
vaccine against it has yet to be found. The new coronavirus poses
immense challenges to vaccine makers, but most of them have to do with
manufacturing billions of doses in a matter of months.

We have enough worries when it comes to Covid-19; no need to add
needless ones to the list.

## We can’t count on warm weather to defeat the virus.

The hot and humid weather of summer [will not stop the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/health/virus-summer-pandemic.html).
More sunlight and humidity may slow down its spread, but we probably
won’t know by how much. Other factors, like reduced travel, increased
personal distance, closed schools, canceled gatherings and mask-wearing,
have effects that would outweigh the influence of the weather.

A few things are known about conditions that do or do not favor the
virus. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight help destroy the virus on
surfaces and some studies have shown a small effect from humidity. It
seems to last longest on hard surfaces like plastic and metal. It [won’t

indoors.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html)

A wooden bench under a bright sun at a breezy beach is a better bet than
a metal and plastic recliner on the shady side of the pool. But if

with no immunity waiting to be infected. Bring on the sun; the novel
coronavirus will survive.

Air conditioning[may blow the virus right to your restaurant

On Memorial Day, many people in the United States gathered in congenial
