The
coronavi[rus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/coronavirus-us.html),
which surfaced in a Chinese seafood and poultry market late last year,
has spread to [at least 177
countries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html),
killing more than 610,200 and sickening more than 14.7 million in a
matter of months. The [World Health
Organization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-world-health-organization.html)
has declared the situation a pandemic.

Here’s a timeline of the outbreak so far.

Dec.
31

## Chinese authorities treated dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause.

On Dec. 31, the[government in Wuhan, China,
confirmed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html)
that health authorities were treating dozens of cases. Days later,
researchers in China [identified a new
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html)
that had infected dozens of people in Asia. At the time, there was no
evidence that the virus was readily spread by humans. Health officials
in China said they were monitoring it to prevent the outbreak from
developing into something more severe.

Jan. 11

## China reported its first death.

On Jan. 11, Chinese state media reported the [first known
death](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/10/world/asia/china-virus-wuhan-death.html)
from an illness caused by the virus, which had infected dozens of
people. The 61-year-old man who died was a regular customer at the
market in Wuhan. The report of his death came just before one of China’s
biggest holidays, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the
country.

Jan. 20

## Other countries, including the United States, confirmed cases.

The first confirmed cases outside mainland China occurred in Japan,
South Korea and Thailand, according to the W.H.O.’s first [situation
report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4).
The first confirmed case in the United States came the next day in
Washington State, where [a man in his 30s developed
symptoms](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/21/health/cdc-coronavirus.html)
after returning from a trip to Wuhan.

American citizens or permanent residents. By this date, [213 people had
died](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html#link-6a63a9b7)

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

May 29

## India lifted lockdown as its cases skyrocketed.

More than two months after India went into one of the world’s most
severe lockdowns, the country moved to ease restrictions. Experts feared
it was the worst timing: Infections were increasing quickly, including
among migrant workers, leading to outbreaks in villages across Northern
India. Almost half of the country’s 160,000 known cases had been traced
to just four cities: New Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Mumbai, where
hospitals had been overwhelmed.

cases, but only [18 days for that figure to
double](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/06/1066142). While the sharp
rise in cases could be explained by an increase in testing, the agency
said, more than half of the 54 countries on the continent were
experiencing community transmissions. Ten countries were driving the
rise in numbers and accounted for nearly 80 percent of all cases. South
Africa has a quarter of the total cases.

and seven deaths. But on July 10, it shut down its school system as it
worked to contain a third wave of infections, which official reported
included 38 new cases.

The third wave, which comes after [infections surged in
March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/world/asia/coronavirus-china-hong-kong-singapore-south-korea.html)
and were contained by May, was a setback for a city that had [largely
returned to
normal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/19/world/asia/coronavirus-hong-kong.html),
with restaurants enjoying packed crowds and workers returning to
offices.

President Trump wore a mask in public for the first time during a visit
to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, following repeated
urging from aides that it was a necessary message to send to Americans
resistant to covering their faces. The president had repeatedly
[dismissed
suggestions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/us/politics/100000007070943/trump-mask-coronavirus.html)
that he wear a mask, frequently appearing in public spaces without one
and ignoring public health rules in several states.

## More than five million Americans lost health insurance.

The coronavirus pandemic stripped an estimated 5.4 million Americans of
their health insurance between February and May, a period in which more
adults became uninsured because of job losses than have ever lost
coverage in a single year, [according to a
study](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/politics/coronavirus-health-insurance-trump.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article).

sprawling metropolis of 14 million had reported a total of just under
8,200 cases and 325 deaths.

## A study in South Korea found that older children spread the virus comparably to adults.

While school districts around the United States struggle with reopening
plans, [a study from South
Korea](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-1315_article) offered
a note of caution. It found that children between the ages of 10 and 19
can spread the virus at least as well as adults do, suggesting that
middle and high schools in particular may seed new clusters of
infection. Children younger than 10 transmit to others much less often,
according to the study, although the risk is not zero.
