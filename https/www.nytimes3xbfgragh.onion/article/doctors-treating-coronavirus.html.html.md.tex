Emergency room doctors drenched in sweat and critical care nurses
scrambling for protective equipment have quickly come to personify the
heroism and tragedy of the coronavirus pandemic.

Like the ash-covered firefighters of Sept. 11, we'll remember these
health care workers and their sacrifice and resilience on the front
lines long after Covid-19 fades away. They put themselves in harm's way,
often without the necessary equipment to protect themselves or the
resources to treat many of their patients.

What does it mean for these professionals to risk their own health ---
and their families' --- for the greater good? And what toll has it
taken?

If you're a health care worker confronting the spread of the
coronavirus, we want to hear from you. We invite you to share your story
below and submit a photograph of yourself or a video responding to our
questions. If you prefer to share in one format, please choose one.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-health-care-workers.html}{We
are publishing many of the responses here.} If you send us your story, a
Times reporter or editor may contact you to learn more. If you submit a
video, we may feature it in an
\href{https://www.instagram.com/nytimes/}{Instagram Story on @nytimes}.

\subsubsection{PHOTOS}\label{photos}}

We want to see you on the front line of the coronavirus fight. Send us a
photo of yourself as you get ready for a new day or a picture of
yourself at the end of your shift.

To see examples, browse these
\href{https://www.instagram.com/covid_nurses/}{other selfies from
medical workers}.

\textbf{When taking your photo, please:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Dress how you dress for your job.
\item
  Position yourself in front of a window or outside, so that sunlight
  falls onto your face. If there are bright lights on behind you, please
  turn them off.
\item
  Look into the lens.
\item
  Tap your face on the phone so the camera will focus and expose
  correctly for your face.
\item
  Photos should be head-and-shoulders or waist-up portraits.
\item
  If possible, or helpful, ask someone to hold the camera for you.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{video}{%
\subsubsection{VIDEO}\label{video}}

\textbf{In your recording, we'd like you to respond to these three
prompts:}

1. Tell us your name, age, where you're from and what you do.

2. Tell us about the most intense experience you have had fighting
Covid-19.

3. How has the coronavirus outbreak affected you, i.e., what sacrifices
have you had to make to do your job?

\textbf{When taking your video, please:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hold your phone upright to shoot vertically.
\item
  Keep your response to each question under 15 seconds.
\item
  Position yourself in front of a window or outside, so that sunlight
  falls onto your face. If there are bright lights on behind you, please
  turn them off.
\item
  Look into the lens.
\item
  Tap your face on the phone so the camera will focus and expose
  correctly for your face.
\item
  Leave a small bit of room above your head and aim to include at least
  your head and shoulders in the frame.
\item
  Record somewhere with limited background noise so we can hear you
  clearly.
\item
  If possible, or helpful, ask someone to hold the camera for you.
\end{itemize}

We may feature your video in an
\href{https://www.instagram.com/nytimes/}{Instagram Story on @nytimes}.
