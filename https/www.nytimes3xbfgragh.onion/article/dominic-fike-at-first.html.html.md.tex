First'}\label{the-new-york-times-presents-dominic-fike-at-first}}

\emph{Watch on Friday, Aug. 7, at 10 p.m. on FX and streaming on Hulu.}

Dominic Fike was fresh out of jail when he landed a multimillion-dollar
record deal.

He didn't have an album or even a single that could be heard, but a few
mysterious demo tracks posted to the internet were enough to kick off a
frenzied bidding war for an artist who record executives believed could
be their next breakout star.

``It was ugly and competitive as it should be --- nice and old-school,''
said Imran Majid, an executive vice president / co-president of A\&R at
Columbia Records, which eventually signed Fike, then 22.

It was a big bet to make on an artist with no music anyone had heard,
and Fike's genre-bending crossover appeal prompted some critics to
speculate that he was a music-industry plant, dreamed up by marketing
executives.

``I hope people don't think I'm a fraud for trying to show depth,'' Fike
said. He spent two years trying to refine his sound while discovering
his voice. The result is ``What Could Possibly Go Wrong,'' Fike's debut
album released on Friday.

The making of the album --- and Fike as an artist --- was a winding
process of self-discovery at the same time the music industry was trying
to find its footing in a marketplace transformed by streaming, touring
and social media.

Watch how it all came together in our new documentary, which follows
Fike's journey from Naples, Fla., to his first world tour. ``This is
really the very beginning,'' he said.
