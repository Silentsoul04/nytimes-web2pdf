HBO?}\label{how-do-i-get-hbo-max-if-i-already-have-hbo}}

Almost 35 million people have HBO. But not all of them can get HBO Max.
Here's what you need to know.

AT\&T's new streaming platform HBO
Max\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/business/media/hbo-max-netflix-streaming.html}{went
live on Wednesday}, but for many HBO subscribers, it was not entirely
clear whether they had access to the service.

Millions currently do not. That's because AT\&T could not strike deals
in time for the launch with some key distributors and a few device
makers. Only those who purchased HBO through the right distributor and
have the approved device could watch HBO Max.

HBO Max costs the same as HBO (\$15 a month) and is intended to convert
HBO users to the new service, which offers twice as much content.

Confused? Here's a handy guide:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For those who already pay for HBO through a \textbf{traditional TV
  provider}, you're in luck. HBO Max hashed out agreements with most of
  the major players, including Comcast, the nation's largest cable
  operator, thanks to a last-minute deal signed Wednesday. Those
  customers can download the app and sign in with their HBO Go or pay-TV
  account. (Here's the
  \href{https://help.hbomax.com/Answer/Detail/2360}{full list} of
  providers.)
\item
  But if you're planning to watch on an \textbf{Amazon Fire} or
  \textbf{Roku} device, you're out of luck. AT\&T could not reach
  agreements with either. Both Amazon and Roku get a cut of revenue from
  streaming providers, and the structure of those deals can get
  complicated. Still, there are still plenty of places to download the
  app. Approved devices include Apple, Samsung TVs from 2016 and later,
  Xbox and Chromecast. Here's the
  \href{https://help.hbomax.com/Answer/Detail/20}{full list}.
\item
  For those who bought their HBO service through a digital provider like
  \textbf{Apple}, \textbf{Google Play}, \textbf{Hulu Live} or
  \textbf{YouTubeTV}, you're good to go. Log in to the HBO Max website
  or app with your HBO credentials. But the same device caveat as above
  applies.
\item
  For those who have HBO Now, you likely bought it directly from the HBO
  website. You should be all set. Just log in to the HBO Max website or
  app with the same account.
\item
  Anyone who bought HBO through \textbf{Amazon Channels} or a
  \textbf{Roku} device are shut out of HBO Max. Amazon and Roku provide
  both media access and sell devices, so they have two key areas over
  which to negotiate.
\end{itemize}

For consumers stuck in the middle, you can cancel your HBO account to
sign up on the HBO Max website and watch through an approved device.
