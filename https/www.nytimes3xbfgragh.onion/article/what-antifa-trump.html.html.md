# What Is Antifa, the Movement Trump Wants to Declare a Terror Group?

</div>

President Trump’s announcement brought renewed attention to the
anti-fascist protesters he has blamed for inciting violence at
protests.

Seeking to [assign blame for the
protests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-antifa-terrorist-group.html?referringSource=articleShare)
that have convulsed cities across the country this week, President Trump
[said on
Sunday](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267129644228247552)
that the United States would designate antifa, the loosely affiliated
group of far-left anti-fascism activists, a terrorist organization.

The president’s critics noted, however, that the United States does not
have a [domestic terrorism
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/07/us/domestic-terror-law.html)
and that antifa, a contraction of the phrase “anti-fascist,” is not an
organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles.

Rather, antifa is more of a movement of activists whose followers share
a philosophy and tactics. They have made their presence known at
protests around the country in recent years, including the [“Unite the
Right”
rally](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/13/us/charlottesville-protests-unite-the-right.html)
in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.

## Who are the members of antifa?

It is impossible to know how many people count themselves as members.
Its followers acknowledge that the movement is secretive, has no
official leaders and is organized into autonomous local cells. It is
also only one in a constellation of activist movements that have come
together in the past few years to oppose the far right.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Antifa members campaign against actions they view as authoritarian,
homophobic, racist or xenophobic. Although antifa is not affiliated with
other movements on the left — and is sometimes [viewed as a
distraction](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/28/opinion/antifa-trump-charlottesville.html)
by other organizers — its members sometimes work with other local
activist networks that are rallying around the same issues, such as the
Occupy movement or [Black Lives
Matter](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/7xqjv9/neo-nazis-are-giving-black-lives-matter-and-antifa-a-reason-to-work-together).

*\[See* [*photos from a sixth night of
protest*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/pictures-george-floyd-protests-photos.html)
*in cities across America.\]*

## What are its goals?

Supporters generally seek to stop what they see as fascist, racist and
far-right groups from having a platform to promote their views, arguing
that public demonstration of those ideas leads to the targeting of
marginalized people, including racial minorities, women and members of
the L.G.B.T.Q. community.

“The argument is that militant anti-fascism is inherently self-defense
because of the historically documented violence that fascists pose,
especially to marginalized people,” said Mark Bray, a history lecturer
at Rutgers University and the author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist
Handbook.”

Many antifa organizers also participate in more peaceful forms of
community organizing, but they believe that using violence is justified
because of their views that if racist or fascist groups are allowed to
organize freely, “it will inevitably result in violence against
marginalized communities,” said Mr. Bray, whose defense of the
anti-fascist movement [incited criticism and generated
support](https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2017/09/dartmouth-and-lecturer-mark-bray-at-center-of-antifa-violence-dispute)
at Dartmouth College when he was a lecturer there.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## When did the movement begin?

Although the Merriam-Webster dictionary says the word
“[antifa](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antifa)” was
first used in 1946 and was borrowed from a German phrase signaling an
opposition to Nazism, more people began [joining the
movement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/17/us/antifa-left-wing-faction-far-right.html)
in the United States after the 2016 election of Mr. Trump, to counter
the threat they believed was posed by the so-called
[alt-right](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/15/us/politics/alt-left-alt-right-glossary.html),
Mr. Bray said.

One of the first groups in the United States to use the name was [Rose
City
Antifa](https://www.wweek.com/news/2017/05/23/white-supremacists-are-brawling-with-masked-leftists-in-the-portland-streets-homeland-security-is-watching/),
which says it was founded in 2007 in Portland, Ore. It has a large
following on social media, where it shares news articles and sometimes
seeks to dox, or reveal the identities and personal information of,
figures on the right.

The antifa movement gained more visibility in 2017 after a series of
events that put a spotlight on anti-fascist protesters, including the
[punching](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/21/us/politics/richard-spencer-punched-attack.html)
of a prominent alt-right member; [the
cancellation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/02/us/university-california-berkeley-free-speech-milo-yiannopoulos.html)
of an event by a right-wing writer at the [University of California,
Berkeley](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/02/us/university-california-berkeley-free-speech-milo-yiannopoulos.html);
and their confrontation of white nationalist [protesters in
Charlottesville](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/14/us/who-were-the-counterprotesters-in-charlottesville.html)
who turned violent.

## What distinguishes antifa from other protest groups?

Mr. Bray said antifa groups often use tactics similar to anarchist
groups, such as dressing in all black and wearing masks. The groups also
have overlapping ideologies, as both often criticize capitalism and seek
to dismantle structures of authority, including police forces.

## How have politicians and others reacted?

The movement has been widely criticized among the mainstream left and
right. After the protests in Berkeley, Calif., in August 2017, Speaker
Nancy Pelosi [decried](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/82917/) “the
violent actions of people calling themselves antifa” and said they
should be arrested.

Conservative publications and politicians routinely rail against
supporters of antifa, who they say are seeking to shut down peaceful
expression of conservative views. These critics point to moments during
which purported antifa members have been [accused of
sucker-punching](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/08/25/a-trump-supporter-was-sucker-punched-by-a-counterprotester-why-isnt-it-a-hate-crime/?utm_term=.9ddfb2a40d3a)
Trump supporters.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history at New York University who
studies fascism, said she was worried that antifa’s methods could feed
into what she said were false equivalencies that seek to lump violence
on the left with attacks by the right, such as the killing of a
protester in Charlottesville by a [man who had expressed white
supremacist
views](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/27/us/james-alex-fields-charlottesville.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Throwing a milkshake is not equivalent to killing someone, but because
the people in power are allied with the right, any provocation, any
dissent against right-wing violence, backfires,” Professor Ben-Ghiat
said in an interview last year.

Between 2010 and 2016, 53 percent of terrorist attacks in the United
States were carried out by religious extremists — 35 percent by
right-wing extremists and 12 percent by left-wing or environmentalist
extremists, [according to a University of Maryland-led
consortium](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_IdeologicalMotivationsOfTerrorismInUS_Nov2017.pdf)
that studies terrorism.

Militancy on the left can “become a justification for those in power and
allies on the right to crack down,” Professor Ben-Ghiat said. “In these
situations, the left, or antifa, are historically placed in impossible
situations.”
