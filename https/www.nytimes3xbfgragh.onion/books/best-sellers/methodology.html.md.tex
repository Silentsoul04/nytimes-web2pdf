A version of this Best Sellers report appears in the August 9, 2020
issue of
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/section/books/review}{The New
York Times Book Review}. Rankings on weekly lists reflect sales for the
week ending July 25, 2020.

Rankings reflect unit sales reported on a confidential basis by vendors
offering a wide range of general interest titles published in the United
States. Every week, thousands of diverse selling locations report their
actual sales on hundreds of thousands of individual titles. The panel of
reporting retailers is comprehensive and reflects sales in tens of
thousands of stores of all sizes and demographics across the United
States.

The book selling universe is comprised of well-established vendors as
well as emerging ones. The sales venues for print books include
national, regional and local chains representing tens of thousands of
storefronts; many hundreds of independent book retailers; scores of
online and multimedia entertainment retailers; supermarkets, university,
gift and big-box department stores; and newsstands.

E-book rankings reflect sales from leading online vendors of e-books in
a variety of popular e-reader formats and are included in our combined
fiction, combined nonfiction, advice, children's series and monthly
lists. Titles are included regardless of whether they are published in
both print and electronic formats or just one format. In general,
publisher credits for e-books are listed under the corporate publishing
name instead of by publisher's division or imprint, unless by special
request. Graphic book rankings include all print and digital formats.
Adult, children's, young adult, fiction and nonfiction graphic books are
eligible for inclusion on the graphic books and manga list. Audiobook
rankings are created from sales of physical and digital audio products.
Free-trial or low-cost audiobook sales are not eligible for inclusion.
Publisher credits for audiobooks are listed under the audiobook
publisher name.

The appearance of a ranked title reflects the fact that sales data from
reporting vendors has been provided to The Times and has satisfied
commonly accepted industry standards of universal identification (such
as ISBN13 and EISBN13 codes). All identities, anecdotal, contextual, and
other information about the retail sales of any title, as well as
overall sales data, are provided with the expectation and assurance of
confidentiality by every vendor and are protected by Non-Disclosure
Agreements.

Sales are defined as completed transactions by vendors and individual
end users during the period on or after the official publication date of
a title. Institutional, special interest, group or bulk purchases, if
and when they are included, are at the discretion of The New York Times
Best-Seller List Desk editors based on standards for inclusion that
encompass proprietary vetting and audit protocols, corroborative
reporting and other statistical determinations. When included, such bulk
purchases appear with a dagger (†).

Publishers and vendors of all ranked titles must conform in a timely
fashion to The New York Times Best-Seller Lists requirement to allow for
examination and independent corroboration of their reported sales for
that week. Sales are statistically weighted to represent and accurately
reflect all outlets proportionally nationwide. An asterisk (*) indicates
that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book
above.

Among the categories not actively tracked at this time are: perennial
sellers, required classroom reading, textbooks, reference and test
preparation guides, e-books available exclusively from a single vendor,
journals, workbooks, calorie counters, shopping guides, periodicals and
crossword puzzles.

The New York Times Best Sellers are compiled and archived by The
Best-Seller Lists Desk of The New York Times News Department, and are
separate from the Editorial, Culture, Advertising and Business sides of
The New York Times Company.
