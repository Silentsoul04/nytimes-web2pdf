\subsection{}

Henry Fountain covers climate change, with a focus on the innovations
that will be needed to overcome it. He also writes about other
science-related subjects, including earthquakes, hurricanes, mudslides,
nuclear accidents and other natural and human-caused disasters. For 10
years he wrote about research findings from across the world of science
in Observatory, a weekly column in Science Times.~He is the author of
``The Great Quake,'' a book about the 1964 Alaskan earthquake.

  Twin emergencies on two coasts this week --- Hurricane Isaias and the
  Apple Fire --- offer a preview of life in a warming world and the
  steady danger of overlapping disasters.
