Megan Twohey is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter with The
New York Times and co-author of the book SHE SAID: Breaking the Sexual
Harassment Story That Helped Ignite A Movement. The book takes readers
behind the scenes of Twohey's and Jodi Kantor's 2017 investigation of
Harvey Weinstein, which helped trigger the global reckoning on sexual
misconduct. Along with a team of reporters who exposed sexual harassment
and abuse across industries, she was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Public
Service in 2018.
