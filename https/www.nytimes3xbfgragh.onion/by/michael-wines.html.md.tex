\subsection{}

Michael Wines is a national correspondent for The New York Times and
writes about voting and other election-related issues. Since coming to
The Times in 1988, he has covered the Justice Department, the American
intelligence community, the White House, the 1992 presidential campaign,
Congress, the environment and, for nearly 15 years, news and life in
Russia and surrounding states, southern Africa and China. He also has
periodically written about other topics, including the similarity
between Washington, D.C., and theme parks, the joy of pessimism and an
outbreak of cynicism in the spring of 1995.
