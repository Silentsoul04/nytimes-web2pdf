In 2018, the Newswomen's Club of New York recognized Stewart for her
coverage of homelessness, mental health and poverty. She has been a
finalist for the Livingston Award and an Investigative Reporters and
Editors Award. In Troop 6000: The Girl Scout Troop That Began in a
Shelter and Inspired the World, Stewart chronicles the triumphs and
challenges of the first Girl Scout troop designed for girls in the New
York City shelter system. Stewart joined The New York Times in 2014
after working at The Washington Post.~
