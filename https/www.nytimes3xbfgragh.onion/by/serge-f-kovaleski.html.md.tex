\subsection{}

Serge Kovaleski is an investigative reporter on the National Desk at The
New York Times. Prior to rejoining the national staff, Mr. Kovaleski was
a correspondent on the paper's Culture Desk for two years and broke
notable stories on the controversy over Harper Lee's new book, Prince's
death from a drug overdose and art restitution advocate Ronald Lauder's
own problems with the provenance of works within a Manhattan museum he
co-founded. Mr. Kovaleski's return to the national staff marks his
second tour on that desk. During his first tour, he covered major
stories such as the Boston Marathon bombing, the Aurora, Colo., theater
shooting and the complex and conflicting issues of law involved in the
legalization of marijuana in states across the country.
