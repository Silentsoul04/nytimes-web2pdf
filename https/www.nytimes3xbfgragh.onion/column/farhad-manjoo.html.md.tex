Farhad~Manjoo~became an opinion columnist for The New York Times in
2018.~

Before that, he wrote The Times' State of the Art column, covering the
technology industry's efforts to swallow up the world. Mr.~Manjoo~has
also written for Slate, Salon, Fast Company and The Wall Street Journal.
To his chagrin, his 2008 book, ``True Enough: Learning to Live in a
Post-Fact World,'' accurately predicted our modern age of tech-abetted
echo chambers and ``alternative facts.''

Mr.~Manjoo~was born in South Africa and emigrated with his family to
Southern California in the late 1980s. He lives in Northern California
with his wife and two children.~
