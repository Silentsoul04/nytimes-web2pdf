Frank Bruni, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times since June 2011,
joined the newspaper in 1995 and has ranged broadly across its pages. He
has been both a White House correspondent and the chief restaurant
critic. As a staff writer for The Times Magazine, he profiled J. J.
Abrams and a health-obsessed billionaire who planned to live to 125; as
the Rome bureau chief, he kept tabs on both Pope John Paul II and Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Mr. Bruni came to The Times from The Detroit Free Press, where he was,
alternately, a war correspondent, the chief movie critic and a religion
writer. He is the author of three New York Times best sellers: a 2015
examination of the college admissions frenzy, ``Where You Go Is Not Who
You'll Be'';~a 2009 memoir, ``Born Round,'' about the joys and torments
of his eating life; and a 2002 chronicle of George W. Bush's initial
presidential campaign, ``Ambling into History.'' His~first cookbook, "A
Meatloaf in Every Oven," was published in February 2017 and co-written
with his Times colleague Jennifer Steinhauer.~

In his columns, which appear every Sunday and Wednesday, he reflects on
diverse topics, including: American politics, higher education, popular
culture and gay rights. Follow him on
