Maureen Dowd, winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished
commentary and author of three New York Times best sellers, became an
Op-Ed columnist in 1995. In August 2014, she also became a writer for
The Times Magazine.

Born in Washington, Ms. Dowd began her journalism career in 1974 as an
editorial assistant for The Washington Star, where she later became a
sports columnist, metropolitan reporter and feature writer. In 1983, she
joined The New York Times as a metropolitan correspondent and then moved
to The Times's Washington bureau in 1986 to cover politics. Ms. Dowd has
covered nine presidential campaigns, served as The Times's White House
correspondent, and written ``On Washington,'' a column for The Times
Magazine. In the run-up to the 2004 presidential election, G. P. Putnam
published her first book, ``Bushworld,'' which covered the presidency
and personality of George W. Bush. After ``Bushworld'' quickly climbed
the best-seller list, Ms. Dowd switched from presidential politics to
sexual politics in another best seller, ``Are Men Necessary? When Sexes
Collide,'' released in 2005.

In addition to The New York Times, Ms. Dowd has written for GQ, Vanity
Fair, Rolling Stone, The New Republic, Mademoiselle, Sports Illustrated
and others. Her column appears every Sunday.
