Thomas L. Friedman became the paper's foreign affairs Op-Ed columnist in
1995. He joined the paper in 1981, after which he served as the Beirut
bureau chief in 1982, Jerusalem bureau chief in 1984, and then in
Washington as the diplomatic correspondent in 1989, and later the White
House correspondent and economic correspondent.

Mr. Friedman was awarded the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for international
reporting (from Lebanon) and the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for international
reporting (from Israel). He also won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for
commentary.

Mr. Friedman is the author of ``From Beirut to Jerusalem,'' which won
the National Book Award in 1989. He has written several other books,
including ``Hot, Flat and Crowded,'' an international best seller.

Born in Minneapolis, Mr. Friedman received a B.A. degree in
Mediterranean studies from Brandeis University in 1975. In 1978 he
received a master's in modern Middle East studies from Oxford. His
column appears every Sunday and Wednesday.
