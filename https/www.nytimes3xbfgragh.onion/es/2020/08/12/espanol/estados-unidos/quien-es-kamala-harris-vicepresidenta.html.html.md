La senadora Kamala Harris de California, a quien [Joe
Biden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/es/interactive/2020/espanol/estados-unidos/joe-biden-elecciones.html)
eligió el martes como su compañera de fórmula, será la primera mujer
negra y la primera persona de ascendencia india en ser nominada para un
cargo nacional en uno de los dos partidos principales de Estados Unidos.
Harris, una pragmática moderada y exrival de Biden en la carrera
presidencial, fue una fiscala que rompió barreras antes de ser elegida
para el Senado en 2016.

Harris, de 55 años, nació en Oakland, California. Fue fiscala general de
California y fiscala de distrito en San Francisco.

Cuando anunció [su propia candidatura a la
presidencia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/21/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-president.html)
—en el cumpleaños de Martin Luther King de 2019—, se presentó como una
candidata que hacía historia, y le rindió homenaje a Shirley Chisholm,
la congresista de Nueva York que se convirtió [en la primera mujer en
buscar la nominación para presidente del Partido
Demócrata](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/01/03/obituaries/shirley-chisholm-unbossedpioneer-in-congress-is-dead-at-80.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Antecedentes en la fiscalía

El historial de Harris en la fiscalía —fue la fiscala de distrito en San
Francisco de 2004 a 2011 y la fiscala general de California de 2011 a
2017— fue un tema importante de su campaña presidencial y es casi seguro
que será discutido en las elecciones generales, en especial debido a la
indignación nacional [por el abuso
policiaco](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/es/2020/06/13/espanol/mundo/protestas-violencia-policial.html)
y el racismo sistémico que se ha desatado desde el asesinato de [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/es/2020/06/09/espanol/mundo/George-Floyd-quien-es.html).

Harris se ha descrito como una “fiscala progresista” y ha argumentado
que es posible tener mano dura contra el crimen y, al mismo tiempo,
confrontar las profundas desigualdades del sistema de justicia penal.
Harris[ha
mencionado](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/politics/kamala-harris-racism-police.html)que
se volvió fiscala porque creía que la mejor manera de cambiar el sistema
era desde adentro. Ese mensaje se volvió parte clave de su campaña como
candidata presidencial: los votantes podían confiar en ella para
reformar el sistema judicial porque lo conocía “[desde
adentro](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html)”.

Sin embargo, hay aspectos [de su
historial](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/11/us/kamala-harris-progressive-prosecutor.html)
que han despertado críticas, en especial de la izquierda.

Como fiscala general, [casi nunca
procesó](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-policing.html)
a oficiales de la policía que hubieran asesinado a civiles, aunque para
cuando dejó ese cargo había abierto algunas investigaciones sobre los
departamentos de la policía. También recibió críticas por haberse negado
a permitir pruebas avanzadas de ADN que pudieron exonerar a Kevin
Cooper, [un hombre negro sentenciado a
muerte](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/05/17/opinion/sunday/kevin-cooper-california-death-row.html),
y por haber defendido algunas condenas en contra de acusaciones de
conducta inapropiada de la
fiscalía.

Harris, una opositora de la pena de muerte, se negó a buscarla cuando un
policía fue asesinado en San Francisco en 2004, un episodio que generó
protestas en ese momento, pero que ella ha mencionado como ejemplo de su
compromiso con un sistema judicial más justo. Sin embargo, diez años más
tarde, cuando un juez declaró inconstitucional la pena de muerte en
California, Harris apeló la decisión, bajo el argumento de que estaba
obligada a hacerlo en su papel de fiscala general del estado.

El plan de justicia penal [que
divulgó](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html)
durante su campaña presidencial contenía varias políticas progresistas a
las que se había opuesto en otros momentos de su carrera.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Carrera en el Senado

Tras ser elegida al Senado en 2016, Harris se convirtió en la primera
mujer negra en estar en la cámara en más de una década. En su periodo
relativamente breve como senadora júnior de California, se volvió famosa
por sus interrogatorios intensos a funcionarios y nominados del gobierno
del presidente Donald Trump, entre ellos Brett Kavanaugh, durante la
audiencia de confirmación para la Corte Suprema, y el ex fiscal general
Jeff Sessions, durante una [audiencia del Comité de Inteligencia del
Senado](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/13/us/politics/kamala-harris-interrupted-jeff-sessions.html).

En años recientes, buscó aliarse más con la fracción de izquierda del
Partido Demócrata. En un inicio respaldó el proyecto de ley “Medicare
para todos” del senador Bernie Sanders, antes de cambiar su postura
durante la campaña presidencial. También ha respaldado propuestas para
[aumentar el salario mínimo a nivel
federal](https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-harris-joins-colleagues-in-support-of-15-minimum-wage-bill)a
15 dólares por hora y para corregir [el sistema de
fianzas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/20/opinion/kamala-harris-and-rand-paul-lets-reform-bail.html)
del país.

Harris ha defendido con vehemencia la legislación de justicia racial en
respuesta [al asesinato de
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/20/opinion/kamala-harris-and-rand-paul-lets-reform-bail.html)
y ha respaldado propuestas para que se reforme la vigilancia y el
linchamiento sea un crimen federal.

Harris presta servicio en varios comités de alto perfil en el Senado,
entre ellos el Comité de Inteligencia y el Comité Judicial.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Campaña presidencial

El año pasado, Harris [se retiró de la carrera
presidencial](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/03/us/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-drops-out.html)
después de quedarse sin fondos. Su candidatura se disparó en las
encuestas después de un sólido primer debate, pero luego cayó y nunca
volvió a ganar fuerza.

No obstante, en enero de 2019, cuando entró a la carrera, se le
consideró una de las favoritas, y tuvo un impacto al principio de la
trayectoria de la campaña.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Parte de su influencia fue ideológica: por ejemplo, [fue la primera
candidata](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/28/us/politics/kamala-harris-abortion.html)
en sugerir que se exigiera una preautorización a nivel federal para las
restricciones estatales al aborto, una postura que luego apoyaron [la
mayoría de los
candidatos](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/25/us/politics/abortion-laws-2020-democrats.html)
demócratas.

En junio del año pasado, [protagonizó un momento
electrizante](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html)
en el primer debate, cuando desafió enérgicamente a Biden por sus
antecedentes en el tema racial. Ese intercambio también comenzó de forma
notable. Los moderadores no le habían dado la palabra, pero Harris se
reivindicó al decir: “Como la única persona negra en este escenario, me
gustaría tratar el tema de la raza”.

Dicha interacción fue un ejemplo de una de las virtudes que la campaña
de Harris se esforzó por aprovechar a su favor, del mismo modo que
intentaron destacar su estilo intenso de interrogatorio durante las
audiencias del Senado. Su equipo argumentaba que podía dominar cualquier
escenario de debate, incluido uno en el que se enfrentara al presidente
Trump y que no se sentiría intimidada por el estilo intimidatorio que
Trump utiliza en la política.

Sin embargo, parecía no contar con una base ideológica política y [en
ocasiones
batalló](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html)
para presentar una plataforma coherente, sobre todo en temas de salud.
En un ejemplo muy difundido,
[titubeó](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/28/upshot/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all-debate.html)
sobre si “Medicare para todos” significaría eliminar los seguros
privados.

## Relación con Biden

A muchos observadores políticos les pudo parecer que la relación entre
Harris y Biden era tensa. Después de todo, en el primer debate, Harris
desató tal vez el ataque más enérgico —y memorable— en contra de un
rival en toda la campaña primaria. Sucedió cuando Harris desafió a Biden
por haberse opuesto con anterioridad a que se usara el transporte
escolar como un medio de integración de las escuelas públicas.

Harris dijo que fue
“[hiriente](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html)”
escuchar a Biden hablar de forma positiva acerca de su [trabajo con
senadores
segregacionistas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html),
porque “hubo una niñita de California que fue parte de la segunda
generación de escuelas públicas integradas y que se iba en autobús a la
escuela todos los días: esa niñita era yo”.

Entre algunos de los asesores de Biden, su ataque en el escenario del
debate generó un resentimiento permanente, incluso hasta hace unas
semanas. En una recaudación de fondos de marzo, Jill Biden, la ex
segunda dama, dijo que los comentarios de Harris en el escenario del
debate fueron un “golpe en el estómago”.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sin embargo, tal vez para evitar cualquier duda sobre su compatibilidad,
el martes, la campaña de Biden de inmediato divulgó un documento sobre
Harris que incluía una sección sobre la “sociedad” entre ambos
políticos, al hacer notar que ella había servido como fiscala general
de California cuando un hijo de Biden, Beau, fue fiscal general de
Delaware.

“Los dos se hicieron amigos mientras luchaban para enfrentarse a la
industria bancaria”, decía un punto. “Gracias a su amistad con Beau,
conoció a Joe Biden”.

## Listen to ‘The Daily’: A Historic VP Decision

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Rachel Quester, Jessica Cheung, and Robert Jimison, and edited by Lisa Tobin and M.J. Davis Lin

#### Joe Biden’s vice-presidential search has ended: Kamala Harris will be his running mate. How did he settle on the California senator?

</div>

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
    
    Today: Joe Biden picks Senator Kamala Harris of California as his
    running mate, making her the first Black woman and the first
    Asian-American woman to run for vice president on a major party
    ticket. Alex Burns on the historic decision.
    
    It’s Wednesday, August 12.
    
    Alex, did you get the text message from the Biden campaign?

  - alex burns  
    You know, I had the text messages forwarded to me by several other
    people before I got it myself. But I suppose I was notified by text
    message, just not directly from the Biden campaign.

  - michael barbaro  
    Just not the Biden text message? I actually am pretty disappointed.
    Because I signed up for the text message from the Biden campaign,
    and I didn’t get a text message. So I suppose this answers the
    inevitable question, how do you make an enormous announcement during
    a pandemic? Which is you do it via text message. You just don’t send
    it to Alex Burns or Michael Barbaro.

  - alex burns  
    \[LAUGHS\]

  - michael barbaro  
    OK. So onto the decision itself. It is 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday evening.
    Joe Biden announced his choice about three hours ago, that it was
    going to be Kamala Harris. And Alex, the last time that we spoke
    with you, we talked about three overlapping realities that you said
    were influencing Biden’s choice of a running mate — the nationwide
    protests over race and policing, the pandemic and the economic
    collapse. And then there was Biden’s age, the fact that he would be
    the oldest president to assume the office. So how does Biden get
    from those realities to Kamala Harris?

  - alex burns  
    So I think in some ways they are three distinct forces. And in some
    ways, they really are different strands of the same big current.
    Which is that Biden was looking from the start for a running mate
    who he saw and who he believed the country would see as a really
    serious person for really serious times. Now that could mean a whole
    bunch of different things. But one of the reasons why I think you
    end up seeing Kamala Harris emerge as the vice president is that she
    straddles all the different forces of this moment in a way that
    nobody else on the short list did or, at least demonstrated that
    they did.
    
    She was a senator who marched in racial justice protests this spring
    and who led a charge in the Senate to make lynching a federal crime.
    She is a familiar face to Democratic voters, not only from her
    presidential campaign, but from her interrogations of Trump
    officials in the Judiciary Committee at a time when Democrats are
    really struggling to hold the administration to account over its
    handling of the coronavirus pandemic. And she’s somebody of, clearly
    in Joe Biden’s eyes, sufficient and diverse enough political
    experience and stature that she will look to voters like somebody
    who is ready to be president.

  - michael barbaro  
    Mhm. Well let’s drill into these three realities, each individually,
    just a little bit further. And I want to start with the nationwide
    protests, the questions around race. How did that influence the
    choice? You mentioned Kamala Harris marching in some of these
    protests and the work she has done in the Senate.

  - alex burns  
    Right. You had, at the outset of the season of protest, a number of
    figures on Biden’s vice presidential list really speak up about
    matters of racial justice and policing. You had Val Demings, the
    congresswoman from Florida, a former police chief, become an
    outspoken champion of police reform. But you also saw people come
    under the microscope in less flattering ways, including Val Demings.
    That there was a sense from the start among Democrats that anybody
    on the short list who has touched the criminal justice system in
    their career is going to really need to have their record picked
    over. And that happened with Val Demings. She was the police chief
    in Orlando. And there are some questions about how appropriately she
    handled matters of police misconduct on her watch.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, what about Harris’s history as attorney general in California?
    Because that was a significant focus during her own primary run for
    president. And my sense is that a lot of progressive voters, a lot
    of Black voters — especially in California — are skeptical of her
    record and question whether or not she’s the right figure in this
    moment. I recall that she once described herself as the state’s top
    cop.

  - alex burns  
    I think that’s one of the questions that we are going to see play
    out in this campaign going forward — is whether she can address the
    criticism of her record as a prosecutor more convincingly in a
    general election than she did during the primary. And the question
    is, has she done enough in the last few months, in the wake of
    George Floyd, in the midst of these demonstrations, to show that she
    is serious about criminal justice reform as a matter of governing
    now, that people who looked askance at her record during the
    Democratic primaries say, you know what? This is good enough or even
    better than good enough.

  - michael barbaro  
    And in thinking about race and this moment, how should we be
    thinking about fact that Harris is herself a Black woman?

  - alex burns  
    Well that’s of course of enormous importance in this moment. That I
    think starting in the late spring, the sense among people close to
    Biden was that it would be tough in this moment to really meet the
    political mood of the country if the Democrats put forward an all
    white ticket. That Joe Biden, as a 77-year-old white guy, needed a
    running mate who could speak to the country’s multiracial future in
    a way that he with his identity could not.
    
    And so, between her identity as a Black woman and as an
    Indian-American woman, Senator Harris, I think, clearly has an
    opportunity to speak to the country in a different way than a white
    running mate with her criminal justice record might have had. That
    there are people who may be willing to accept her embrace, her
    evolution on certain matters of police misconduct, police reform,
    criminal justice, because she can speak to those issues from the
    perspective of her own identity in a way that a white candidate
    could not.

  - michael barbaro  
    OK. So next in these overlapping realities that guided Biden’s
    choice, we have the pandemic, both as a public health crisis and an
    economic crisis. So how did that further narrow the field, influence
    the choice?

  - alex burns  
    So this is a trickier one. Because the candidates for vice president
    who were most directly in contact with the pandemic, most directly
    involved in responding to the pandemic, were governors and mayors.
    But the pandemic has made it really hard for a lot of people to
    imagine choosing a running mate who would be campaigning for vice
    president at the same time as they were managing a crisis on the
    ground, where it would just be awfully difficult to imagine the
    governor of a state being out at a political fundraiser every day,
    or doing political morning shows when their state is experiencing a
    second wave of the virus in October.

  - michael barbaro  
    So are you saying that Kamala Harris’s lack of responsibility in
    this pandemic was actually kind of an asset.

  - alex burns  
    Well, I think for all the senators the lack of day-to-day management
    responsibility in the coronavirus pandemic — yes, absolutely an
    asset to them in being considered as a political candidate for the
    fall.

  - michael barbaro  
    And finally, Biden’s age and his energy are kind of this third
    overlapping reality that you said would shape the decision. So how
    did that shape it?

  - alex burns  
    It shapes it in a couple ways. Some of them are about governing, and
    some of them are about the political future of the Democratic party.
    When you talk to voters, when you see polls about how people see
    Biden, how people think about his vice presidential choice, there is
    clearly a sense that he is choosing a back up president in a way
    that you might not have if Biden were 57. And you put that together
    with the gravity of the crisis that this country is in, and the bar
    for what a vice president needs to bring to the table on the first
    day gets a lot higher. Kamala Harris ran for president. People know
    her as a former presidential candidate. She’s not a new face to most
    of the country. And that feeds into the dimension to this that’s
    about the political future of the Democratic party as well.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, so you’re starting to get at this. But how strongly do you
    think the age question, the succession question, influenced who
    Biden felt he could select in terms of their politics? Not just in
    terms of the future of the party, but the future of his ticket,
    whether he can win in the fall. And I’m thinking about a voter who
    might be comfortable with the idea of a Vice President Warren, for
    example, right? But if they are thinking to themselves, but if
    something happens to Biden or if he doesn’t seek re-election, am I
    comfortable with a President Warren? And therefore, he needed to
    choose a candidate whose politics aligned with his, resembled his,
    so that voters didn’t feel like a more progressive figure was kind
    of being snuck into office through the back door of Joe Biden.

  - alex burns  
    Well, that is exactly the message that the Trump campaign is trying
    to push about Joe Biden. That he is a Trojan horse for the left. So
    we know that Joe Biden feels an affinity and a respect for Elizabeth
    Warren. And they’ve gotten closer over the last few months. It
    clearly would have been a significant political risk for him to
    choose a running mate who is seen by a lot of the moderate white
    folks who are currently supporting him as an alternative to
    President Trump — might make them feel, like, maybe the president
    has a point.
    
    But in Kamala Harris, I think they feel they have somebody who
    cannot easily be caricatured as some flag burning radical who wants
    to burn down police stations. Right? That’s not the truth of her
    political biography. And it leaves the Trump campaign with a
    somewhat difficult task in trying to caricature the Biden ticket and
    a potential Biden administration as some kind of stealth project of
    the extreme left in this country.

  - michael barbaro  
    So with everything that you have laid out here, did all this leave
    Biden with many choices? Did you expect it to be Harris?

  - alex burns  
    So I’ll say two things to that. The first is, and I’m glad you asked
    this. Because part of how we’ve been talking about this, I hope it
    doesn’t sound to people like this was merely a process of
    elimination with Kamala Harris as the last person standing. She was
    one of the strongest candidates at the start, and in the middle, and
    obviously at the end. And there was never really any doubt that she
    would be one of the finalists.
    
    And the second part of this is that one thing we heard consistently
    was that he was making the selection from a position of political
    strength. That he is substantially ahead of President Trump in the
    polls right now. And if he had felt like, you know, the governing
    partner I want is somebody who I will have to defend from attacks
    that she is too liberal, like Elizabeth Warren, or that she’s
    inexperienced, like Keisha Lance Bottoms, he definitely could have
    done that. And he didn’t. He chose Kamala Harris.

  - michael barbaro  
    So now that we have Harris as the running mate, let’s talk about
    what she brings and what kind of voters she is meant to appeal to.
    Who might go to the polls, or I guess the mailbox in this case,
    because of this choice of Kamala Harris? In the mind of Joe Biden
    and his advisers, I mean, how does this help him win in the fall?

  - alex burns  
    I think that they hope she will keep the broad appeal that Joe Biden
    currently has, while exciting groups that are currently voting for
    him but maybe without an enormous amount of enthusiasm. Think about
    young people. Think about educated left of left of center voters who
    may have supported Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary and
    see Joe Biden as just a figure from the past. They’re not looking at
    Kamala Harris as somebody who is going to go out there and electrify
    the left the way somebody closer to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth
    Warren might. They’re looking at her as somebody who will excite
    Democrats and liberals and young people, because she does represent
    a breakthrough for the country, because she can speak about the
    themes of the Biden campaign with a perspective and a biography that
    Joe Biden himself lacks.
    
    And so the hope among Democrats and the hope of the Biden campaign
    is that Kamala Harris can do all of that without becoming a divisive
    or scary figure to voters in the center and to the right of center
    who are currently supporting Joe Biden but maybe haven’t voted for a
    Democrat in a while or ever.

  - michael barbaro  
    So what Harris does theoretically, in the eyes of the Biden
    campaign, is she firms up Biden supporters who may be skeptical. She
    helps bring in some people who might be on the fence. And she does
    that without alienating his existing base of supporters and without
    inflaming a whole bunch of other Americans, including Trump
    supporters.

  - alex burns  
    Again, that’s the hope. Whether it turns out that way I think is a
    really open question. And there are Democrats, including pretty
    senior Democrats who are pretty close to the Biden campaign, who
    will acknowledge at least in private that they really don’t know how
    a lot of those voters in the middle will react to the idea of a
    Black woman being a 78-year-old heartbeat away from the presidency.
    
    So it’s not that there’s no risk involved here. There is just a bet
    that there are more people in the country by a lot who will be
    excited by somebody who looks and sounds like Kamala Harris than
    people who will be turned off, or at least people who will be turned
    off who were open to Joe Biden to begin with. But, again, I think
    there is a high degree of confidence that the country is broadly
    ready for a ticket that looks like this. There is just some
    uncertainty about exactly who is ready for it.

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back Alex, we’ve been talking a lot about Biden, how
    he’s thinking about this decision of a running mate. We haven’t
    talked much about how Kamala Harris is thinking about it. And I am
    mindful that she delivered the single most searing and memorable
    attack on Joe Biden —

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    Vice President Biden —

michael barbaro

— during the Democratic primary.

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe, and it is
    personal — and I was actually very — it was hurtful to hear you talk
    about the reputations of two United States senators who built their
    reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.
    And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose
    busing.

michael barbaro

Basically saying that he was sympathetic to segregation and
segregationists.

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America
    then? Do you agree?

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered
    by the Department of Education.

michael barbaro

Words that you really can’t ever take back when you have said them on
live television. So how does Harris square that — that point of view,
that statement — with this decision to be Biden’s running mate?

alex burns

In a couple ways. You know, even at the most pitched moments of conflict
between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the Democratic primary, I didn’t
talk to anybody in either of their camps who suggested that they just
cannot stand each other, that they fundamentally see each other as bad
people who were in politics for the wrong reasons. I think it’s pretty
clear at this point that she did not think that his views on race were
utterly disqualifying. And one of the things that I am personally going
to be watching for with great interest is: What is the public chemistry
and personal rapport between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? How do they
talk about this stuff when they get asked about it?

michael barbaro

Right.

alex burns

I think it’s hard to imagine that Joe Biden would have chosen her if he
didn’t feel he had sufficient confidence based on their private
conversations that the past is the past. But let’s hear him say that for
himself, if that is indeed how he feels.

michael barbaro

Alex, do you think in any way the Biden campaign liked the idea of
picking someone who had so publicly attacked him? Did they see any value
in that?

alex burns

I’ll tell you what they did like, is they liked the idea of picking
somebody who can deliver that kind of attack. Not against Joe Biden, but
against Donald Trump, against Mike Pence in a vice presidential debate.
You know, just a recognition that that person has real moves and real
skills.

michael barbaro

Right.

alex burns

And that even people who didn’t like what she did to Joe Biden recognize
that there was a kind of political dexterity and panache that Joe Biden
himself has really not exhibited in this race.

michael barbaro

Well, to that point, are we expecting Kamala Harris to be used to attack
the president over the next three months or so? I mean, I vividly
remember people during the Democratic debates, the pundit class, talking
about the prospect of seeing Harris apply the same kind of sharp
prosecutorial flair that she had used against Biden on Donald Trump.

alex burns

I think there’s a universal expectation among Democrats that Kamala
Harris will be a obviously major carrier of a message of criticism and
denunciation against the Trump administration. And that in her role in
the Senate, she will continue to really hold the administration’s feet
to the fire in different ways. There is — not to get too far ahead of
the game here — but if we did have a Supreme Court confirmation battle
in the middle of all of this, she is a member of the Judiciary
Committee. That has been a major source of her stature and popularity
within the Democratic party, because of how she handled moments like the
Brett Kavanaugh confirmations.

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    So I’m going to ask you one last time, are you willing to ask the
    White House to authorize the F.B.I. to investigate the claims that
    have been made against you?

  - archived recording (brett kavanaugh)  
    Well, I’ll do whatever the committee wants, of course.

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    And I’ve heard you say that.

  - archived recording (brett kavanaugh)  
    The witness statements —

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    I’ve not heard you ask — I’ve not heard you answer a very specific
    question that’s been asked.

alex burns

So I think there’s a high degree of optimism and sky high expectations
for the role that Harris will play in, as she would put it, prosecuting
the case against Donald Trump.

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    So are you willing to ask the White House to do it? And say yes or
    no, and then we can move on.

  - archived recording (brett kavanaugh)  
    I’ve had six background investigations over 26 years.

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    Sir, as it relates to the recent allegations, are you willing to
    have them do it.

  - archived recording (brett kavanaugh)  
    The witness testimony is before you. No witness who was there
    supports that I was there.

  - archived recording (kamala harris)  
    OK. I’m going to take that as a no. And we can move on. You have
    said —

michael barbaro

Well, with that in mind, I mean, what are we expecting the Trump
campaign to say about Kamala Harris, about this choice? What are they
saying about her so far?

alex burns

It’s been pretty scattershot so far.

  - archived recording (ad for donald trump)  
    Voters rejected Harris. They smartly spotted a phony.

alex burns

You have had the Trump campaign immediately putting out videos,
statements attacking her as yet another Trojan horse for the radical
left.

  - archived recording (ad for donald trump)  
    Kamala Harris ran for president by rushing to the radical left,
    embracing Bernie’s plan for socialized medicine, calling for
    trillions in new taxes, attacking —

alex burns

That she adopted these more left-wing ideas during the primary and that,
in her heart, that is truly her agenda, just like they claim it is for
Joe Biden. The president himself we saw at the White House earlier today
come out and call Kamala Harris a “nasty” for how she handled the
Kavanaugh hearing.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    I was a little surprised. She was extraordinarily nasty to Judge
    Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that
    was just a horrible thing the way she was. The way she —

alex burns

Again, there was the sort of she, like Joe, is just going to be another
radical lefty.

  - archived recording  
    She’s also known, from what I understand, as being just about the
    most liberal person in the U.S. Senate. And I would have thought
    that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit.
    Because —

alex burns

I don’t know how convincing that is going to be as an attack on Senator
Harris. And a lot of the stuff that’s been said about her by the Trump
folks so far, with the exception of what the president said on the
Kavanaugh hearings, you could really imagine them saying about basically
anybody Biden chose as a running mate. So there’s kind of a boilerplate
quality to it. And I think you still do kind of have the sense that they
are trying to run against the Democratic ticket as though the Democrats
nominated Bernie Sanders, when obviously they nominated somebody much
more moderate than that.

michael barbaro

You know, Alex, it’s actually been a pretty long time since we’ve had
big political news. You know, politics is not the dominant story of
America right now.

alex burns

Michael, that hurts my feelings.

michael barbaro

I know that. I know that. And look, you’re just as essential as you’ve
ever been. But that being said, what are you thinking about with this
decision, knowing everything else that’s going on?

alex burns

What do you mean? Just, like, what’s on my mind personally?

michael barbaro

Not like, what are you making for dinner? But like, you know.

\[laughter\]

alex burns

You know, we have been talking about these intertwined realities of the
campaign that all fed into this decision by Biden. What ties together
everything Joe Biden has done in this race so far — I think including
his choice of the vice president — is his real conviction that you can
bring the country together again, that you can run as a unity candidate
in a country this divided and in so much painful turmoil. It worked out
for him in the Democratic primary. It seems to be working out for him so
far in the general election. But just because it seems to be working out
for him politically so far with Donald Trump as your opponent doesn’t
necessarily mean that that is an achievable thing for any president to
do in this country at this time.

\[music\]

This is, in some ways, less of a question for the next few months of
this election than for the next four years if Joe Biden and Kamala
Harris are elected. Is how justified is Joe Biden’s faith that you can
put things together again? And how much is he setting himself and his
party up for disappointment and turmoil if it turns out that a coalition
that you put together to beat Donald Trump in November isn’t necessarily
held together by a whole lot besides this urgent desire to beat an
unpopular president?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

alex burns

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

Biden and Harris are scheduled to appear together for the first time as
a ticket later today at a hotel in Delaware, the same hotel where Biden
first announced his campaign for U.S. Senate in 1972. We’ll be right
back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording  
    \[CROWDS YELLING AND SIRENS BLARING\]

michael barbaro

Protests in Belarus are entering their fourth consecutive day over
suspicious election results that gave the country’s authoritarian
president his latest landslide victory.

The election is widely viewed as rigged by President Alexandra
Lukashenko, who is known as Europe’s last dictator, fueling the biggest
anti-government demonstrations since Belarus left the Soviet Union in
1991 and a massive government crackdown in response. And —

  - archived recording (kevin warren)  
    When you look at this decision, we just believe collectively there’s
    too much uncertainty at this point in time in our country to really
    — to encourage our student athletes to participate in fall sports.
    And we just, I take this responsibility seriously.

michael barbaro

On Tuesday, two of college football’s wealthiest and most powerful
conferences, the Big Ten and the Pac-12, announced that they will not
play this fall because of the pandemic. The decision is one of the most
significant in the history of college athletics, a multibillion dollar
industry that heavily supports college budgets. And it defies calls by
some coaches, players and President Trump to mount a season.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

## Cómo verán los votantes su selección

Durante su campaña presidencial, Harris atrajo en particular a los
demócratas más moderados y a los que encontraban interesante su
biografía. Ella podría reforzar el interés en Biden entre las mujeres
negras, las mujeres suburbanas y las mujeres que en general anhelan
verse reflejadas en el liderazgo del país.

Harris también tiene otra arma secreta en potencia: [su conexión con la
sororidad Alpha Kappa
Alpha](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/01/us/politics/kamala-harris-alpha-kappa-alpha.html),
de la que fue parte al cursar la licenciatura en la Universidad Howard,
y la cual cuenta con casi 300.000 miembros y un presupuesto
multimillonario que podría brindar poder organizativo y de captación de
fondos en todo el país.

No obstante, lo más probable es que la izquierda progresista, incluidos
algunos simpatizantes de Sanders, esté decepcionada con la selección de
Harris, porque considera que apoya más un cambio progresivo que el tipo
de propuestas amplias y revolucionarias que defienden. Además, su larga
carrera en la procuración de justicia podría repeler a algunos votantes,
en especial a los más jóvenes, quienes están impacientes por ver un
movimiento que reforme la policía con un respaldo incondicional de la
Casa Blanca.
