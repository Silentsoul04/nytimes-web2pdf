La senadora Kamala Harris de California, a quien
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/es/interactive/2020/espanol/estados-unidos/joe-biden-elecciones.html}{Joe
Biden} eligió el martes como su compañera de fórmula, será la primera
mujer negra y la primera persona de ascendencia india en ser nominada
para un cargo nacional en uno de los dos partidos principales de Estados
Unidos. Harris, una pragmática moderada y exrival de Biden en la carrera
presidencial, fue una fiscala que rompió barreras antes de ser elegida
para el Senado en 2016.

Harris, de 55 años, nació en Oakland, California. Fue fiscala general de
California y fiscala de distrito en San Francisco.

Cuando anunció
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/21/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-president.html}{su
propia candidatura a la presidencia} ---en el cumpleaños de Martin
Luther King de 2019---, se presentó como una candidata que hacía
historia, y le rindió homenaje a Shirley Chisholm, la congresista de
Nueva York que se convirtió
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/01/03/obituaries/shirley-chisholm-unbossedpioneer-in-congress-is-dead-at-80.html}{en
la primera mujer en buscar la nominación para presidente del Partido
Demócrata}.

\hypertarget{antecedentes-en-la-fiscaluxeda}{%
\subsection{Antecedentes en la
fiscalía}\label{antecedentes-en-la-fiscaluxeda}}

El historial de Harris en la fiscalía ---fue la fiscala de distrito en
San Francisco de 2004 a 2011 y la fiscala general de California de 2011
a 2017--- fue un tema importante de su campaña presidencial y es casi
seguro que será discutido en las elecciones generales, en especial
debido a la indignación nacional
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/es/2020/06/13/espanol/mundo/protestas-violencia-policial.html}{por
el abuso policiaco} y el racismo sistémico que se ha desatado desde el
asesinato de
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/es/2020/06/09/espanol/mundo/George-Floyd-quien-es.html}{George
Floyd}.

Harris se ha descrito como una ``fiscala progresista'' y ha argumentado
que es posible tener mano dura contra el crimen y, al mismo tiempo,
confrontar las profundas desigualdades del sistema de justicia penal.
Harris\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/politics/kamala-harris-racism-police.html}{ha
mencionado}que se volvió fiscala porque creía que la mejor manera de
cambiar el sistema era desde adentro. Ese mensaje se volvió parte clave
de su campaña como candidata presidencial: los votantes podían confiar
en ella para reformar el sistema judicial porque lo conocía
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html}{desde
adentro}''.

Sin embargo, hay aspectos
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/11/us/kamala-harris-progressive-prosecutor.html}{de
su historial} que han despertado críticas, en especial de la izquierda.

Como fiscala general,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-policing.html}{casi
nunca procesó} a oficiales de la policía que hubieran asesinado a
civiles, aunque para cuando dejó ese cargo había abierto algunas
investigaciones sobre los departamentos de la policía. También recibió
críticas por haberse negado a permitir pruebas avanzadas de ADN que
pudieron exonerar a Kevin Cooper,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/05/17/opinion/sunday/kevin-cooper-california-death-row.html}{un
hombre negro sentenciado a muerte}, y por haber defendido algunas
condenas en contra de acusaciones de conducta inapropiada de la
fiscalía.

Harris, una opositora de la pena de muerte, se negó a buscarla cuando un
policía fue asesinado en San Francisco en 2004, un episodio que generó
protestas en ese momento, pero que ella ha mencionado como ejemplo de su
compromiso con un sistema judicial más justo. Sin embargo, diez años más
tarde, cuando un juez declaró inconstitucional la pena de muerte en
California, Harris apeló la decisión, bajo el argumento de que estaba
obligada a hacerlo en su papel de fiscala general del estado.

El plan de justicia penal
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html}{que
divulgó} durante su campaña presidencial contenía varias políticas
progresistas a las que se había opuesto en otros momentos de su carrera.

\hypertarget{carrera-en-el-senado}{%
\subsection{Carrera en el Senado}\label{carrera-en-el-senado}}

Tras ser elegida al Senado en 2016, Harris se convirtió en la primera
mujer negra en estar en la cámara en más de una década. En su periodo
relativamente breve como senadora júnior de California, se volvió famosa
por sus interrogatorios intensos a funcionarios y nominados del gobierno
del presidente Donald Trump, entre ellos Brett Kavanaugh, durante la
audiencia de confirmación para la Corte Suprema, y el ex fiscal general
Jeff Sessions, durante una
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/13/us/politics/kamala-harris-interrupted-jeff-sessions.html}{audiencia
del Comité de Inteligencia del Senado}.

En años recientes, buscó aliarse más con la fracción de izquierda del
Partido Demócrata. En un inicio respaldó el proyecto de ley ``Medicare
para todos'' del senador Bernie Sanders, antes de cambiar su postura
durante la campaña presidencial. También ha respaldado propuestas para
\href{https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-harris-joins-colleagues-in-support-of-15-minimum-wage-bill}{aumentar
el salario mínimo a nivel federal}a 15 dólares por hora y para corregir
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/20/opinion/kamala-harris-and-rand-paul-lets-reform-bail.html}{el
sistema de fianzas} del país.

Harris ha defendido con vehemencia la legislación de justicia racial en
respuesta
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/20/opinion/kamala-harris-and-rand-paul-lets-reform-bail.html}{al
asesinato de Floyd} y ha respaldado propuestas para que se reforme la
vigilancia y el linchamiento sea un crimen federal.

Harris presta servicio en varios comités de alto perfil en el Senado,
entre ellos el Comité de Inteligencia y el Comité Judicial.

\hypertarget{campauxf1a-presidencial}{%
\subsection{Campaña presidencial}\label{campauxf1a-presidencial}}

El año pasado, Harris
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/03/us/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-drops-out.html}{se
retiró de la carrera presidencial} después de quedarse sin fondos. Su
candidatura se disparó en las encuestas después de un sólido primer
debate, pero luego cayó y nunca volvió a ganar fuerza.

No obstante, en enero de 2019, cuando entró a la carrera, se le
consideró una de las favoritas, y tuvo un impacto al principio de la
trayectoria de la campaña.

Parte de su influencia fue ideológica: por ejemplo,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/28/us/politics/kamala-harris-abortion.html}{fue
la primera candidata} en sugerir que se exigiera una preautorización a
nivel federal para las restricciones estatales al aborto, una postura
que luego apoyaron
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/25/us/politics/abortion-laws-2020-democrats.html}{la
mayoría de los candidatos} demócratas.

En junio del año pasado,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html}{protagonizó
un momento electrizante} en el primer debate, cuando desafió
enérgicamente a Biden por sus antecedentes en el tema racial. Ese
intercambio también comenzó de forma notable. Los moderadores no le
habían dado la palabra, pero Harris se reivindicó al decir: ``Como la
única persona negra en este escenario, me gustaría tratar el tema de la
raza''.

Dicha interacción fue un ejemplo de una de las virtudes que la campaña
de Harris se esforzó por aprovechar a su favor, del mismo modo que
intentaron destacar su estilo intenso de interrogatorio durante las
audiencias del Senado. Su equipo argumentaba que podía dominar cualquier
escenario de debate, incluido uno en el que se enfrentara al presidente
Trump y que no se sentiría intimidada por el estilo intimidatorio que
Trump utiliza en la política.

Sin embargo, parecía no contar con una base ideológica política y
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-election.html}{en
ocasiones batalló} para presentar una plataforma coherente, sobre todo
en temas de salud. En un ejemplo muy difundido,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/28/upshot/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all-debate.html}{titubeó}
sobre si ``Medicare para todos'' significaría eliminar los seguros
privados.

\hypertarget{relaciuxf3n-con-biden}{%
\subsection{Relación con Biden}\label{relaciuxf3n-con-biden}}

A muchos observadores políticos les pudo parecer que la relación entre
Harris y Biden era tensa. Después de todo, en el primer debate, Harris
desató tal vez el ataque más enérgico ---y memorable--- en contra de un
rival en toda la campaña primaria. Sucedió cuando Harris desafió a Biden
por haberse opuesto con anterioridad a que se usara el transporte
escolar como un medio de integración de las escuelas públicas.

Harris dijo que fue
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html}{hiriente}''
escuchar a Biden hablar de forma positiva acerca de su
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html}{trabajo
con senadores segregacionistas}, porque ``hubo una niñita de California
que fue parte de la segunda generación de escuelas públicas integradas y
que se iba en autobús a la escuela todos los días: esa niñita era yo''.

Entre algunos de los asesores de Biden, su ataque en el escenario del
debate generó un resentimiento permanente, incluso hasta hace unas
semanas. En una recaudación de fondos de marzo, Jill Biden, la ex
segunda dama, dijo que los comentarios de Harris en el escenario del
debate fueron un ``golpe en el estómago''.

Sin embargo, tal vez para evitar cualquier duda sobre su compatibilidad,
el martes, la campaña de Biden de inmediato divulgó un documento sobre
Harris que incluía una sección sobre la ``sociedad'' entre ambos
políticos, al hacer notar que ella había servido como fiscala general de
California cuando un hijo de Biden, Beau, fue fiscal general de
Delaware.

``Los dos se hicieron amigos mientras luchaban para enfrentarse a la
industria bancaria'', decía un punto. ``Gracias a su amistad con Beau,
conoció a Joe Biden''.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''

  Today: Joe Biden picks Senator Kamala Harris of California as his
  running mate, making her the first Black woman and the first
  Asian-American woman to run for vice president on a major party
  ticket. Alex Burns on the historic decision.

  It's Wednesday, August 12.

  Alex, did you get the text message from the Biden campaign?
\item
  alex burns\\
  You know, I had the text messages forwarded to me by several other
  people before I got it myself. But I suppose I was notified by text
  message, just not directly from the Biden campaign.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Just not the Biden text message? I actually am pretty disappointed.
  Because I signed up for the text message from the Biden campaign, and
  I didn't get a text message. So I suppose this answers the inevitable
  question, how do you make an enormous announcement during a pandemic?
  Which is you do it via text message. You just don't send it to Alex
  Burns or Michael Barbaro.
\item
  alex burns\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  OK. So onto the decision itself. It is 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday evening.
  Joe Biden announced his choice about three hours ago, that it was
  going to be Kamala Harris. And Alex, the last time that we spoke with
  you, we talked about three overlapping realities that you said were
  influencing Biden's choice of a running mate --- the nationwide
  protests over race and policing, the pandemic and the economic
  collapse. And then there was Biden's age, the fact that he would be
  the oldest president to assume the office. So how does Biden get from
  those realities to Kamala Harris?
\item
  alex burns\\
  So I think in some ways they are three distinct forces. And in some
  ways, they really are different strands of the same big current. Which
  is that Biden was looking from the start for a running mate who he saw
  and who he believed the country would see as a really serious person
  for really serious times. Now that could mean a whole bunch of
  different things. But one of the reasons why I think you end up seeing
  Kamala Harris emerge as the vice president is that she straddles all
  the different forces of this moment in a way that nobody else on the
  short list did or, at least demonstrated that they did.

  She was a senator who marched in racial justice protests this spring
  and who led a charge in the Senate to make lynching a federal crime.
  She is a familiar face to Democratic voters, not only from her
  presidential campaign, but from her interrogations of Trump officials
  in the Judiciary Committee at a time when Democrats are really
  struggling to hold the administration to account over its handling of
  the coronavirus pandemic. And she's somebody of, clearly in Joe
  Biden's eyes, sufficient and diverse enough political experience and
  stature that she will look to voters like somebody who is ready to be
  president.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Mhm. Well let's drill into these three realities, each individually,
  just a little bit further. And I want to start with the nationwide
  protests, the questions around race. How did that influence the
  choice? You mentioned Kamala Harris marching in some of these protests
  and the work she has done in the Senate.
\item
  alex burns\\
  Right. You had, at the outset of the season of protest, a number of
  figures on Biden's vice presidential list really speak up about
  matters of racial justice and policing. You had Val Demings, the
  congresswoman from Florida, a former police chief, become an outspoken
  champion of police reform. But you also saw people come under the
  microscope in less flattering ways, including Val Demings. That there
  was a sense from the start among Democrats that anybody on the short
  list who has touched the criminal justice system in their career is
  going to really need to have their record picked over. And that
  happened with Val Demings. She was the police chief in Orlando. And
  there are some questions about how appropriately she handled matters
  of police misconduct on her watch.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Well, what about Harris's history as attorney general in California?
  Because that was a significant focus during her own primary run for
  president. And my sense is that a lot of progressive voters, a lot of
  Black voters --- especially in California --- are skeptical of her
  record and question whether or not she's the right figure in this
  moment. I recall that she once described herself as the state's top
  cop.
\item
  alex burns\\
  I think that's one of the questions that we are going to see play out
  in this campaign going forward --- is whether she can address the
  criticism of her record as a prosecutor more convincingly in a general
  election than she did during the primary. And the question is, has she
  done enough in the last few months, in the wake of George Floyd, in
  the midst of these demonstrations, to show that she is serious about
  criminal justice reform as a matter of governing now, that people who
  looked askance at her record during the Democratic primaries say, you
  know what? This is good enough or even better than good enough.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  And in thinking about race and this moment, how should we be thinking
  about fact that Harris is herself a Black woman?
\item
  alex burns\\
  Well that's of course of enormous importance in this moment. That I
  think starting in the late spring, the sense among people close to
  Biden was that it would be tough in this moment to really meet the
  political mood of the country if the Democrats put forward an all
  white ticket. That Joe Biden, as a 77-year-old white guy, needed a
  running mate who could speak to the country's multiracial future in a
  way that he with his identity could not.

  And so, between her identity as a Black woman and as an
  Indian-American woman, Senator Harris, I think, clearly has an
  opportunity to speak to the country in a different way than a white
  running mate with her criminal justice record might have had. That
  there are people who may be willing to accept her embrace, her
  evolution on certain matters of police misconduct, police reform,
  criminal justice, because she can speak to those issues from the
  perspective of her own identity in a way that a white candidate could
  not.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  OK. So next in these overlapping realities that guided Biden's choice,
  we have the pandemic, both as a public health crisis and an economic
  crisis. So how did that further narrow the field, influence the
  choice?
\item
  alex burns\\
  So this is a trickier one. Because the candidates for vice president
  who were most directly in contact with the pandemic, most directly
  involved in responding to the pandemic, were governors and mayors. But
  the pandemic has made it really hard for a lot of people to imagine
  choosing a running mate who would be campaigning for vice president at
  the same time as they were managing a crisis on the ground, where it
  would just be awfully difficult to imagine the governor of a state
  being out at a political fundraiser every day, or doing political
  morning shows when their state is experiencing a second wave of the
  virus in October.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So are you saying that Kamala Harris's lack of responsibility in this
  pandemic was actually kind of an asset.
\item
  alex burns\\
  Well, I think for all the senators the lack of day-to-day management
  responsibility in the coronavirus pandemic --- yes, absolutely an
  asset to them in being considered as a political candidate for the
  fall.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  And finally, Biden's age and his energy are kind of this third
  overlapping reality that you said would shape the decision. So how did
  that shape it?
\item
  alex burns\\
  It shapes it in a couple ways. Some of them are about governing, and
  some of them are about the political future of the Democratic party.
  When you talk to voters, when you see polls about how people see
  Biden, how people think about his vice presidential choice, there is
  clearly a sense that he is choosing a back up president in a way that
  you might not have if Biden were 57. And you put that together with
  the gravity of the crisis that this country is in, and the bar for
  what a vice president needs to bring to the table on the first day
  gets a lot higher. Kamala Harris ran for president. People know her as
  a former presidential candidate. She's not a new face to most of the
  country. And that feeds into the dimension to this that's about the
  political future of the Democratic party as well.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Well, so you're starting to get at this. But how strongly do you think
  the age question, the succession question, influenced who Biden felt
  he could select in terms of their politics? Not just in terms of the
  future of the party, but the future of his ticket, whether he can win
  in the fall. And I'm thinking about a voter who might be comfortable
  with the idea of a Vice President Warren, for example, right? But if
  they are thinking to themselves, but if something happens to Biden or
  if he doesn't seek re-election, am I comfortable with a President
  Warren? And therefore, he needed to choose a candidate whose politics
  aligned with his, resembled his, so that voters didn't feel like a
  more progressive figure was kind of being snuck into office through
  the back door of Joe Biden.
\item
  alex burns\\
  Well, that is exactly the message that the Trump campaign is trying to
  push about Joe Biden. That he is a Trojan horse for the left. So we
  know that Joe Biden feels an affinity and a respect for Elizabeth
  Warren. And they've gotten closer over the last few months. It clearly
  would have been a significant political risk for him to choose a
  running mate who is seen by a lot of the moderate white folks who are
  currently supporting him as an alternative to President Trump ---
  might make them feel, like, maybe the president has a point.

  But in Kamala Harris, I think they feel they have somebody who cannot
  easily be caricatured as some flag burning radical who wants to burn
  down police stations. Right? That's not the truth of her political
  biography. And it leaves the Trump campaign with a somewhat difficult
  task in trying to caricature the Biden ticket and a potential Biden
  administration as some kind of stealth project of the extreme left in
  this country.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So with everything that you have laid out here, did all this leave
  Biden with many choices? Did you expect it to be Harris?
\item
  alex burns\\
  So I'll say two things to that. The first is, and I'm glad you asked
  this. Because part of how we've been talking about this, I hope it
  doesn't sound to people like this was merely a process of elimination
  with Kamala Harris as the last person standing. She was one of the
  strongest candidates at the start, and in the middle, and obviously at
  the end. And there was never really any doubt that she would be one of
  the finalists.

  And the second part of this is that one thing we heard consistently
  was that he was making the selection from a position of political
  strength. That he is substantially ahead of President Trump in the
  polls right now. And if he had felt like, you know, the governing
  partner I want is somebody who I will have to defend from attacks that
  she is too liberal, like Elizabeth Warren, or that she's
  inexperienced, like Keisha Lance Bottoms, he definitely could have
  done that. And he didn't. He chose Kamala Harris.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So now that we have Harris as the running mate, let's talk about what
  she brings and what kind of voters she is meant to appeal to. Who
  might go to the polls, or I guess the mailbox in this case, because of
  this choice of Kamala Harris? In the mind of Joe Biden and his
  advisers, I mean, how does this help him win in the fall?
\item
  alex burns\\
  I think that they hope she will keep the broad appeal that Joe Biden
  currently has, while exciting groups that are currently voting for him
  but maybe without an enormous amount of enthusiasm. Think about young
  people. Think about educated left of left of center voters who may
  have supported Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary and see Joe
  Biden as just a figure from the past. They're not looking at Kamala
  Harris as somebody who is going to go out there and electrify the left
  the way somebody closer to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren might.
  They're looking at her as somebody who will excite Democrats and
  liberals and young people, because she does represent a breakthrough
  for the country, because she can speak about the themes of the Biden
  campaign with a perspective and a biography that Joe Biden himself
  lacks.

  And so the hope among Democrats and the hope of the Biden campaign is
  that Kamala Harris can do all of that without becoming a divisive or
  scary figure to voters in the center and to the right of center who
  are currently supporting Joe Biden but maybe haven't voted for a
  Democrat in a while or ever.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So what Harris does theoretically, in the eyes of the Biden campaign,
  is she firms up Biden supporters who may be skeptical. She helps bring
  in some people who might be on the fence. And she does that without
  alienating his existing base of supporters and without inflaming a
  whole bunch of other Americans, including Trump supporters.
\item
  alex burns\\
  Again, that's the hope. Whether it turns out that way I think is a
  really open question. And there are Democrats, including pretty senior
  Democrats who are pretty close to the Biden campaign, who will
  acknowledge at least in private that they really don't know how a lot
  of those voters in the middle will react to the idea of a Black woman
  being a 78-year-old heartbeat away from the presidency.

  So it's not that there's no risk involved here. There is just a bet
  that there are more people in the country by a lot who will be excited
  by somebody who looks and sounds like Kamala Harris than people who
  will be turned off, or at least people who will be turned off who were
  open to Joe Biden to begin with. But, again, I think there is a high
  degree of confidence that the country is broadly ready for a ticket
  that looks like this. There is just some uncertainty about exactly who
  is ready for it.

  michael barbaro\\
  We'll be right back Alex, we've been talking a lot about Biden, how
  he's thinking about this decision of a running mate. We haven't talked
  much about how Kamala Harris is thinking about it. And I am mindful
  that she delivered the single most searing and memorable attack on Joe
  Biden ---
\item
  archived recording (kamala harris)\\
  Vice President Biden ---

michael barbaro

--- during the Democratic primary.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (kamala harris)\\
  I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe, and it is
  personal --- and I was actually very --- it was hurtful to hear you
  talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built
  their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this
  country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to
  oppose busing.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Basically saying that he was sympathetic to segregation and
segregationists.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (kamala harris)\\
  Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America
  then? Do you agree?
\item
  archived recording (joe biden)\\
  I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered
  by the Department of Education.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Words that you really can't ever take back when you have said them on
live television. So how does Harris square that --- that point of view,
that statement --- with this decision to be Biden's running mate?

alex burns

In a couple ways. You know, even at the most pitched moments of conflict
between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the Democratic primary, I didn't
talk to anybody in either of their camps who suggested that they just
cannot stand each other, that they fundamentally see each other as bad
people who were in politics for the wrong reasons. I think it's pretty
clear at this point that she did not think that his views on race were
utterly disqualifying. And one of the things that I am personally going
to be watching for with great interest is: What is the public chemistry
and personal rapport between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? How do they
talk about this stuff when they get asked about it?

michael barbaro

Right.

alex burns

I think it's hard to imagine that Joe Biden would have chosen her if he
didn't feel he had sufficient confidence based on their private
conversations that the past is the past. But let's hear him say that for
himself, if that is indeed how he feels.

michael barbaro

Alex, do you think in any way the Biden campaign liked the idea of
picking someone who had so publicly attacked him? Did they see any value
in that?

alex burns

I'll tell you what they did like, is they liked the idea of picking
somebody who can deliver that kind of attack. Not against Joe Biden, but
against Donald Trump, against Mike Pence in a vice presidential debate.
You know, just a recognition that that person has real moves and real
skills.

michael barbaro

Right.

alex burns

And that even people who didn't like what she did to Joe Biden recognize
that there was a kind of political dexterity and panache that Joe Biden
himself has really not exhibited in this race.

michael barbaro

Well, to that point, are we expecting Kamala Harris to be used to attack
the president over the next three months or so? I mean, I vividly
remember people during the Democratic debates, the pundit class, talking
about the prospect of seeing Harris apply the same kind of sharp
prosecutorial flair that she had used against Biden on Donald Trump.

alex burns

I think there's a universal expectation among Democrats that Kamala
Harris will be a obviously major carrier of a message of criticism and
denunciation against the Trump administration. And that in her role in
the Senate, she will continue to really hold the administration's feet
to the fire in different ways. There is --- not to get too far ahead of
the game here --- but if we did have a Supreme Court confirmation battle
in the middle of all of this, she is a member of the Judiciary
Committee. That has been a major source of her stature and popularity
within the Democratic party, because of how she handled moments like the
Brett Kavanaugh confirmations.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (kamala harris)\\
  So I'm going to ask you one last time, are you willing to ask the
  White House to authorize the F.B.I. to investigate the claims that
  have been made against you?
\item
  archived recording (brett kavanaugh)\\
  Well, I'll do whatever the committee wants, of course.
\item
  archived recording (kamala harris)\\
  And I've heard you say that.
\item
  archived recording (brett kavanaugh)\\
  The witness statements ---
\item
  archived recording (kamala harris)\\
  I've not heard you ask --- I've not heard you answer a very specific
  question that's been asked.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

So I think there's a high degree of optimism and sky high expectations
for the role that Harris will play in, as she would put it, prosecuting
the case against Donald Trump.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (kamala harris)\\
  So are you willing to ask the White House to do it? And say yes or no,
  and then we can move on.
\item
  archived recording (brett kavanaugh)\\
  I've had six background investigations over 26 years.

\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Well, with that in mind, I mean, what are we expecting the Trump
campaign to say about Kamala Harris, about this choice? What are they
saying about her so far?

alex burns

It's been pretty scattershot so far.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (ad for donald trump)\\
  Voters rejected Harris. They smartly spotted a phony.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

You have had the Trump campaign immediately putting out videos,
statements attacking her as yet another Trojan horse for the radical
left.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (ad for donald trump)\\
  Kamala Harris ran for president by rushing to the radical left,
  embracing Bernie's plan for socialized medicine, calling for trillions
  in new taxes, attacking ---
\end{itemize}

alex burns

That she adopted these more left-wing ideas during the primary and that,
in her heart, that is truly her agenda, just like they claim it is for
Joe Biden. The president himself we saw at the White House earlier today
come out and call Kamala Harris a ``nasty'' for how she handled the
Kavanaugh hearing.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  I was a little surprised. She was extraordinarily nasty to Judge
  Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that
  was just a horrible thing the way she was. The way she ---
\end{itemize}

alex burns

Again, there was the sort of she, like Joe, is just going to be another
radical lefty.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  She's also known, from what I understand, as being just about the most
  liberal person in the U.S. Senate. And I would have thought that Biden
  would have tried to stay away from that a little bit. Because ---
\end{itemize}

alex burns

I don't know how convincing that is going to be as an attack on Senator
Harris. And a lot of the stuff that's been said about her by the Trump
folks so far, with the exception of what the president said on the
Kavanaugh hearings, you could really imagine them saying about basically
anybody Biden chose as a running mate. So there's kind of a boilerplate
quality to it. And I think you still do kind of have the sense that they
are trying to run against the Democratic ticket as though the Democrats
nominated Bernie Sanders, when obviously they nominated somebody much
more moderate than that.

michael barbaro

You know, Alex, it's actually been a pretty long time since we've had
big political news. You know, politics is not the dominant story of
America right now.

alex burns

Michael, that hurts my feelings.

michael barbaro

I know that. I know that. And look, you're just as essential as you've
ever been. But that being said, what are you thinking about with this
decision, knowing everything else that's going on?

alex burns

What do you mean? Just, like, what's on my mind personally?

michael barbaro

Not like, what are you making for dinner? But like, you know.

{[}laughter{]}

alex burns

You know, we have been talking about these intertwined realities of the
campaign that all fed into this decision by Biden. What ties together
everything Joe Biden has done in this race so far --- I think including
his choice of the vice president --- is his real conviction that you can
bring the country together again, that you can run as a unity candidate
in a country this divided and in so much painful turmoil. It worked out
for him in the Democratic primary. It seems to be working out for him so
far in the general election. But just because it seems to be working out
for him politically so far with Donald Trump as your opponent doesn't
necessarily mean that that is an achievable thing for any president to
do in this country at this time.

{[}music{]}

This is, in some ways, less of a question for the next few months of
this election than for the next four years if Joe Biden and Kamala
Harris are elected. Is how justified is Joe Biden's faith that you can
put things together again? And how much is he setting himself and his
party up for disappointment and turmoil if it turns out that a coalition
that you put together to beat Donald Trump in November isn't necessarily
held together by a whole lot besides this urgent desire to beat an
unpopular president?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

alex burns

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

Biden and Harris are scheduled to appear together for the first time as
a ticket later today at a hotel in Delaware, the same hotel where Biden

On Tuesday, two of college football's wealthiest and most powerful
conferences, the Big Ten and the Pac-12, announced that they will not
play this fall because of the pandemic. The decision is one of the most
significant in the history of college athletics, a multibillion dollar
industry that heavily supports college budgets. And it defies calls by
some coaches, players and President Trump to mount a season.

\subsection{Cómo verán los votantes su
selección}\label{cuxf3mo-veruxe1n-los-votantes-su-selecciuxf3n}}

Durante su campaña presidencial, Harris atrajo en particular a los
demócratas más moderados y a los que encontraban interesante su
biografía. Ella podría reforzar el interés en Biden entre las mujeres
negras, las mujeres suburbanas y las mujeres que en general anhelan
verse reflejadas en el liderazgo del país.

Harris también tiene otra arma secreta en potencia:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/01/us/politics/kamala-harris-alpha-kappa-alpha.html}{su
conexión con la sororidad Alpha Kappa Alpha}, de la que fue parte al
cursar la licenciatura en la Universidad Howard, y la cual cuenta con
casi 300.000 miembros y un presupuesto multimillonario que podría
brindar poder organizativo y de captación de fondos en todo el país.

No obstante, lo más probable es que la izquierda progresista, incluidos
algunos simpatizantes de Sanders, esté decepcionada con la selección de
Harris, porque considera que apoya más un cambio progresivo que el tipo
de propuestas amplias y revolucionarias que defienden. Además, su larga
carrera en la procuración de justicia podría repeler a algunos votantes,
en especial a los más jóvenes, quienes están impacientes por ver un
movimiento que reforme la policía con un respaldo incondicional de la
Casa Blanca.
