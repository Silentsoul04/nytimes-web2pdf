“This is a really new birthplace of stars,” Jennifer Wiseman, senior
project scientist for the Hubble Space Telescope, said of the new image,
which shows a cluster of 3,000 stars known as Westerlund 2 in the
constellation Carina. “The cluster is only about two million years old,
which in stellar terms is very young. And it contains some of the
galaxy’s hottest, brightest and most massive stars that we know of.”

    This is a really interesting spiral galaxy that has only recently
    had an encounter with a dwarf galaxy. It perturbed the spiral
    structure, but you can see it's still an intact spiral and going out
    a hundred kilo parsecs is this huge tail. And in that tail are brand
    new star-forming regions, incredible activity caused by shocks
    traveling through this tadpole tail.
    
    Finally, with Hubble, we were able to see the universe with the same
    kind of resolution that we see with our eyeballs. In the background,
    virtually every pixel that is lit up, is another galaxy.
    
    You could pick any small region of the image — not the tadpole. You
    could pick any other small region and do great science.
    
    This is why I risked my life, to be able to allow the Hubble to
    provide this level of wonderful science. This is the image I have
    hanging up in my home.

    love its breathtaking iconic appeal. It is always humbling to think

    This striking 1994 Hubble Space Telescope image shows the rich

    disks of raw planetary materials –

    image is my favorite because even more astonishing than the beauty
    is the implication – one that came well before exoplanets orbiting
    nearby stars was established – that protoplanetary disks around
    newborn stars are abundant and that planet-forming processes (and
    hence planets) should be common in the Milky Way

    The prevailing opinion before Hubble telescope’s launch was that a
    very long exposure with the telescope was not likely to reveal
    distant new objects. Any would be too faint to be detected. One of
    the unique features of astronomy is that one can directly look back
    into the past because of the finite speed of light, and there is no
    better way to piece together the changing nature of the universe
    than to detect the most distant objects. They represent the
    ancestors of all that we see around us. A deep field with the Hubble
    simply had to be tried.
    
    When we announced to the science community that we would attempt to
    take a long series of exposures for a "deep field," a number of our
    colleagues were very troubled by our plans. [Lyman
    Spitzer](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1997/04/02/nyregion/lyman-spitzer-jr-dies-at-82-inspired-hubble-telescope.html),
    who along with [John
    Bahcall](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/08/19/nyregion/19bahcall.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)
    was one of the essential advocates to bring about Hubble, was
    serious, but muted in expressing his concerns.
    
    On several occasions he asked me at council meetings, “Are you sure
    you want to do this?” His colleague John Bahcall was much more vocal
    in working to prevent what he believed to be a much too risky
    venture, coming so soon after Hubble’s embarrassing spherical
    aberration had been fixed by the historic NASA Shuttle [servicing
    mission](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/03/11/us/nasa-shuttle-mission-is-moved-up-to-repair-hubble-telescope.html%20).
    His concern, certainly understandable, was that if a large segment
    of time on the telescope produced little or no useful results, which
    would no doubt become public, the fallout could tarnish the mission
    of the telescope beyond repair.
    
    Scientific progress requires risk, so we executed the observations
    over a two-week period in December 1995. The resulting Hubble Deep
    Field image yielded a wondrous display of galaxies, many of them
    very small, faint, and distant. The image is really a core sample of
    the universe.
    
    The Hubble Deep Field has truly opened up the entire universe of
    galaxies to study and interpretation by simple imaging, turning the
    pretty faces of those galaxies into true talking heads that have
    helped us understand how structure formed and evolved over time in
    the universe.

    The Antennae are the most famous example of a colliding pair of
    galaxies, a phenomenon that results in some of the favorite Hubble
    images due to their great diversity and graceful appearance.  
      
    For astronomers, they are also a wonderful laboratory for studying
    the formation of stars, since the collision ignites a starburst that
    lights up the galaxy like a display of fireworks. A surprise was
    that most of the star formation is in the form of star clusters —
    some of which survive to form the equivalent of the ancient globular
    clusters in our own galaxy — but most of which dissolve, their stars
    spreading out to form the stars that make up the galaxy as a whole.
    The contrast between the very bright blue stars formed in the
    starburst, the red light from hydrogen gas emission and the
    intricate dark dust structures result in spectacular images as the
    galaxies go through their gravitational dance and eventually merge
    to form an elliptical galaxy.

    My very favorite is the very deep image from the [GOODS

    while still at the Space Telescope Science Institute (along with
    Mark Dickinson and Mauro Giavalisco). It’s quiet and perhaps not as
    dramatic as many other Hubble Space Telescope images but it tells us
    about the history of the universe, including the growth of
    supermassive black holes — one in every galaxy, like a chicken in
    every pot — and the assembly of galaxies. So much information from
    such a little picture. (GOODS was an acronym we came up with: Great
    Observatories Origins Deep Survey. “Great Observatories because the
    full multiwavelength survey used Hubble, Spitzer and Chandra, i.e.,
    what NASA referred to as the Great Observatories; “Deep Survey”
    because it was the deepest multiwavelength survey ever done at that
    time, about a quarter the size of the full moon; and “Origins”
    because without another letter the name was pure hubris.)

    of stars beginning to assemble the structures that would eventually

    This image is my favorite because I used Hubble in 1990 to image
    this region for an engineering test shortly after launch. The image
    was severely degraded by Hubble’s focus problem. The modern version
    of Hubble took a spectacular image of the region in 2012, which
    shows both the beauty of a stellar nursery and the immense power of
    some of the most massive stars in our universe. Astronomy has come
    so far in the past 25 years thanks to Hubble and the people who
    built and operate it.

    My favorite, personally most exciting and meaningful, is a
    no-brainer: the discovery of Pluto’s small moons.
    
    Late at night on June 15, 2005, I was working in my office on Hubble
    observations of Pluto for Hal Weaver of the Johns Hopkins Applied
    Physics Laboratory, who intentionally over-exposed a series of
    images to try and detect faint moons. Hal is the project scientist
    for NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. I thought I was merely
    cleaning up the raw images, so I hadn’t really begun to search them
    yet, when a moment of pure scientific discovery snuck up on me:
    Pluto has two small moons (to go with the large moon Charon
    discovered in 1978)\!
    
    The actual discovery images were nowhere near as clear and obvious
    as this later confirmation image (which has also been heavily
    processed), but it was still surprisingly easy for Hubble to clearly
    detect not just one but *two* moons which had been missed in
    previous searches. It actually seemed too easy, and we gave
    ourselves many months to confirm the discovery and convince
    ourselves they weren’t some camera artifact (but I was 90 percent
    sure they were real that night).
    
    By 2012, the New Horizons team used Hubble to discover two more
    small Pluto moons, Styx and Kerberos. To me, this image represents
    the symbiosis of two great NASA missions working in concert to
    discover and explore new worlds. Hubble set the stage, and now New
    Horizons will fly through the Pluto system on July 14, and turn
    these small dots into real places for the first time.

    Can't do it. Like picking your favorite child. What’s certain,
    however, is that nobody ever required a caption to appreciate them.
    The images convey their own majesty and splendor without
it
