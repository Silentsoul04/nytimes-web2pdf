<span class="summary-text">The New York Times reported last week that
Donald J. Trump had a [$916 million net operating
loss](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html)
on his 1995 tax returns, which could have legally allowed him to avoid
federal income taxes for nearly two decades. That figure may seem
startling, but wealthy real estate developers like Mr. Trump enjoy
federal income tax breaks largely unavailable to typical
homeowners.</span> [Related

</div>

<div class="section-main">

<div class="section-title">

Advantage 1: <span class="the-title">Borrowing to Buy</span>

</div>

**** When Mr. Trump purchases an expensive piece of real estate — say, a
New Jersey casino, a Las Vegas hotel or a historic skyscraper in the
financial district of Manhattan — **he often uses little of his own
money**, and the interest he pays on the loans is tax deductible.

Through the mid-1990s, Mr. Trump often borrowed heavily from banks and
other investors. In the case of the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic
City, his company issued [$675 million in high-interest junk
bonds](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html)
to acquire the property and finish
construction.

</div>

<div class="section-main">

<div class="section-title">

Advantage 2: <span class="the-title">Legal Ownership Structures</span>

</div>

Real estate investors like Mr. Trump generally control properties
through [limited
partnerships](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/partnerships)
or similar ownership structures. This allows the profits and losses to
be treated as individual income, while shielding Mr. Trump from lawsuits
and from personal liability for the corporation’s debt.

It also means that business losses can be used to offset other personal
income from taxation. [When his Atlantic City casinos began to fail in
the
early 1990s](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html),
**Mr. Trump could have deducted the full value of his businesses’ losses
against his income, even though most of the money invested in them had
been
borrowed.**

</div>

<div class="section-main">

<div class="section-title">

Advantage 3: <span class="the-title">Deducting Wear and Tear</span>

</div>

As soon as one of his properties opens, **Mr. Trump can deduct a set
percentage of its value each year** in a process called
[depreciation](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946/index.html).

In the case of a billion-dollar casino, that could be more than **$25
million per year in deductions**, until the entire purchase value has
been recovered around 40 years later, according to Bradley T. Borden, a
professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in real estate
taxation.

Mr. Trump can also use [cost
segregation](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/cost-segregation-audit-techniques-guide-chapter-1-introduction)
to separate the value of the building’s components — such as the gilded
bathroom fixtures and marbled interiors — from the value of the
building, and depreciate them on an even more aggressive timetable.

Mr. Trump is allowed to take full advantage of these deductions to
offset any of his personal income because he qualifies as a [real estate
professional](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/passive-activity-loss-atg-exhibit-2-4-real-estate-professionals),
someone who spends at least 750 hours a year and more than 50 percent of
his time working in real estate.

**Most homeowners are not allowed to deduct the depreciation** of their
home.

</div>

<div class="section-main">

<div class="section-title">

Advantage 4: <span class="the-title">Net Operating Losses</span>

</div>

The real estate industry stands apart in the sheer scale of the amount
of borrowed money it can take to make a deal, which increases the size
of the potential losses for a developer like Mr. Trump. Exceptionally
big losses can be used to avoid taxation for years. If Mr. Trump’s
business losses, combined with his other deductions, exceed his income,
he produces what is known as a **[net operating
loss](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p536/ar02.html)**.

This type of loss, the same as a $916 million loss that Mr. Trump
reported in 1995, is useful because it can be **carried forward for the
next 20 years (before 1997, it was 15 years) and used to avoid paying
income tax on his future income** — like the more than $200 million he
claimed to have earned by appearing on the NBC television show “The
Apprentice.”

</div>

<div class="section-main">

<div class="section-title">

Advantage 5: <span class="the-title">Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</span>

</div>

Mr. Trump’s businesses have [filed for
Chapter 11](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/)[bankruptcy](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/)[several
times](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/).
Unlike a [Chapter 7
bankruptcy](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/chapter-7-bankruptcy-liquidation-under-the-bankruptcy-code),
which would liquidate a business, a
[Chapter 11](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/chapter-11-bankruptcy-reorganization)
bankruptcy places its debts on hold while the business negotiates a
restructuring plan with its lenders.

Mr. Trump characterized the choice to repeatedly file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy as a smart business move, saying in an [interview with
Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2011/04/29/fourth-times-a-charm-how-donald-trump-made-bankruptcy-work-for-him/),
“Basically, I’ve used the laws of the country to my advantage.”

During negotiations, Mr. Trump has used the threat of years in
bankruptcy court to **force his lenders to forgive some of his debt,
allow longer and more forgiving payment terms, and provide him with
additional loans to keep the properties afloat.**

Normally, [debt forgiveness would be taxable
income](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc431.html). But there are several
ways he might be able to reduce or eliminate it. **Some real estate
owners can take advantage of a special provision to avoid paying this
tax by forgoing future depreciation
deductions.**

</div>

<div class="section-main">

<div class="section-title">

Advantage 6: <span class="the-title">Time to Sell</span>

</div>

For most investments, selling at a loss counts as a capital loss, which
can only be used on your taxes to offset capital gains and a small
amount of income.

But through a [provision in the tax
code](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p544/ch03.html), **the sale of
business real estate is counted as an ordinary loss** instead. So if Mr.
Trump had sold a casino at a large loss, 100 percent of the loss could
be used to offset his income taxes, or added to his net operating loss
to carry forward to future
years.

</div>

<div class="section-main">

<div class="section-title">

Advantage 7: <span class="the-title">Flipping Real Estate</span>

</div>

**** Let’s say that Mr. Trump sells at a gain. If he quickly reinvests
the proceeds from the sale into a new piece of real estate, it qualifies
as a [like-kind
exchange](https://www.irs.gov/uac/like-kind-exchanges-under-irc-code-section-1031).
**This would allow him to delay paying taxes** on the gain until he
sells the new property. If that sale is also a like-kind exchange, Mr.
Trump could continue to defer the taxes.

This can go on as long as Mr. Trump continues to do like-kind exchanges.
**If the proceeds continue to be reinvested in real estate until Mr.
Trump dies, all income taxes on the accumulated gains between the
depreciated value and the sale price will vanish.**

All of these tax advantages are legal options available to real estate
developers under the current federal tax code. The extent to which they
helped Mr. Trump build his fortune by contributing to the [$916 million
net operating
loss](http://documentcloud.org/documents/3117920-Pages-From-Donald-Trump-s-1995-Income-Tax-Returns.html)
shown in his 1995 records might never be fully understood unless he
chooses to release his tax
returns.
