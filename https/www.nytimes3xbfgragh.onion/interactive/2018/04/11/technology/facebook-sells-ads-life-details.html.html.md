<div class="g-graphic g-graphic-freebird" data-preview-slug="2018-04-06-data-privacy">

<div class="g-item g-text">

One in five dollars spent on online advertising in the United States
currently goes to Facebook. The power of the company’s ad platform comes
from the ability it gives politicians, brands, real estate agents,
nonprofits and others to precisely [target people on its social
networks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/11/technology/facebook-privacy-hearings.html).

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Facebook has expanded its ad apparatus over time by continuously
accumulating details about its users and turning those details into
targetable data points. As it has grown, however, the company has drawn
the scrutiny of privacy advocates, regulators and lawmakers around the
world.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed">

## The Early Days

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

When Facebook introduced its ad platform in 2007, advertisers could
target people using **information they had volunteered** on the
platform.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

This is what a typical target audience might have looked like with those
options:

</div>

<div class="g-item g-sentence">

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span class="g-anyone">Anyone who</span> **lives in Philadelphia**,
**studies philosophy in college** <span class="g-anyone">and</span> **is
18 to 22**.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In 2009, Facebook added several features, including the ability for
users to click a “like” button on posts in their newsfeed, which refined
the list of interests that advertisers could target. The company also
introduced ways for advertisers to target friends of those who had
interacted with their brands, and to target ads to people by **age or
birthday**.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-sentence">

<div class="g-item g-text">

Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college and **is
21**.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed">

## Introducing <span class="g-third-party">Third-Party Data</span>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Three years later, Facebook introduced Custom Audiences, a feature that
allowed companies to **upload their own lists of people to target**. A
retailer, for example, could upload its customer list and target ads at
those who had recently bought a specific kind of T-shirt.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-sentence">

<div class="g-item g-text">

Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21
and **has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year**.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Of course, companies were not limited to using lists of their own
customers. They could also upload lists of consumers bought from
third-party marketing firms known as data brokers.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Data brokers [collect vast troves of
information](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html)
from public records, retailers who sell customer information and other
sources. The brokers combine that data into consumer profiles, and then
resell lists filtered to target certain demographics.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

By this time, targeting ads to people based on their interests had
become a common online-advertising practice, and marketers and
researchers were beginning to tap into big data analysis to push that
practice further.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In 2013, a researcher working for the consulting firm Cambridge
Analytica released a personality quiz that people could take on
Facebook, with the results indicating how open, conscientiousness,
extroverted, agreeable or neurotic they were. The researcher compared
the quiz results with what those who took it had liked on Facebook,
ultimately determining which interests corresponded with which
personality traits.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Using that method, which had been
[developed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/20/technology/facebook-cambridge-behavior-model.html)
by researchers at Cambridge University, targeting certain interests was
now tantamount to targeting **personality traits**.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-sentence">

<div class="g-item g-text">

Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21,
has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year and **is neurotic**.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Around 2014, Facebook’s ad program began to evolve dramatically,
allowing advertisers to pinpoint people even more precisely than before.
By then, more than 1.2 billion people on average used the social network
every day.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

One new feature, Partner Categories, brought hundreds of **targeting
options from data brokers** into Facebook’s ad platform. Brands could
now target people based on demographics like salary; number of open
credit lines; car make and model; and whether a user fit into a category
such as “trendy moms.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-sentence">

<div class="g-item g-text">

Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21,
has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year, is neurotic, **makes less
than $28,000 a year** and **is likely to buy a minivan in the next six
months**.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In 2014, the company also introduced what it called Lookalike Audiences,
a feature that allowed organizations that uploaded customer lists to
also target people who had profiles similar to those customers.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-sentence">

<div class="g-item g-text">

Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21,
has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year, is neurotic, makes less than
$28,000 a year and is likely to buy a minivan in the next six months.
**Plus, anyone on Facebook who is similar to them**.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed">

## Tracking You Around the Web and Guessing Your Ethnicity

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In mid-2014, Facebook incorporated users’ **online browsing history**
into its ad-targeting platform. The company had been collecting browsing
data for years, from any web page that included a Facebook like button
or had let people log in through their Facebook accounts. The company
used the browsing data — from, say, a user’s visits to several websites
while she shopped for a new tent — to refine the specific interests that
advertisers could target and to give them more confidence about what
they were targeting.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-sentence">

<div class="g-item g-text">

Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21,
has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year, is neurotic, makes less than
$28,000 a year, is likely to buy a minivan in the next six months and
**is interested in camping**. Plus, anyone on Facebook who is similar to
them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Around this time, Facebook also added a targeting option called **Ethnic
Affinity**. The company does not ask users to identify their race, but
it assigns ethnicities based on activities such as the content and pages
that users like. A user could be categorized as African-American, for
example, because his Facebook activity “aligns with African-American
multicultural affinity.” The other ethnicities that can be assigned are
Hispanic and Asian-American.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-sentence">

<div class="g-item g-text">

Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21,
has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year, is neurotic, makes less than
$28,000 a year, is likely to buy a minivan in the next six months, is
interested in camping and **whose interests align with those of
African-Americans**. Plus, anyone on Facebook who is similar to them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The recent
[revelation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html)
that Cambridge Analytica collected information of up to 87 million
Facebook users has renewed concerns about privacy on the platform, and
has prompted the company to pledge to improve its privacy tools and
transparency and to re-think at least one aspect of its ad practices.
The company has already said it would drop targeting options based on
third-party data from its advertising platform.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The changes coincide with the introduction of a new law in the European
Union, the [General Data Protection
Regulation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/08/technology/a-tough-task-for-facebook-european-type-privacy-for-all.html).
The law, which is to take effect next month, requires technology
companies to limit their collection of user data to what they need to
perform services, and to obtain customers’ consent for how their data
will be used and with whom it will be shared.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has said the company would
offer all of its users the same privacy required under the European law,
regardless of where they live.
