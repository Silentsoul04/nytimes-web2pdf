The first sign that something was wrong was a continuous busy signal on
the home phone of Doug and Peggy Ryen.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Bill Hughes, who lived nearby, wasn’t initially concerned. His
11-year-old son, Chris, had slept over at the Ryens’ and he thought
maybe they had all gone out for breakfast. But finally at noon Hughes
drove over to pick Chris up and, when no one answered the Ryens’ door,
he peered through the sliding glass doors — and his brain couldn’t
process all the red. “This is paint, makeup,” he thought wildly.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Then reality sank in, and he kicked the kitchen door in. Blood from the
five victims was splattered everywhere. Hughes rushed to his son, but
the body was cold. Doug and Peggy Ryen, both nude, had also been stabbed
to death, and the bloody corpse of their 10-year-old daughter, Jessica,
was in a doorway. But Josh Ryen, 8 years old, was moving feebly on the
floor even though his throat had been slashed and his skull
fractured.

Soon sheriff’s deputies were swarming all over the Ryen house in
affluent, suburban Chino Hills, east of Los Angeles, that day in June
1983. Several signs, including Josh’s personal account, pointed to three
white attackers, and blond or brown hairs were found in the victims’
hands, as if torn off in a struggle.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Sheriff’s deputies were also contacted by the woman whose boyfriend was
a convicted murderer, recently released from prison, whom she suspected
of involvement in the Ryen killings. She not only gave deputies his
bloody coveralls but also told them that his hatchet was missing from
his tool rack and resembled one of the weapons reportedly used in the
attacks.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But instead of testing the coveralls for the Ryens’ blood, the deputies
threw them away–and pursued Cooper. After a racially charged trial, he
was convicted of murdering the Ryens and Chris Hughes and is now on
death row at San Quentin Prison.

<div class="g-item g-text">

This is the story of a broken justice system. It appears that an
innocent man was framed by sheriff’s deputies and is on death row in
part because of dishonest cops, sensational media coverage and flawed
political leaders — including Democrats like Brown and Kamala Harris,
the state attorney general before becoming a U.S. senator, who refused
to allow newly available DNA testing for a black man convicted of
hacking to death a beautiful white family and young neighbor. This was a
failure at every level, and it should prompt reflection not just about
one man on death row but also about profound inequities in our entire
system of justice.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I’m using strong language, I know. But I went to San Quentin to
interview Cooper, reviewed trial transcripts and other documents, spoke
to innumerable people on and off the record, and in 34 years at The New
York Times, I’ve never come across a case in America as outrageous as
Kevin Cooper’s. So hear me out.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Smarter people than me have come to the same conclusion. “This guy is
innocent,” said Thomas R. Parker, a 30-year law enforcement veteran who
was deputy head of the F.B.I.’s office in Los Angeles. “The evidence was
planted, he was framed, the cops lied on the stand.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Parker said the case involved “abject racism,” and he has volunteered
his time investigating the case for the last seven years because he is
horrified that a man he believes was framed is nearing execution.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Or listen to Judge William A. Fletcher of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit. “He is on death row because the San Bernardino
Sheriff’s Department framed him,” Fletcher declared in a [searing 2013
lecture](http://www.nyulawreview.org/sites/default/files/pdf/NYULawReview-89-3-Fletcher_0.pdf).

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

This appears to be a replay of a tragedy we’ve seen before: The police
are under great pressure to solve a sensational crime, they are sure
they have the culprit, and when evidence is lacking they plant it and
give false testimony. This is called “testilying,” and it’s more common
than we’d like to think. In New York City alone, [The New York Times
found](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/18/nyregion/testilying-police-perjury-new-york.html)
“an entrenched perjury problem,” with more than 25 instances of probable
testilying just since 2015.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

How did we get here?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Initially, the authorities searched for three white men, which fit the
evidence from the crime.

That was Cooper, and deputies who examined his file and mug shot saw a
black man with a huge Afro who fit their narrative of an incorrigible
criminal. He had a long arrest record dating back to when he was 7 years
old.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The sheriff’s deputies were sure they had their man: an escaped felon,
one who they thought looked suitably evil. The authorities pivoted and
focused on Cooper, ignoring other threads.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Still, the authorities had a problem: Although they were sure Cooper was
the killer, they couldn’t find fingerprints, hairs or other evidence
implicating him.

<div class="g-item g-text">

So evidence began to turn up in mysterious
ways.

“I ran out to the car and got the slip of paper on which my grandmother

If there’s no apparent motive for Cooper, there are only hints of one
for Lee. His previous murder, of a 17-year-old girl, was at the behest
of a gang leader, Clarence Ray Allen, who raised the same kind of
Arabian horses as the Ryens. There’s some — very squishy, unconfirmed —
evidence that Allen may have previously threatened to kill Peggy Ryen,
that they had a quarrel over a horse sale gone sour, and that she was
terrified of him.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

All this said, let’s be clear that if there’s one lesson from the Cooper
case, it’s that we should be very wary of assuming guilt on the basis of
fragmentary evidence. I tracked down Lee, now 68, and he strongly denied
any involvement in the case. However, he did not want to discuss it and
asked not to be contacted again.

One point in Lee’s favor: He has avoided serious tangles with the law in
the decades since the Ryen killings.

With all these uninvestigated threads, it’s worth considering the

Then, a day after the bodies were discovered, the district attorney
closed the on-scene investigation for fear, he said, of gathering so
much evidence that defense experts could spin complicated theories.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Concerns with the San Bernardino sheriff’s deputies have continued since
then.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Almost exactly 10 years after the Ryen murders, there was another
terrible murder in San Bernardino County, and a man named William
Richards was convicted in part based on evidence “discovered” by the
same sheriff’s office lab technician who earlier had “found” evidence
against Cooper. Later, it turned out that this evidence was planted, and
Richards was eventually exonerated. (The sheriff’s office declined to
comment for this article.)

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The only witness to the murders themselves, of course, was Josh Ryen,
who endured a physical and emotional trauma that is unimaginable. By the
time of the trial, he had no clear memory of what happened or of seeing
an intruder.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Yet his first memories were clearer. I tracked down Don Gamundoy, who at
the time of the murders was a social worker at the hospital to which
Josh was rushed. “He was awake and alert,” Gamundoy recalled.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Josh could hear but couldn’t speak because of the wound to his throat,
so Gamundoy wrote the alphabet, the numbers and the words “yes” and “no”
on a piece of paper and asked Josh to point to the letters to spell his
name, phone number and birth date. Josh did so correctly, showing that
the method worked.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Then Gamundoy asked Josh if the people who did this were black.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“He pointed to ‘no,’” Gamundoy told me. Communicating in the same way,
Josh said that the attackers were white, and that there were three or
four of them.

This was a chaotic scene unfolding as doctors were struggling to treat
the boy, but Gamundoy said he had asked each question twice to make sure
the answers were not a mistake. Sheriff’s deputies were present and
observing, he said, and in interviews with deputies later, Josh referred
to the attackers as “they,” saying that “they” had chased him.

With a good defense, Cooper might have prevailed. But his county public
defender was overwhelmed and made a series of practical legal mistakes.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“Kevin got convicted because they framed him and because he didn’t have
a half-decent defense,” said Norman C. Hile, his current lawyer. Hile,
now retired as a partner in the international law firm Orrick,
Herrington & Sutcliffe, has volunteered on the case for the last 14
years because he fiercely believes in Cooper’s innocence.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

This is a familiar pattern: Inmates have third-rate defenders at trial,
but after they are sentenced to death they get the help of brilliant
free counsel; by then it is often too late to undo the damage.

Cooper’s trial unfolded amid the ugliest racism. At a hearing, a crowd
displayed signs reading “Hang the Nigger.” One man displayed a noose
around a stuffed gorilla.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Newspapers carried inaccurate reports, apparently based on prosecution
leaks, that tied Cooper to the murder scene and suggested falsely that
he was gay (seizing upon 1980s homophobia as well as racism).

Cooper was scheduled to be executed at 12:01 a.m. on Feb. 10, 2004. On
Feb. 9, he was offered a last meal (he turned it down), and led on the
“dead man walking” path to a holding area beside the execution cell.
He was strip-searched, given new clothes to die in, and guards searched
his arms for veins that could be used to administer lethal injections. A
pastor visited to pray with him.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Yet on what was supposed to be his last day, the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit granted a stay of execution, and a few hours before
the end, the warden halted the machinery of death.

Cooper was now permitted to conduct a new test on the tan T-shirt, and
this time the labs found something extraordinary. Yes, that may have
been Cooper’s blood on it — but the blood had a chemical preservative
called EDTA in it. That suggested that the blood came not from Cooper
directly but from a test tube of his blood. Sure enough, the sheriff’s
deputies had taken a sample of Cooper’s blood and had kept it in a test
tube with EDTA.

— William A. Fletcher

A United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, speaking about
Kevin Cooper’s case

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Cooper’s case began to get traction. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
en banc refused to hear an appeal by Cooper, but Fletcher wrote a
remarkable 100-page dissent, concluding, “The State of California may be
about to execute an innocent man.” Four judges joined in this
extraordinary judicial opinion.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Likewise, the [Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
found](https://kevincooperorg.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/iachr-report-no-26-15-dated-7-21-15.pdf)in
2015 that there had been profound flaws in the case and called for a
review. The deans of four law schools and the president of the American
Bar Association expressed concerns. At the end of his term in office,
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger urged a “thorough and careful review” of the
case.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Five of the original jurors signed declarations expressing concerns
about the case and calling for new DNA testing or for clemency. An
award-winning book, “Scapegoat,” concluded that Cooper had been framed.
In February 2016, Hile and the Orrick law firm submitted to Governor
Brown [a 235-page clemency
petition](https://kevincooperorg.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/kevin-cooper_s-petition-for-executive-clemency.pdf),
pleading for advanced DNA testing of evidence from the case.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Cooper’s lawyers ask above all for new “touch DNA” testing — capable of
detecting microscopic residues — of the tan T-shirt, the hatchet and the
blond or brown hairs found in the victims’ hands. This might determine
who wore the tan T-shirt or handled the hatchet, and whom the hairs came
from. Was it Kevin Cooper? Or was it Lee?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

As state attorney general, Kamala Harris refused to allow this advanced
DNA testing and showed no interest in the case (on Friday, after the
online publication of this column, Senator Harris called me to say "I
feel awful about this" and put out [a
statement](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/KamalaHarris/posts/10156769408692923)
saying: "As a firm believer in DNA testing, I hope the governor and the
state will allow for such testing in the case of Kevin Cooper."). As for
Brown, he has not responded in the two years since the petition was
filed, and he refused to be interviewed. His spokesman, Gareth Lacy,
told me that the petition “remains under review.” Brown leaves office in
January, and I think he is running out the clock.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

One reason Brown may be hesitant to weigh in: For four years before
becoming governor, he was attorney general, and during that time he
suggested that no one on death row was innocent. I hope that this won’t
keep him from allowing advanced DNA testing.

</div>

<div class="g-item break">

<div class="g-item g-text">

California voters in 2016 approved a ballot measure to hasten
executions. So, depending on how litigation unfolds, Cooper could again
be led to the execution chamber sometime in the next year or so — and
even if he delays execution, he feels he is wasting
away.

a 4.5-foot-by-11-foot cell.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Cooper told me about his abusive and troubled childhood in Pennsylvania,
where he was adopted as a baby. When prosecutors said that Cooper had
tangled with the law since the age of 7, they were right, but he says
that the reason is that he was running away from home to escape
beatings. His childhood involved shoplifting, marijuana smoking,
juvenile detention and negligible education; he never graduated from
high school.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

These days in prison, Cooper has remedied his lack of education with a
G.E.D. diploma and comes across as smart, passionate and articulate. But
he’s not optimistic that the governor or courts will block his
execution.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“I don’t have any confidence,” he told me. “I don’t believe in the
system.” He also spends his time writing a memoir, which now stands at
more than 300 pages. “That’s my motivating factor to get out of here, to
tell my story and tell the truth about this rotten-ass system,” he said.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I asked Cooper whom he blamed. The sheriff? The jury? “I blame myself
first and foremost, for walking out of Chino prison, for letting those
people get their hands on me,” he said. “I regret that every day of my
life.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Time and again, Cooper came back to a larger point: The criminal justice
system is unfair to poor people and members of minorities.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“I’m frameable, because I’m an uneducated black man in America,” he
said. “Sometimes it’s race, and sometimes it’s class.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“The only people here on death row to my understanding are the poor,” he
added. “Even the white people on death row, they’re poor. If they’re
white, racism goes away and classism jumps in and takes its place.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Although Cooper’s defenders note that before the murders he had never
been convicted of a violent offense, or even charged with one, it’s a
bit more complicated: He has been accused of rape without being charged.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I’m particularly troubled by one episode. Cooper admits forcing a
17-year-old girl into a vehicle in 1982. She says that he also hit her,
threatened to kill her and raped her, and she went afterward to a
hospital to seek treatment; he flatly denies hitting or raping her. Hile
says that if the evidence had been strong, Cooper would have been
charged with rape. For my part, I can’t think why the girl would have
lied, and although it’s impossible to know after 36 years what happened,
it bothers me.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

It’s obvious to you by now that this is not a usual column — I’m not
sure The Times has ever published a column of this length — so why am I
exploring the case with such passion? I became interested primarily
because Fletcher and other respected federal appeals judges had said he
was framed. That just doesn’t
happen.

<div class="g-item g-text">

I’m also haunted by something else. In 2000, I proposed reporting a
lengthy piece about doubts about the conviction of Cameron Willingham,
who was then on death row in Texas for the arson murder of his three
children. An editor talked me out of it, and I never did write about
Willingham, who was executed in 2004. Since then, [growing
evidence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/letter-from-witness-casts-further-doubt-on-2004-texas-execution/2015/03/09/d9ebdab8-c451-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html?utm_term=.45bc6814a119)has
[emerged](https://theintercept.com/2017/05/02/texas-prosecutor-in-junk-science-execution-case-stands-trial-for-misconduct/)
that he was innocent, and perhaps it’s partly to atone for my earlier
failure that I’ve taken up Cooper’s case.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

If Cooper is innocent, he would have plenty of company. The Death
Penalty Information Center says that since 1973, [at least 162
people](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf) sentenced
to death have been exonerated. [One peer-reviewed
study](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230) estimated that at least
4.1 percent of those sentenced to death in the United States are
innocent; that would mean that on California’s death row alone, where
746 people await execution, about 30 have been wrongfully convicted.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Moreover, there’s abundant evidence that executions in America are
linked to race: [One study in Washington
State](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/WashRaceStudy2014.pdf)
found that jurors were three times as likely to hand down a death
sentence for a black defendant as for a white defendant in a similar
case.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Decades after Cooper’s trial, many of the people involved have died or
didn’t want to talk to me. Some who were willing to talk insist that the
trial was fair and Cooper was properly convicted.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

William Baird, the sheriff’s office lab expert who in 1983 found
suspicious shoe print evidence supposedly linking Cooper to the crime
scene, told me that the evidence was real. He acknowledged having stolen
heroin from the evidence room but said that had nothing to do with the
evidence against Cooper.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I also spoke to Bill Hughes, who discovered the bodies of the Ryens and
of his son, Chris. He is certain that Cooper is responsible: “There is
no doubt in my mind that he did that.” His wife, Mary Ann, is equally
passionate: She spoke of her family’s suffering as the case drags on
without closure, of her certainty that Cooper is simply trying to
distract from overwhelming evidence against him, of her frustration at
calls for further testing when there has already been forensic testing
for 35 years.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I told Bill and Mary Ann Hughes that my heart breaks for them. And of
course, I can’t be sure that Kevin Cooper is innocent. One lesson to
absorb from the criminal justice system’s past mistakes is that we need
some humility about our own ability to ferret out truth.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

That’s why the governor should allow advanced DNA testing, especially of
the hairs and of the T-shirt and hatchet, and why Dianne Feinstein,
Gavin Newsom and other California politicians should back the call.

I know readers will ask me what they can do, and I don’t have a good
answer beyond [contacting Brown’s
office](https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov39mail/) or signing a
[petition](https://act.amnestyusa.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1839&ea.campaign.id=40574)
calling for clemency. Another takeaway is to regard our criminal justice
system, especially in its interactions with the poor or racial
minorities, with greater skepticism.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Maybe in the grand scheme of things, the fate of one man on death row
doesn’t seem so important; innumerable people die tragically every day.
Yet we aspire to be a nation where we are all equal before the law, and
if we execute a man in so flawed a case without even bothering to test
the evidence rigorously, then a piece of our justice system dies along
with Kevin Cooper.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Governor Brown, if you’re reading this, I understand that you may
believe that Cooper is guilty. But other smart people, including federal
judges and law school deans, believe him innocent. So how can you
possibly execute him without even allowing advanced DNA testing, at the
defense’s expense, to resolve the doubt? What’s your argument for
refusing to allow testing?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor once wrote that
“the execution of a legally and factually innocent person would be a
constitutionally intolerable event.” She’s right: It is not just
Cooper’s life that is at stake, but also the legitimacy of our system
of laws. This is a test of Governor Brown, of our justice system, of our
politicians, and of us.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“This is bigger than me,” Cooper told me in our prison meeting. “This is
bigger than any one person.”
