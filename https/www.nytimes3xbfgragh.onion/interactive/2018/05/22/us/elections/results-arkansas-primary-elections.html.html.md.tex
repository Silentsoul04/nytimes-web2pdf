\section{Arkansas Primary Election
Results}\label{arkansas-primary-election-results}}

By THE NEW YORK TIMES May 29, 2018, 12:23 PM ET

Arkansans are choosing candidates for governor and for their state's
four House seats. Gov. Asa Hutchinson is expected to remain in office
after holding off a primary challenge from Jan Morgan, a conservative
former television personality who tied her campaign to President Trump's
``America First'' platform.

Keep a close eye, too, on the Second District, where four Democrats are
running to challenge Representative French Hill, the Republican
incumbent. All four of Arkansas's House districts are represented by
Republicans, but the Second --- which includes Little Rock, the state's
capital and largest city --- is the least conservative of the bunch, and
the Democrats believe they have a chance to retake it in November.

State Representative Clarke Tucker, national Democrats' candidate of
choice for the seat, has some challengers, including Gwen Combs, who has
been endorsed by the National Organization for Women. Mr. Tucker is
expected to come in first on Tuesday, but he may not reach the 50
percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.
