\section{Mississippi Primary Election
Results}\label{mississippi-primary-election-results}}

By THE NEW YORK TIMES June 11, 2018, 11:21 AM ET

In an unusual situation, both of Mississippi's Senate seats are in play
this year: Senator Roger Wicker is seeking re-election to one of them,
and the seat Thad Cochran
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/05/us/politics/thad-cochran-retire-senate.html}{vacated
this spring} is open. Mr. Wicker advanced to the general election on
Tuesday; the special election to replace Mr. Cochran will take place in
November.

Electorally speaking, Mr. Cochran's retirement was good news for Mr.
Wicker. Chris McDaniel --- a conservative firebrand who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/06/25/us/politics/thad-cochran-chris-mcdaniel-mississippi-senate-primary.html}{almost
unseated Mr. Cochran in 2014} ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/26/us/politics/mississippi-mcdaniel-wicker-primary-fight.html}{was
expected} to mount a strong primary challenge to Mr. Wicker this year,
but he is now running for the open seat instead. Mississippi is one of
the most solidly Republican states in the nation, so Mr. Wicker's
re-election is basically assured.
