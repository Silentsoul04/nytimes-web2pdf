\section{South Carolina Primary Runoff Election
Results}\label{south-carolina-primary-runoff-election-results}}

By THE NEW YORK TIMES June 28, 2018, 11:14 AM ET

\textbf{What to watch:} South Carolina will hold a runoff election for
the Republican nomination for governor after the incumbent, Gov. Henry
McMaster, failed to win more than 50 percent of the vote in the
Republican primary this month.

Mr. McMaster, who took over as governor after Nikki Haley joined the
Trump administration last year, is running for his first full term in
the governor's mansion.

His opponent in the runoff is John Warren, a businessman and self-styled
political outsider, who won about 28 percent of the primary vote.
