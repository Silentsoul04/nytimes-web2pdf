</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

GENOA, Italy — An off-duty firefighter, Davide Capello, had just driven
out of a tunnel and onto the main bridge over Genoa in a heavy summer
rain, when he heard a low, dull rumble all around his car. It was not
thunder.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mr. Capello, 33, glanced upward and saw a huge cloud of white dust
rising up in the fog and rain. A white sedan 20 or 30 yards ahead of him
seemed to disappear into a void. He hit the brakes. But the emptiness
advanced toward him as the road fell away, section by section, like a
staircase to oblivion.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In a split second, his car was plummeting, nose down, the windshield
darkened by dust and concrete blocks flying past him. “I am dead\! I am
dead\!” he cried.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

He was in free fall.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The bridge he was driving across, a viaduct designed by Riccardo
Morandi, [collapsed that
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/14/world/europe/italy-genoa-bridge-collapse.html),
Aug. 14, [leaving 43 people
dead](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/18/world/europe/italy-genoa-morandi-bridge-funeral.html)
as dozens of cars fell some 150 feet onto the riverbed, railroad tracks
and gritty streets below.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The collapse of the bridge — a signature of the port city, a source of
deep civic pride, and an [indispensable daily transportation
link](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/16/world/europe/genoa-morandi-bridge-political-paralysis.html)
for thousands — has scarred Genoa and set off a bitter debate in Italy
about who bears responsibility for the disaster and precisely what
caused it.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Those questions remain under investigation by the chief magistrate of
the region, Francesco Cozzi, and a team of engineers, security and
government officials.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The New York Times has recreated what happened by using investigators’
descriptions of a central piece of evidence — video footage captured by
a security
camera.

<div class="g-item g-text">

He warned the company that manages the bridge, Autostrade per l’Italia,
or Highways for Italy, but he said that it never followed up on his
recommendation to perform a fuller computer study and to outfit the
bridge with permanent sensors.

“Probably they underestimated the importance of the information,”
Professor Gentile said in an interview.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Autostrade never denied Professor Gentile’s findings, but said that no
one had perceived any urgency. **** In a statement this week, Autostrade
said that Professor Gentile’s suggestions were included in a proposal to
retrofit the viaduct that was approved in June, but blamed the Ministry
of Infrastructure for months of delays in authorizing the work.

The footage from the security camera has not been previously reported in

Because the investigation is in its early stages, conclusions could
still change. For example, an unseen failure in the roadway structure or
a shift in the tower foundations could have triggered the failure of the
stays. Further work remains to eliminate such possibilities.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Still, the rumble Mr. Capello heard, according to Professor Gentile, was
most probably the initial snapping of the steel within the supports he
had warned about.

## A Simple Design Invited Dangers

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

When it was built in the 1960s, Genoa’s viaduct was more than just a
bridge. It was a 3,600-foot journey of artistry and innovation that had
garnered its designer, Riccardo Morandi, fame in architectural and
engineering circles around the world.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Its figure was so light and airy it seemed to have leapt from an elegant
line drawing on an engineer’s gridded pad to where it soared over
Genoa’s deep, rolling valleys.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The signature elements were three narrow, A-frame towers that rose
nearly 300 feet, paired with just 12 stays — supports that extended from
the towers and fastened to the sides of the roadway, holding it up.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Even in a country with countless historical structures, it became “one
of Italy’s most important bridges,” said Marzia Marandola, an adjunct
professor of architectural history at Sapienza University in Rome who is
a specialist in Mr. Morandi’s work.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The structure “gave an identity to the site and to the entire area,” she
said. “It managed to become a part of the
landscape.”

Its beauty was its simplicity. But engineers gradually recognized that
the structure had so few crucial supports that if even one of them
failed, an entire section could collapse.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“There is no robustness, or the possibility of redistribution of the
forces,” said Massimo Majowiecki, an architect and engineer in Bologna,
northern Italy.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

That lack of redundancy, as it is now often called, “is not necessarily
inconsistent with how bridges were designed in the 1960s,” said Donald
Dusenberry, a structural engineer with Simpson Gumpertz & Heger in
Boston.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

For that reason, the design “is hard to criticize,” Mr. Dusenberry said,
although he said it placed a premium on inspection and maintenance.

Andrew Herrmann, a structural engineer who is a former president of the
American Society of Civil Engineers, described the peril in the clearest
possible terms.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“If you lose one stay,” Mr. Herrmann said, “the whole thing comes down.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Those concerns were far from theoretical, not least because of another
of Mr. Morandi’s innovations: He suspended the roadway from the stays,
essentially cables bundled together and encased in what is known as a
prestressed concrete
shell.

MODERN CABLE-STAYED BRIDGE

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

All the supports on a similar Morandi bridge in Venezuela were replaced
by cables with a protective sheath, but no concrete, said David
Goodyear, chief bridge engineer at T.Y. Lin International, an
engineering services firm in San Francisco.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In the late 1990s, corrosion and other problems with the easternmost of
the three towers on the Genoa bridge became serious enough that their
supports were given a similar refurbishment.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

For reasons it has not fully explained, Autostrade, which took over
management of the bridge in 1999, did not carry out the same operation
on the supports of the other two towers — including the tower that
collapsed.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But Autostrade was concerned enough by the bridge’s apparent
deterioration that, last October, it asked Professor Gentile to test for
damage that might be hidden deep inside the concrete.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed">

## Warnings of Potential Weakness

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

When it comes to bridges, Professor Gentile is the closest thing to a
musician that exists among structural engineers. He listens to the
sounds that bridges make.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

From those sounds, he determines whether the bridges are safe. Placing
small devices at various points, he has performed his tests on some 300
bridges around the world.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Each part vibrates much like a guitar string: higher loads on the
element, like a tighter string, produce higher frequencies; bigger
elements, like thicker strings, produce lower
notes.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-diptych">

<div class="g-item g-scoop-image">

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Beyond the frequencies, Professor Gentile also tests to see if the
vibrations have the same smooth, predictable wave — like those that
would make lovely notes on a violin. Consistency indicates integrity.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

When the sound is discordant, the work must be accompanied by further
studies, usually involving computer models, to determine exactly what is
wrong.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Over four nights last October, Professor Gentile recorded the
frequencies of the Morandi bridge. Most of the stays on the two towers
he tested sounded fine, Professor Gentile said. But the two southern
stays on what was known as Tower 9 sounded wrong, he found. They were
like damaged strings.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

He suspected corrosion of the cables hidden inside the concrete, some
problem with the points where the supports connected to the tower or the
roadway, or problems elsewhere in the structure, he said.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

To be sure, he recommended that the bridge be permanently outfitted with
sensors and that he undertake additional studies to pin down the reason
for what he called “anomalous” findings.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The Autostrade subcontractor in charge of the work never contacted him
after his contract expired on Oct. 31, Professor Gentile said.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Autostrade, which handles media queries on behalf of the subcontractor,
Spea Engineering, declined to comment.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed">

## Questions of Management

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Autostrade never raised any specific alarm regarding Genoa’s viaduct
with the Ministry of Infrastructure, according to Italian news reports.
Managers at the company, however, exchanged messages noting
“criticalities” in the bridge in the weeks before the collapse, police
investigators told The New York Times. But the officials said it was not
yet clear to what the company managers were referring specifically, or
how aware Autostrade was of the real condition of the bridge.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The company also said that it “promptly fulfilled the concession
obligations” it committed to, including upkeep of the bridge.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But maintenance costs around Genoa, with its aging infrastructure, were
on average twice as high as elsewhere in Italy, and four times as high
for bridges, viaducts and overpasses, according to company documents
published on their website after the bridge
collapse.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-scoop-image">

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

There is now fierce debate in Italy over whether the company did in fact
do enough — along with calls to roll back the privatization of much of
Italy’s roadways.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Autostrade won the concession to run nearly half of Italy’s highways
from a cash-strapped Italian government, starting in 1999. After that,
there were no major renovations of the Morandi bridge.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In late 2017 or early 2018, tests indicated that the bridge had weakened
by an “average” of 10 to 20 percent, Roberto Ferrazza, superintendent at
the local ministry of infrastructure and transportation, told The Times
in an interview.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Experts in bridge construction say it is notoriously difficult to
measure the exact amount of degradation of steel elements buried in
concrete, in the way that they are on the Morandi bridge.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“There’s nothing more imprecise than trying to evaluate the condition of
internal cables,” said Gary J. Klein, a member of the National Academy
of Engineering in the United States who studies structural failures and
is executive vice president at Wiss, Janney, Elstner, an engineering and
architecture firm in Northbrook, Ill. “It’s a very imperfect science.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Because the weakest point could be anywhere on the structure, Mr. Klein
added, “you have to be in the right place at the right time, and so I’m
very skeptical of the accuracy of any such estimate.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

A decision was made, by Autostrade in accordance with the Ministry of
Infrastructure, to refurbish and repair the stays on two towers,
including the one that would collapse. But the work was not yet
scheduled.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-scoop-image">

<div class="g-item g-text">

There were so many constant small repairs that two years ago, an
engineer at the University of Genoa, Antonio Brencich, wrote a paper
recommending that the entire bridge be replaced.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In a brief interview near the bridge’s rubble, Dr. Brencich, who was
part of the team investigating the collapse, said it had been like
owning a car that needed constant fixing — at some point, it would make
more sense to buy a new one.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But that would have been costly.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Immediately after the collapse of the Morandi bridge, Italy’s new
populist governing coalition blamed Autostrade for the catastrophe and
accused the company of poor maintenance.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The anti-establishment Five Star Movement in particular has threatened
to revoke the company’s contract and impose fines of hundreds of
millions of euros.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But their far-right partner in the coalition, the League, led by the
deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has been more cautious.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The party, when it was still named the Northern League, received a
150,000-euro donation from Autostrade, which has given to other
political parties as well.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In 2008, Mr. Salvini and his Northern League voted in Parliament in
favor of renewing the license to Autostrade.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed">

## ‘It Was a War Scene’

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Once the roadway dropped out from under him, Mr. Capello had no idea how
long he fell. Or how far.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

He thought he was surely dead, he told The Times in an interview.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The fall shattered his rear window. He touched his head and his neck,
feeling for blood. He checked his hands, too. His seatbelt, still
fastened, was brushing against his neck. He was all right, but needed
help.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Outside, the rain was incessant, creating a slick mess. One truck from
the bridge had landed on the road underneath, blocking traffic. The
hundreds of water bottles it had been carrying were scattered
everywhere.

<div class="g-item g-text">

“Trying to reach the site was like walking on bars of soap,” said Sergio
Olcese, one of the first firefighters to arrive.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Some cars still lay on the bridge roadway, but were so flattened by the
heavy concrete debris that had rained down, it was hard even to make out
their model. Others were dangling from steel cables.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

A few trucks rested on their sides in the fields, after a 50-yard flight
from the bridge. The smell of gas filled the air. But the heavy rain
dampened the dust of the pulverized concrete.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Some remember the eerie silence, others the firefighters shouting
directions.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mr. Olcese could hear a mother calling out to her daughter, who was
buried alive under the rubble. “Camilla\! Camilla\!,” she screamed.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“Her voice begging us to save her daughter first is the only voice I
remember from the bridge,” he recalled.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

His team dug and moved chunks of concrete for more than an hour and a
half to free the girl and her mother, who was lying on top of the pile
that had buried her daughter, while holding her hand. When the
firefighters managed to extract the women alive from the rubble, they
were exhausted, he said.

</div>

“It was a war scene,” said Maurizio Volpara, an experienced fireman and
coordinator of a team that rescued a man from a van dangling from a
steel cable, 25 yards in the air.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The cabin of the van was facing down, toward the ground, he said, and
the back had been “bombarded” by concrete blocks that had plummeted from
the bridge’s deck.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The young man trapped inside, his face pushed against the dashboard, was
screaming, “Please come and get me\! Get me out of here\!”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mr. Volpara recalled people screaming everywhere — a handful of
survivors fallen from the bridge, rescuers, personnel from the city’s
garbage company whose warehouse was right next to the bridge, and
finally residents.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“It was raining so strongly and had rained all morning,” Giuseppe
Crosetti, another firefighter, said. “Our boots sank in the grass, under
the weight of the
equipment.”

Residents helped the rescuers to carry the heavy equipment needed to cut
open cars and free possible survivors.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Inside Mr. Capello’s car, the sports radio he had on was still playing.
He stretched out a hand to reach the touch screen on the dashboard. He
then dialed the Italian equivalent of 911.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The line was busy, so he turned to one of his most frequent calls, his
own firehouse in Savona, a city 30 miles west of Genoa.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“The bridge collapsed and I am in here, hanging in the balance,” he told
his colleague. “I am between Genoa East and Genoa West highway exits,
and it was full of cars all around me.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Once he knew that the firefighters were on their way, he felt relieved.
He dialed two more numbers.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“I am all right,” he told his girlfriend, whom he had been with just an
hour earlier, before filling the tank and setting off to Genoa. “The
bridge collapsed, but I am alive, don’t worry. I don’t have a scratch.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mr. Capello’s fiance was in disbelief, he said. “What bridge?” she
asked. He had to cut her short. He wanted to reassure his parents, too,
and he knew he had to get out of the car as soon as possible.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“I feared I’d never hear their voices again,” Mr. Capello said.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

When he phoned, his father, a retired fireman with 30 years of service,
told him: “Get out of the car immediately\!”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Then, he heard the voice of a young man screaming outside. “Is anyone in
there?”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“Help me\! I am here,” Mr. Capello replied, unfastening his seatbelt,
and climbing over the seats, through the smashed rear window.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“Get out of there,” a police officer shouted.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

He was on top of a tall pile of rubble. The young man living **** in the
area, who had called for him was a local resident and helped him climb
down.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“As I walked, I looked back and saw that the bridge was gone,” he said
with a shaking voice. “Only then did I realize the magnitude of the
disaster.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Bystanders looked at him incredulously, he said, as he walked away in
his blue rain jacket with Italy’s national flag sewn on it, gray shorts
and white sneakers, soaking wet.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“They looked at me as if I was a phantom,” he said.
