Debbie Mucarsel-Powell has defeated Representative Carlos Curbelo, the
two-term Republican incumbent, in a race that has been considered a
bellwether for a ``blue wave'' in the House. Mr. Curbelo has criticized
President Trump and distanced himself from the Republican congressional
leadership on some issues. Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, an immigrant from
Ecuador and a former associate dean at Florida International University,
painted Mr. Curbelo as a someone who talks like a moderate but tends to
vote with conservatives --- as he did when he voted to repeal the
Affordable Care Act.

Donna Shalala, a Democrat who served in President Bill Clinton's cabinet
and as president of the University of Miami, won the contest to replace
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who is retiring. While the race was
tight, Ms. Shalala was generally favored to win the traditionally
Republican district, which includes Miami Beach, Key Biscayne and Coral
Gables, and which has been tilting more toward Democrats in recent
years.
