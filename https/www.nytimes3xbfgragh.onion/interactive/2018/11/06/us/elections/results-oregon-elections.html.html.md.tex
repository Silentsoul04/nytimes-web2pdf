In a year when the number of female candidates across the country is
setting records, Oregon already has more women in top state leadership
positions than any other state, with track records in office to defend.

Issues like sexual assault and abortion rights that have attracted many
women to join the electoral fray
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/02/us/politics/oregon-women-politics.html}{have
become challenges} for some of the Oregon candidates.

Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat seeking a second term, is up against Knute
Buehler, an orthopedic surgeon who defeated nine other primary
contenders and is a rare Republican candidate who favors abortion
rights. Though Hillary Clinton carried the state by 11 percentage points
in 2016, the race for governor is seen as a toss-up.
