Both of President Trump's preferred candidates in the Wyoming primaries

snubbed by voters} in a solidly conservative state where Mr. Trump won
by his widest margin in 2016. Read more

But two Republican incumbents running for re-election to statewide
offices --- Senator John Barrasso and Representative Liz Cheney --- are
expected to retain their seats after defeating primary challengers.

In the race for governor, Mark Gordon, the current state treasurer, is
widely expected to defeat Mary Throne, a former Democratic minority
leader in the state House of Representatives.
