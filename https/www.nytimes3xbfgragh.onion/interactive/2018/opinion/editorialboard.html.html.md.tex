The New York Times editorial board is made up of opinion journalists who
rely on research, debate and individual expertise to reach a shared view
of important issues. The board does not speak for the newsroom or The
Times as a whole. Rather, amid the contending individual voices of Times
Opinion, it aims to provide a consistent, independent view of the world
based on time-tested institutional values. The board argues for a world
that is both free and fair, believing that societies must struggle to
reconcile these values in order to succeed. It has long supported a
liberal order of nations in which freedom and progress advance through
democracy and capitalism. But it has also sought to guard against the
excesses of those systems by promoting honest governance, civil rights,
equality of opportunity, a healthy planet and a good life for society's
most vulnerable members. Since its founding in 1896, the board has,
above all, championed what Adolph Ochs called ``the free exercise of a
sound conscience,'' believing that the fearless exchange of information
and ideas is the surest means of resisting tyranny and realizing human
potential.
