<span id="g-0" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">I don't know Putin, have no
deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a
deal with Iran, \#1 in terror, no problem\!</span>
<span id="g-1" class="g-quote g-media">The fake news media is going
crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are
unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great\!</span>
<span id="g-2" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">This Russian connection
non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in
Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.</span>
<span id="g-3" class="g-quote g-media">Information is being illegally
given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence
community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia</span>
<span id="g-4" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Thank you to Eli Lake of The
Bloomberg View - "The NSA & FBI...should not interfere in our
politics...and is" Very serious situation for USA</span>
<span id="g-5" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Crimea was TAKEN by Russia
during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?</span>
<span id="g-6" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The real scandal here is that
classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like
candy. Very un-American\!</span>
<span id="g-7" class="g-quote g-media">Leaking, and even illegal
classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years.
Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize\!</span>
<span id="g-8" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The spotlight has finally been
put on the low-life leakers\! They will be caught\!</span>
<span id="g-9" class="g-quote g-media">FAKE NEWS media, which makes up
stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited
Democrats - but they are fading fast\!</span>
<span id="g-10" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">The Democrats had to come up
with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so
they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news\!</span>
<span id="g-11" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The FBI is totally unable to
stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government
for a long time. They can't even......</span>
<span id="g-12" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">find the leakers within the FBI
itself. Classified information is being given to media that could have a
devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW</span>
<span id="g-13" class="g-quote g-media">Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out
by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big
election defeat and the illegal leaks\!</span>
<span id="g-14" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...intentional. This whole
narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that
everyone thought they were supposed.....</span>
<span id="g-15" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...to win. The Democrats are
overplaying their hand. They lost the election, and now they have lost
their grip on reality. The real story...</span>
<span id="g-16" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">...is all of the illegal leaks
of classified and other information. It is a total "witch hunt\!"</span>
<span id="g-17" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">The first meeting Jeff
Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration
under education program for 100 Ambs......</span>
<span id="g-18" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Terrible\! Just found out
that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory.
Nothing found. This is McCarthyism\!</span>
<span id="g-19" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Just out: The same Russian
Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22
times, and 4 times last year alone.</span>
<span id="g-20" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Is it legal for a sitting
President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an
election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW\!</span>
<span id="g-21" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">I'd bet a good lawyer
could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping
my phones in October, just prior to Election\!</span>
<span id="g-22" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">How low has President
Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process.
This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy\!</span>
<span id="g-23" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Is it true the DNC would not
allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning
it was hacked? Can that be possible?</span>
<span id="g-24" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Who was it that secretly
said to Russian President, "Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll
have more flexibility?" @foxandfriends</span>
<span id="g-25" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">For eight years Russia
"ran over" President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea
and added missiles. Weak\! @foxandfriends</span>
<span id="g-26" class="g-quote g-media">James Clapper and others stated
that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE
NEWS and everyone knows it\!</span>
<span id="g-27" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">The Democrats made up and
pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign.
Big advantage in Electoral College & lost\!</span>
<span id="g-28" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The real story that Congress,
the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of
Classified information. Must find leaker now\!</span>
<span id="g-29" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">What about all of the
contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true
that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?</span>
<span id="g-30" class="g-quote g-media">Just watched the totally biased
and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such
dishonesty\!</span> <span id="g-31" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Why
isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary
deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech....</span>
<span id="g-32" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...money to Bill, the
Hillary Russian "reset," praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian
Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. \#MAGA\!</span>
<span id="g-33" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Watch @foxandfriends now on
Podesta and Russia\!</span>
<span id="g-34" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Why doesn't Fake News talk
about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia
to Clinton - sale of Uranium?</span>
<span id="g-35" class="g-quote g-media">Mike Flynn should ask for
immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by
media & Dems, of historic proportion\!</span>
<span id="g-36" class="g-quote g-media">When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd
and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop
with the Fake Trump/Russia story?</span>
<span id="g-37" class="g-quote g-media">It is the same Fake News Media
that said there is "no path to victory for Trump" that is now pushing
the phony Russia story. A total scam\!</span>
<span id="g-38" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Wow, @FoxNews just
reporting big news. Source: "Official behind unmasking is high up. Known
Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked....</span>
<span id="g-39" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">..not associated with
Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated." If this is true,
does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.</span>
<span id="g-40" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">The real story turns out to be
SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING\! Find the leakers.</span>
<span id="g-41" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Such amazing reporting on
unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. "Spied on
before nomination." The real story.</span>
<span id="g-42" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Was the brother of John
Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did
Hillary know?</span>
<span id="g-43" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">.@FoxNews from multiple
sources: "There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close
to Trump. This is unprecedented." @FBI</span>
<span id="g-44" class="g-quote g-comey">FBI Director Comey was the best
thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free
pass for many bad deeds\! The phony...</span>
<span id="g-45" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...Trump/Russia story was an
excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election.
Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?</span>
<span id="g-46" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Susan Rice, the former
National Security Advisor to President Obama, is refusing to testify
before a Senate Subcommittee next week on.....</span>
<span id="g-47" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">...allegations of
unmasking Trump transition officials. Not good\!</span>
<span id="g-48" class="g-quote g-media">When will the Fake Media ask
about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI
to check their server or investigate?</span>
<span id="g-49" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">General Flynn was given
the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the
Fake News seldom likes talking about that.</span>
<span id="g-50" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if
she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after
she explained it to W.H. Counsel.</span>
<span id="g-51" class="g-quote g-media">Director Clapper reiterated what
everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is "no
evidence" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.</span>
<span id="g-52" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Sally Yates made the fake media
extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news\!</span>
<span id="g-53" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">The Russia-Trump
collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade
end?</span> <span id="g-54" class="g-quote g-media">Biggest story today
between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report
on this? \#FakeNews\!</span>
<span id="g-55" class="g-quote g-comey">Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated
recently, "I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer."
Then acts so indignant. \#draintheswamp</span>
<span id="g-56" class="g-quote g-comey">The Democrats have said some of
the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be
fired, but now they play so sad\!</span>
<span id="g-57" class="g-quote g-comey">James Comey will be replaced by
someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and
prestige of the FBI.</span>
<span id="g-58" class="g-quote g-comey">Comey lost the confidence of
almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When
things calm down, they will be thanking me\!</span>
<span id="g-59" class="g-quote g-comey">Watching Senator Richard
Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke. "Richie" devised one of the
greatest military frauds in U.S. history. For....</span>
<span id="g-60" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">years, as a pol in
Connecticut, Blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in
Vietnam - except he was never there. When....</span>
<span id="g-61" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">caught, he cried like a
baby and begged for forgiveness...and now he is judge & jury. He should
be the one who is investigated for his acts.</span>
<span id="g-62" class="g-quote g-media">The Roger Stone report on @CNN
is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had
nothing to do with my decision.</span>
<span id="g-63" class="g-quote g-comey">Dems have been complaining for
months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they
PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites\!</span>
<span id="g-64" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Russia must be laughing up
their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat
EXCUSE for losing the election.</span>
<span id="g-65" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Again, the story that there
was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by
Dems as an excuse for losing the election.</span>
<span id="g-66" class="g-quote g-comey">James Comey better hope that
there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to
the press\!</span> <span id="g-67" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">When
James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the
witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?</span>
<span id="g-68" class="g-quote g-comey">I have been asking Director
Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the
LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....</span>
<span id="g-69" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">This is the single
greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history\!</span>
<span id="g-70" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">With all of the illegal
acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration,
there was never a special counsel appointed\!</span>
<span id="g-71" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Russian officials must be
laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the
election has taken over the Fake News.</span>
<span id="g-72" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">So now it is reported
that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't
want him to testify. He blows away their....</span>
<span id="g-73" class="g-quote g-comey">...case against him & now wants
to clear his name by showing "the false or misleading testimony by James
Comey, John Brennan..." Witch Hunt\!</span>
<span id="g-74" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Crooked Hillary Clinton now
blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible
candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC.</span>
<span id="g-75" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">The big story is the
"unmasking and surveillance" of people that took place during the Obama
Administration.</span> <span id="g-76" class="g-quote g-comey">I believe
the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever
thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly\!'</span>
<span id="g-77" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">A.G. Lynch made law
enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a
free pass and protection. Totally illegal\!</span>
<span id="g-78" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">They made up a phony
collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for
obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice</span>
<span id="g-79" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">You are witnessing the
single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some
very bad and conflicted people\! \#MAGA</span>
<span id="g-80" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Why is that Hillary Clintons
family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my
non-dealings are?</span>
<span id="g-81" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Crooked H destroyed phones
w/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, & had husband meet w/AG days before she
was cleared- & they talk about obstruction?</span>
<span id="g-82" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">After 7 months of
investigations & committee hearings about my "collusion with the
Russians," nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad\!</span>
<span id="g-83" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">Despite the phony Witch
Hunt going on in America, the economic & jobs numbers are great.
Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up\!</span>
<span id="g-84" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">I am being investigated for
firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI
Director\! Witch Hunt</span>
<span id="g-85" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">Former Homeland
Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to
state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia.</span>
<span id="g-86" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">By the way, if Russia was
working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama
Admin. Why didn't they stop them?</span>
<span id="g-87" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...Why did Democratic
National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks
(long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX\!</span>
<span id="g-88" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...Why did the DNC REFUSE to
turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem
scam and excuse for losing the election\!</span>
<span id="g-89" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">With all of the recently
reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal
leaking of information, I have no idea...</span>
<span id="g-90" class="g-quote g-comey">...whether there are "tapes" or
recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and
do not have, any such recordings.</span>
<span id="g-91" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Just out: The Obama
Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election
meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?</span>
<span id="g-92" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Since the Obama
Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians
were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T\!</span>
<span id="g-93" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">Obama Administration
official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling
of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?</span>
<span id="g-94" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">The reason that President
Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of
meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..</span>
<span id="g-95" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">...and did not want to
"rock the boat." He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it
did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.</span>
<span id="g-96" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">The real story is that
President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian
meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...</span>
<span id="g-97" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">..under a magnifying
glass, they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding. There is no
collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology\!</span>
<span id="g-98" class="g-quote g-obama-admin">From @FoxNews "Bombshell:
In 2016, Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American
election." Check out his statement - Witch Hunt\!</span>
<span id="g-99" class="g-quote g-media">Wow, CNN had to retract big
story on "Russia," with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the
other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS\!</span>
<span id="g-100" class="g-quote g-media">Fake News CNN is looking at big
management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony
Russian stories. Ratings way down\!</span>
<span id="g-101" class="g-quote g-media">So they caught Fake News CNN
cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC? What about the failing @nytimes &
@washingtonpost? They are all Fake News\!</span>
<span id="g-102" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Everyone here is talking
about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the
CIA. Disgraceful\!</span>
<span id="g-103" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">...and safe. Questions were
asked about why the CIA & FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their
SERVER, and were rejected, still don't....</span>
<span id="g-104" class="g-quote g-media">...have it. Fake News said 17
intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do
NOTHING when he had info before election?</span>
<span id="g-105" class="g-quote g-comey">James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal\!</span>
<span id="g-106" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">My son Donald did a
good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the
greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad\!</span>
<span id="g-107" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">.@WashTimes states
"Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the
presidential election against Donald Trump."</span>
<span id="g-108" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">Why aren't the same
standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have
gotten away with. Disgraceful\!</span>
<span id="g-109" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">HillaryClinton can
illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my
son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?</span>
<span id="g-110" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">Thank you to former
campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was
no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.</span>
<span id="g-111" class="g-quote g-comey">A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from
the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These
illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop\!</span>
<span id="g-112" class="g-quote g-media">While all agree the U. S.
President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only
crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS</span>
<span id="g-113" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">So many people are asking why
isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or
Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?</span>
<span id="g-114" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">...What about all of the
Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian
Reset, big dollar speeches etc.</span>
<span id="g-115" class="g-quote g-2016-dems">My son Donald openly gave
his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton
deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails\!</span>
<span id="g-116" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">As the phony Russian
Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost
election taking hold, Democrats and Russians\!</span>
<span id="g-117" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">After 1 year of
investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated
that "Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia."</span>
<span id="g-118" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">So why aren't the Committees
and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into
Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?</span>
<span id="g-119" class="g-quote g-muellergeneral">Sleazy Adam Schiff,
the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia," spends all of his
time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse\!</span>
<span id="g-120" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Ukrainian efforts to sabotage
Trump campaign - "quietly working to boost Clinton." So where is the
investigation A.G. @seanhannity</span>
<span id="g-121" class="g-quote g-fbidoj">Attorney General Jeff Sessions
has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are

Trump has described Paul Manafort, his onetime campaign chairman â who

Mr. Trump praised Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime associate who has

against him.

<div class="g-item g-text">

And Mr. Trump called his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., a âgood boyâ who
did nothing wrong in arranging a meeting at Trump Tower with a
