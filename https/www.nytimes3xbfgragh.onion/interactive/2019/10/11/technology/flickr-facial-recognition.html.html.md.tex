Millions of Flickr images were sucked into a database called MegaFace.
Now some of those faces may have the ability to sue.

One day in 2005, a mother in Evanston, Ill., joined Flickr. She uploaded
some pictures of her children, Chloe and Jasper. Then she more or less
forgot her account existed.

Years later, their faces are in a database that's used to test and train
some of the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems in the
world.

The pictures of Chloe and Jasper Papa as kids are typically goofy fare:
grinning with their parents; sticking their tongues out; costumed for
Halloween. Their mother, Dominique Allman Papa, uploaded them to Flickr
after joining the photo-sharing site in 2005.

None of them could have foreseen that 14 years later, those images would
reside in an unprecedentedly huge facial-recognition database called
\href{http://megaface.cs.washington.edu/}{MegaFace}. Containing the
likenesses of nearly 700,000 individuals, it has been downloaded by
dozens of companies to train a new generation of face-identification
algorithms, used to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/26/technology/hong-kong-protests-facial-recognition-surveillance.html}{track
protesters}, surveil terrorists, spot problem gamblers and spy on the
public at large.

``It's gross and uncomfortable,'' said Mx. Papa, who is now 19 and
attending college in Oregon. ``I wish they would have asked me first if
I wanted to be part of it. I think artificial intelligence is cool and I
want it to be smarter, but generally you ask people to participate in
research. I learned that in high school biology.''

By law, most Americans in the database don't need to be asked for their
permission --- but the Papas should have been.

As residents of Illinois, they are protected by one of the strictest
state privacy laws on the books: the Biometric Information Privacy Act,
a 2008 measure that imposes financial penalties for using an
Illinoisan's fingerprints or face scans without consent.

Those who used the database --- companies including Google, Amazon,
Mitsubishi Electric, Tencent and SenseTime --- appear to have been
unaware of the law, and as a result may have huge financial liability,
according to several lawyers and law professors familiar with the
legislation.

\subsection{How MegaFace was born}\label{how-megaface-was-born}}

How did the Papas and hundreds of thousands of other people end up in
the database? It's a roundabout story.

In the infancy of facial-recognition technology, researchers developed
their algorithms with subjects' clear consent: In the 1990s,
\href{https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-technology-feret}{universities}
had volunteers come to studios to be photographed from many angles.
Later, researchers turned to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/13/technology/databases-faces-facial-recognition-technology.html}{more
aggressive and surreptitious methods} to gather faces at
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facial-recognition-s-dirty-little-secret-millions-online-photos-scraped-n981921}{a
grander scale}, tapping into surveillance cameras in coffee shops,
college campuses and public spaces, and scraping photos posted online.

According to Adam Harvey, an artist who
\href{https://megapixels.cc/}{tracks the data sets}, there are probably
more than 200 in existence, containing tens of millions of photos of
approximately one million people. (Some of the sets are derived from
others, so the figures include some duplicates.) But these caches had
flaws. Surveillance images are often low quality, for example, and
gathering pictures from the internet tends to yield too many
celebrities.

In June 2014, seeking to advance the cause of computer vision, Yahoo
unveiled what it called ``\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01817}{the
largest public multimedia collection that has ever been released},''
featuring 100 million photos and videos. Yahoo got the images --- all of
which had Creative Commons or commercial use licenses --- from Flickr, a
subsidiary.

The database creators said their motivation was to even the playing
field in machine learning. Researchers need enormous amounts of data to
train their algorithms, and workers at just a few information-rich
companies --- like Facebook and Google --- had a big advantage over
everyone else.

``We wanted to empower the research community by giving them a robust
database,'' said David Ayman Shamma, who was a director of research at
Yahoo until 2016 and helped create the Flickr project. Users weren't
notified that their photos and videos were included, but Mr. Shamma and
his team built in what they thought was a safeguard.

They didn't distribute users' photos directly, but rather links to the
photos; that way, if a user deleted the images or made them private,
they would no longer be accessible through the database.

But this safeguard was flawed. The New York Times found a security
vulnerability that allows a Flickr user's photos to be accessed even
after they've been made private. (Scott Kinzie, a spokesman for SmugMug,
which acquired Flickr from Yahoo in 2018, said the flaw ``potentially
impacts a very small number of our members today, and we are actively
working to deploy an update as quickly as possible.'' Ben MacAskill, the
company's chief operating officer, added that the Yahoo collection was
created ``years before our engagement with Flickr.'')

Additionally, some researchers who accessed the database simply
downloaded versions of the images and then redistributed them, including
a team from the University of Washington. In 2015, two of the school's
computer science professors --- Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman and Steve
Seitz --- and their graduate students used the Flickr data to create
MegaFace.

Containing more than four million photos of some 672,000 people, it held
deep promise for testing and perfecting face-recognition algorithms.

\subsection{Monitoring Uighurs and outing porn
actors}\label{monitoring-uighurs-and-outing-porn-actors}}

Importantly to the University of Washington researchers, MegaFace
included children like Chloe and Jasper Papa. Face-recognition systems
tend to perform poorly on young people, but Flickr offered a chance to
improve that with a bonanza of children's faces, for the simple reason
that people love posting photos of their kids online.

In 2015 and 2016, the University of Washington ran the ``MegaFace
Challenge,'' inviting groups working on face-recognition technology to
use the data set to test how well their algorithms were working.

The school asked people downloading the data to agree to use it only for
``noncommercial research and educational purposes.'' More than 100
organizations participated, including Google, Tencent, SenseTime and
NtechLab. In all, according to
\href{https://www.washington.edu/news/2016/06/23/how-well-do-facial-recognition-algorithms-cope-with-a-million-strangers/}{a
2016 university news release}, ``more than 300 research groups'' have
worked with the database. It has been publicly cited by researchers from
Amazon and, according to
\href{https://megapixels.cc/datasets/megaface/}{Mr. Harvey}, Mitsubishi
Electric and Philips.

Some of these companies have been criticized for the way clients have
deployed their algorithms: SenseTime's technology has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html}{used
to monitor the Uighur population in China}, while NtechLab's has been
used to
\href{https://splinternews.com/this-face-recognition-company-is-causing-havoc-in-russi-1793856482}{out
pornography actors and identify strangers} on the subway in Russia.

SenseTime's chief marketing officer, June Jin, said that company
researchers used the MegaFace database only for academic purposes.
``Researchers have to use the same data set to ensure their results are
comparable like-for-like,'' Ms. Jin wrote in an email. ``As MegaFace is
the most widely recognized database of its kind, it has become the de
facto facial-recognition training and test set for the global academic
and research community.''

NtechLab spokesman Nikolay Grunin said the company deleted MegaFace
after taking part in the challenge, and added that ``the main build of
our algorithm has never been trained on these images.'' Google declined
to comment.

A spokeswoman for the University of Washington declined to make
MegaFace's lead researchers available for interviews, saying they ``have
moved on to other projects and don't have the time to comment on this.''
Efforts to contact them individually were unsuccessful.

MegaFace's creation was financed in part by Samsung, Google's Faculty
Research Award, and by the National Science Foundation/Intel.

In recent years, Ms. Kemelmacher-Shlizerman has sold a face-swapping
image company to Facebook and advanced deep-fake technology by
converting audio clips of Barack Obama into a realistic, synthetic video
of him giving a speech. She is now working on a ``moonshot project'' at
Google.

MegaFace remains publicly available for download. When The New York
Times recently requested access, it was granted within a minute.

MegaFace doesn't contain people's names, but its data is not anonymized.
A spokesman for the University of Washington said researchers wanted to
honor the images' Creative Commons licenses. As a result, each photo
includes a numerical identifier that links back to the original Flickr
photographer's account. In this way, The Times was able to trace many
photos in the database to the people who took them.

``What the hell? That is bonkers,'' said Nick Alt, an entrepreneur in
Los Angeles, when told his pictures were in the database, including
photos he took of children at a public event in Playa Vista, Calif., a
decade ago.

Mr. Alt's photos, with a selection of images from MegaFace.

``The reason I went to Flickr originally was that you could set the
license to be noncommercial. Absolutely would I not have let my photos
be used for machine-learning projects. I feel like such a schmuck for
posting that picture. But I did it 13 years ago, before privacy was a
thing.''

Another subject, who asked to be identified as J., is now a 15-year-old
high school sophomore in Las Vegas. Photos of him as a toddler are in
the MegaFace database, thanks to his uncle's posting them to a Flickr
album after a family reunion a decade ago. J. was incredulous that it
wasn't illegal to put him in the database without his permission, and he
is worried about the repercussions.

Since middle school, he has been part of an Air Force Association
program called CyberPatriot, which tries to steer young people with
programming skills toward careers in cybersecurity. ``I'm very
protective of my digital footprint because of it,'' he said. ``I try not
to post photos of myself online. What if I decide to work for the
N.S.A.?''

For J., Mr. Alt and most other Americans in the photos, there is little
recourse. Privacy law is generally so permissive in the United States
that companies are free to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/13/technology/databases-faces-facial-recognition-technology.html}{use
millions of people's faces without their knowledge} to power the spread
of face-recognition technology. But there is an exception.

In 2008, Illinois passed a prescient
\href{http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004\&ChapterID=57}{law}
protecting the ``biometric identifiers and biometric information'' of
its residents. Two other states, Texas and Washington, went on to pass
their own biometric privacy laws, but they aren't as robust as the one
in Illinois, which strictly forbids private entities to collect,
capture, purchase or otherwise obtain a person's biometrics ---
including a scan of their ``face geometry'' --- without that person's
consent.

``Photos themselves are not covered by the Biometric Information Privacy
Act, but the scan of the photos should be. The mere use of biometric
data is a violation of the statute,'' said Faye Jones, a law professor
at the University of Illinois. ``Using that in an algorithmic contest
when you haven't notified people is a violation of the law.''

Illinois residents like the Papas whose faceprints are used without
their permission have the right to sue, said Ms. Jones, and are entitled
to \$1,000 per use, or \$5,000 if the use was ``reckless.'' The Times
attempted to measure how many people from Illinois are in the MegaFace
database; one approach, using self-reported location information,
suggested 6,000 individuals, and another, using geotagging metadata,
indicated as many as 13,000.

Their biometrics have likely been processed by dozens of companies.
According to multiple legal experts in Illinois, the combined liability
could add up to more than a billion dollars, and could form the basis of
a class action.

``We have plenty of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/05/technology/unpopular-in-silicon-valley.html}{ambitious
class-action lawyers} here in Illinois,'' said Jeffrey Widman, the
managing partner at Fox Rothschild in Chicago. ``The law's been on the
books in Illinois since 2008 but was basically ignored for a decade. I
guarantee you that in 2014 or 2015, this potential liability wasn't on
anyone's radar. But the technology has now caught up with the law.''

It's remarkable that the Illinois law even exists. According to Matthew
Kugler, a law professor at Northwestern University
\href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3289850}{who
has researched the Illinois act}, it was inspired by the 2007 bankruptcy
of a company called Pay by Touch, which had the fingerprints of many
Americans, including Illinoisans, on file; there were worries that it
could sell them during its liquidation.

No one from the technology industry weighed in on the bill, according to
legislative and lobbying records.

``When the law was passed, no one who is now concerned about it was
thinking about the issue,'' Mr. Kugler said. Silicon Valley is aware of
the law now. Bloomberg News
\href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/google-takes-aim-at-privacy-law-after-facebook-lobbying-failed}{reported}
in April 2018 that lobbyists for Google and Facebook were trying to
weaken its provisions.

More than 200 class-action lawsuits alleging misuse of residents'
biometrics have been filed in Illinois since 2015, including
\href{https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-advances-35-billion-privacy-suit-against-facebook/}{a
\$35 billion case} against Facebook for using face recognition to tag
people in photos. That lawsuit gained momentum in August, when the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the
company's arguments that the people did not suffer ``concrete harm.''

In recent years, technology companies have been treading more lightly in
states with biometric legislation. When Google released a feature in
2018 that matched selfies to famous works of art, people
\href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-google-wont-search-for-art-look-alike-in-some-states-1516194001}{in
Illinois and Texas couldn't use it}. And Google's Nest security cameras
don't offer an otherwise standard feature for recognizing familiar faces
in Illinois.

``It's creepy that you found me. I always lived with the philosophy that
what I put out there was public, but I couldn't have imagined this,''
said Wendy Piersall, a publisher and City Council member in Woodstock,
Ill., whose photos, along with those of her three children, were in the
MegaFace database.

``We can't use the fun art app; why are you using our kids' faces to
test your software?'' she added. ``My photos there are geotagged to
Illinois. It's not hard to figure out where these pictures were taken.
I'm not a sue-happy person, but I would cheer someone else on to go
after this.''

Some of the Illinois lawsuits have been settled or dismissed, but most
are active, and Mr. Kugler, the Northwestern law professor, noted that
basic legal questions remained unanswered. It's unclear what the legal
liability would be for a company that takes photos uploaded in Illinois
but processes the facial data in another state, or even another country.

``Defendants are going to be creative in searching for arguments,
because no one wants to be stuck holding this expensive hot potato,'' he
said.

A spokesman for Amazon Web Services said its use of the data set was
``compliant with B.I.P.A.,'' while declining to explain how. Mario
Fante, a spokesman for Philips, wrote in an email that the company ``was
never aware of any Illinois residents included in the above-mentioned
data set.''

Victor Balta, a spokesman for the University of Washington, said, ``All
uses of photos in the researchers' database are lawful. The U.W. is a
public research university, not a private entity, and the Illinois law
targets private entities.''

Some of the Illinoisans we found in MegaFace and contacted were
indifferent about the use of their faces.

``I do know that when you upload information online, it can be used in
unexpected ways, so I guess I'm not surprised,'' said Chris Scheufele, a
web developer in Springfield. ``When you upload information to the
internet and make it available for public consumption, you should expect
it to be scraped.''

What about the subjects of his photos? Mr. Scheufele laughed. ``I
haven't talked to my wife about it,'' he said.

``\href{https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/the-age-of-privacy-nihilism-is-here/568198/}{Privacy
nihilism}'' is an increasingly familiar term for giving up on trying to
control data about oneself in the digital era. What happened to Chloe
Papa could, depending on your perspective, argue for extreme vigilance
or total resignation: Who could have possibly predicted that a snapshot
of a toddler in 2005 would contribute, a decade and a half later, to the
development of bleeding-edge surveillance technology?

``We have become accustomed to trading convenience for privacy, so that
has dulled our senses as to what is happening with all the data gathered
about us,'' said Ms. Jones, the law professor. ``But people are starting
to wake up.''

\textbf{Correction:}~Oct. 11, 2019

An earlier version of this article inaccurately described an academic
paper on the MegaFace database. The average age of the people included
is not 16.1 years; that is the average range in ages within the
database.

An earlier version also misstated a goal of the CyberPatriot program. It
encourages young people to pursue careers in fields like cybersecurity,
not careers in intelligence and the military.~~
