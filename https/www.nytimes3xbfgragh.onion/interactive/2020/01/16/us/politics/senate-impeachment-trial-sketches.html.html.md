Because no photos or videos are [allowed to be taken in the Senate
chamber](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/13/us/politics/senate-photography.html),
the public’s only view of the Senate floor is a feed provided to C-SPAN
from cameras that are operated by government employees.

That is, unless someone seated in the gallery can draw.

Art Lien is a courtroom sketch artist who has primarily covered the
Supreme Court — another body that does not allow cameras — since 1976.
But for the extent of the impeachment trial of President Trump, Mr. Lien
will be walking across the street to the Capitol to capture moments that
we might not see on television.

## <span class="g-balancer" data-id="1">Wednesday, Feb. 5</span>

Hours before the final votes in the Senate, Mitt Romney, Republican of
Utah, [announced in an emotional floor
speech](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/us/politics/mitt-romney-impeachment-speech-transcript.html)
that he had decided to cross party lines and vote to convict Mr. Trump
on the abuse of power charge, saying that the president was “guilty of
an appalling abuse of public
trust.”

Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader who had promised
a swift trial and acquittal of the president, gave the final speech in
the chamber before the voting commenced.

“The United States Senate was made for moments like this,” Mr. McConnell
said, adding that the framers of the Constitution created the Senate to
safeguard against “factional fever” that might dominate in the House.
“This partisan impeachment will end today,” he
declared.

by the Senate of both articles of impeachment, [52

on the abuse of power charge and [53

After [closing
arguments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/03/us/politics/trump-impeachment-trial-final-arguments.html)
by House managers and the president’s lawyers on Monday, senators took
turns on the Senate floor to [announce their
positions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/04/us/politics/senate-impeachment-vote.html)
before Wednesday’s final votes on the articles of impeachment.

Because the speeches were not part of the formal impeachment trial,
senators were not required to be in attendance, leaving the chamber
mostly
empty.

On the other side of the Capitol, House members staked out seats for Mr.
Trump’s State of the Union address that evening. Some lawmakers were
seen reserving their positions along the aisle more than seven hours
before the

In his [speech promoting a “Great American

Mr. Trump did not address his impeachment or the upcoming vote in the
Senate. Some of the Democratic House impeachment managers sat near the
front of the chamber, with copies of the U.S. Constitution in
hand.

[The Senate
voted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/01/31/us/politics/impeachment-vote.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)
to block the admission of new witnesses and [agreed to a
schedule](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-31?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage#senators-schedule-trial)
that would end the trial on Wednesday. Democrats needed four Republicans
to join them in supporting the motion on additional evidence, but only
two senators, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, broke with
their party to vote for it.

Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, was considered another potential
defector, but she [ultimately
decided](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-31#murkowski-witnesses)
to vote
“no.”

called a “quorum call” in order for party leaders to negotiate next
steps. Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona who could break
with her party by voting to acquit the president, could be seen chatting
with her Republican
colleagues.

Senators convened for the [second day of posing
questions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-30)
to House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump’s lawyers.

Early in the session, a question submitted by Senator Rand Paul of
Kentucky [was
rejected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-30?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#chief-justice-declines-a-question-from-rand-paul-that-could-have-identified-the-whistle-blower)

inquiry.

that they would be able to block the passage of a Democratic-supported
proposal to call new witnesses. At least four Republican senators and
every Democrat would need to vote “yes” for it to pass.

Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania appeared open to the idea of
new witnesses earlier in the week, but on Wednesday he said that he was
“very, very skeptical” that any witness would change his
decision.

votes on whether to convict or acquit Mr. Trump could take place this
week.

One Democratic senator, Doug Jones of Alabama, [has
indicated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-30?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#trump-could-win-a-bipartisan-acquittal)
that he might vote to acquit the president of the obstruction of justice
charge. Other centrist Democrats, like Senators Kyrsten Sinema of
Arizona and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, could also
defect.

of the side they aligned with — Republicans for the defense, and
Democrats for House managers.

“You want to control the dynamic,” explained Senator Mike Braun,
Republican of Indiana.

Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, was one of several Democrats
to pose questions to the managers. “They needed the chance to rebut the
false arguments, the fallacious reasoning, the half-truths and even no
truths that the three days of the president’s counsel made,” he
said.

As Mr. Trump’s defense team concluded their opening arguments, new

national security adviser, [fueled a push by
Democrats](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/27/us/politics/john-bolton-impeachment-witness.html)
to call witnesses in the trial.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, has said that he will

openness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/25/us/politics/lamar-alexander-witnesses-impeachment.html)

Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, has garnered attention as the
only one in his party who has [publicly
committed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/27/us/politics/john-bolton-impeachment-witness.html)
to voting ‘yes’ on calling witnesses.

Mr. Romney caught the spotlight for another reason on Tuesday, when he
was seen momentarily breaking Senate rules by entering the chamber with
a bottle of chocolate milk. He promptly exited and returned with the
milk in a
glass.

The trial [continued
Monday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/27/us/politics/impeachment-live.html)
with presentations by Mr. Trump’s defense team, [which includes Ken
Starr](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/17/us/politics/ken-starr-impeachment-trump-clinton.html),
the former independent counsel whose investigation led to President Bill
Clinton’s impeachment.

Mr. Lien sketched from his perch in the press gallery overlooking the
Senate floor, jotting down notes about color, because he must exit the
chamber to use his watercolor kit.

He uses a very thin (.03mm) mechanical pencil with soft 2B lead. “People
move around and things change, so it’s nice to be able to erase,” he
said.

Luckily, staff members in the Senate press gallery provide a diagram for

“I do keep the seating chart handy and consult it frequently,” said Mr.
Lien.

Mr. Trump’s defense team kicked off their arguments on Saturday morning,
[attempting to sow
doubt](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-25/trumps-defense-team-seeks-to-sow-reasonable-doubt#live-blog-list)

evidence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-25/cipollone-leads-off-for-white-house-legal-team#live-blog-list)
and trying “to remove President Trump from the ballot.”

Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers, accused the House
managers of [engaging in a partisan
attack](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-25/lawyers-zero-in-on-the-mueller-inquiry#live-blog-list)
on the president by having “tried once again to re-litigate the Mueller
case.”
