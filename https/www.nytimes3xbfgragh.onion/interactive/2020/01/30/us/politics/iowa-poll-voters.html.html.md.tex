ALL OVER IOWA --- Erika Derrick was feeding her peacocks in Springville,
Iowa, when the phone rang. It was us, The New York Times, on the other
end of the line. Hers was one of 75,299 numbers called as part of a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/25/us/politics/democratic-iowa-poll-sanders.html}{poll
conducted} in January by The Times and Siena College. A small subset of
these likely Democratic caucusgoers --- including Ms. Derrick --- said
they would talk to us in person. So we flew to Iowa to meet 15 of them
(plus a 9-year-old) in their homes, dorm rooms, a coffee shop and two
public libraries.

\emph{The New York Times/Siena College Research Institute survey of
1,689 registered voters in Iowa, including 584 Democratic caucusgoers,
was conducted from Jan. 20 to Jan. 23. The margin of error due to
sampling is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points for the Democratic
caucus electorate and plus or minus 2.8 percentage points for registered
voters. To ensure a representative sample, the types of voters least
likely to respond to telephone polls were more likely to be called.}
