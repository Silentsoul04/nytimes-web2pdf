From the start of the coronavirus outbreak, statements from the
presidential pulpit have been far out of step with those of health
experts and many inside the administration. President Trump contradicted
some officials while they were standing right next to him. Here is a
sampling of what Mr. Trump has said compared with statements made by
prominent officials.

<span class="g-eventtext">In late January, **President Trump** expressed

he said [on

<span class="g-eventtext">Just a week later, the director-general of the

a [public health

<span class="g-eventtext">With fewer than a dozen cases reported, **Mr.

family.</span>

<span class="g-eventtext">By mid-February, few U.S. cases had been

later said, “We have no reason to believe that this virus would behave

five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next

<span class="g-eventtext">That same day, **Dr. Nancy Messonnier,** the
director of the C.D.C’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory
Diseases, [said the virus would continue to
spread](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0225-cdc-telebriefing-covid-19.html).
“It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather

this country will have severe illness,” she

<span class="g-eventtext">At the White House the next day, **Mr. Trump**
[offered a mixed message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aas3YQKIFeY)

<span class="g-eventtext">At [a rally in South
Carolina](https://www.c-span.org/video/?469663-1/president-trump-campaign-event-north-charleston-south-carolina&start=395),
**Mr. Trump** said that Democrats had been “politicizing” his response
to the coronavirus, just as he said they had the Russia investigation
and the impeachment inquiry. “They tried anything, they tried it over
and over,” he said. “And this is their new hoax.” Later, he accused the
news media of being in “hysteria mode” over the coronavirus, which he

<span class="g-eventtext">When U.S. cases surpassed 100, **Mr. Trump**

<span class="g-eventtext">**Mr. Trump** suggested that his signature
policy proposal, a border wall with Mexico, required renewed urgency in
the face of the outbreak. “Going up fast. We need the Wall more than
ever\!” [he
tweeted](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1237334397172490240?lang=en).</span>

<span class="g-eventtext">At a [congressional
hearing](https://www.c-span.org/video/?470181-1/cdc-director-redfield-testifies-coronavirus&live&vod&start=5721)
that day, **Dr. Redfield** was asked whether structural barriers at U.S.
borders would mitigate the outbreak. “Not that I’ve seen,” he
replied.</span>

<span class="g-eventtext">The W.H.O. declared that the coronavirus had
become a
[pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020).
“W.H.O. has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are
deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and
by the alarming levels of inaction,” **Dr. Ghebreyesus**
said.</span>

**Dr. Fauci**, who [told
Congress](https://www.c-span.org/video/?470277-1/federal-health-officials-testify-coronavirus-outbreak-response&start=680),
“The system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are

it.”</span>

<span class="g-eventtext">**Mr. Trump** suggested at a news conference
that **Google** would handle some of the burden of making tests
available. “I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a
website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the
past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing
at a nearby convenient
location.”</span>

triage coronavirus cases was in the early stages of development. Google
C.E.O. **Sundar Pichai** later said [its own
plans](https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/covid-19-how-were-continuing-to-help/)
were limited to creating an informational website “dedicated to COVID-19
education, prevention and local resources
nationwide.”</span>

**Mr. Trump** said [the situation was under
