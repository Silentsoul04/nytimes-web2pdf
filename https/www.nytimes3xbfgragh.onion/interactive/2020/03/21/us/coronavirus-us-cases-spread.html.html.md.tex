\textbf{Total cases}

Note: The map shows the known locations of coronavirus cases by county.
Circles are sized by the number of people there who have tested
positive, which may differ from where they contracted the illness. Some
people who traveled overseas were taken for treatment in California,
Nebraska and Texas. Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories are not
shown. Sources: State and local health agencies, hospitals and C.D.C.
Data as of 11:45 p.m. on Friday, March 20.

It started
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/21/health/cdc-coronavirus.html}{two
months ago}, just north of Seattle. A young man who had returned from
China tested positive for the coronavirus, the first known case in the
United States.

At first, the virus was detected only in a handful of cases, and mostly
in those who had traveled outside the United States.

There were lone patients in Arizona, in Massachusetts, in Wisconsin.
Married couples in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html}{Illinois}
and California were infected. Groups of Americans evacuated from
overseas received treatment in California, Nebraska and Texas.

But in the past three weeks, everything has changed. As
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-administration-coronavirus-testing.html}{testing
expanded} and the virus spread, cases have been confirmed by the dozens,
then by the hundreds and thousands.

By Friday night,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\#us}{more
than 17,000 cases} of the coronavirus had been detected across all 50
states and Washington, D.C., and more than 200 people had died. New
York, California and Washington State have been the hardest hit.

The climb in the number of cases has been rapid, in part because of more
testing. This week saw five times more cases than the previous one, more
than 6,000 of which were in New York, which has the most cases in the
country.
