Dr. Li Wenliang tried to warn his country but was silenced. Now its
traumatized people visit his spirit online.

\textbf{They come to say} ``good morning'' and ``good night.'' They tell
him that spring has arrived and that the cherry blossoms are blooming.
They share that they are falling in love, falling out of love or getting
divorced. They send him photos of fried chicken drumsticks, his favorite
snack.

They whisper that they miss him.

Li Wenliang, a doctor in the Chinese city of Wuhan,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/06/world/asia/chinese-doctor-Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html}{died}
of the coronavirus on Feb. 6 at the age of 34. More than a month before
that, he went online to warn friends of the strange and deadly virus
rampaging through his hospital, only to be threatened by government
authorities. He became a hero in China when his warnings proved true,
then
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/07/business/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html}{a
martyr} when he died.

After his passing, people began to gather, virtually, at his

post on Weibo}, the Chinese social media platform. In the comments
section, they grieve and seek solace. Some call it China's Wailing Wall,
a reference to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/03/world/middleeast/new-western-wall-prayer-space-highlights-wider-divide-among-jews.html}{the
Western Wall in Jerusalem} where people leave written prayers in the
cracks.

李医生，谢谢你曾尝试拯救地球

\href{https://www.weibo.com/337281119}{@奥杰塔Odette}: Dr. Li, thank you
for trying to save the world.

As the deadly virus killed tens of thousands around the world, each
society will have its unique way of coping with the loss and grief. In a
largely atheist yet spiritual nation with little tradition of praying,
the digital Wailing Wall allows the Chinese people to share their
sadness, frustration and aspirations with someone they trusted and
loved.

It may be the gentlest place on the often polarizing and combative
Chinese internet. People write down their thoughts and leave. They don't
argue or make accusations. When they do respond to each other, they
leave digital hugs and encouragement. I cried as I read through the
comments. I found the experience cathartic.

It's a refuge for a traumatized people. Many people, I believe, feel the
same way.

Dr. Li had been an avid user of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/19/fashion/china-social-media-weibo-wechat.html}{Weibo},
China's rough equivalent of Twitter, since 2011. He posted his last
message on Feb. 1. ``Today the nucleic acid test result is positive,''
he wrote of the test that confirmed he had been infected by the
coronavirus. ``The dust has settled, and the diagnosis is finally
confirmed.'' He died five days later.

Under that post, Weibo users have left more than 870,000 comments. Some
people post a few times a day, telling him how their mornings,
afternoons and evenings went. Only posts by China's biggest actors and
pop stars can match those numbers, but even those lack the visceral
response that Dr. Li's last post has drawn.

Users feel comfortable talking to Dr. Li. They know he will never scold
them or judge them for what they say. They know, after reading his more
than 2,000 posts, that he was a gentle and kind soul. He was an ordinary
person just like them who enjoyed food and fun and sometimes got tired
of working such a demanding job. He would understand.

I read thousands of messages people left just on March 26, the 49th day
--- the seventh day of the seventh week --- since Dr. Li's death. Many
Chinese believe that is the day that a person's soul will finally leave
the body and be reincarnated as a newborn.

March 26 is also when Wuhan began to allow its residents to take back
the ashes of their loved ones. People queued in long lines at funeral
homes. The photos triggered social media discussions of the real scope
of the outbreak and the credibility of government's official toll of
Wuhan's dead. Many of the photos were subsequently censored.

Because many people see him as an ordinary person wronged by the

prevailed.

They are angry that only two police officers have been punished for
reprimanding him. Many believe the police were acting on orders from
higher up.

They also share their relief that China's lockdowns appear to be nearing
an end, their distrust of the official news and their lingering fear of
the pandemic.

有的地方一线医护的补助发下来又被收上去，真的寒心。我是医科大学大一学生，有点想放弃了

\href{https://www.weibo.com/u/3560720554}{@落卡落卡落}: In some places
the subsidies for front-line medical workers were distributed then taken
back. I'm very disappointed. I am a first-year medical student. I kind
of want to give up.

Some people complain that the comments are censored, an allegation that
is difficult to prove. They worry that his Weibo account could be
deleted, just like many others. Then, they will lose the only place they
can take a break from a world that has been turned upside down.

They watch warily and helplessly as the pandemic spreads to many parts
of the world and the two super powers, China and the United States,
engage in reckless and meaningless diplomatic squabbles. Like people
everywhere, they don't know how this is going to end.

But most people just want to tell him that they miss him and wish him
the best in the next world.
