Note: The 2020 lines in the charts are provisional data through April
11. The end of the first week of each month is labeled.

Total deaths in seven states that have been hard hit by the coronavirus
pandemic are nearly 50 percent higher than normal for the five weeks
from March 8 through April 11, according to
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/}{new death
statistics} from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is
9,000 more deaths than were reported as of April 11 in official
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{counts}
of deaths from the coronavirus.

The new data is partial and most likely undercounts the recent death
toll significantly. But it still illustrates how the coronavirus is
causing a surge in deaths in the places it has struck, probably killing
more people than the reported statistics capture. These increases belie
arguments that the virus is only killing people who would have died
anyway from other causes. Instead, the virus has brought a pattern of
deaths unlike anything seen in recent years.

If you look at the provisional deaths from all causes, death counts in
New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, Maryland and
Colorado have spiked far above their normal levels for the period. In
New York City, the home of the biggest outbreak, the number of deaths
over this period is more than three times the normal number. (Recent
data suggests it could have reached
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/27/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-new-york-city.html}{six
times higher} than normal.)

In New Jersey, deaths have been 172 percent of the normal number so far
--- more than 5,000 additional deaths, compared with an average count
from the past five years. In Michigan, the partial death count is 121
percent of the count in a normal year, the equivalent of nearly 2,000
more deaths.

These numbers are preliminary because death certificates take time to be
processed and collected, and complete death tallies from the
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm}{Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention} can take up to eight weeks to become
final. The speed of that data reporting varies considerably by state. In
Connecticut, for example, where reported coronavirus deaths are high,
the C.D.C. statistics include zero reported deaths from any cause since
Feb. 1, because of reporting lags.

We compared these provisional death counts with the average number of
deaths each week over the past five years. Public health researchers use
the term ``excess deaths'' to describe a gap between recent trends and a
typical level of deaths.

It's difficult to know whether the differences between excess deaths and
the official counts of coronavirus deaths reflect an undercounting of
coronavirus deaths or a surge in deaths from other causes. It's likely a
mix of both.

There is evidence, in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/10/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-new-york-city.html}{New
York} and other places, that the official coronavirus counts are
probably too low. Tests for the illness can be hard to get, and not all
who die now are being tested, particularly if they die outside a
hospital. New York
City\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-deaths.html}{recently
revised} its own statistics for the number of coronavirus-related
fatalities, saying thousands of additional deaths were probably because
of Covid-19, even though no tests had been conducted.

There is also increasing evidence that stresses on the health care
system and fears about catching the disease have caused some Americans
to die from ailments that are typically treatable. A recent
\href{http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/accj/early/2020/04/07/j.jacc.2020.04.011.full.pdf}{draft
paper} found that hospital admissions for a major type of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/well/live/coronavirus-doctors-hospitals-emergency-care-heart-attack-stroke.html}{heart
attack} fell by 38 percent in nine major U.S. hospitals in March. In a
normal year, cardiovascular disease is the country's leading cause of
death.

Some causes of death may actually be going down. There appear to be
\href{https://roadecology.ucdavis.edu/files/content/projects/COVID_CHIPs_Impacts_updated_415.pdf}{fewer
road fatalities in California}, as more U.S. residents stay at home, for
example. It is possible that those reductions could cancel out
coronavirus deaths in places where the virus is not yet widespread. But,
in many states, any such reductions have been clearly outweighed by
increases in deaths directly and indirectly related to the virus.

Demographers often use measures of total deaths, sometimes called
all-cause mortality, to evaluate the effects of natural disasters, where
it can be difficult to trace particular causes.

In Puerto Rico in 2017, only
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/28/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-deaths.html}{64
deaths were initially attributed} to Hurricane Maria. But an analysis of
the additional deaths showed the way that the disaster had, directly and
indirectly, led to nearly
\href{https://prstudy.publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/prstudy.publichealth.gwu.edu/files/reports/Acertainment\%20of\%20the\%20Estimated\%20Excess\%20Mortality\%20from\%20Hurricane\%20Maria\%20in\%20Puerto\%20Rico.pdf}{3,000
deaths} over six months. The total included the immediate deaths from
mudslides and drownings, but also sepsis, diabetes and suicides that
came later as the power failure stretched on for months.

Coronavirus is clearly killing more U.S. residents directly than any
hurricane has, but it is also changing lives in ways that may also
contribute indirectly to increased deaths --- by overloading the health
care system and discouraging people from seeking care.

Measures of total deaths are also commonly used in countries without
detailed accounting of causes of death. Right now, they are the most
useful tool, several epidemiologists said, for measuring the impact of
coronavirus in the United States, too.

``It gives you an overall sense of how big things are,'' said Samuel
Clark, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, whose work is
in demography and epidemiology. ``For now, you can basically attribute
the excess mortality to Covid-19. But you also grab all the things that
are not Covid at all, but are probably created by the situation.''

Severe Are Coronavirus Outbreaks Across the U.S.?}

Around the world, the coronavirus is bringing large waves of mortality.
In Spain, deaths over the last month are 66 percent higher than normal,
according to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{New
York Times reporting}. In Ecuador, they are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/world/americas/ecuador-deaths-coronavirus.html}{more
than 80 percent higher} than normal. In Paris, more than twice as many
people are dying every day as normal --- far more than during a typical
bad flu season.

Eventually, we will get more clarity about all of the reasons that
people died this year. While no mortality statistics are ever perfect,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses detailed death
certificates to code the causes of death for everyone who dies each year
in the United States. But that process typically takes more than a year
to complete.

For now, total deaths are our best glimpse into the ways the coronavirus
is affecting the normal patterns of survival.
