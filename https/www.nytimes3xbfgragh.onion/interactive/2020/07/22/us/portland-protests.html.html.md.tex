On the Ground in Portland as Protesters Clash with Federal Authorities

Federal authorities again clashed with protesters in Portland last
night. Here's a quick look at what I saw →

Thousands, including the ``wall of moms,'' gathered in downtown Portland
to protest police violence and the presence of federal authorities in
the city.

At around 11 p.m., a large group began kicking and hitting the wooden
facade of the federal courthouse building, which has been at the center
of the protests.

A group here tried to light the facade on fire, which eventually led to
a strong disagreement among them over whether fire is an appropriate
method for protest.

Federal authorities had chased this group back a couple of times before
making this forceful push at 12:30 a.m. in response to the attempted
fire.

The intensity ramped up around 2 a.m. when the feds once again chased
protesters with tear gas and fired less-lethal weapons into the crowd.
