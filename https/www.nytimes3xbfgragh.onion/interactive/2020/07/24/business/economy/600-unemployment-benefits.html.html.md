After July 31, millions of out-of-work Americans will likely lose ****
[an additional $600 a
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits.html)
in unemployment benefits that have helped them weather the coronavirus
pandemic. Lawmakers are negotiating a new relief package, and any
extension of additional aid is expected to be [a fraction of what it
currently
is](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html).

Depending on income and where someone lives, regular unemployment
benefits replace only a portion of lost wages. The lower-income workers
who were benefiting the most from the $600 lifeline will feel its loss
most acutely.

These are the estimated unemployment payments for each state
<span class="state"></span> and the national average
<span class="avg"></span> for different income levels.

</div>

<div class="slide slide-txt svelte-1oeusgz">

Currently, with the additional $600, an unemployed person who had been
making <span class="highlight-text">$35,000 a year</span> would, on
average, receive about <span class="highlight-text">$944 a week</span>
in unemployment benefits.

</div>

<div class="slide slide-txt svelte-1oeusgz">

We calculated how much of each person’s previous income is replaced by
the unemployment payments they receive. It’s what economists call the
replacement rate — the share of someone’s normal income that
unemployment benefits make up.

</div>

<div class="slide slide-txt svelte-1oeusgz">

To put that in context, for the person earning $35,000, their average
replacement rate is about <span class="highlight-text">140
percent</span> of what she or he would have previously earned at work.

</div>

<div class="slide slide-txt svelte-1oeusgz">

With the additional $600, many lower-income workers earned more on
unemployment, on average, than they had in their previous jobs.

</div>

<div class="slide slide-txt svelte-1oeusgz">

Without the additional $600, the share of income replaced by the
unemployment benefit falls sharply for everyone, but lower-income
workers feel the hit the most.

</div>

<div class="slide slide-txt svelte-1oeusgz">

The person who had been receiving 140 percent of their weekly income on
average would now receive only <span class="highlight-text">51
percent</span> of their income.

</div>

<div class="slide slide-txt svelte-1oeusgz">

Democrats have made proposals to extend the $600 additional benefit
through the end of the year. Republican leaders on Monday proposed a
plan to provide payments of up to $500 that, when combined with normal
state benefits, could cover 70% percent of many recipients’ salaries.

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

If approved, the 70-percent plan would go into effect until October in
order to give states time to put in place the new system. As a stopgap
solution, Republicans have suggested adding a flat $200 to unemployment
benefits when the $600 payments expire.

Unemployment benefits are typically meant to keep people afloat while
staying low enough to spur them to find a job. But as the economy
hurtled into a recession early this year, and the pandemic has kept many
businesses closed or at limited capacity, jobs have disappeared for
many.

The extra $600 unemployment benefits have injected billions into the
economy, and if those benefits shrink, that missing boost could cause
widespread damage.

The idea of basing benefits on workers’ previous wages, which is central
to the Republican plan, [isn’t
new](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-stimulus-coronavirus.html).
It’s a factor in how states determine the benefits they give out, which
is one reason benefits may vary depending on the location.

Here’s how unemployment benefits could shift in every state if the $600
expires, ordered from the lowest to the highest level of benefits for
someone who makes $35,000 a year:

Estimated payments in each state were calculated using an [unemployment
benefits calculator](https://github.com/ganong-noel/ui_calculator)
developed by researchers at the University of Chicago. The calculator
uses state unemployment eligibility requirements and rules to estimate
the regular unemployment benefits of a worker without dependents, as of
January 2020. The calculator may not capture every rule in every state,
and estimated payments may not match an individual’s actual payments.
These estimates assume that annual income was earned over 52 40-hour
weeks. Averages do not include Washington D.C. or any territories.
