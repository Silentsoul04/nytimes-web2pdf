As college students and professors decide whether to head back to class,
and as universities weigh how and whether to reopen, the coronavirus is
already on campus.

A New York Times survey of every public four-year college in the
country, as well as every private institution that competes in Division
I sports or is a member of an [elite group of research
universities](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Who-We-Are/AAU-Member-List.pdf),
revealed at least 6,600 cases tied to about 270 colleges over the course
of the pandemic. And the new academic year has not even begun at most
schools.

Outbreaks have emerged on Greek Row this summer at the
<span id="inline236948">University of Washington</span>, where at least
136 residents were infected, and at <span id="inline177551">Harris-Stowe
State University</span> in St. Louis, where administrators were
re-evaluating their plans for fall after eight administrative workers
tested positive.

The virus has turned up in a science building at
<span id="inline200004">Western Carolina</span>, on the football team at
<span id="inline217882">Clemson</span> and among employees at the
<span id="inline127060">University of Denver</span>.

At <span id="inline197869">Appalachian State</span> in North Carolina,
at least 41 construction workers have tested positive while working on
campus buildings. The Times has identified at least 14
coronavirus-related deaths at colleges.

<span class="g-credit">\*All reported cases were in the athletic
department.  
Note: The charts show the cases per 100,000 residents reported each week
in the county where each school is located. The location of a
university’s main campus is listed unless otherwise specified. In
several instances, colleges noted that some cases were tied to branch
campuses or satellite locations. Universities with no case total listed
either did not respond to inquiries, declined to provide information or
said they had no known infections.</span>

</div>

</div>

There is no standardized reporting method for coronavirus cases and
deaths at colleges, **** and the information is not being publicly
tracked at a national level. Of nearly 1,000 institutions contacted by
The Times, some had already posted case information online, some
provided full or partial numbers and others refused to answer basic
questions, citing privacy concerns. Hundreds of colleges did not respond
at all.

Still, the Times survey represents the most comprehensive look at the
toll the virus has already taken on the country’s colleges and
universities.

Coronavirus infections on campuses might go unnoticed if not for
reporting by academic institutions themselves because they do not always
show up in official state or countywide tallies, which generally exclude
people who have permanent addresses elsewhere, as students often do.

The Times survey included four-year public schools in the United States,
some of which are subject to public records laws, that are members of
the Association of American Universities or that compete at the highest
level of college sports. It has not yet expanded to include hundreds of
other institutions, including most private schools and community
colleges, where students, faculty and staff are struggling with the same
difficult decisions.

Among the colleges that provided information, many offered no details
about who contracted the virus, when they became ill or whether a case
was connected to a larger outbreak. It is possible that some of the
cases were identified months ago, in the early days of the outbreak in
the United States before in-person learning was cut short, and that
others involved students and employees who had not been on campus
recently.

## <span class="g-balancer" data-id="1">Return to Campus</span>

This data, which is almost certainly an undercount, shows the risks
colleges face as they prepare for a school year in the midst of a
pandemic. But because universities vary widely in size, and because some
refused to provide information, comparing case totals from campus to
campus may not provide a full picture of the relative risk.

What is clear is that despite months of planning for a safe return to
class, and despite drastic changes to campus life, the virus is already
spreading widely at universities.

Some institutions, like the California State University system, have
moved most fall classes online. Others, including those in the Patriot
League and Ivy League, have decided to not hold fall sports. But many
institutions still plan to welcome freshmen to campus in the coming
days, to hold in-person classes and to host sporting
events.

At the <span id="inline228778">University of Texas at Austin</span>,
where more than 440 students and employees have tested positive since
the spring, in-person classes will be capped at 40 percent of capacity
and final exams will be taken online.

At <span id="inline181534">Peru State College</span> in Nebraska, where
there have been no known cases, classes are expected to resume on
schedule, but with stepped-up cleaning procedures and a recommendation
for dorm residents to wear masks in common areas.

The <span id="inline139959">University of Georgia</span> has announced
plans for in-person classes despite rising deaths from the virus in the
state. The university has recorded at least 390 infections involving
students, faculty and staff.

O’Bryan Moore, a senior at the school, said he was worried about the
safety of his classmates and teachers. He said he was skeptical that
students would widely follow guidelines to wear masks once they return
in August.

“There is no way I can see this ending without outbreaks on campus,”
said Mr. Moore, who is studying to become a park ranger.

Mr. Moore said that online classes have not been as effective as
in-person classes, but that he still hoped the university would change
its plans for students to return to campus.

“I think we should remain online for this semester, even if it’ll hurt
my education,” he said. “Because it’s the right thing to do.”

Case numbers may be larger at some universities with tens of thousands
of students, including <span id="inline132903">Central Florida</span>
and the University of Texas at Austin, and at others where many
university employees work in hospitals where coronavirus patients [have
been treated](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/covid-19/), including at
the <span id="inline228635">University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center</span>.

Though hundreds of universities responded to The Times’s request for
data — including a mix of public and private colleges, both small and
large, in states across the country — others declined to cooperate. Some
said they were not tracking such cases. Others invoked privacy concerns,
even though The Times asked for aggregate case totals, not a list of
individuals who were infected. Others did not respond at all.

A spokesman at <span id="inline448886">Arizona State</span>, for
example, said they “chose months ago to not release data/names/results”
on coronavirus cases. A spokesman for <span id="inline180461">Montana
State University</span> said the school “does not provide health
information on its students, faculty or staff, even on general
subgroups.” <span id="inline164155">The United States Naval
Academy</span> cited “operational security” concerns. A spokeswoman for
<span id="inline156082">Washburn University</span> in Kansas said she
believed giving such information would violate privacy laws. And while
the <span id="inline178396">University of Missouri</span>’s athletic
department confirmed 10 cases, a spokesman at the flagship campus would
not provide information about other students and employees.

As students have started trickling back onto campuses in recent weeks,
the early returns have been troubling. After 10 students tested positive
this month at <span id="inline238032">West Virginia University</span>,
officials pledged to deep-clean the places on campus where they had
been. At <span id="inline155399">Kansas State University</span>,
off-season football workouts were paused last month after an outbreak on
the
team.

## <span class="g-balancer" data-id="2">Athletic Departments at High Risk</span>

Many of the first arrivals on campus have been athletes hoping to
compete this fall. A separate Times survey of the 130 universities that
compete at the highest level of Division I football revealed more than
630 cases on 68 campuses among athletes, coaches and other employees.

<div data-role="img">

As universities make plans for the fall semester — online, in person, or
a mix of the two — administrators have had to weigh shifting public
health guidance and financial and academic concerns, as well as the
difficult reality that some students and faculty members are likely to
test positive no matter how classes are held.

“There is simply no way to completely eliminate risk, whether we are
in-person or online,” Martha E. Pollack, the president of Cornell,
[wrote in a
letter](https://covid.cornell.edu/updates/20200630-reactivate-campus.cfm)
explaining the decision to bring students back to
campus.
