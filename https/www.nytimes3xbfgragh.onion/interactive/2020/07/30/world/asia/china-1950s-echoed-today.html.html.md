<span class="g-intro">SHENZHEN-HONG KONG BORDER</span> — The bridge was
only 20 yards long, but it was the longest journey of my father’s life.
Holding a flimsy piece of paper with a Swiss watermark and Chinese
characters, he crossed the bridge from the British colony of Hong Kong
into Mao’s China, one of the first foreign correspondents to report on a
country largely unknown to the rest of the world in 1954. The paper was
his golden ticket.

Some six decades later, I found myself staring out at the same
footbridge from the other side.

In mainland China on my own coveted journalism visa, I peeked out
through the metal bars separating me from Hong Kong, now a
semiautonomous territory of China. The closest my father had previously
come to China was approaching this bridge to meet missionaries who, he
wrote, stumbled “[out of the Chinese
Revolution](https://archive.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/library/world/asia/china-index-timeline.html)
with tragic tales fully confirmed by their emaciated bodies and haggard
eyes.”

As the bamboo gate swung closed behind him, my father put one foot down
on Chinese soil and looked up to see a simple mud village at the
precipice of a new era. Decades later, I looked back to see a different
view altogether: a towering skyline of glass and metal with one of the
world’s tallest buildings in a city going through its own dramatic
transformation.

It was almost impossible to get to China from the West at the start of
Mao’s rule. The country had [declared itself the People’s Republic of
China](https://archive.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/library/world/asia/100149mao-communism.html)
five years earlier, and it was the early days of the Cold War that
divided Communist countries from Western
democracies.

My father had carved out an unusual beat, reporting for The Toronto Star
and The Star Weekly from one newly Communist country to another,
chronicling the path of each. On his travels he searched for a Chinese
diplomatic office where he could get a visa to visit.

If he could find a friendly Chinese official in Moscow or another
capital in Eastern Europe, he might have a chance to talk that person
into giving him a visa. Yet in his early travels behind the Iron
Curtain, China remained elusive. He persisted, propelled by an urgency
to understand this huge
nation.

<div class="g-ad">

<div id="mid1" class="place-ad" data-position="mid1" data-size-key="default">

</div>

</div>

Eventually, during a trip to Poland, his determination paid off.

In July 1954, he traveled to Bern, Switzerland, where he was told to
pick up his visa.

My father left behind written notes and newspaper clippings, stacks of
passports with visas, photos and transcripts from his first and
subsequent trips to China. They have allowed me to imagine conversations
that we might have had in the six years since he died. Conversations
about how the country he saw back then — brimming with hope and
enthusiasm yet also tightly controlled — is in some ways the same
today.

His first trip to China spanned two months and thousands of miles. He
met [Mao
Zedong](https://archive.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/library/world/asia/061357mao-inthenews.html)
(whom he tapped on the shoulder from behind his camera, mistaking the
chairman for a “humble courtier” blocking his shot) and Zhou Enlai, the
premier and foreign minister at the time. But he also talked with
factory workers, actors, newspaper editors and shop owners.

He described being filled with hope for the human spirit he witnessed.
But he also felt despair because a government-provided handler was never
too far away, ready to silence anyone who veered too far from the
Communist Party line.

China defied any broad-brush statement. “And yet,” he wrote in one
notebook, “under the current leadership, the way in which the government
silences alternative points of view makes it hard not
to.”

A version of this exists today. I have a long list of names of people
who wouldn’t talk to me because I work for The New York Times, portrayed
in Chinese state media as the source of “smears and lies.” Sources I’ve
interviewed privately are later threatened by the local police, while
stridently nationalist rhetoric dominates the state media.

Several months after I returned to Hong Kong, the Chinese government in
March[](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/world/asia/china-expels-journalists.html)[expelled
my American
colleagues](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/world/asia/china-expels-journalists.html)
as part of a diplomatic dispute with the United States. In the past
month,[](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)[Beijing
has tightened its

over Hong Kong with a new national security law,
threatening[](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-china.html)[free
speech and other civil
liberties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-china.html)
in the city.

During his trip, my father traveled from Shenzhen, Guangzhou and
Chongqing in the south, to cities farther north like Shenyang, Shanghai,
Wuhan and Beijing. Some of the datelines in his dispatches were
different from today — Canton, Hankow, Mukden, Peiping — yet much of his
observations still ring true.

In Beijing, he found more than just a city but also a way of life that
defied the strictures of Communism. “No rubber stamp yet dictates the
passions and peculiarities of its people,” he
wrote.

It is the same today. In the summer heat, men [roll up their shirts to
expose their
bellies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/02/world/what-in-the-world/china-summer-beijing-bikini.html),
even though the government calls the act “uncivilized” and has tried to
crack down. The unsuspecting bicycle rider is never too far from
crashing into a manic delivery man zipping down narrow bike paths on the
wrong side of the road. Smokers stub out their cigarettes on the No
Smoking signs plastered everywhere.

In one of his notebooks, my father noted a seriousness to the people he
met and interviewed. But, he added, it was hard to resist a smile, “and
everyone seems to smile; surely not all by government order?”

The people my father met shared their aspirations, both personal and
professional.

One young factory worker told him she had no time to think about getting
married. Knitting, cooking and doing domestic chores were a waste of
time, she said. And anyway, once she did get around to having a baby she
would keep working.

“After 14 months a baby has to look out for itself,” she told him. So
she would leave the baby at the factory nursery, taking the child home
only once the workweek was over.

“Should a woman just go back to fulfilling her traditional role as a
wife and be shut out of society after giving birth?” Li Xiaoping asked
me. The 33-year-old said she was fired for being pregnant. After she

to five years of salary for the hassle.

During his first trip, my father was pushed around by unfriendly
officials.

While visiting the Great Wall, he left his guide to chase two men over
the other side of the wall with his camera. Two People’s Liberation Army
soldiers were launched into action, he wrote, “before you could say
‘Chiang Kai-shek,’” referring to the Chinese Nationalist leader, who
had fled to Taiwan after his defeat by the Communists in 1949.

He waved cheerily, and they retreated. It was over, he thought, until
his guide told him that he had taken unauthorized photographs and that
the military was waiting for him in Beijing where he would be forced to
give up his camera. But the developed film was eventually returned,
“with thanks by a grinning official who agreed the only military
secret it recorded was this breathtaking and ageless barrier — the Great
Wall of
China.”

They scanned our IDs. They questioned our motives. They threatened our
driver. They pleaded with us to write a positive story. They asked to
see our phones, to delete our photos. We got a Beijing official on
speakerphone to tell the police we were allowed to be there, to no
avail.

</div>

[The charade went
on](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/10/business/china-reporter-police.html)
for two hours before another female cop inexplicably walked up to us,
shook my colleague’s hand and said, “You’re welcome here, thanks for
your cooperation.”

These interactions are not new. I experienced similar acts of
intimidation when I was working in China a decade ago. But there is an
undercurrent now that feels different, one that I recognize in some of
my father’s writing.

He struggled to reconcile what he saw with what he believed to be true.
The “sinister regime where jails and punishment cells awaited the
unfaithful” was mostly invisible on his first trip. Yet, he later
wondered, what had happened to those acquaintances who disappeared and
then later reappeared with confessions in
hand?

The government’s heavy handedness would inevitably emerge. In Shanghai,
he visited a theater, elated because for the first time in weeks there
appeared to be no political subtext to the visit. But when he sneaked
backstage he bumped into a big
blackboard.

On it was an essay written by one of the actors, he was told. “It is
called: ‘Who are my friends and who are my enemies?’” It turned out, in
fact, to be a confession written by someone who had complained, “this
government gives me a pain.”

As my six-month assignment in China came to an end, the country was
preparing to celebrate 70 years of Chinese Communist Party rule. Every
corner of the country was whipped up into celebratory fervor. Huge
billboards of a smiling Xi Jinping with proclamations about China lined
the highways. When my husband and I traveled through the mountains on a
rickety bus in the southwest, we started a new game to pass the time:
Spot President Xi.

The day before the parade I found myself sharing a cab to the airport in
Shenzhen with Walter Liu, a 37-year-old Beijing native who now lives in
California. Mr. Liu and his high school had participated in the 50th
anniversary parade in 1999 when he was 17. He and his classmates were
given pink and yellow blocks of paper to hold in a formation on
Tiananmen Square. From above the sign read “50.”

It was the culmination of two months of rehearsals, first at his high
school and then later during midnight rehearsals on Tiananmen
Square.

</div>

What Mr. Liu remembered most vividly was the excitement of being able to
see his girlfriend during those midnight sessions. “It is rare that you
could see your girlfriend at night,” he said, smiling as he recalled it.
“We could just look at each other from the crowd and wink wink. We
couldn’t even talk.”

On the day of the parade, his parents squinted, trying to find him on
their television. “I don’t think they could see me because I was so
tiny,” said Mr. Liu, laughing. “I was one color pixel on
TV.”

On the day of
the[](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/28/world/asia/china-national-day-70th-anniversary.html)[70th
anniversary
parade](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/28/world/asia/china-national-day-70th-anniversary.html)
I, too, was a pixel. I had managed to persuade the government to give me
a highly prized ticket to watch the parade from the stands, just as my
father had done at the end of his first China tour.

</div>

It was an unusually hot day and the air was heavy with smog. Everyone
had an identifier. Blue uniformed sanitation workers. Green soldiers.
Dark blue naval officers. Blue-and-white track-suited volunteers. A
thousand government workers from one Beijing district with white shirts
and a red bird logo. I felt out of place, even though I was given a
bright red flag to wave.

My father had stood in the same place for the fifth anniversary parade.
He noted similar columns of troops, guns and tanks, with soldiers
marching in unison and such “terrifying rhythm” that it was as though
they were “pouring straight off the production line of some human
factory.”

From the stands, my father focused his binoculars on Mao, who stood
beneath 10 huge lanterns waving and laughing. His gold-colored helmet
had tipped to one side and his hands were hidden behind a thick
cloak.

I did not need binoculars to find Xi Jinping. He was projected, standing
stiff, on huge screens at every angle. Just as Mao had done long before
him, he came rolling out onto Chang’an Avenue in a special retro-styled
black car to greet and inspect the troops.

</div>

The two-hour parade ended with towering portraits of the Communist
Party’s top leaders over the decades since 1949. As they rolled out on
huge floats, loud cheers erupted from the bleachers. Mao’s portrait came
first. The biggest cheer was reserved for the last portrait, of Xi.

There is much discussion today among intellectuals in China about how
the state
looks[](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/11/09/world/asia/xi-propaganda.html)[much
more like it did under
Mao](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/11/09/world/asia/xi-propaganda.html)
than at any other time since the country opened itself up to the world
four decades ago.

I wish I could ask my father about that. But I have a pretty good idea
what he would
say.
