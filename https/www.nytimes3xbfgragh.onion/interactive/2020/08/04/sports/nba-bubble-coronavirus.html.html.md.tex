Life Inside the N.B.A. Bubble

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2018/06/14/multimedia/author-marc-stein/author-marc-stein-thumbStandard.png}

I've covered the N.B.A. for nearly 30 years, but life inside the
league's ``bubble'' introduces all-new sights and sounds on a near-daily
basis. Allow me to share a few snapshots --- things you would only see
on this tightly-controlled campus →

Everyone in the bubble is asked to wear a proximity sensor to promote
social distancing. A chirping alarm sounds if two people wearing sensors
are within six feet each of other for 10 seconds --- provided both are
actually wearing them and have charged them overnight.

Sensors are optional for players, many of whom privately scoff at the
idea of wearing a device that is not a movement tracker but is widely
described that way.

 Everyone else, including reporters, is required to wear them. That
leads to lots of chirping on bus rides and in postgame media scrums when
maintaining six feet of distance is nearly impossible.~

Speaking of buses, the small group of reporters here ride them daily to
the three game venues at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex. This
message, taped to the door or window on all buses, refers to the driver.

Every day in the bubble starts the same for reporters. We record our
temperature and oxygen saturation readings via a league-sanctioned app
to receive access at checkpoints within the bubble.

Then we head to the testing room, with access set aside exclusively for
reporters in the 9 a.m. hour, to receive three shallow throat swabs and
one shallow swab of each nostril --- daily.

The traditional N.B.A. bench is gone. To keep the area as safe as
possible, there are three rows of socially-distanced chairs. Players are
assigned seats furnished with an individual Gatorade station to ensure
no sharing of drinks.

San Antonio's Gregg Popovich, at 71, is the oldest coach in the N.B.A.~
He is among the few coaches who wears a mask while coaching games,
despite the impediment to voice projection. When asked why he stays
faithful to the mask, Popovich replied: ``I don't want to die.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/03/reader-center/burst-nba-lebron/burst-nba-lebron-blog480.jpg}

Coaches such as Popovich and Houston's Mike D'Antoni have expressed
surprise about the quality of play after the long layoff. There is
cautious optimism that the bubble can hold through October to allow the
N.B.A. to produce a legitimate conclusion to the 2019-20 season.

Of course, there is no guarantee that the N.B.A. can continue to keep
the coronavirus from infiltrating this first-of-a-kind village that
houses 22 teams.

But it already seems clear that the bubble approach was the only
approach that had any shot in 2020, especially given the challenges
Major League Baseball has already faced in its comeback.
