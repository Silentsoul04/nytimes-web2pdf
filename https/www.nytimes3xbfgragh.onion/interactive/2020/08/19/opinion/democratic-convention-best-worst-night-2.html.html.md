Welcome to Opinion’s commentary for the second night of the Democratic
National Convention. In this special feature, Times Opinion writers rank
the evening on a scale of 1 to 10: 1 means the night was a disaster for
Democrats; 10 means it could lead to a big polling bump for
Biden-Harris. Here’s what our columnists and contributors thought of the
event, which highlighted the roll call, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bill
Clinton and Jill Biden.

### Best moment

</div>

<div class="g-image">

<div class="g-caption">

</div>

</div>

**Wajahat Ali**   Democrats are making the case that they represent a
majority, with a broad coalition of diverse communities, including
life-long Republicans. Well, they showed it.

**Jamelle Bouie**   The roll call\! I am a sucker for earnest pride in
one’s home and community, and I found it genuinely moving to see
Americans of all colors and backgrounds speak to that pride and to their
faith in this country. It is good stuff\! Also, it should be a reminder
that the United States owes its territories either independence or full
voting rights and representation in Congress.

**Frank Bruni**   Joe Biden saying, with a Roman candle of a smile,
“thank you, thank you, thank you,” when the nomination was finally and
formally his. Gratitude, along with humility, is foreign to Donald
Trump.

**Gail Collins**   Have to admit the virtual roll call was better than
expected. Really thought I’d miss all those delegates howling
commercials for their state from the convention floor. But actually
seeing them on their home turf was nice.

**Michelle Cottle**   This is how nominating roll calls should be
conducted. Rather than focusing on spun-up delegates in daffy hats
jammed into a convention hall, this vote looked outward at America, with
on-site shots from every state and territory, starting from the Edmund
Pettus bridge in Alabama.

**Michelle Goldberg**   In many ways, a virtual convention is a pale
imitation of a real one, but the tour-of-America roll call vote, with
its moving diversity, homespun production values and slightly uncanny
masked tableaus, was a huge improvement over the usual procedure.

**Nicole Hemmer**   The roll call. Over the past several months, many
Americans have barely left their homes, much less their states, so that
tour of the country felt a little like traveling. And it brought some
kitschy fun to a convention woefully short on funny hats.

**Liz Mair**   It was, by far, when Rhode Island used its roll-call vote
to feature a man holding a platter of calamari — a prime-time earned
media ad for “the calamari comeback state.” The video roll call was
genuinely fun and gave a good glimpse of the breadth and depth of
American culture.

**Daniel McCarthy**   The Biden family video humanized him well after
his rather stiff acceptance of the nomination, and Jill Biden’s
follow-up in the classroom was potent.

**Melanye Price**   The delegate roll call. There is no way the
Republican Party can match the Democrats when it comes to reflecting the
diversity of America. Effective and uplifting\!

**Mimi Swartz**   Jill Biden. Gee, it would be nice to have a real first
lady again.

**Héctor Tobar**   The world’s biggest Zoom conference call, i.e., the
around-the-U.S.A. delegate vote. Great landscapes, and a wonderfully
diverse sampling of young Democratic leaders, activists and citizens. It
offered the viewer a real “proud to be an American” moment. Even the Fox
News pundits liked it.

**Peter Wehner**   Not any of the speeches, which were average at best,
but two D.N.C. videos — one about Jill Biden and her relationship with
Joe; the other on the “unlikely friendship” between Biden and John
McCain. Honorable mention to the virtual roll call, which was better and
more interesting than any in the
past.

### Worst moment

</div>

<div class="g-image">

![](https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/19/opinion/19scorecard-worst2/merlin_175881108_00f2601d-803c-4512-946f-234c5585d548-articleLarge.jpg)

<div class="g-caption">

the background. <span class="g-credit">Democratic National Convention,

</div>

</div>

**Wajahat Ali**   Tom Perez needs to stop trying so hard. As the party
chairman, just come out and say it straight. Bill Clinton delivered, as
he always does, but Democrats have to navigate their future without him
and his scandals. The rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez needed more
than 96 seconds.

**Jamelle Bouie**   I am finding it hard to identify a worst moment that
isn’t just an ideological gripe on my part. (And on that point, the
foreign policy segment wasn’t for me\!) I suppose I would have loved to
hear more from Representative Ocasio-Cortez, who is an extremely
talented political communicator.

**Frank Bruni**   The relay-race keynote speech. This gimmick meant the
remarks had no shape, pacing or heft, and the swiftly changing faces and
backdrops instilled motion sickness: Political bromides met “The Perfect
Storm.” At one point 17 keynoters said, in unison, “That’s a big effing
deal\!” I effing cringed.

**Gail Collins**   Sticking to a five-minute speech must have been hell
for Bill Clinton, and he sounded sorta flat. And John Kerry — oh, wow,
forgot what it was like to stare blankly at a screen when John Kerry was
making an important address.

**Michelle Cottle**   After the roll call, the cameras lingered a bit
too long on Joe and Jill standing around grinning awkwardly as people in
masks threw streamers at them. The nominee looked happy — but also as
though he wasn’t sure what to do. Wave? Dance? Hug Jill? Let’s keep it
crisp, people\!

**Michelle Goldberg**   Post \#MeToo, there was no reason to have Bill
Clinton speak.

**Nicole Hemmer**   Chuck Schumer kept gesturing meaningfully toward the
Statue of Liberty during his speech, seemingly unaware that it was just
a distant green smudge. You could spin that as symbolism — the erosion
of liberty and all that — but it was just bad camera work for an
otherwise forgettable speech.

**Liz Mair**   Both parties desperately need a new inventory of
celebratory music. Teeing up tunes that remind everyone of autumn 1980
isn’t a great way of projecting youth, vigor, stamina and a
forward-facing outlook.

**Daniel McCarthy**   Colin Powell is an impressive man who put his
prestige behind a needless and disastrous war in Iraq, which Biden
backed, too. Powell and the videos before and after him were a reminder
that Biden is the candidate of the war party.

**Melanye Price**   The old guys in the middle. John Kerry, Colin
Powell, Chuck Hagel and even Bill Clinton harkened back to a version of
politics that is on life support. In a high-tech, diverse, increasingly
progressive political moment, they seemed too stoic and out of place.

**Mimi Swartz**   It pains me to say this, but the scene of Joe Biden in
the library after winning the nomination was underwhelming after the
heroic buildup. Maybe anyone would long for the lift of a live crowd at
that moment, but Biden looked like someone still waiting for his cue.

**Héctor Tobar**   Chuck Schumer. A speech completely devoid of any
original ideas, delivered with a stiff posture and wooden tone, with the
Statue of Liberty in the background. Ugh. It was the one moment of the
night that most resembled a “Saturday Night Live” sketch.

**Peter Wehner**   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s searing indictment of
America, which fit in a lot in 96 seconds: racial injustice,
colonization, misogyny, homophobia, the violence and xenophobia of our
past, and the “unsustainable brutality” of our economy. Democrats should
be glad she wasn’t granted more
time.

### What else mattered

</div>

<div class="g-image">

<div class="g-caption">

The broadcast included livestreams from across the country.
<span class="g-credit">Democratic National Convention, via Associated
Press</span>

</div>

</div>

**Wajahat Ali**   It’s easy to forget Republicans remain committed to
dismantling Obamacare. The Democrats put a human face on health care.
Americans with disabilities shared their stories with Biden. He listened
and cared. He showed us what’s at stake if Trump gets another term: the
health of a nation.

**Jamelle Bouie**   The showcase of young leaders. The next generation
of Democratic Party leaders are here and working their way through the
ranks and up the ladder. Seeing them was also a reminder of how
America’s national leadership is in deep need of generational
turnover.

**Frank Bruni**   John Kerry’s devastating review of Trump on the world
stage (“when this president goes overseas, it isn’t a goodwill mission,
it’s a blooper reel”), followed by testimonials from Marie Yovanovitch
and Colin Powell, was a crucial reminder that foreign policy matters and
that Trump’s stinks.

**Gail Collins**   It would be pretty hard to come out of the night not
liking Joe Biden at least a little bit. Or if you already did, a little
bit more.

**Michelle Cottle**   The group “keynote address” delivered by 17
Democratic up-and-comers — county commissioners, mayors, state
legislators, etc. — helped focus attention on the party’s future
leaders, not just its past ones. It was a risk, and a tech challenge,
but it had great energy and flow. Having Stacey Abrams as the closer was
an especially nice touch.

**Michelle Goldberg**   The people who put this thing together struck
just the right tone, mixing grief-stricken sobriety with earnest hope.
But while I understand why Biden’s team wants Republican validators, his
campaign didn’t need to give more time to John McCain than to A.O.C. and
Stacey Abrams combined.

**Nicole Hemmer**   Just eight years ago, Bill Clinton stole the
convention with his lengthy prime-time speech. This year, his role
shrank to five unexceptional minutes, making clear that the Party of
Clinton has been fully eclipsed by the Party of Obama.

**Liz Mair**   Biden as listener and empathizer in chief works very
well. Biden moderating panels with ordinary Americans on issues makes
for some compelling and watchable content. But tonight’s session on
health care — when he talked about his personal experiences and thoughts
as Beau Biden lay dying of cancer — showcased what’s most appealing
about him: his personality, as opposed to a set of policies or good
soundbites, and the message that this is about you, not him.

**Daniel McCarthy**   Trump is the overwhelmingly dominant theme of the
convention so far — forward-looking hope and change have given way to
anti-Trumpism and nostalgia.

**Melanye Price**   It was crystal clear that the people who know Biden
really like him. It’s less clear whether he can maintain the crisp and
coherent narratives that have been so powerful here, as the campaign
continues.

**Mimi Swartz**   The roll call worked in that hokey American way — the
landscapes, the regional accents, the hopes and enthusiasms, and the
kids holding up signs of what looked like Joe Biden’s sunglasses. Even
Mayor Pete, on what looked like the movie set for “Delegates in Black.”

**Héctor Tobar**   The storytelling discipline of the producers of this
nightly infomercial is admirable. They’re hammering away relentlessly at
two storylines: Joe Biden as the defender of common Americans, with a
compassion born of personal suffering; and Trump as the nation’s callous
divider in chief.

**Peter Wehner**   Day 2 of the Democratic convention lacked the energy
and galvanizing moments of the first day. But what came through to me is
how effectively the convention is at humanizing Joe Biden. Personal
tragedy and loss are central to his story, and so, too, is empathy,
decency and healing. That doesn’t guarantee he’ll be a successful
president, but those qualities mean something, especially in the age of
Trump.
