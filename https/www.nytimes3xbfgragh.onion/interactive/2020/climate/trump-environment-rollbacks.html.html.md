<div class="g-item g-text">

After three years in office, the Trump administration has dismantled
most of the major climate and environmental policies the president
promised to undo.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Calling the rules unnecessary and burdensome to the fossil fuel industry
and other businesses, his administration has weakened Obama-era limits
on planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions [from power
plants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html)
and from [cars and
trucks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/climate/trump-fuel-economy.html),
and rolled back many more rules governing clean air, water and toxic
chemicals. Several major reversals have been finalized in recent months
as the country has struggled to contain the spread of the new
coronavirus.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In all, a New York Times analysis, based on research from [Harvard Law
School](https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/regulatory-rollback-tracker/),
[Columbia Law
School](http://columbiaclimatelaw.com/resources/climate-deregulation-tracker/)
and other sources, counts nearly 70 environmental rules and regulations
officially reversed, revoked or otherwise rolled back under Mr. Trump.
More than 30 additional rollbacks are still in progress.

With elections looming, the administration has sought to wrap up some of
its biggest regulatory priorities quickly, said Hana V. Vizcarra, a
staff attorney at Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law
Program. Further delays could leave the new rules [vulnerable to
reversal under the Congressional Review
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/05/01/us/politics/trump-obama-regulations-reversed.html)
if Democrats are able to retake Congress and the White House in
November, she said.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The bulk of the rollbacks identified by the Times have been carried out
by the Environmental Protection Agency, which repealed and replaced the
Obama-era emissions rules for power plants and vehicles; weakened
[protections for more than half the nation's
wetlands](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/22/climate/trump-environment-water.html);
and withdrew [the legal justification for restricting mercury emissions
from power
plants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/climate/epa-mercury-coal.html).

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

At the same time, the Interior Department has worked to open up more
land for oil and gas leasing by [cutting back protected
areas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/04/us/trump-bears-ears.html)
and [limiting wildlife
protections](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/15/climate/trump-sage-grouse.html).

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“Over the past three years, we have fulfilled President Trump’s promises
to provide certainty for states, tribes, and local governments,” a
spokeswoman for the E.P.A. said in a statement to The Times, adding that
the agency was “delivering on President Trump’s commitment to return the
agency to its core mission: Providing cleaner air, water and land to the
American people.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But environmental and legal groups said the rollbacks have not served
that mission. Ms. Vizcarra, who has tracked environmental rollbacks for
Harvard since 2018, said the agency under Mr. Trump has often limited
its own power to regulate environmental harm, especially when it comes
to climate change.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Many of the rollbacks have faced legal challenges by states,
environmental groups and others, and some could remain mired in court
beyond November, regardless of the outcome of the election.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Hillary Aidun, who tracks deregulation at Columbia University’s Sabin
Center for Climate Change Law, said many of the rollbacks had not been
adequately justified, leaving them vulnerable to legal challenge.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The New York Times analysis identified 10 rules that were initially
reversed or suspended but later reinstated, often [following
lawsuits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/06/climate/trump-administration-environmental-regulations.html)
and other challenges. Other rollbacks were rebuffed by the courts but
later revised by the administration and remain in effect.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

All told, the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks could
[significantly increase greenhouse gas
emissions](https://rhg.com/research/fuel-economy-1-5/) and lead to
[thousands of extra deaths from poor air quality each
year](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/climate-and-health-showdown-in-the-courts.pdf),
according to energy and legal analysts.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Below, we have summarized each rule that has been targeted for reversal
over the past three years.
