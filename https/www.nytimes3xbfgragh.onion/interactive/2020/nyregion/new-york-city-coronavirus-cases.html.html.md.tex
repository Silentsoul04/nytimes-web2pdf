About this data Note: The map shows the known locations of coronavirus
cases by ZIP code. For total cases: Circles are sized by the number of
people there who have tested positive for the virus, which may differ
from where they contracted the illness.

About this data Sources: New York City Department of City Planning,
Zillow and U.S. Census (neighborhood names). 2019 population estimates
are from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and
are based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the New York City
Department of City Planning.

Many of the neighborhoods with the highest number of cases per capita
were areas with the lowest median incomes and largest average household
size. The biggest hot spots included communities in the South Bronx,
north and southeast Queens, and much of Staten Island.

While age was a major factor in who died from Covid-19, neighborhoods
with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/nyregion/coronavirus-deaths-nyc.html}{high
concentrations of black and Latino people}, as well as low-income
residents, suffered the highest death rates. In August, the city
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/nyregion/new-york-city-antibody-test.html}{released
the results of 1.5 million antibody tests}, which showed that in one ZIP
code in Queens, more than 50 percent of people who had gotten tested
were found to have antibodies, a strikingly high rate.

The city saw a steep decline in new cases from a peak in early April,
but New York is still not close to being back to its former loud
bustling self. The frontlines of the Covid-19 fight have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/nyregion/coronavirus-recovery-hospital.html}{moved
from I.C.U.s to wards} where patients face lengthy recoveries. And
summer will be unlike any other in recent memory, as the pandemic has
led to the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/nyregion/nyc-pools-schools-closed-summer.html}{cancellation
of most summer programs} for children and public pools will not be
reopening.

Data for New York City includes confirmed cases and deaths from the
state's

also includes individuals who did not have a confirmed test but were
evaluated as probable coronavirus deaths by the city's

Health and Mental Hygiene}.

The New York Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track details
about every reported case in the United States, collecting information
from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in
this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest
information our journalists are gathering from around the country.

Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display
trend.

The New York Times has found that official
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/12/us/covid-deaths-us.html}{tallies
in the United States} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

In data for New York City, the Times relies on reports from both city
and state health departments. New York City typically releases new data
each day. Weekend counts may be lower because fewer sources report to
the state. Cases and deaths are reported based on a person's permanent
or usual residence.

The Times has identified the following reporting anomalies or
methodology changes in the data:

April 6: The Times began using deaths reported by the New York State
Health Department instead of the city's health department.

April 19: New York State released backlogged confirmed deaths from April
17 and April 18.

June 30: New York City released deaths from earlier periods but did not
specify when they were from.

Aug. 6: Our database changed to record deaths by New York City residents
instead of deaths that took place in New York City.

Aug. 20: New York City removed four previously reported deaths after
reviewing records.

The tallies on this page include probable and confirmed cases and
deaths.

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths}, which are widely considered to be
an undercount of the true toll, are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a molecular laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who meet criteria
for other types of testing, symptoms and exposure, as developed by
national and local governments.

Governments often revise data or report a single-day large increase in
cases or deaths from unspecified days without historical revisions,
which can cause an irregular pattern in the daily reported figures. The
Times is excluding these anomalies from seven-day averages when
possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing}. It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/05/well/covid-19-symptoms.html}{Here
is a guide to the symptoms of Covid-19.}

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs,
and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear
masks, the more we all stay safer.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into
contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to
keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed
them.

Here's a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html}{complete
guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
