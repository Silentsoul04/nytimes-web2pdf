Gov. Andrew Cuomo said all public schools in New York City, Long Island
and Westchester County would be closing down in response to deepening
concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. New York City’s school system
is the largest in the country, with 1.1 million students.

Some schools will open as “enrichment centers” to serve vulnerable
children. The district has 750,000 children who are low-income and rely
on school for basic services.

In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy has ordered all public and private
schools, including colleges, to close no later than March 18.
