Vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching
the clinic, but scientists are racing to produce a [safe and effective
coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html)
by next year. Researchers are testing **37 vaccines** in clinical trials
on humans, and at least 91 preclinical vaccines are [under active
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/health/covid-19-vaccines.html)

Work began in January with the deciphering of the [SARS-CoV-2
genome](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html).
The first vaccine safety trials in humans started in March, but the road
ahead remains uncertain. Some trials will fail, and others may end
without a clear result. But a few may succeed in stimulating the immune
system to produce effective antibodies against the virus.

Here is the status of all the vaccines that have reached trials in
humans, along with a selection of promising vaccines still being tested
in cells or animals.

<span class="g-phase0">PRECLINICAL TESTING</span>: Scientists test a new
vaccine on cells and then give it to **animals** such as mice or monkeys
to see if it produces an immune response. We have confirmed 91
preclinical vaccines in active development.

<span class="g-phase1">PHASE 1 SAFETY TRIALS</span>: Scientists give the
vaccine to a **small number of people** to test safety and dosage as
well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system.

<span class="g-phase2">PHASE 2 EXPANDED TRIALS</span>: Scientists give
the vaccine to **hundreds of people** split into groups, such as
children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in
them. These trials further test the vaccine’s safety and ability to
stimulate the immune system.

<span class="g-phase3">PHASE 3 EFFICACY TRIALS</span>: Scientists give
the vaccine to **thousands of people** and wait to see how many become
infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials
can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. In June,
the F.D.A. said that a coronavirus vaccine would have to [protect at
least 50% of vaccinated
people](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-action-help-facilitate-timely-development-safe-effective-covid)
to be considered effective. In addition, Phase 3 trials are large enough
to reveal evidence of relatively rare side effects that might be missed
in earlier studies.

<span class="g-limited">EARLY OR LIMITED APPROVAL</span>:
[China](#cansino) and [Russia](#gamaleya) have approved vaccines without
waiting for the results of Phase 3 trials. Experts say the rushed
process has [serious
risks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/health/russia-covid-19-vaccine-safety.html).

<span class="g-approval">APPROVAL</span>: Regulators in each country
review the trial results and decide whether to approve the vaccine or
not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may receive emergency use
authorization before getting formal approval. Once a vaccine is
licensed, researchers continue to monitor people who receive it to make
sure it’s safe and effective.

<span class="g-combined">COMBINED PHASES</span>: One way to [accelerate
vaccine
development](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html)
is to combine phases. Some coronavirus vaccines are now in Phase 1/2
trials, for example, in which they are tested for the first time on
hundreds of people. (Note that our tracker would count a combined Phase
1/2 trial as both Phase 1 and Phase 2.)

**Moderna** develops vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce
viral proteins in the body. They have yet to bring one to the market.
The government has bankrolled Moderna’s efforts on a coronavirus vaccine
with nearly $1 billion. In partnership with **National Institutes of
Health**, they found that the vaccine [protects
monkeys](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html)
from the coronavirus. In March, the company [put the first Covid-19

trials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html),
which yielded [promising
results](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/world/coronavirus-update.html#link-751c8321),
After carrying out a Phase 2 study they
[launched](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-6509720d)
a Phase 3 trial on July 27. The final trial will enroll 30,000 healthy
people at about 89 sites around the United States. On August 11, the
government
[awarded](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200811005852/en/Moderna-Announces-Supply-Agreement-U.S.-Government-Initial)
the company an additional $1.5 billion in exchange for 100 million doses
if the vaccine proves safe and effective.  
  
In July, Moderna
[lost](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/08/11/us/11reuters-health-coronavirus-moderna.html?searchResultPosition=1)
a patent dispute over some of their vaccine technology. The following
month, the company
[stated](https://www.axios.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-sec-disclosure-c8c491d1-0395-4c9d-8bf4-792246c6aa34.html)

The German company **BioNTech** entered into collaborations with
**Pfizer**, based in New York, and the Chinese drug maker **Fosun
Pharma** to develop an mRNA vaccine. In May they launched a Phase 1/2
trial on two versions of the vaccine. They
[found](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176651) that both versions
caused volunteers to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, as well as
immune cells called T cells that respond to the virus. They found that
one version, called BNT162b2, produced significantly fewer side effects,
such as fevers and fatigue, and so they chose it to move into Phase 2/3
trials. On July 27, the companies announced the
[launch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200727005800/en/Pfizer-BioNTech-Choose-Lead-mRNA-Vaccine-Candidate)
of a Phase 2/3 trial with 30,000 volunteers in the United States and
other countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Germany.  
  
In that same month, the Trump administration
[awarded](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
a $1.9 billion contract for 100 million doses to be delivered by
December and the option to acquire 500 million more doses. Meanwhile,
Japan made a
[deal](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-supply-japan-120-million-doses-their)
for 120 million doses. In September, the chief executive of Pfizer
[said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/09/03/world/europe/03reuters-health-coronavirus-drugs.html)
they would know if the vaccine works as soon as October 2020. If
approved, Pfizer has
[said](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-supply-canada-their-bnt162-mrna-based)

The **Gamaleya Research Institute**, part of Russia’s Ministry of

Gam-Covid-Vac. It is a combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26,
both engineered with a coronavirus gene.  
  
On Aug. 11, President Vladimir V. Putin
[announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-b092b4d)
that a Russian health care regulator had [approved the
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine.html),

[decried](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/health/russia-covid-19-vaccine-safety.html)
the move as risky, and Russia later [walked
back](https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-announces-expanded-trials-coronavirus-vaccine-approved-10/story?id=72497297)
the announcement, saying that the approval was a “conditional
registration certificate,” which would depend on positive results from
Phase 3 trials. Those trials, initially planned for just 2,000
volunteers, [were expanded
to 40,000](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04530396?term=vaccine&recrs=abdf&cond=COVID-19&phase=0123&sort=nwst&draw=2&rank=2).
On September 4, three weeks after Putin’s announcement, Gamaleya
researchers published the results of [their
Phase](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/health/russia-covid-vaccine.html?smid=tw-share)[1/2](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/health/russia-covid-vaccine.html?smid=tw-share)[trial](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/health/russia-covid-vaccine.html?smid=tw-share).
In a small study, they found that Sputnik yielded antibodies to the
coronavirus and mild side effects.

Institute**
[registered](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04527575) a Phase
1/2 trial for a coronavirus vaccine they call EpiVacCorona. The vaccine
contains small portions of viral proteins, known as peptides. According
to [newspaper
reports](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8656073/Second-Covid-vaccine-released-Russia-avoids-effects-one.html),
the EpiVacCorona trials had already begun by then, with plans for
distribution of the vaccine by the end of the year.

on animals, but provided no data. What’s more, it stated that
effectiveness trials would have to be carried out in another country
“since there is no case of Covid-19 in DPR Korea.” That’s a claim
