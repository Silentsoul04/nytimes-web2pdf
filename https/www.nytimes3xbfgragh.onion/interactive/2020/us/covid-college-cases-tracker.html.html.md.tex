Colleges

As colleges start the academic year amid a pandemic, coronavirus cases
are turning up by the thousands.

A New York Times survey of more than 1,500 American colleges and
universities --- including every four-year public institution, every
private college that competes in N.C.A.A. sports and others that
identified cases --- has revealed at least 26,000 cases and at least 64
deaths since the pandemic began.

\hypertarget{colleges-with-coronavirus-cases-since-the-pandemic-began}{%

100 or more cases

50-99 cases

10-49 cases

Fewer than 10 cases

Note: Data is as recent as Sept. 2. Only schools with known cases are
shown.

More than 100 colleges have reported at least 100 cases over the course
of the pandemic, including dozens that have seen spikes in recent weeks
as dorms have reopened and classes have started. Many of the metro areas
with the most cases per capita in recent days --- including Auburn,
Ala.; Ames, Iowa; and Statesboro, Ga. --- have hundreds of cases at
universities.

A cluster of 44 cases in the Virginia Commonwealth athletic department
forced the university to find additional isolation space. As cases
mounted on campus, Iowa State scrapped plans to allow 25,000 fans to
attend their first home football game. And California State University,
Chico, sent students home to take online classes after dozens of cases
emerged, including at least one in almost every dorm.

``I, like you, wish the story of this semester had been much
different,'' Gayle Hutchinson, the university's president,
\href{https://www.csuchico.edu/coronavirus/stories/8-30-onlinetransition.shtml}{wrote}
in a letter announcing the decision.

\hypertarget{search-for-a-school}{%
\subsubsection{Search for a school}\label{search-for-a-school}}

The list includes public, four-year universities in the United States,
as well as private colleges that compete in N.C.A.A. sports or are
members of an elite group of \href{https://www.aau.edu/}{research
universities}.

*Total is known to include one or more cases from a medical school,
medical center, teaching hospital, clinical setting or other academic
program in health sciences.\\
Schools without case totals (indicated as ---) either did not respond to
inquiries or declined to provide information.

Note: The charts show the cases per 100,000 residents reported each week
in the county where each school is. The location of a university's main
campus is listed unless otherwise specified. In several instances,
colleges noted that some cases were tied to branch campuses or satellite
locations.

This data shows where the virus has been identified over the course of
the pandemic, not necessarily where it is prevalent now. The Times has
counted more than 20,000 additional cases at colleges
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/28/us/covid-19-colleges-universities.html}{since
late July}, and more than 24,000 additional cases since late August.
Many of those are new infections from recent days, but others may have
emerged earlier in the pandemic. Some universities just started
reporting data, and The Times recently contacted others for the first
time.

Because colleges report data differently, and because cases continued to
emerge even in the months when most campuses were closed, The Times is
counting all reported cases since the start of the pandemic.

Though some universities decided to hold most or all classes online this
fall, others reopened their campuses with extensive rules on face
coverings, social distancing and gatherings. Many universities, hoping
to quickly identify cases and prevent broader outbreaks, have tested
aggressively for the virus, contributing in some instances to higher
case counts.

With no national tracking system, colleges are making their own rules
for how to tally infections. While The Times's survey is believed to be
the most comprehensive account available, it is also a near-certain
undercount. Among the colleges contacted by The Times, many published
case information online or responded to requests for case numbers, but
at least 600 others ignored inquiries or refused to answer questions.
More than 150 have reported zero cases.

Given the disparities in size, reopening plans and transparency among
universities, this data should not be used to make campus-to-campus
comparisons. Some colleges remove people from their tallies once they
recover. Some only report tests performed on campus. And some initially
provided data but then stopped.

The Times is counting reported cases among university students and
employees in all fields, including those whose roles as doctors, nurses,
pharmacists or medical students puts them at higher risk of contracting
the virus. At least four universities that have a broad range of
programs, including medical units, have reported dozens of cases tied to
health care. Those cases are listed above as a subset of their
universitywide totals.

Some universities did not provide data for cases at their medical
schools, hospitals or clinics. Some included those cases in their
campuswide counts, but did not specify how many. Other universities that
are primarily focused on medical training, or that reported a small
number of cases tied to clinical programs, are listed in the main table
on this page with an asterisk.

The college case data is as recent as Sept. 2 and will be updated
periodically. It is based on reports from colleges and government
sources and may lag. Colleges and government agencies report this data
differently, so exercise caution when comparing institutions. Some
colleges declined to provide data or did not respond to inquiries. At
some institutions, cases may be spread across multiple campuses. Total
cases include confirmed positive cases and probable cases, where
available. Colleges occasionally adjust their data downward if new
information emerges. Cases include those of students, faculty, staff
members and other college workers.
