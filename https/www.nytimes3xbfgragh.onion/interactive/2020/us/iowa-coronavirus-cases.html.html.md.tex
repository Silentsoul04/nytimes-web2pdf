About this data For total cases and deaths: The map shows the known
locations of coronavirus cases by county. Circles are sized by the
number of people there who have tested positive or have a probable case
of the virus, which may differ from where they contracted the illness.
For per capita: Parts of a county with a population density lower than
10 people per square mile are not shaded. For hot spots: The hot spots
map shows the share of population with a new reported case over the last
week. Parts of a county with a population density lower than 10 people
per square mile are not shaded.

The New York Times has found that official
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/12/us/covid-deaths-us.html}{tallies
in the United States} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

In data for Iowa, the Times primarily relies on reports from the state.
Iowa typically releases new data each day. Weekend counts may be lower
because fewer sources report to the state. The state reports cases and
deaths based on a person's permanent or usual residence.

The Times has identified the following reporting anomalies or
methodology changes in the data:

Aug. 27: Iowa started including cases identified through antigen testing
among positive cases.

The tallies on this page include cases that have been identified by
public health officials as probable coronavirus patients through antigen
testing.

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths}, which are widely considered to be
an undercount of the true toll, are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a molecular laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who meet criteria
for other types of testing, symptoms and exposure, as developed by
national and local governments.

Governments often revise data or report a single-day large increase in
cases or deaths from unspecified days without historical revisions,
which can cause an irregular pattern in the daily reported figures. The
Times is excluding these anomalies from seven-day averages when
possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing}. It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/05/well/covid-19-symptoms.html}{Here
is a guide to the symptoms of Covid-19.}

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs,
and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear
masks, the more we all stay safer.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into
contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to
keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed
them.

Here's a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html}{complete
guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
