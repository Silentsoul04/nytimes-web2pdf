About this data For total cases and deaths: The map shows the known
locations of coronavirus cases by county. Circles are sized by the
number of people there who have tested positive or have a probable case
of the virus, which may differ from where they contracted the illness.
For per capita: Parts of a county with a population density lower than
10 people per square mile are not shaded. For hot spots: The hot spots
map shows the share of population with a new reported case over the last
week. Parts of a county with a population density lower than 10 people
per square mile are not shaded.

About this data Weekly cases per capita shows the share of population
with a new reported case for each week. Weeks without a reported case
are shaded gray. The table includes new cases and deaths that were
reported in the last seven days.

In the tallies shown on this page, The Times is now including cases and
deaths that have been identified by public health officials as probable
coronavirus patients.

The New York Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track details
about every reported case in the United States, collecting information
from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in
this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest
information our journalists are gathering from around the country.

The New York Times has found that official
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-death-toll-total.html}{tallies
in the United States} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

In data for the United States, The Times is now including cases and
deaths that have been identified by public health officials as probable
coronavirus patients. Some states and counties only report figures in
which a coronavirus infection was confirmed through testing. Because
confirmed cases are widely considered to be an undercount of the true
toll, some state and local governments have started identifying probable
cases and deaths using criteria that were developed by states and the
federal government.

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths} are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who did not have a
confirmed test but were evaluated using criteria developed by national
and local governments. Some governments are reporting only confirmed
cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers.
And there is also another set of governments that are reporting the two
types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the
confirmed from the probable. The Times is now using the total of
confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or
combined. Otherwise only the confirmed count will be shown.

Governments often revise data or report a large increase in cases on a
single day without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular
pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these
anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing}. It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs,
and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear
masks, the more we all stay safer.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into
contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to
keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed
them.

Here's a

guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.

Note: Data are based on reports by states and counties at the time of
publication. Local governments may revise reported numbers as they get
new information. Some deaths may be reported by officials in two
different jurisdictions. When possible, deaths have been reported here
in the jurisdiction where the death occurred.

*Cases in New York City, Kansas City, Mo., and Joplin, Mo., each of
which span multiple counties, are grouped together. Cases in a state
that have been reported without a specific county are listed as county
``unknown.''
