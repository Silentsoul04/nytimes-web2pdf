There have been at least 191,200 confirmed cases of coronavirus in
France, according to the
\href{https://dashboard.covid19.data.gouv.fr/}{French government}. As of
Tuesday morning, 30,294 people had died.

National health authorities in France do not provide regional data for
test-confirmed cases of the virus, but they do report regional data for
the number of people hospitalized for Covid-19 and how many of those
people have recovered or died.

The number of hospitalized patients in intensive care has been steadily
decreasing over the past few months, dropping below the 1,000 patients
per day in early July, and the number of new deaths each day has also
fallen.

Weeks have passed since government officials began lifting the
months-long lockdown, but health authorities have reported an upward
trend in reported cases in recent days, which they've attributed to
waning social distancing efforts. As of July 20, the government imposed
mandatory mask-wearing in enclosed public spaces.

All restrictions on travel within the country have been lifted, and
schools, shops,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/world/europe/coronavirus-paris-cafe-reopen-france.html}{cafÃ©s
and restaurants} have all reopened, with restrictions. The French
government has ramped up its ability to identify and isolate new cases
and trace their contacts. Several hundreds of clusters have emerged in
the months since the lockdown lifted, with more than 100 still active,
prompting authorities to warn that a second wave of the epidemic is
possible.

The New York Times has found that official
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-death-toll-total.html}{tallies
in the United States} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

France is one of a few countries in Europe that includes Covid-19 deaths
in retirement or nursing homes in its country-wide daily death tallies,
meaning the overall picture of mortality is more accurate. But the data
skewed higher in the early weeks of April when previously unrecorded
deaths were suddenly added to the nationally tally.

Generally speaking, France was late to increase its testing capacities
compared to countries like
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-cases.html}{Germany}.
The national public health authority has acknowledged that the reported
number of test-confirmed cases was lower than the real number of cases.

de Gaulle, France's flagship aircraft carrier,

Here is where you can find more detailed information:

France has centralized official coronavirus-related information and
documents --- like the waivers needed for personal outings --- on
\href{https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus}{this website} (a
more limited version
\href{https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19}{is available

outbreak

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

The Times has found the following reporting anomalies for the data on
this page:

France does not regularly report new data on weekends.

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths} are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who did not have a
confirmed test but were evaluated using criteria developed by national
and local governments. Some governments are reporting only confirmed
cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers.
And there is also another set of governments that are reporting the two
types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the
confirmed from the probable. The Times is now using the total of
confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or
combined. Otherwise only the confirmed count will be shown.

Governments often revise data or report a large increase in cases on a
single day without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular
pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these
anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing}. It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs,
and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear
masks, the more we all stay safer.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into
contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to
keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed
them.

Here's a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html}{complete
guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
