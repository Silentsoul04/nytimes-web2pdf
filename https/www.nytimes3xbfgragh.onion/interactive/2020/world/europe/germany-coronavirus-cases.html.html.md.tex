There have been at least 211,200 confirmed cases of coronavirus in
Germany, according to the
\href{https://www.rki.de/DE/Home/homepage_node.html}{Robert Koch
Institute}, the country's public health institution. As of Tuesday
morning, 9,156 people had died.

locations of coronavirus cases by region. Circles are sized by the
number of people there who have tested positive or have a probable case
of the virus, which may differ from where they contracted the illness.

Here's how the number of cases and deaths are growing in Germany:

Widespread testing for the virus began early in the year and has
remained a key strategy for containing the virus in Germany. Labs across
the country were allowed to produce their own test kits, starting in
January, which epidemiologists have credited with keeping the number of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html}{deaths
relatively low} and preventing Germany's health care system from
becoming overwhelmed.

With a capability to carry out 1.2 million tests per week, Germany will
begin implementing mandatory tests for anyone returning from vacation
outside of Europe in August. Germany relies on contact tracing and an
app to prevent outbreaks from spreading. Regions reporting more than 50
new cases per 100,000 residents in a week must
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-reopening.html}{return
to lockdown}.

The German economy is predicted to shrink by more than 5 percent this
year, and more than 2.9 million Germans remain
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/business/europe-economy-coronavirus-recession.html}{unemployed},
with another 6.7 million furloughed. But Europe's largest economy is
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/the-german-economy-had-its-biggest-slump-in-50-years.html}{rebounding
more quickly} than expected, though the risk of further setbacks remains
high.

The country's

soccer league}, which resumed matches played to empty stadiums on May
16, is planning to allow fans to return in smaller numbers and without
beer in the coming months. Still, large-scale events, including the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/sports/berlin-marathon-germany.html}{Berlin

banned.

The New York Times has found that official
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-death-toll-total.html}{tallies
in the United States} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

The data in Germany is compiled by the country's public health
institution, which collects information reported by doctors and
laboratories to the local health authorities in each state. Other
organizations have reported higher figures for cases and deaths in
Germany, but the German health authorities maintain that this data is
unverified.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

\textbf{Confirmed cases and deaths} are counts of individuals whose
coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test.
\textbf{Probable cases and deaths} count individuals who did not have a
confirmed test but were evaluated using criteria developed by national
and local governments. Some governments are reporting only confirmed
cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers.
And there is also another set of governments that are reporting the two
types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the
confirmed from the probable. The Times is now using the total of
confirmed and probable counts when they are available individually or
combined. Otherwise only the confirmed count will be shown.

Governments often revise data or report a large increase in cases on a
single day without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular
pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these
anomalies from seven-day averages when possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing}. It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs,
and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear
masks, the more we all stay safer.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into
contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to
keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed
them.

Here's a

guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
