**Uber** said on Thursday that its revenue in the second quarter dropped
29 percent to $2.2 billion from a year ago and that its net loss
narrowed to $1.8 billion, as the ride-hailing giant deals with the
fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

The revenue decline was the steepest since Uber went public in May 2019,
though total revenue was better than what Wall Street analysts had
projected. Uber’s losses improved from [$5.2
billion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/08/technology/uber-earnings.html)
a year ago when it had heavy stock-based compensation costs after its
initial public offering.

The pandemic’s hit to Uber’s core ride-hailing business was
unmistakable. The company said<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>the amount of money it receives from rides before paying driver
wages and other fees declined 73 percent from a year earlier.

But delivery surged, with revenue from Uber Eats, its food delivery
business, exceeding the core ride-hailing business for the first time.
Revenue from Uber Eats totaled $1.2 billion, while rides shrank to $790
million.

To bolster its delivery business, Uber recently agreed to acquire the
food delivery company Postmates for [$2.65
billion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/05/technology/uber-postmates-deal.html).

</div>

Since April, federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program has
injected $523 billion into the economy, allowing small-business owners
to stay afloat and keep employees on payrolls.

But with the program set to end Saturday and an economic rebound nowhere
in sight, the looming question is: What happens to the millions of
workers who have no jobs to return to, and the struggling businesses
that employed them?

The numbers are already dire. On Thursday, the government reported that
[nearly 1.2 million Americans filed for state unemployment
benefits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/new-state-jobless-claims-decline-but-exceed-one-million-for-the-20th-week)
last week — the 20th straight week that new jobless claims have topped
one million. Economists estimate that 30 million Americans are
unemployed.

Small businesses employ nearly half of America’s nongovernment workers,
and the paycheck program preserved at least 1.4 million jobs through
early June, [a recent economic
analysis](http://economics.mit.edu/files/20094) concluded. More than
five million companies received loans, averaging $102,000 each.

Ken Bodenstein borrowed $148,000 from the federal government to help
cover payroll expenses at the Westport day care center he runs with his
wife, Kristen. But by June 5, the money ran out, forcing the Bodensteins
to furlough or lay off all but nine employees.

“We were just about to hit break-even, and then everything collapsed,”
Mr. Bodenstein said.

So far, there is [little agreement in
Washington](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-stimulus.html)
about how to continue to help millions of floundering businesses.

“There’s absolutely a need for more help in some industries,” said
Carson Lappetito, president of Sunwest Bank, a regional lender based in
Irvine, Calif., that has made more than 2,000 P.P.P. loans. “In the
hotel and restaurant and hospitality sectors, those areas have been
completely hammered.”

Rupert Murdoch’s publishing empire took a staggering loss for the three
months ending in June, as **News Corp** reported a $401 million loss for
the period, with much of the decline related to impairment charges for
some of its assets in Britain and Australia and restructuring costs
related to the coronavirus pandemic.

  - But a surprise highlight was the company revealing for the first
    time financial details of its Dow Jones division, the group that
    publishes **The Wall Street Journal**. The unit was News Corp’s only
    growing business on an annual basis. For the fiscal year ending in
    June, revenue for Dow Jones, which includes Barron’s and the news
    and information site MarketWatch, was up 3 percent to $1.6 billion,
    and profit rose 13 percent to $236 million. Circulation sales
    increased 6 percent to about $1.2 billion, while ad revenue fell 9
    percent to $359 million.

  - In addition to The Journal, News Corp publishes several newspapers
    across the United States, Britain and Australia, including The Times
    of London and the tabloids The New York Post and The Sun. Those
    papers are housed under a separate group from The Journal.

  - One advantage to laying out a division’s finances is it allows a
    **potential acquirer** to more accurately value that part of the
    business. The company has not said there are any plans to sell The
    Journal.

  - **Robert Thomson**, chief executive of News Corp, called the
    reporting of Dow Jones financials “a particularly historic moment.”
    He said it highlighted the division’s “superior profit profile and
    prospects compared to those of our nearest competitor.”

  - **Subscriptions** to The Wall Street Journal rose 15 percent to just
    under three million, including 2.2 million digital-only
    subscriptions.

  - Quarterly results revealed advertising challenges at Dow Jones, as
    at other news publishers. Revenue fell 4 percent to $381 million,
    largely because of a 28 percent drop in advertising sales to $71
    million. Profit, however, was up 13 percent to $60 million.

  - Total sales for News Corp fell 22 percent to $1.9 billion, with
    advertising dropping across its properties. This is also the first
    quarter that News Corp is reporting its results without James
    Murdoch, a potential heir to the Murdoch family empire who [stepped
    down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/business/media/james-murdoch-resigns-news-corp.html)

</div>

The Trump administration is considering forcing Chinese companies to
delist their shares from stock exchanges in the United States unless
they share their audits with American regulators, a move that would
further ratchet up tension between the world’s two largest economies.

China does not allow its companies to provide their audit information to
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which oversees auditors
in the United States. Officials at the Treasury Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged that the Chinese
government would likely have to amend its laws so that companies would
be in compliance with the rules, if they take effect.

The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets recommended the move
in a report released on Thursday as a way to protect American investors
from what it described as the [risks posed by Chinese
companies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/07/13/business/in-china-inspecting-the-inspectors.html).
The recommendations would require the S.E.C. to undertake a rule-making
process and would not take full effect until 2022.

“The recommendations outlined in the report will increase investor
protection and level the playing field for all companies listed on U.S.
exchanges,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the working
group, said in a statement.

If a Chinese company did not comply with the rule and provide access to
work papers of the principal audit firm, it would have until January
2022 to delist. A Chinese company could potentially satisfy the
requirements by undertaking a co-audit with a comparable firm that would
provide access to relevant information.

Treasury and S.E.C. officials acknowledged that the policy could lead to
a wave of delistings.

There is currently bipartisan legislation in the House and the Senate
that would impose restrictions similar to what the working group is
proposing.

With operations ceased for the entirety of the quarter and most of its
employees laid off or furloughed, **AMC Entertainment**, the largest
theater chain in the U.S., posted a quarterly loss for the period ended
June of $561.2 million. Revenues totaled $18.9 million, a 98.7 percent
plunge from the same period last year for the Kansas-based company.

The coronavirus has laid waste to the company’s 1,000 theaters scattered
across the globe, calling into question whether it would be able to stay
financially viable. AMC did restructure $2.6 billion of its debt, which
Adam Aron, the chief executive, said will allow the company to stay
afloat should theaters have to remain shuttered into 2021.

AMC is planning on reopening two-thirds of its U.S. theaters this month.
Internationally, AMC has already restarted business in 130 markets and
expects its remaining theaters to also open in August.

“We remain optimistic about AMC’s long term future,” Mr. Aron said in a
statement. “Theatrical exhibition has always been resilient, and we are
confident that at AMC we are taking the right steps to emerge from this
crisis and to thrive once again as the leader in our
industry.“<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Last week, AMC [shocked
Hollywood](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/business/media/universal-amc-movies-at-home.html)
by signing an agreement with Universal Studios that would dramatically
shorten the amount of time movies need to play exclusively in its
theaters before moving to premium video-on-demand. The deal, which now
only requires a film to play for 17 days, will allow AMC to share in the
revenue generated by the on-demand sales.

Wall Street regained its footing on Thursday afternoon, pushing higher
after an unsteady start to the day, with the S\&P 500 inching ever
closer to its record and climbing for a fifth consecutive day.

The S\&P 500 rose more than half a percent, gains that put the index
about 1 percent below a high reached on February 19, before markets went
into a tailspin as investors panicked about the fast spreading
coronavirus.  
  
Large technology stocks, which have played a large role in the rebound,
rallied again. On Thursday, it was **Facebook** that ranked among the
best performing stocks in the S\&P 500, with a gain of almost 6.5
percent. Shares of **Apple**, **Google** and **Microsoft** were also
higher, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1 percent.

The gains came despite more indications of the economic morass the
United States finds itself in, and as prospects for a deal on a new
financial [rescue
package](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-stimulus.html)
appeared to dim.

It may have helped that President Trump on Thursday said he was willing
to act unilaterally to [strengthen the
economy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-d79b4fa),
saying he was looking at executive orders to forestall evictions,
suspend payroll tax collection and provide extra unemployment aid and
student loan relief.

Mr. Trump’s comments came after the Labor Department released data
showing that workers filed more than one million new state [jobless
claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#new-jobless-claims-are-set-to-exceed-one-million-for-the-20th-week)
for the 20th straight week, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to
lead to layoffs and business closures. The tally for last week, 1.2
million claims, was the lowest since March.

Shares in Europe fell, however, weighed down by warnings from Britain’s
central bank of a slow recovery ahead.

Bank of England policymakers said that they expected the country’s
economy to contract by 9 percent this year, [a less severe
downturn](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/britains-economy-wont-fully-recover-till-end-of-2021-its-central-bankers-said)
than they indicated a few months ago, but they also predicted that the
economy would not return to its pre-pandemic levels until the end of
2021. Even in three years, they said, the economy will still be smaller
than it would have been had the growth rate followed the path it was on
at the end of 2019.

The Turkish lira hit a new low against the dollar Thursday, raising
fears of a currency crisis that would undermine the fragile economy. The
Turkish central bank said Thursday it would “use all available
instruments to reduce the excessive volatility in the markets” after the
lira fell as low as 7.3 to the dollar, down from 6 to the dollar at the
beginning of the year.

The [government reported](https://oui.doleta.gov/press/2020/080620.pdf)
on Thursday that nearly 1.2 million workers filed new claims for state
unemployment benefits last week. It was the lowest weekly total since
March, but signaled the continuing damage that the pandemic is
inflicting on the labor market.

An additional 656,000 claims were filed by freelancers, part-time
workers and others who do not qualify for regular state jobless aid but
are eligible for benefits under a separate federal unemployment
insurance program, the Labor Department announced on Thursday. Unlike
the state figures, that number is not seasonally adjusted.

“Over all, the data was modestly better than we expected, a surprising
improvement,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at
Oxford Economics. There were declines across nearly all the states, even
those where there is a resurgence of the virus.

But jobless claims “remain at alarmingly high levels,” she said, and the
stubbornly high number of people collecting unemployment — estimated by
economists at 30 million — suggests that “temporary layoffs are becoming
permanent.”

Although the number of new claims is down from the stratospheric levels
reached in the early days of the pandemic, the million-plus tallies that
have continued for 20 weeks in a row are still extraordinarily high by
historical standards.

And now that emergency federal supplemental benefits have expired, the
newest entrants to join the ranks of unemployed will not be receiving
the extra $600 a week that has helped jobless workers pay bills through
the spring and early summer.

The Nevada Legislature has approved a bill mandating health protections
for hundreds of thousands of workers in the hospitality industry while
providing most of the state’s businesses with a liability shield against
coronavirus-related lawsuits.

The state’s powerful culinary union pushed for the worker protections as
part of what it called the Adolfo Fernandez Bill, named for a utility
porter on the Las Vegas Strip who died after contracting Covid-19.

Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, is expected to sign the measure, which
was approved Wednesday night. Both houses of the Legislature are
controlled by Democrats.

In the counties that include Las Vegas and Reno, the bill requires daily
temperature screenings of hospitality workers, coronavirus tests for
those returning to work and regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces. The
legislation bars employers from forcing workers with symptoms from
reporting to the job while awaiting test results and offers paid time
off to those testing positive.

At the same time, the bill shields businesses in most of the state’s
industries from potential lawsuits by customers who become ill with
Covid-19.

State Senator Yvanna Cancela, a co-majority whip, said the measure
“finds a balance” in offering health protection to workers while
assuring employers that “there can be certainty around which you can
operate.”

But progressive groups criticized the liability provisions, saying they
offered a shield to employers not bound by the safety mandates that
apply to casino and hotel workers.

Hugh Baran, a staff lawyer with the National Employment Law Project, a
worker advocacy group, said the liability provisions would grant “legal
immunity to employers who fail to protect their workers.”

While the elevated levels of [jobless
claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#new-state-jobless-claims-decline-but-exceed-one-million-for-the-20th-week)
show that businesses are still struggling to keep employees on the
payroll, there has been some pickup in hiring. After drooping, job
postings at the online jobs site ZipRecruiter rose by 7.4 percent in
July and are still climbing, said Julia Pollak, the company’s labor
economist.

But the latest economic data is mixed, she cautioned. Surveys from the
[Institute for Supply Management](https://www.ismworld.org/), for
instance, showed that business activity in service industries expanded
last month, but that the [employment
index](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#as-unemployment-benefits-began-to-run-out-a-freelance-job-came-just-in-time)
declined, an indication that many companies are still not bringing back
workers.

There were steep increases in joblessness related to the performing arts
and other live events in July, Ms. Pollak said.

And announcements of impending layoffs continue to pile in. Ms. Pollak
has been tracking plant closings and layoffs that the government
requires to be announced in advance. “They are showing that new layoffs
are still taking place at an alarming rate,” she said. “Plenty of
layoffs are scheduled for August, September and October, as well.”

“Many companies are realizing now that the effects will be much longer
than expected,” she said.

  - **Facebook** will allow its employees to work from home until at

    will give employees an additional $1,000 to support continued remote
    work. The company believed in the importance of in-person

    from the previous year. Behind that number were 10.6 million sales
    of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, pushing the Japanese gaming
    company’s net income to 106.5 billion yen ($1 billion), and the
    company said “sales of this title continue to be strong with no loss
    of momentum.” Since it was released, there have been more than 22
    million sales of the game.

    according to a new survey, underscoring the difficulty airlines face
    in convincing people it is safe for them to get back on planes.
    Younger adults are more willing to travel; only a third of those
    between the ages of 18 and 34 expressed discomfort with the idea.
    But older adults, who tend to have more time and money to travel,
    are far more reluctant. Among those 55 or older, 69 percent said
    they would not be comfortable taking a flight.
