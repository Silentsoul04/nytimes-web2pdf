A standoff between the **Walt Disney Company** and a union over the
company’s handling of coronavirus testing at Walt Disney World in
Florida was resolved on Wednesday, according to the Actors’ Equity
Association, which represents roughly 700 actors, dancers and stunt
workers at the theme park complex.

“I’m happy to announce that Equity’s executive committee has signed a
memorandum of understanding with Disney for Equity performers to
return,” Kate Shindle, president of Actors’ Equity, said in a
statement.

The union had been sparring with Disney World over coronavirus testing
since late June, when the mega-resort started to call back [43,000
furloughed
workers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/12/business/disney-furloughs-coronavirus.html),
who are represented by a number of unions, in preparation for a [phased
reopening](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/business/coronavirus-disney-world-reopening.html)
that started on July 11. Actors’ Equity, noting that its members worked
in jobs where they were unable to wear masks or stay six feet from one
another, demanded that Disney provide regular tests. Disney declined,
citing other safety measures, and announced on July 7 that its parks
would reopen without Equity members. The union [filed a
grievance](https://www.actorsequity.org/news/PR/DisneyGrievance/)
against Disney on July 9 for “retaliation.”

Disney has not changed its stance on providing employee testing.
However, the union appeared to be satisfied with an offer that Disney
made to the Florida Division of Emergency Management to operate a public
testing facility on its property. Any Florida resident [can get a test
for free](https://doineedacovid19test.com/Kissimmee_FL_1147.html), with
a three-to-five-day turnaround for results. Disney is allowing the
government to use vacant office space known as Maingate in the southwest
corner of the 25,000-acre resort — relatively far away from the actual
entrances of any Disney World park or hotel.

“We have offered the location to help with community testing, and any
suggestion that this has been done as a result of any one union is
unfounded,” Disney said in a statement. “Our actions support all cast
and our community at large.” (Disney refers to park workers as “cast
members.”)

The testing site will open to the public on Friday. Disney employees and
their immediate families [can get in](https://disneycovid19test.com/)
starting on Thursday.

Disney declined to comment about when — or if — it would recall Actors’
Equity performers. Some shows at Disney World have not been running as a
result of their absence, including the popular “Festival of the Lion
King” at Disney’s Animal Kingdom. In other instances, Disney has
reworked its entertainment offerings to avoid using Actors’ Equity
performers.

Stocks rallied on Wednesday, with Wall Street coming ever closer to a
high that would seem to defy dire predictions of the economic damage
brought by the coronavirus pandemic.

The S\&P 500 rose nearly 1.5 percent, its biggest daily gain in weeks
and one that left it just six points short of a record of 3,386.15,
reached in February before the fast-spreading virus set off an enormous
decline in stock prices.

The index is up about 50 percent from its lowest point this year, gains
that have been fueled by a number of factors, including government
spending to prop up the economy and a rally in shares of big technology
companies.

Technology stocks again drove the rally on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq
composite jumping more than 2 percent and the information technology
sector of the S\&P 500 the best performing corner of the market.  
  
Companies such as **Apple**, **Amazon** and **Microsoft** have attracted
investors despite the deep economic downturn in the United States, with
buyers betting that those companies are poised to thrive in a
stay-at-home economy and emerge from the crisis in an even stronger
competitive position.

Still, the march higher has also meant that investors have looked past a
number of risks that lie ahead. Most prominent among them this week is
the inability of lawmakers in Washington to reach any consensus about
another economic aid package. On Tuesday, stocks reversed their gains
after the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said that talks over
a new plan for unemployment benefits and other spending had “stalled.”

The cost of the pandemic was on display in
[Britain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/12/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/britains-lockdown-recession-is-the-deepest-in-europe-and-north-america),
where the government released data showing the economy shrank by more
than 20 percent in the April to June quarter, when the economy was in
the grips of a lockdown to curb the virus’s spread. That was not only
the steepest fall on record for Britain, but the worst second-quarter
collapse among European and North American countries.

The coronavirus pandemic has wiped out business for **Lyft**, which said
Wednesday in an earnings report that its second-quarter revenue was down
61 percent from a year ago, to $339.3 million. Its net loss was $437.1
million.

Travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders have dented the ride-hailing
industry, as passengers have avoided commutes, airport trips and social
events. Ridership was down 60 percent in the quarter than ended June 30
from the same period a year ago, Lyft said. In an [earnings
report](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/technology/uber-ride-hailing-delivery-coronavirus.html)
last week, Uber said its rides were also down 50 percent to 85 percent
in many major U.S. cities.

Uber has accelerated its food delivery services to offset the impact of
the pandemic, but Lyft has remained focused on transportation. Despite
its losses, Lyft exceeded Wall Street expectations for the quarter,
sending its stock up more than 2 percent in after-hours trading.

The United States budget deficit grew to a record $2.8 trillion for the
fiscal year to date as the federal government continued to pump money
into an economy coping with the coronavirus pandemic, the Treasury
Department said on Wednesday.

The monthly shortfall of $63 billion for July was an improvement from
[the prior
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/politics/budget-deficit-coronavirus.html),
however, as tax payments that were delayed from April came in and as
government loans that were being supported through the $660 billion
Paycheck Protection Program slowed.

The ballooning deficit comes as Congress [continues to
debate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-relief-bill.html)
another round of fiscal stimulus on top of the $2.2 trillion in economic
relief that was approved in March. Republican lawmakers have begun
expressing concern about the size of the deficit — which is the gap
between what the U.S. spends and what it takes in — and have cited that
as a reason to slow future spending. But many economists say the United
States should be running a large deficit now, as millions remain out of
work and business activity remains depressed.

The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, has also cautioned that now
is “not the time” to act on concerns about the deficit.

Much of the spending in July came from the Department of Health and
Human Services and the Department of Labor, which has been paying out
[an additional $600 per
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/24/business/economy/600-unemployment-benefits.html)
in supplemental unemployment insurance benefits. That extra money
expired at the end of July.

Government receipts for the month were $563 billion, up sharply from the
same month the previous year as tax dollars began to flow into the
Treasury. The Trump administration had delayed Tax Day by three months
to July 15 to help workers hit by the pandemic.

For the fiscal year, tax receipts are down by just 1 percent compared
with 2019.

Lawmakers in Congress and the Trump administration have been locked in
negotiations over how much to spend on another relief package as the
existing programs run dry. The White House and Republicans are willing
to spend slightly more than $1 trillion while Democrats want to spend
more than $3 trillion.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview on the Fox
Business Network on Wednesday that about 20 percent of U.S. gross
domestic product has been pumped into the economy this year through
support measures and that it was important to be mindful about piling on
substantially more debt.

A Federal Reserve regional bank president warned that the country’s
inability to control the spread of coronavirus is undermining its
economic rebound and risks delaying the return of full employment, as
nervous consumers stay home to avoid getting infected.

“We must get the virus under control in order for a sustainable economic
recovery to take hold,” Eric Rosengren, president of the **Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston**, said on Wednesday. He added later that “states
lifted protective measures too soon and in a manner not calibrated for
the true risks posed by the virus.”

Mr. Rosengren said that “common sense precautions — such as wearing
masks when around other people, maintaining safe social distance and
avoiding crowded indoor settings — are much less costly than having to
shut down whole sectors of the economy again.” It was important for
Americans to take such steps “to avoid more tragic outcomes along with
further economic pain,” he said.

Mr. Rosengren said that real-time data suggest the recovery may be
“losing steam,” [echoing
remarks](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/jerome-powell-fed-press-conference-speech-transcript-july-29)the
Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, made at a news conference in late July,
when he suggested that a resurgence in virus cases might be slowing the
rebound.

The Boston Fed chief, whose central bank branch is running the Fed’s
Main Street loan program for midsize businesses, said that the
government’s program to provide funding to those companies will be
useful in the fall if activity slows and credit conditions worsen. Some
have [called the program a
failure](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/business/economy/federal-reserve-main-street-lending.html)
because it has supported relatively few loans so far.

Mr. Rosengren said he “completely” disagrees with that assessment.

“The program can serve as a vital bridge to address cash-flow
interruption ushered in by the pandemic,” Mr. Rosengren said, noting
that “as borrowers and banks have become more familiar with the program,
we have seen a steady increase in banks submitting loans to our portal.”

The program now has $856 million in loans in some stage of the approval
process, he said, a pickup from the program’s slow start, but still a
fraction of its $600 billion capacity.

The Chinese internet giant **Tencent** on Wednesday said it believed
that [President Trump’s recent executive
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/business/economy/trump-executive-order-tiktok-wechat.html)
targeting its messaging app **WeChat** would not affect its other
businesses in the United States.

Tencent reported Wednesday that net profit [rose 37
percent](https://cdc-tencent-com-1258344706.image.myqcloud.com/uploads/2020/08/12/00e999c23314aa085c0b48c533d4d393.pdf)
for the second quarter. Revenue from online games jumped 40 percent as
the pandemic lockdowns kept people indoors.

The Aug. 6 order from the [White
House](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html)prohibits
Americans from making transactions with Tencent that are “related to
WeChat” starting late next month. But it does not specify which
transactions, saying only that the secretary of commerce would identify
them later.

The order sent Tencent’s shares tumbling last week. In the United
States, the company has a sprawling but low-profile presence that
includes the video game, entertainment and tech industries.

“Based on our initial reading and subsequent press reports, the
executive order is focused on WeChat in the United States and not our
other businesses in the U.S.,” John Lo, Tencent’s chief financial
officer, said in a call with analysts. “We are in the process of seeking
further clarification from relevant parties in the U.S.”

A ban on WeChat in the United States would cut off a key tool used
by[Chinese living
abroad](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/business/trump-china-wechat-tiktok.html)
to chat, swap videos and memes, and read the news. But its financial
impact on Tencent would be less significant, the company’s chief
strategy officer, James Mitchell, said on Wednesday’s call.

The United States represents less than 2 percent of Tencent’s global
revenue, Mr. Mitchell said. He also said that Tencent did not believe
that the White House order prevented American companies from advertising
on the company’s platforms in China. The order, he said, specifies that
it only affects transactions that are subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States.

The British economy sunk into its deepest recession on record in the
second quarter, taking it back to the size it was in 2003. Official
statistics showed [gross domestic product dropped by 20.4
percent](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/gdpfirstquarterlyestimateuk/apriltojune2020)
between April and June, compared with the previous quarter.

The pandemic-induced collapse was harsher in Britain than other large
economies in Europe and North America. The second-quarter fall in
economic output was twice as deep in Britain as in the United
States.

Britain has the challenge of getting out of a much deeper hole because
of the length of the lockdown imposed to restrict the spread of the
coronavirus. The Office for National Statistics said lockdown measures
were in place in Britain for a larger part of this three-month period
than they were for other economies. Britain was relatively slow in
introducing a national lockdown [compared with most of its European
neighbors](https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-coronavirus-lockdown-measures-compared/).
It started in earnest in late March and the government didn’t begin
lifting the broadest restrictions until mid-June. Its lockdowns also
affected a greater share of the population for a longer period of time
than the state-by-state shutdowns in the United States.

A monthly breakdown showed [the British economy did pick up in
June](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/gdpmonthlyestimateuk/june2020),
climbing 8.7 percent from May as construction activity resumed and
[consumer spending
rebounded.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/24/business/stock-market-updates-coronavirus#british-retail-sales-see-a-v-shaped-recovery-but-it-may-not-last)
Still, the Bank of England said last week it didn’t expect the recovery
to be [complete until the end
of 2021](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/business/britains-economy-wont-fully-recover-till-end-of-2021-its-central-bankers-said.html).

In an effort to keep the recovery from stalling, the government is
encouraging people to return to work in offices and it is planning for
schools to reopen next month. The Treasury also spent more than 53
million pounds ($69 million) last week as part of a stimulus plan paying
for discounts for meals eaten in restaurants and pubs on Mondays,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays this month.

The cost of Britain’s late and long lockdown in response to the pandemic
is [an economic recession deeper than any
other](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/12/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#britains-lockdown-recession-is-the-deepest-in-europe-and-north-america)
reported by a European and North American country in the second quarter.

The British economy contracted by a fifth in the second quarter,
compared with the first three months of the year. It’s the deepest
recession since the government started keeping such records, in
1955.

<div style="max-width:100%;margin:0 auto">

Some of the severity of Britain’s recession can be explained by the
economy’s high dependence on consumer spending, which was brought to a
near-standstill by the closure of shops, restaurants, and places like
movie theaters and hotels, according to Samuel Tombs, an economist at
Pantheon Macroeconomics.

But it was the government’s slow response to the pandemic in March which
led to a longer lockdown in the second quarter, that was “at the root of
the economy’s underperformance,” he wrote in a research note.

The nationwide lockdown began in late March and only started to be
lifted in mid-June.

By starting later — Britain’s pubs and restaurants were open a week or
more longer than those in other European countries — the virus had more
time to spread around the country, and so the lockdown needed to be
tighter and last longer. An[Oxford University index on the strictness of
government
responses](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker),
including school and workplace closures and travel bans, showed that
Britain’s lockdown was more strict in the second quarter than in Italy,
Germany, Spain and the United States.

A venture backed by the owner of **Barneys New York** has won a bid to
buy **[Brooks
Brothers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/business/brooks-brothers-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html)**,
America’s oldest apparel company, for $325 million.

**Sparc Group**, a venture including **Authentic Brands**, the new owner
of
[Barneys](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/01/business/barneys-bankruptcy-authentic-brands.html),
and **Simon Property**, the biggest mall operator in the United States,
will save at least 125 Brooks Brothers stores as part of the agreement.
Brooks Brothers, a 200-year-old men's wear retailer, filed for
bankruptcy protection last month. It has struggled with declining sales
in recent years as many in the corporate world have opted for a more
casual look.

The brand was among several high-profile retailers, including **[J.C.
Penney](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/business/jc-penney-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html)**,
**Neiman Marcus** and **J. Crew**, whose businesses were unable to
weather the sales slump resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.

A court hearing to approve the sale is scheduled for Friday, Brooks
Brothers in a statement on Tuesday, and the deal is expected to be
completed by the end of this month.

Authentic and Simon initially made a “stalking horse” offer of $305
million, setting a price floor for bids in the bankruptcy auction.

  - **United Airlines** said on Wednesday that it planned to add direct

    Boston, New York and Cleveland are planned starting in November,
    with routes from Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Columbus,
    Ohio, to be added in December, though United noted that the plans
    were “subject to change.” Massachusetts and New York currently
    require, and several other states recommend, those returning from
    Florida to quarantine for two weeks.

    though it sells far fewer vehicles than its industry peers.

  - The corporate restructuring at **WarnerMedia** continued with
    layoffs in its **DC Entertainment** division, home of DC Comics and
    the DC Universe streaming platform, part of an overhaul that will
    reduce head count by 600. Nearly 50 people at DC Comics were laid
    off, said two people with knowledge of the decision who spoke on
    condition of anonymity because it had not been announced publicly.
    DC Direct, the company’s division devoted to collectibles, will be

Sumner M. Redstone, the billionaire entrepreneur who saw business as
combat and his advancing years as no obstacle in building a media empire
that encompassed **CBS** and **Viacom**, [died on
Tuesday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/obituaries/sumner-redstone-dead.html).
He was 97.

His death was announced in a statement from **National Amusements**, the
private theater chain company founded by his father.

Mr. Redstone had vowed never to give up the reins of his sprawling
conglomerate, but in February 2016 he stepped away from managing it, and
his daughter, Shari E. Redstone, with whom he had a contentious
relationship, took control of day-to-day affairs.

Beginning with a modest chain of drive-in movie theaters, Mr. Redstone
negotiated, sued and otherwise fought to amass holdings that over time
included CBS, the **Paramount** film and television studios, the
publisher **Simon & Schuster**, the video retail giant **Blockbuster**
and a host of cable channels, including **MTV**, **Comedy Central** and
**Nickelodeon**. At their peak, the businesses he controlled were worth
more than $80 billion.

Toward the end of his life, he controlled about 80 percent of the voting
stock in Viacom and CBS, presiding over both through National
Amusements. And almost to the end, his grip was tight and his enthusiasm
undiminished.
