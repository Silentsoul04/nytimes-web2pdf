The S\&P 500 [climbed to a record on
Tuesday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-record.html),
reaching a level few would have predicted a few months ago, and defying
the economic storm facing the United States.

The index rose only slightly, but it was enough to eclipse a high
reached in February, before the fast-spreading virus set off a
staggering decline in stock prices.

The recovery has been fueled by trillions of dollars pumped into
financial markets by the Federal Reserve and enormous spending by the
government to protect American workers and businesses from the worst of
the downturn.

A run-up in shares of technology giants that, because of their sheer
size, hold sway over the entire market has also propelled the stock
index. Put together, these factors drove a recovery that was so quick
that the bear market — defined as a drop of more than 20 percent — that
began earlier this year turned out to be the shortest ever, according to
records going back to 1929.

The high on Tuesday comes despite the drastic economic toll of the
virus, which dragged the American economy into one of the steepest
downturns since the Great Depression, crushed corporate earnings and
sent unemployment soaring.

Investors have largely shrugged off such concerns, and focused instead
on economic updates that have not been quite as catastrophic as
expected.

Last week’s retail sales data showing that Americans kept shopping in
July, even as coronavirus infections continued to spread, was followed
on Tuesday by strong earnings reports from
**[Walmart](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/walmarts-e-commerce-sales-jump-by-97-percent)**
and **[Home
Depot](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/home-depot-reports-surge-in-second-quarter-sales)**.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction of new homes
in the United States surged nearly 23 percent in July, to the highest
annual pace since February.

That focus on the good news has helped lift the S\&P 500 by more than 50
percent from its low point in March.

Technology stocks have played a big role in those gains. Companies such
as **Apple**, **Alphabet** and **Microsoft** have attracted investors
despite the deep downturn in the United States, with buyers betting that
those companies are poised to thrive in a stay-at-home economy and
emerge from the crisis in an even stronger competitive position.

On Tuesday, **Amazon** was the best-performing stock in the S\&P 500,
rising 4 percent, with shares of a number of other technology companies
— including **Adobe** and **Salesforce** — also climbing.

Still, the march higher has also meant that investors have looked past a
number of risks that lie ahead. Most prominent among them this week is
the inability of lawmakers in Washington to reach a consensus about
another economic aid package.

Another is the latest escalation in tensions between the United States
and China. The Trump administration said Monday that it would restrict
the ability of the Chinese tech giant
**[Huawei](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/technology/trump-huawei-commerce-chips.html)**
to buy a wider array of chips made or designed with American equipment
and software.

The
[S\&P 500](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#sp-500-hits-a-record-as-traders-looks-past-economic-devastation)
closed at a record on Tuesday, a remarkable display of investor optimism
in the face of a still-shambolic American economy.

But aside from standing as testament to the sunny disposition of stock
market investors, the record high also confirms the transfer of power
from Wall Street’s pessimists — or “bears” — to the “bulls” who see more
gains ahead.  
  
Simply put, the record on Tuesday confirms that American investors are
in a bull market again. We say ‘confirmed’ because the start of the bull
market is actually traced back to when stocks hit rock bottom — which
means it has been going on since March.

There’s no science behind the system for determining the start or end of
a bull or bear market. It’s just tradition.

By that tradition, [entry into a bear
market](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/11/business/bear-market-stocks-dow.html)
is confirmed once stocks have fallen 20 percent from their high. That
happened in mid-March, after the market crashed as the coronavirus
crisis slammed the United States.

A bull market has its own criteria. Even though stocks were already up
more than 50 percent from their lowest point (hit on March 23), some
market traditionalists say that the bull market is only confirmed once
stocks close at a record. That’s what just happened.

Why does any of this matter? Because markets often operate as something
of an experiment in mass psychology. There’s a symbolic value to whether
commentators, the news media and even the president are able to describe
the context of the market as good or bad.

The last bull market grew out of the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis,
with the S\&P 500 beginning its run in March 2009, and rising more than
300 percent in almost 11 years.  
  
That doesn’t mean the current bull market will last as long. The last
one was about twice as long as usual. But this one is just getting
started.

In a sign that the airline recovery will be long and painful,
**Boeing’s** chief executive said on Monday that the company would
offer a second round of buyouts, adding to the 10 percent cut the
company [announced in
April](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/business/boeing-layoffs-coronavirus.html).

“I truly wish the current market demand could support the size of our
work force,” the chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said in a memo to staff.
“Unfortunately, layoffs are a hard but necessary step to align to our
new reality, preserve liquidity and position ourselves for the eventual
return to growth.”

Mr. Calhoun did not specify how many jobs Boeing was hoping to cut. The
new buyouts will help limit involuntary layoffs and will be offered to
employees who work in parts of the company most affected by the
pandemic, like Boeing’s commercial airplane and services businesses.
Fewer employees who work on Boeing’s defense, space and government
services businesses will be eligible, Mr. Calhoun said.

While recent federal data shows air travel is recovering again after
stalling in July, the number of people flying each day is still less
than a third of what it was a year ago. Industry executives expect that
figure to remain depressed until a coronavirus vaccine is widely
available.

**Walmart’s** business continued to boom in the second quarter, as sales
rose 9.3 percent, driven by continuing strong demand for food and
general merchandise during the pandemic and huge growth in its
e-commerce business.

The company said Tuesday that its revenues were up 5.6 percent to $137.7
billion from a year ago, while e-commerce sales grew 97 percent, more
than double what the company had been averaging in recent years.

Despite rising costs related to the pandemic, Walmart, the nation’s
largest retailer, also managed to generate larger-than-expected profit.
It earned $1.56 per share, far exceeding the $1.25 that Wall Street
analysts had predicted.

Walmart’s strong results reflect how a few large retailers have been
able to capitalize on the surge in demand for food and necessary items
by Americans hunkered down at home. Walmart’s success, while many other
retailers have struggled or failed in recent months, shows the
consolidation in the retail industry has been compounded by the
pandemic.

The company noted that stimulus money helped boost sales of general
merchandise, making it uncertain if Walmart and other large retailers
will be able to keep up the sales growth in the coming months if
policymakers do not restore the benefits that expired at the end of
July.

In a statement Tuesday morning, Walmart’s chief executive, Doug
McMillon, thanked the company’s employees “for their tireless efforts
during these unprecedented times,’’ adding that “we also appreciate the
trust and confidence of our customers.”

Same-store sales at **Home Depot** soared more than 23 percent in the
quarter from May to July, as Americans across the country tackled home
improvement projects while housebound during the coronavirus pandemic.

The company also saw an increase in profits, earning $4.3 billion in the
second quarter compared with $3.5 billion during the same period last
year.

“The investments we have made across the business have significantly
increased our agility, allowing us to respond quickly to changes while
continuing to promote a safe operating environment,” said Home Depot’s
chief executive, Craig Menear, in a
[statement](https://corporate.homedepot.com/newsroom/news-release-home-depot-announces-second-quarter-2020-results).

The company invested approximately $480 million in additional benefits
for employees during the second quarter, including weekly bonuses for
hourly workers in stores and distribution centers. The company has spent
$1.3 billion on enhanced pay and benefits so far this year, it reported.

    [according](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/technology/uber-lyft-franchise-california.html)
    to three people with knowledge of the plans. The change would
    resemble an independently operated franchise, allowing Uber and Lyft

[Mario
Draghi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/24/business/mario-draghi-ecb.html),
the former president of the **[European Central
Bank](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/european-central-bank)**,
warned Tuesday that the pandemic “threatens to undermine the fabric of
our society as we know it,” with a particularly devastating impact on
young people whose ability to acquire skills and experience has been
derailed.

Mr. Draghi, 72, who had been keeping a low profile since his term as the
central bank’s president ended last year, called for more investment in
education to compensate for the disruption the pandemic has caused for
schools and universities.

Otherwise, he told an audience in Rimini, Italy, young people “will be
left with a lack of professional qualifications and experience,
compromising both their freedom of choice and their earning potential
later in life.”

“The [debt created by the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/business/europe-coronavirus-economic-support.html)
is unprecedented and will have to be repaid mainly by those who are
young today,” Mr. Draghi said. “It is therefore our duty to equip them
with the means to service that debt, and to do so while living in
improved societies.”

**Marks & Spencer**, the British department store and food retailer,
announced plans on Tuesday to cut 7,000 jobs in the next three months,
or nearly 10 percent of its work force. The staff reductions will be in
stores, its central office and across regional management.

The pandemic has dealt a deep blow to many of Britain’s most well-known
retail brands, including **Boots**, **John Lewis** and **Debenhams**,
which have also announced [thousands of
layoffs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53348519)and store closures
in recent weeks.

Just four weeks ago, M & S said it expected to cut 950 jobs. The
acceleration and expansion of its restructuring plans comes as[many
retail areas have
struggled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/business/britain-economic-comeback-suburbs.html)to
attract shoppers even as social-distancing measures have eased in
Britain. According to Springboard data on retail activity, foot traffic
on high streets and shopping centers is still down by more than a third
compared to last year. Central London and other regional cities also
have far fewer shoppers than market towns or suburban locations.

In [a trading
update](https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/media/press-releases/5e0f046f7880b21924350282/marks-and-spencer-group-plc-trading-update-and-streamlining-announcement)
on Tuesday, the Marks and Spencer Group said food sales over the last
three-month period were up 2.5 percent compared with the same period
last year, while clothing and home sales were down 38.5 percent. Overall
revenue for the whole company was still lower than last year, even
though online sales had risen by more than 40 percent.

Despite being an iconic British retailer, [M & S has been struggling for
years.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/02/business/marks-spencer-faded-glory.html)
In 2018, the company said it planned to close 100 stores by 2022. It has
spent the past few years moving away from clothing and home goods and
promoting its food business, while also trying to get more of its
products online. The company’s share price has dropped 78 percent in the
past five years.

With more than 400 shops, the **Singapore Changi Airport** would be the
fourth-largest mall by the number of tenants if it were in the United
States.

The combination of an often affluent and captive audience has made
airport commercial square footage some of the most lucrative in the
world. But the pandemic has [crushed the commercial calculus at
airports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/business/airport-remodeling-coronavirus-safety.html),
and no one is sure what comes next.

The leading airport for concession and retail sales in the United States
is **Los Angeles International**, with revenue of $3,036 a square foot,
according to a 2018 report from Airport Experience News. By comparison,
the average mall retailer is around $325 per square foot, according to
2017 data from CoStar.

But that’s all gone now, said Alan Gluck, a senior aviation consultant
at ICF. “In general, sales are in the toilet,” he said.

The very amenities that once made airports a standout for profit are the
same things that are proving to be challenging.

So far, the pandemic has not paused terminals planned or in progress in
the United States. Projects already underway, including
[at](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/nyregion/new-la-guardia-airport-terminal.html)**[La
Guardia
Airport](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/nyregion/new-la-guardia-airport-terminal.html)**
in New York and in smaller markets like Lafayette, La., are moving
ahead, but taking a wait-and-see approach on adjustments.

New terminal construction should focus on space not just for the
coronavirus but other respiratory illnesses, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,
the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.

New terminals needed to allow enough space for people to spread out,
offer high-efficiency particulate air filtration and distribute free
masks. He would also like to see more health screening at airports.

“You can’t throw up your hands and say it is impossible,” Dr. Fauci
said.
