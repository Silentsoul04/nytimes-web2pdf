[Democrats formally nominated Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/roll-call-pass-dnc.html)
for the presidency on Tuesday night, anointing him as their
standard-bearer against President Trump with an extraordinary virtual
roll call vote that showcased the cultural diversity of their coalition
and exposed a generational gulf that is increasingly defining the party.

Denied the chance to assemble in Milwaukee, Democratic activists and
dignitaries cast their votes from locations across all 50 states and
from the American territories and the District of Columbia; from the
Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., to the iconic welcome sign in Las
Vegas; and far beyond to the shores of Guam, “where America’s day
begins.” They offered a grand mosaic of personal identities and
experiences, many speaking in raw terms about their personal aspirations
and adversities.

The second night of the Democratic National Convention straddled themes
of national security, presidential accountability and continuity between
the past and future leaders of the party. Like the opening night on
Monday, it took the form of a kind of political variety show. Hosted by
the actress Tracee Ellis Ross, the program skipped between recorded
tributes from political luminaries, personal testimonials from activists
and voters, and various forms of music and entertainment.

Two tributes by Republicans carried particular symbolic weight for a
Democratic candidate seeking to appeal across party lines: Colin Powell,
the retired general and former secretary of state in the George W. Bush
administration, delivered a message of support for Mr. Biden, whom he
had previously endorsed. And Cindy McCain, the widow of Senator John
McCain, appeared in a video about Mr. Biden’s relationship with her
husband.

By voting to nominate Mr. Biden, Democrats delivered to the former vice
president a prize he has pursued intermittently since before the night’s
most prominent young speaker, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
was born. Two previous presidential campaigns ended in abrupt defeat: A
plagiarism scandal extinguished his hopes in 1988, and his next effort
in 2008 fizzled against the higher-wattage candidacies of Hillary
Clinton and former President Barack Obama.

When Mr. Biden opted not to run for president in 2016, it was widely
assumed that his dream of the Oval Office was finished. Instead, Mr.
Biden’s long-awaited victory is a triumph of personal and political
endurance, representing the apex — so far — of a slow upward climb by a
man who entered the Senate in 1972 at the age of 30 as a grieving single
father. No other presidential candidate in modern times has endured such
a long interval between assuming a first major office and being
nominated for the presidency.

The Tuesday night speaking lineup for the Democratic convention was
always intended as a muscular contrast on foreign policy and diplomatic
integrity, presented to viewers under the evening’s unsubtle theme:
“Leadership Matters.”

There were two former commanders in chief, Bill Clinton and Jimmy
Carter, and a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs turned chief diplomat:
Colin Powell. There was Sally Q. Yates, the former deputy attorney
general.

John Kerry, the former secretary of state who negotiated the Iran deal
that Mr. Trump decimated, said that “America deserves a president who is
looked up to, not laughed at.”

Earlier in the day, he sent a fund-raising email saying that Mr. Biden
could “begin the hard work of putting back together the pieces of what
Donald Trump has smashed apart.”

But putting back the pieces is probably not a feasible option:

The relationship with China has turned poisonous. Mr. Biden’s party,
still reeling from Russia’s election interference in 2016, has become
more hawkish on dealing with Moscow than Republicans who once cast
themselves as the party of national security. North Korea has turned a
project to build a few bombs into an arsenal that rivals India’s and
Pakistan’s, and reconstituting the Iran deal, if that is even possible,
is unlikely to change the fundamental tensions dividing the Middle East.

Mr. Biden has offered few detailed policy plans to address how he would
tackle this very changed world. Instead the broad message of the virtual
convention came down to this: Trust a man who ran the Foreign Relations
Committee, who participated in the decisions to take out Osama bin Laden
with a commando strike and Iran’s nuclear centrifuges with a cyber
strike, and who would arrive at the White House with an experienced
team.

To Mr. Trump and his supporters, that is Mr. Biden’s vulnerability. They
say he stands for the establishment foreign policy that the current
administration took office to destroy.

Mr. Biden, in turn, is arguing that Mr. Trump has allowed adversaries to
undercut American interests, coddling strongmen, heartening the Russians
and cutting deals for his friends.

[Jill
Biden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/jill-biden-dnc-speech.html),
who as second lady of the United States taught English at a community
college throughout her time in the administration, returned to a
classroom to give her convention speech on Tuesday.

Dr. Biden spoke from Brandywine High School in Wilmington, Del., where
she taught English in the early 1990s. She spoke from
[Room 232](https://twitter.com/DrBiden/status/1295694942141067269), her
former classroom.

“You can hear the anxiety that echoes down empty hallways,” Dr. Biden
said. “There’s no scent of new notebooks or freshly waxed floors. The
rooms are dark as the bright young faces that should fill them are now
confined to boxes on a computer screen.”

Dr. Biden expressed heartache over the losses from the coronavirus, as
well as the frustration and fear it was inspiring among parents of
schoolchildren. “Like so many of you, I’m left asking, ‘How do I keep my
family safe?’” she said.

Dr. Biden’s convention speech focused in large measure on loss —
something that has deeply affected her husband, Joseph R. Biden Jr., in
different chapters of his life.

She recalled her early days with Mr. Biden, in the years after his first
wife and daughter were killed in a car accident.

“How do you make a broken family whole?” she asked. “The same way you
make a nation whole. With love and understanding, and with small acts of
kindness. With bravery. With unwavering faith.”

And she recalled how Mr. Biden pressed on after the death of their son
Beau Biden
[in 2015](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/05/31/us/politics/joseph-r-biden-iii-vice-presidents-son-beau-dies-at-46.html).
At the time, she said, “I wondered if I would ever smile or feel joy
again.” But her husband went back to work.

“Joe’s purpose has always driven him forward,” Dr. Biden said. “His
strength of will is unstoppable. And his faith is unshakable, because
it’s not in politicians or political parties or even in himself. It’s
in the providence of God. His faith is in you — in us.”

Dr. Biden, who married Mr. Biden in 1977, was once a reluctant political
spouse. But this campaign season, she emerged as one of her husband’s
[most prolific
surrogates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/us/politics/joe-jill-biden-2020.html),
maintaining public campaign schedules at a pace that sometimes surpassed
Mr. Biden’s during the in-person days on the trail early this year, and
serving as a critical adviser.

When Dr. Biden finished speaking, Mr. Biden greeted her with a hug.

“Hey, everyone, I’m Jill Biden’s husband,” he said. “You can see why
she’s the love of my life and the rock of our family.”

Cindy McCain, the widow of Senator John McCain, lent her voice to a
video that aired as part of the Democratic National Convention on
Tuesday — another nod to Republican voters who may be willing to cross
party lines and support Joseph R. Biden Jr.

The video recounted the longtime friendship between Mr. Biden, a former
Delaware senator, and Mr. McCain, who represented Arizona until [his
death
in 2018](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/25/obituaries/john-mccain-dead.html).

“They would just sit and joke,” Mrs. McCain said in the video. “It was
like a comedy show sometimes to watch the two of them.”

The video described how Mr. Biden forged relationships with his Senate
colleagues over the course of his career. Mrs. McCain called it “a style
of legislating and leadership that you don’t find much anymore.”

Mrs. McCain did not explicitly endorse Mr. Biden in the video. Earlier
on Tuesday, she [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/cindymccain/status/1295845241841360897):
“My husband and Vice President Biden enjoyed a 30+ year friendship
dating back to before their years serving together in the Senate, so I
was honored to accept the invitation from the Biden campaign to
participate in a video celebrating their relationship.”

Tuesday was the second consecutive night in which the convention
featured programming that could appeal to disaffected Republican voters.
Monday night’s proceedings included remarks from several notable
Republican figures, including former Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio. Colin
Powell, a former secretary of state in the George W. Bush
administration, also appeared on Tuesday.

Mr. Biden and Mr. McCain faced each other on opposing tickets in 2008,
when Mr. McCain was the Republican presidential nominee and Mr. Biden
was Barack Obama’s running mate on the Democratic ticket.

Mr. McCain later would come under attack from President Trump, who as a
presidential candidate in 2015 [disparaged Mr. McCain’s Vietnam War
service](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/19/us/politics/trump-belittles-mccains-war-record.html).
Mr. Trump [continued attacking
him](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/20/us/politics/trump-john-mccain.html)
even after his death.

Colin Powell, a former secretary of state in the George W. Bush
administration, gave a message of support for Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the
Democratic convention on Tuesday night. It was his third consecutive
Democratic presidential endorsement but his first appearance at one of
the party’s national conventions.

Mr. Powell, who had previously said he would vote for Mr. Biden, said in
his convention remarks that the country needed a “commander in chief who
takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family. For
Joe Biden, that doesn’t need teaching. It comes from the experience he
shares with millions of families sending his beloved son off to war.”

Mr. Powell said Mr. Biden would be a president “who unites us”
domestically and would restore American alliances abroad. Drawing a
contrast with President Trump, Mr. Powell said that Mr. Biden would not
be swayed by “the flattery of dictators and despots.”

Shortly before Mr. Powell spoke, another former secretary of state, John
Kerry, had even harsher words for Mr. Trump and his leadership at the
White House, invoking a recent episode that Mr. Trump has been sensitive
about, when he was [briefly whisked to the
basement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html)
for his safety.

“Our troops can’t get out of harm’s way by hiding in a White House
bunker,” said Mr. Kerry, the Democrats’ 2004 presidential nominee. He
called Mr. Trump’s trips overseas “blooper reels.”

Mr. Kerry, who helped orchestrate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Mr.
Trump has abandoned, said that by contrast, Mr. Biden “knows that even
the United States of America needs friends on this planet.”

Mr. Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, joined a group of national
security officials who offered pretaped testimonials, a group that
included Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, and former
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who accused Mr. Trump of “dereliction of
duty” for failing to ask President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about
reports that Moscow had placed bounties on American troops in
Afghanistan.

Mr. Powell, a retired general who served as Ronald Reagan’s national
security adviser and then as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was
once regarded as the future of the Republican Party and contemplated
running against Bill Clinton in the 1996 election. Though he is a figure
of the political past at this point — Mr. Powell is 83 — he may carry a
certain moral weight in addressing moderate voters and others who feel
alienated from a party they once called home.

Mr. Powell endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and Hillary Clinton
in 2016.

In a convention heavily focused on racial justice and increasing
minority representation in government, it is also notable that Mr.
Powell, the Harlem-born son of Jamaican immigrants, broke several tall
racial barriers as a Republican appointee. He was the first Black person
to hold every top office he occupied: national security adviser, Joint
Chiefs chairman and secretary of state.

His appearance — like that of another Republican, [former Gov. John R.
Kasich of
Ohio](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/politics/john-kasich-biden.html),
on Monday — is eased by a virtual convention that lacks a Democratic
audience that might otherwise be inclined to jeer a former senior Bush
administration official who helped make the case for war in Iraq in
2003.

who became a champion for single-payer health care after receiving a

Convention.</span>](https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/09/18/autossell/Screen-Shot-2020-08-19-at-12/Screen-Shot-2020-08-19-at-12-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png)

[Ady
Barkan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/ady-barkan-biden-democrats.html),
the well-known progressive activist and supporter of “Medicare for all,”
put a spotlight on the critical issue of health care on Tuesday night,
addressing a subject that Democrats are likely to talk about up and down
the ballot this fall.

“Even during this terrible crisis, Donald Trump and Republican
politicians are trying to take away millions of people’s health
insurance,” Mr. Barkan said. “With the existential threat of another
four years of this president, we all have a profound obligation to act,
not only to vote, but to make sure that our friends, family and
neighbors vote as well.”

Mr. Barkan, who has A.L.S. and spoke through a computerized voice,
appeared as part of a portion of the evening focused on health care, an
issue that was a critical advantage for Democrats in the 2018 midterm
elections and is sure to play an important role this fall as well.

Mr. Biden has campaigned on expanding health coverage under the
Affordable Care Act, the signature domestic achievement of the Obama
presidency. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans sought to repeal the
health law in 2017 but failed, and the Trump administration is now
asking the Supreme Court [to overturn the
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html).

Mr. Barkan took a while to come around to supporting Mr. Biden,
mirroring the political journey of many other progressives. Before
making an endorsement in the Democratic primary, Mr. Barkan said he
wanted the nominee to be [“someone other than
Biden.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/19/us/ady-barkan-activist-medicare.html)
He eventually endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and
then he backed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Both candidates
supported Medicare for all, unlike Mr. Biden.

But Mr. Biden emerged as the presumptive nominee, and Mr. Barkan
[endorsed him in
July](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/us/politics/ady-barkan-biden-endorsement.html),
providing a boost to Mr. Biden as he seeks to improve his popularity
among progressive voters who were not initially drawn to his candidacy.

In his remarks at the convention, Mr. Barkan described the existing
health care system as falling far short of what Americans deserve,
calling it “fundamentally broken.”

“We live in the richest country in history and yet we do not guarantee
this most basic human right,” he said. “Everyone living in America
should get the health care they need, regardless of their employment
status or ability to pay.”

And Mr. Barkan called for the election of Mr. Biden while also urging
legislative action once he is in office.

“With a compassionate and intelligent president,” Mr. Barkan said, “we
must act together and put on his desk a bill that guarantees us all the
health care we deserve.”

Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware is now the Democratic Party’s 2020
presidential nominee.

Mr. Biden, 77, reached the nomination threshold of 1,991 votes around
10:20 p.m. Eastern, when the delegation from his home state delivered
all of its 32 votes to him.

The camera flashed to a grinning Mr. Biden, who plucked off his mask and
rose from his seat in a school library where his wife, Jill, was to
deliver a speech later Tuesday night.

“Thank you from the bottom of my heart,” he said.

The roll call vote, the central event of the national convention, was
drastically revamped to accommodate the constraints imposed by the
coronavirus pandemic. This year, it consisted of a series of pretaped
recordings of delegates listing their vote tallies, replacing the iconic
and photogenic ritual of delegates shouting their state’s numbers into a
hand-held microphone.

<div class="css-nj25e3">

</div>

One big plus: Most of the pretaped segments were filmed outside — on a
beach in California, at a firehouse in Connecticut, atop a train
platform (where else?) in Delaware — bringing air, sunshine, surf and
chirping crickets to a convention for which many speeches have been
filmed indoors.

A handful of the delegates who called the roll for Mr. Biden were well
known.

Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father and immigrant who spoke out about
President Trump’s immigration policies at the 2016 Democratic
convention, represented Virginia and accused the president of standing
up for “white supremacists” during the 2017 unrest in Charlottesville,
Va.

Mayor Muriel Bowser, who oversaw the painting of “Black Lives Matter”
near the White House after federal law enforcement officials violently
disrupted a peaceful protest, represented Washington, D.C.

Jamie Harrison, who is mounting a strong challenge to Senator Lindsey
Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a strong Trump ally, announced
the Palmetto’s State’s votes for Mr. Biden.

Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, stood in front of Mr.
Biden’s childhood home in Scranton as he announced that the state had
delivered 175 delegate votes to the former vice president.

Both Mr. Biden and the runner-up, Senator Bernie Sanders, were
nominated.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, had the
official role of putting the name of the 2020 runner-up, Senator Bernie
Sanders, up for the nomination on Tuesday. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a
first-term member of Congress, summed up the scope of the progressive
movement and goals along the way.

Some progressives were frustrated that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, one of the
party’s rising stars, was granted only a one-minute speaking slot, but
she packed a lot into her just over 90 seconds.

She railed against the “unsustainable brutality of an economy that
rewards explosive inequalities of wealth.” She highlighted the central
causes that Mr. Sanders had pushed, including “guaranteed health care,
higher education, living wages and labor rights for all people.” And she
frontally addressed the need to “to recognize and repair the wounds of
racial injustice, colonization, misogyny and homophobia.”

<div>

</div>

She added five words in Spanish as she called to reimagine immigration
and foreign policy policies to “turn away from the violence and
xenophobia of our past.”

Two words that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did not say: “Joe Biden.” She explained
that to her big audience on social media soon after.

</div>

Before her appearance, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had mocked Republican critics
who had tried to make hay of her short slot.

“If I can regularly roast Trump sycophants in 280 characters or less, I
can speak to progressive values in 60 secs (& maybe filibuster a few
extra ),” she
[wrote](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1295791805867360256) to Bobby
Jindal, the former Republican governor of Louisiana, earlier on Tuesday.

It was an accidental viral moment for Joseph R. Biden Jr., at a time
when his quest for the Democratic nomination seemed to be flagging. En
route to an interview last year with the editorial board of The New York
Times, Mr. Biden found himself in an elevator with [Jacquelyn,
a 31-year-old security
guard](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/nyt-security-guard-joe-biden-nomination.html)
who shyly admitted she was star-struck.

“I love you,” Jacquelyn told the former vice president. “I do. You’re
like my favorite.” Mr. Biden, smiling, asked if she had a camera. The
two posed for a selfie on her smartphone.

It was a fleeting exchange that happened to be captured by a film crew
for “The Weekly,” an FX show produced in collaboration with The Times.
Mr. Biden did not receive [the paper’s
endorsement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/19/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-elizabeth-warren-new-york-times-endorsement.html)
during the Democratic primary — that went to Senators Amy Klobuchar and
Elizabeth Warren — but his easy rapport with Jacquelyn struck a chord on
social media.

</div>

On Tuesday night, Jacquelyn made a more deliberate appearance before a
national TV audience. The Biden campaign selected her as the first
person to enter Mr. Biden’s name into nomination for president at the
Democratic National Convention. She spoke before the start of the roll
call vote.

“I take powerful people up on my elevator all the time,” Jacquelyn said.
“When they get off, they go to their important meetings. Me? I just head
back to the lobby. But in the short time I spent with Joe Biden, I could
tell he really saw me, that he actually cared, that my life meant
something to him.”

Her role on Tuesday was an honor that dovetailed with some of the themes
the Biden team is keen to promote this week, including his support among
working Americans and Black women in particular. And her appearance nods
to what advisers believe is Mr. Biden’s chief political strength, a
sense of empathy and ease with Americans from many walks of life.

Jacquelyn is employed by The Times as a security guard. She has no role
in the newspaper’s journalism **** or editorial page, and she is not
bound by rules that prohibit many of the company’s employees from
engaging in political activity.

For Jacquelyn, who Biden aides said was declining to make her last name
public, the Tuesday cameo will be the culmination of an unusual and
unexpected role in a national campaign.

“I never thought I would be in a position to do this,” [she told The
Washington

Bill Clinton, once the Democratic Party’s charismatic headliner and
centrist standard-bearer, played a decidedly supporting role on Tuesday
night, offering a stinging rebuke of the “chaos” President Trump has
brought to the office he held from 1992 to 2000.

Mr. Clinton jokingly urged voters to support Mr. Trump if “you want a
president who defines the job as spending hours a day watching TV and
zapping people on social media.”

The former president accused Mr. Trump of downplaying the [coronavirus
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus), and
of collapsing under the pressure of a real management challenge.

“At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command center,” said
Mr. Clinton, 74, speaking from his mansion in the northern suburbs of
New York City. “Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos. Just
one thing never changes — his determination to deny responsibility and
shift the blame. The buck never stops there.”

Mr. Clinton — the last president to be impeached before Mr. Trump —
described Mr. Biden as “a go-to-work president. A down-to-earth,
get-the-job-done guy.”

The pandemic-imposed time constraints demanded by the crammed virtual
format of the convention pulled off a feat planners of the event have
been unable to accomplish in nearly three decades. Mr. Clinton spoke for
only a few minutes.

His introduction of President Barack Obama at the 2012 convention in
Charlotte, N.C., [clocked in at 48

Every living past Democratic president is set to speak at the Democratic
National Convention this week. That makes for a sharp and intentional
contrast with next week’s Republican gathering, where the party’s last
living president, George W. Bush, is not expected to appear and its last
presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, voted to impeach President Trump this
year.

The first of three former presidents to speak was a 95-year-old Jimmy
Carter, who testified that Mr. Biden has the “experience, character, and
decency to bring us together and restore America’s greatness.” His wife,
Rosalynn Carter, also spoke.

The Carters did not appear on camera but voiced their support for Mr.
Biden over a montage of images.

Mr. Carter praised Mr. Biden as a loyal supporter of his in the Senate
in the late 1970s — a sign of the longevity of Mr. Biden’s decades-long
career.

“Joe Biden must be our next president,” he said.

Immediately before Mr. Carter were two links to Democratic presidential
lineage: Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy,
and Jack Schlossberg, Mr. Kennedy’s grandson.

The cumulative message was an unmistakable effort to cast Mr. Biden as
firmly in the Democratic mainstream, while some Republican defectors —
Cindy McCain, John Kasich and Colin Powell — made the case that Mr.
Trump falls well outside the G.O.P. tradition.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, offered a blunt
message to viewers on Tuesday night: “America, Donald Trump has quit on
you.”

Mr. Schumer addressed the convention with less than three months until
November’s elections, when the Democratic Party hopes to win control of
the Senate, where Republicans currently hold 53 seats.

“If we’re going to win this battle for the soul of our nation, Joe can’t
do it alone,” Mr. Schumer said, standing with the Statue of Liberty
behind him. “Democrats must take back the Senate. We will stay united,
from Sanders and Warren to Manchin and Warner. And with our unity, we
will bring bold and dramatic change to our country.”

Mr. Schumer was referring to four members of the Democratic caucus from
opposite wings of the party: two well-known progressives, Senators
Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and two
moderates, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Mark Warner of
Virginia.

If Joseph R. Biden Jr. wins the presidency, the fate of the Senate will
have a big effect on his legislative prospects. He would face a much
more challenging landscape if Republicans managed to hold on to the
chamber. But Democrats have appeared in increasingly strong position,
[in part because of President Trump’s
unpopularity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/politics/trump-senate-republicans-poll.html).

Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired by
President Trump in his first month on the job for refusing to enforce a
travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, became the first of many
so-called \#resistance heroes on the left in the Trump era.

On Tuesday, as a speaker on the second night of the Democratic National
Convention, she pressed the case that Mr. Trump, who has fashioned
himself as a “law and order” president, has instead “trampled the rule
of law, trying to weaponize our Justice Department to attack his enemies
and protect his friends.”

She called his Muslim ban “shameful and unlawful.”

“Speaking at a political convention is something I never expected to be
doing, but our democracy is at stake,” Ms. Yates said, attacking Mr.
Trump for fawning over President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, for trying
to “sabotage” the Postal Service and for undermining the F.B.I. and a
free press.

She said these types of moves “all have one purpose: to remove any check
on his abuse of power. Put simply, he treats our country like it’s his
family business. This time, bankrupting our nation’s moral authority at
home and abroad.”

Ms. Yates spoke for less than five minutes, but she presented herself
and other civil servants who have served in the federal government as
under attack from a rogue president who has “used his position to
benefit himself rather than our country.”

Ms. Yates, who was born in Georgia, has been talked about as a potential
candidate in that increasingly swing state but she has so far opted
against running for office.

The actress Tracee Ellis Ross, 47, who has won a Golden Globe Award for
her role on “Black-ish” and [moderated a book tour for the former first
lady Michelle
Obama](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/20/books/michelle-obama-tracee-ellis-ross-interview.html)
in 2018, is the M.C. of the virtual convention on Tuesday.

“As a Black woman, I find myself at a crucial intersection in American
politics,” Ms. Ross said. “For far too long Black female leadership in
this country has been utilized without being acknowledged or valued.”

The selection of Kamala Harris as Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate has
started to change all that, she added.

“Hello, Kamala,” Ms. Ross said with a smile.

She was preceded by Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, who invited
Democrats to come to his city after the coronavirus crisis had passed.
“Unlike the president, we never made fun of face masks,” he said. “We
understand why we can’t be together this week, and we hope you do too.”

The producers of “Black-ish” recently aired a 2018 episode in which the
show’s characters discuss their alarm at the state of the country under
President Trump. ABC, which airs the program, had been concerned the
episode’s content was too political,

The actress and activist Eva Longoria hosted Monday night’s two-hour
convention schedule; Kerry Washington will M.C. on Wednesday and Julia
Louis-Dreyfus will do so on Thursday.

depiction of a tale of two
cities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1984/07/17/us/transcript-of-keynote-address-by-cuomo-to-the-convention.html)
in 1984. Ann Richards [brought down the

Bush](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/07/19/us/transcript-of-the-keynote-address-by-ann-richards-the-texas-treasurer.html):
“Poor George, he can’t help it. He was born with a silver foot in his
mouth.” Barack Obama [launched himself toward the White
House](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/27/magazine/the-speech-that-made-obama.html)
in 2004 with his stirring account of “the hope of a skinny kid with a
funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.”

But in this year’s Democratic National Convention, there was not — for
the first time in memory — a single keynote speaker handed the
opportunity to capture the imagination of delegates and viewers at home.

Instead of designating a star for the party’s future, the Democrats
assembled a mash-up of 17 of the “next generation of party leaders” to
speak via video montage Tuesday night.

The list of speakers included Stacey Abrams of Georgia, who [considered
a 2020 presidential
run](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/13/us/politics/stacey-abrams-fair-fight-2020.html)
herself after falling short in a bid to win her state’s governorship in
2018; three members of Congress; eight state legislators; two mayors;
Jonathan Nez, the president of the Navajo Nation; and Nikki Fried,
Florida’s agriculture commissioner — the only Democrat elected to
statewide office in the critical battleground state.

One after another, speaking in short snippets, they offered a volley of
criticism aimed at President Trump and talked up Joseph R. Biden Jr.

“You deserve more than the constant chaos that Donald Trump delivers,”
said Mayor Robert Garcia of Long Beach, Calif.

Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania added: “Take it from me. When
you’re in the trenches, you want Joe Biden right there next to you.”

Ms. Abrams offered closing remarks, saying that Mr. Biden would be “a
champion for free and fair elections.”

“Our choice is clear,” she said. “A steady, experienced public servant
who can lead us out of this crisis just like he’s done before. Or a man
who only knows how to deny and distract. A leader who cares about our
families, or a president who only cares about himself.”

She added, “Faced with a president of cowardice, Joe Biden is a man of
proven courage.”
