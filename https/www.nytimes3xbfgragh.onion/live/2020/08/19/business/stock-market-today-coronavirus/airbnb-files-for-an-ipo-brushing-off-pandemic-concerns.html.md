**Airbnb** said on Wednesday that it had confidentially filed to go
public, taking a key step toward one of the largest public market debuts
in a generation of “sharing economy” start-ups.

A public offering by the company, which lets people rent out their spare
rooms or homes to travelers, would cap a volatile year in which its
business was devastated by the spread of the coronavirus.

Airbnb had been privately valued at $31 billion before this year, and
the company must now convince investors that it can thrive and turn a
profit in a new era of limited travel.

Airbnb declined to comment beyond its
[announcement](https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement/).

In recent years, other so-called unicorns, the name given to start-ups
valued at $1 billion or more, have ridden a wave of growth fueled by
smartphones, gig work and copious amounts of venture capital.

  - **Uber** and **Lyft** went public

  - **Postmates** sold itself

  - **WeWork** collapsed spectacularly

Why this is a good time for Airbnb to pursue I.P.O.:

> Its debut will most likely be helped by an ebullient stock market,
> which has remained robust despite the economic destruction caused by
> the pandemic. On Tuesday, the S\&P 500 hit [a new

The stock market may have [broken through its old
high](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-record.html),
as if the coronavirus pandemic never happened, but officials at the
Federal Reserve are still worried about the economy.

When they met in late July, the central bank’s policymakers discussed
the need for continuing economic support with millions of workers still
at home, minutes from the central bank’s [July 28-29
meeting](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)
showed.

“Uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook remained very elevated,
with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus
and the public sector’s response to it,” the minutes say.

That July meeting came just before key government support programs
lapsed, including enhanced unemployment benefits. Officials pointed out
that monetary policy and “particularly fiscal policy” — in other words,
congressionally mandated spending — would play important roles in
supporting business activity.

With some stimulus provisions “set to expire shortly against the
backdrop of a still-weak labor market, additional fiscal aid would
likely be important for supporting vulnerable families, and thus the
economy more broadly, in the period ahead,” a number of participants
said, according to the minutes.

For now, Washington is deadlocked over any new spending. Senate
Republicans began [circulating the
text](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/republicans-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html)
of a narrow coronavirus relief package on Tuesday, but it is unlikely
that Democrats will sign on.

The Fed has taken actions to support the economy. Its policies can set
the backdrop for growth to make it cheap to borrow and spend, but they
do not directly put money in consumers’ and companies’ pockets.

Shares of the **Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company** fell as much as 4
percent on Wednesday, after President Trump called on his supporters to
boycott the Ohio-based company because of its policy on political attire
in the workplace.

“Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS,” Mr.
Trump
[wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1296092859226042368?s=20)
on Twitter on Wednesday, referring to his “Make America Great Again”
campaign slogan.

Mr. Trump’s outburst came a day after [a television station in
Kansas](https://www.wibw.com/2020/08/18/goodyear-employees-say-new-no-tolerance-policy-is-discriminatory/)
shared an image from a Goodyear training presentation that said “MAGA
Attire” as well as “Blue Lives Matter,” the slogan intended to support
police officers but also decried as a ill-suited reaction to the Black
Lives Matter movement. were considered unacceptable.

Goodyear responded on Wednesday by saying that its policy against
harassment and discrimination means that it asks that “associates
refrain from workplace expressions in support of political campaigning
for any candidate or political party.”

Mr. Trump has attacked companies on Twitter in the past for policies he
disagreed with. These include the automaker **Ford**, for manufacturing
cars outside of the United States, and the drug maker **Pfizer** because
of the rising cost of pharmaceuticals.

Earlier in his presidency, those tweets often set off reactions in
financial markets and sometimes prompted changes in company policy, but
Mr. Trump’s public scoldings eventually lost some of [their
impact](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/20/us/politics/trump-twitter-businesses.html).

Goodyear, which has about 60,000 employees and was [founded
in 1898](https://corporate.goodyear.com/en-US/about/history.html), sells
about half of its tires in the Americas. Its two major rivals —
**Bridgestone** and **Michelin** — are not American companies.
Bridgestone is based in Japan, and Michelin in France.  
  
Goodyear’s shares ended trading on Wednesday with a decline of about 1.6
percent.

**JPMorgan Chase**, the largest bank in the United States, had
considered opening A.T.M.s and other banking facilities inside branches
of the United States Postal Service, a bank spokeswoman said.

Several months ago, the bank explored the possibility of leasing space
in post office branches, a move that would have put it in a highly
favorable position compared to its giant peers, the spokeswoman said.

Following [a report on
Wednesday](https://library.thecapitolforum.com/docs/486eya60q0er?vtt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzY29wZSI6InZpZXdUaW1lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTk3ODUyMzQzLCJleHAiOjE1OTgwMjg3NDMsInN1YiI6IjQ4NmV5YTYwcTBlciIsImp0aSI6IjQ4NmV6enhrZGo0OSJ9.S2Supsje_DaQmEA6hsZK7HIHMEL_dMUT4WVLf0z6Ll4&u=3zu7x0eu4e10)
by The Capitol Forum that cited an internal Postal Service document
describing the plans, the JPMorgan spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler, said
the bank had discussions “about what it might look like to lease a small
number of spaces to place A.T.M.s to better serve some historically
underserved communities.”

Democrats in Congress have been pushing for the Postal Service to offer
its own banking options so that more low-income Americans can have
access to basic services, like cashing checks, without having to pay the
same rates that banks or payday lenders charge to people without bank
accounts, which can be extremely high.

Having JPMorgan’s banking facilities in post office branches may have
made the idea of postal banking harder to execute. That would have been
good for JPMorgan and other large banks, which generally oppose postal
banking because it would undermine their ability to attract new
customers.

In June, a consortium of bank lobbying groups, including the American
Bankers Association, the largest such group in the country, as well as
the Bank Policy Institute, which represents the country’s largest banks,
[wrote to
leaders](https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/joint-financial-services-trades-letter-to-the-house-oppose-pascrell-kaptur-postal-banking-amendment)
in the House of Representatives urging them to oppose legislation that
would have provided funding for postal banking services for the 2021
fiscal year.

“Congress should encourage the Postal Service to focus on its core
business of physical mail delivery, and not attempt to expand the
mission to businesses outside of the Postal Service’s area of
expertise,” the groups’ representatives wrote.

Ms. Wexler said JPMorgan’s talks with the Postal Service were
preliminary. “There is no agreement in place and no imminent plans to
move forward,” she said.

It took **Apple** 42 years to [reach $1
trillion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/02/technology/apple-stock-1-trillion-market-cap.html)
in value. It took it just two more years [to get to $2
trillion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/technology/apple-2-trillion.html).

Even more stunning: All of Apple’s second $1 trillion was added in the
past 21 weeks, while [the global
economy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/europes-contraction-is-its-worst-on-record)
[shrank faster than ever
before](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)
in the coronavirus pandemic.

On Wednesday Apple became the first U.S. company to hit that valuation
when its shares climbed in early trading. It was another milestone for
the maker of iPhones, Mac computers and Apple Watches, cementing its
title as the world’s most valuable public company and punctuating how
[the pandemic has been a bonanza for the tech
giants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-facebook-amazon-youtube.html).

As recently as mid-March, Apple’s value was under $1 trillion after the
stock market plunged over fears of the coronavirus. On March 23, the
stock market’s nadir this year, the Federal Reserve announced
[aggressive new
measures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/business/economy/coronavirus-fed-bond-buying.html)
to calm investors. Since then, the stock market — and particularly the
stocks of Apple, **Microsoft**, **Amazon**, **Alphabet** and
**Facebook** — largely soared, with the [S\&P 500 hitting a new
high](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-record.html)
on Tuesday.

**Target** said on Wednesday that its profits surged to nearly $1.7
billion in the three months through Aug. 1, an increase of about 80
percent from the same time a year earlier, as people continued to turn
to big-box retailers for supplies during the coronavirus lockdowns.

The earnings growth came as sales rose nearly 25 percent, in part as
online sales nearly tripled from the previous year, the company said in
a
[statement.](https://investors.target.com/news-releases/news-release-details/target-corporation-reports-second-quarter-earnings)

Same-store sales (from stores that were open both this year and last)
increased nearly 11 percent, while same-day services, including order
pick up and drive up, grew by 273 percent.  
  
Target was designated as an essential service, allowing its stores to
remain open while some competitors were forced to closed. The company
said its “comparable sales” growth of 24.3 percent was the biggest
increase ever reported.

The company’s shares rose more than 12 percent on Wednesday.

  - **Qantas Airways**, Australia’s national carrier, swung to a loss of
    1.96 Australian dollars, or $1.4 billion, for the 2020 financial
    year, as the pandemic devastated the airline industry worldwide. The
    loss was driven primarily by a write-down of assets, including its
    A380 fleet, and restructuring costs intended to help it survive
    during the pandemic, the airline said in a statement on Thursday.
    “The impact of COVID on all airlines is clear,” the company’s
    chief executive, Alan Joyce, said in the statement. “It’s
    devastating and it will be a question of survival for many."

  - **Lowe’s**
    [reported](https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/press-releases/lowes-reports-second-quarter-2020-sales-and-earnings-results-08-19-20)
    a surge in profits during the second quarter, as the coronavirus
    pandemic spurred people across the country to take on home
    improvement projects while cooped up at home. The hardware chain
    said Wednesday it earned $2.8 billion for the quarter ending July
    31, compared to $1.7 billion during the same period last year. Net
    sales also jumped 30 percent to roughly $27 billion. The company
    said it invested $460 million to support frontline hourly workers
    and increase store safety during the quarter.

  - **Southwest Airlines** said in a filing on Wednesday that it had
    turned down a $2.8 billion federal loan offered under the March
    stimulus, reflecting a modest improvement to the company’s outlook
    and its belief that it can raise money at favorable terms elsewhere
    if needed.

  - **Amazon**
    [said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/technology/amazon-office-expansion.html)
    on Tuesday that it would hire 3,500 white-collar employees across
    the country, including 2,000 in New York, following through on plans
    it had largely put in place before the coronavirus made office
    towers empty as employees worked from home. The new jobs will fill a
    lot of office space that the company acquired before Covid-19 took
    hold in the United States. In early March, Amazon bought the iconic
    **Lord & Taylor** building on Fifth Avenue from the co-working
    company **WeWork**.

As the economy contracts and many companies struggle to survive,
America’s biggest tech companies are being lifted to new heights,
putting the industry in a position to [dominate
business](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/technology/big-tech-business-domination.html)
in a way unseen since the days of railroads.

A rally in technology stocks elevated the S\&P 500 index to [a record
high](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/sp-500-hits-a-record-as-traders-look-past-economic-devastation)
on Tuesday even as the pandemic crushes the broader economy. The stocks
of **Apple**, **Amazon**, **Alphabet**, **Microsoft** and **Facebook**,
the five largest publicly traded companies in the United States, rose 37
percent in the first seven months this year, while all the other stocks
in the S\&P 500 fell a combined 6 percent, according to Credit Suisse.

Those five companies now constitute 20 percent of the stock market’s
total worth, a level not seen from a single industry in at least 70
years. Apple’s stock market value, the highest of the bunch, is nearly
$2 trillion — double what it was just 21 weeks ago.

The tech companies’ dominance of the stock market is propelled by their
unprecedented reach into our lives, shaping how we work, communicate,
shop and relax. That has only deepened during the pandemic, and as
people shop more frequently on Amazon, click on a Google or Facebook ad
or pay up for an iPhone, the companies receive a greater share of
spending in the economy and earn ever larger profits.

“Covid was the perfect positive storm for these guys,” said Thomas
Philippon, a professor of finance at New York University.

Strict lockdowns ended weeks ago, but many people across the country are
still avoiding malls, restaurants and other businesses. The shift in
behavior points to [a reshaping of American
commerce](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/18/business/economy/coronavirus-economic-recovery-states.html),
fueling questions about the strength and speed of the economic recovery
as the coronavirus continues to spread.

Through the end of last week, daily visits to businesses were down 20
percent from last year, according to a New York Times analysis of foot
traffic data from the smartphones of more than 15 million people. After
an initial plunge in the spring, consumer habits have been slow to
recover, the data shows.

Visits to businesses have, for example, rebounded more in Alabama, a
largely conservative state, than in the more liberal Vermont. But in
comparison with last year, people in Vermont have been shopping again
more than people in California, where the virus remains a greater
threat. Everywhere, trips to pharmacies and hospitals have fallen, while
those to gas stations and convenience stores have held steady or even
increased.

How people spend will determine which companies survive, and who
ultimately keep their jobs. Continued weakness at brick-and-mortar
stores has enormous implications for an economy that has had [years of
gains wiped
away](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html)
in the months since the pandemic hit. The disparities in how people shop
hint at a prolonged, uncertain and uneven recovery.
