</div>

</div>

The most successful conventions, in normal years, are the ones that
methodically execute a checklist of political objectives.

This one was different in form and function.

Democrats — their 2020 gathering confined to a camera lens — sought to
capitalize on the intimacy of the medium, and the teeth-grinding urgency
of defeating President Trump, by sequencing the first-ever virtual
convention as a series of emotional, rather than political, moments.

That was especially evident on the fourth and final night, when the
convention converged on the focal point of the nominee, Joseph R. Biden
Jr., a candidate whose political strength emanates not from his youth,
oratorical prowess or place at the head of a movement, but from his
capacity to overcome tragedy and to feel other people’s pain.

Mr. Biden’s final message on Thursday, toward that end, was not a
typical end-of-show fist pump. It was a plea for “love and hope and
light.”

The night’s highlights:

**Mr. Biden’s lengthy speech went smoothly.** The Trump campaign has
ridiculed Mr. Biden’s age and physical capacities relentlessly,
suggesting that he was hiding in his basement in Delaware to avoid
verbal pratfalls. In recent days, however, some Republicans have quietly
fretted that setting such a low bar for Mr. Biden would make even a
mediocre performance seem like a triumph.

Mr. Biden did not deliver a perfect speech to an eerily empty hall in
Delaware on Thursday. But there were only a few stumbles, and he
projected a sense of presidential authority, especially when ripping Mr.
Trump on foreign policy.

**Tammy Duckworth gave Mr. Trump a nickname.** A lot of speakers said a
lot of unflattering things about Mr. Trump over the past four days. But
few hit quite as hard as the Illinois senator and combat veteran who
delivered a damning verdict of his stewardship of national security.

Mr. Trump, she said, “is a coward in chief who won’t stand up to
Vladimir Putin, read his daily briefings or even admonish adversaries
for putting bounties on our troops’ heads.”

**Hunter Biden made a cameo.** Mr. Biden’s campaign included a
testimonial from Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, whose highly paid work on
behalf of an energy company in Ukraine caused immense headaches for his
father’s campaign. A Biden campaign aide said there was never a question
about including him.

**Michael Bloomberg got under Trump’s skin.** The Democrats sicced an
even richer guy than Mr. Trump on him Thursday night, with the
billionaire former mayor ridiculing the president’s boasts that he is a
genius in business. “Trump says we should vote for him because he’s a
great businessman,” he said. “Really?”

The insult hit its mark. “After the worst debate performance in the
history of politics, Michael Bloomberg, commonly known as Mini Mike, is
trying to make a comeback by begging the Democrats for relevance,” Mr.
Trump tweeted soon after. “They treated him like a dog — and always
will. Before politics, he said GREAT things about me\!”

**Brayden Harrington set the tone.** Mr. Biden had a debilitating
stutter as a child, and he has befriended young people he has met
through the years who stutter as well. At first a segment featuring
Brayden Harrington, 13, sitting for a moment without speaking, seemed as
if it were experiencing a technical glitch.

Then he began to speak about encountering Mr. Biden: “A few months ago I
met him in New Hampshire,” Brayden said. “He told me that we were
members of the same club. We stutter.”

Brayden went on to talk about how Mr. Biden had made him feel more
confident and hopeful about what he could accomplish. Then he wrapped up
his remarks in a way that eloquently captured Mr. Biden’s core message.

“We all want the world to feel better,” he said. “We need the world to
feel better.”

Forty-eight years after he first ran for the Senate and 33 years since
his first presidential bid flamed out before the first primaries, Joseph
R. Biden Jr. accepted the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination on
Thursday, framing himself as a balm to heal a nation scarred and divided
by four years of President Trump.

Mr. Biden delivered a crisp, forceful live address not before a cheering
arena of Democrats but inside a barren conference center, his big party
yet another casualty of the nation’s enduring public health crisis.

“United we can, and will, overcome this season of darkness in America,”
Mr. Biden said from Wilmington, Del., after months of Zoom fund-raisers
and video chats from his home there. “It is with great honor and
humility that I accept this nomination for president of the United
States of America.”

<div>

</div>

Over the last six months, Mr. Biden has united a fractious Democratic
Party coalition that is sold less on his policy proposals or on him as a
symbol of change than on its united opposition to a president whom all
elements of the party view as an existential threat to democracy.

His speech Thursday was likely to be remembered less for its content
than for the emotion Mr. Biden brought to the case against Mr. Trump.
While the former vice president pledged to “be the generation that
finally wipes out the stain of racism from our national character,” the
crux of his argument was that the United States is better than the
self-centered world of Mr. Trump’s White House.

“This campaign isn’t just about winning votes,” he said, echoing a theme
of his campaign since it began 18 months ago. “It’s about winning the
heart and, yes, the soul of America. Winning it for the generous among
us, not the selfish. Winning it for workers who keep this country going,
not just the privileged few at the top.”

At 77 years old, Mr. Biden is the nation’s oldest presidential nominee
for a major party, someone broadly assumed to be a transitional figure,
[one who may even serve just a single term in
office](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/03/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president-pick.html).
His selection of his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California,
anointed her as a potential successor and future leader of the party.

During a convention heavy on emotion and Mr. Biden’s biography — the
loss of his wife and infant daughter in a car accident and, 40 years
later, of his adult son to brain cancer — Democrats have put relatively
little emphasis on what Mr. Biden would do as president beyond reversing
Mr. Trump’s policies and ending his chaotic style of governing.

“What we know about this president is if he’s given four more years,
he’ll be what he’s been for the last four years,” Mr. Biden said. “A
president who takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others,
cozies up to dictators and fans the flames of hate and division.”

So Mr. Biden gave an acceptance speech aimed at doing no harm to his
coalition of Black voters, suburbanites, older people and
college-educated women, just like the convention itself.

He said little to give fodder to Republican attacks that he is a
stalking horse for the far left — just as his convention gave only 90
seconds of speaking time to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of
New York, who represents the party’s future far more than Michael R.
Bloomberg, who received a plum five-minute slot Thursday night as the
last politician to speak before Mr. Biden.

Instead Mr. Biden delivered familiar attacks on Republican efforts to
cut taxes on the wealthy and big corporations and pledged to protect
Social Security, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden said, is “proposing to eliminate a tax that pays
for almost half of Social Security without any way of making up for that
lost revenue, resulting in cuts. I will not let that happen. If I’m your
president we’re going to protect Social Security and Medicare. You have
my word.”

Mr. Trump has ping-ponged between attacks on Mr. Biden, suggesting he is
a dimwitted avatar for the far left who has little ability to make hefty
decisions on his own.

As if on cue, Mr. Trump, before Mr. Biden was finished speaking, weighed
in on Twitter, not to demean his rival’s proposals but to suggest his
time to put them in place had come and gone during his previous terms in
office.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

“In 47 years, Joe did none of the things of which he now speaks,” Mr.
Trump wrote. “He will never change, just words\!”

Then, as if Mr. Biden were speaking to viewers from inside their living
rooms, he finished his speech — the first nomination acceptance in
modern times without a cheering crowd — with a call to join him in
overcoming the national division of the Trump
era.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

“Let us begin, you and I together, one nation under God, united in our
love for America, united in our love for each other,” Mr. Biden said.
“This is our mission. Let history be able to say that the end of this
chapter of American darkness began here tonight as love and hope and
light. Join in the battle for the soul of the nation.”

Then he and his wife, Jill Biden, along with Ms. Harris and her husband,
Douglas Emhoff, walked outside the convention center, with masks
covering their faces, to watch a fireworks display with a crowd of
supporters who remained by their parked cars.

Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s children, Hunter and Ashley Biden, spoke about
their father ahead of his speech accepting the Democratic nomination on
Thursday night.

“We want to tell you what kind of president our dad will be,” Hunter
Biden said.

Hunter Biden, 50, and Ashley Biden, 39, went on to describe their
father. Ashley Biden said Mr. Biden would be “the worst enemy any bully
ever saw.” Hunter Biden said he would be “the best friend you’ve ever
had.”

“He’s been a great father,” Hunter Biden said.

“And we think he’ll be a great president,” Ashley Biden added.

President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Hunter Biden
over his overseas business dealings, and his appearance at the
convention was notable because he has largely remained out of sight
during the presidential campaign.

The House [impeached Mr.

in December over his effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate the elder

while Mr. Biden was vice president. The Senate [acquitted Mr.

During the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden [repeatedly faced

over his son’s role, and Hunter Biden said last year that he had
exercised [“poor
judgment.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/15/us/politics/hunter-biden-interview.html)

Ashley Biden has a background in social work and served as executive
director of the Delaware Center for Justice, a nonprofit group.

On Thursday night, Hunter and Ashley Biden gave the final word to their
late brother, Beau Biden. The segment concluded with footage of Beau
Biden speaking about their father at the Democratic National Convention
in 2012.

Stephen Curry, one of the most popular players in the N.B.A., and his
wife, the author and chef Ayesha Curry, endorsed [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night.

The celebrity couple appeared in a pretaped video with their daughters,
Riley, 8, and Ryan, 5, one of the highest-profile athlete appearances at
a political convention for either party.

The endorsement plans were first reported [by People
Magazine](https://people.com/politics/steph-and-ayesha-curry-endorse-joe-biden/).

“We want to ensure that our kids live in a nation that is safe, happy,
healthy and fair, and so this election — ” Mrs. Curry says in the video.
Mr. Curry cuts in to say, “We’re voting for Joe Biden.”

Mr. Curry, a two-time Most Valuable Player Award winner, has kept in
close touch with former President Barack Obama, under whom Mr. Biden
served, since Mr. Obama left the White House in 2017. Mr. Obama and Mr.
Curry appeared together last year at an event in Oakland, Calif.,
[celebrating My Brother’s
Keeper](https://theundefeated.com/features/obama-and-curry-join-together-for-my-brothers-keeper-alliance/),
the former president’s initiative aimed at closing the education gap for
young Black men.

The endorsement is not necessarily a surprise, given that Mr. Curry has
been a frequent critic of President Trump since he took office. Early on
in Mr. Trump’s presidency, Mr. Curry publicly rebuked the chief
executive of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, after Mr. Plank [said the
president was a “a real asset” to the
country](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/08/sports/basketball/stephen-curry-under-armour-donald-trump-warriors.html#:~:text=Stephen%20Curry%20became%20the%20latest,real%20asset%E2%80%9D%20to%20the%20country.).
Mr. Curry, who has an endorsement deal with Under Armour, said in an
interview with The San Jose Mercury News, “I agree with that
description, if you remove the ‘et.’”

In fact, one of Mr. Trump’s early feuds in his presidency was with Mr.
Curry, who had expressed reluctance about visiting the White House after
the Golden State Warriors won the N.B.A. championship in 2017. In
response, Mr. Trump [rescinded the
invitation.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/23/sports/stephen-curry-trump-nba-.html)

“Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship
team,” [Mr. Trump posted on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/911572182060453893)
that September. “Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is
withdrawn\!” LeBron James, another N.B.A. star [who has endorsed Mr.
Biden](https://www.tmz.com/2020/08/19/lebron-james-joe-biden-kamala-harris-campaign-trump-president/),
chimed in on Twitter: “U bum

great honor until you showed up\!”

Michael R. Bloomberg, the party-hopping billionaire who alighted on the
Democratic Party’s right, was given five minutes in prime time at the
convention — four more minutes than the slot initially given to
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leading champion of the
party’s left wing.

Why? That is what many progressives and disgruntled former workers on
his short-lived presidential campaign have been asking.

The answer (according to Biden aides) was this: The former New York City
mayor is much, much richer than President Trump, and is therefore
uniquely positioned to offer a suitably sneering takedown of the
president’s claim that he is a business genius.

“Trump says we should vote for him because he’s a great businessman.
Really?” Mr. Bloomberg asked on Thursday.

“He drove his companies into bankruptcy six times — always leaving
behind customers and contractors who were cheated and swindled and
stopped doing business with him,” he added. “Well, this time all of us
are paying the price. And we can’t let him get away with it again.”

Mr. Bloomberg recently pledged to spend $50 million of his roughly $55
billion fortune to help House Democrats. But he was a Republican for the
better part of a decade as mayor, and resisted efforts to raise taxes on
the wealthy to shore up the city’s budget in the wake of the 2001
terrorist attacks.

“I’ve never been much for partisan politics. I’ve supported Democrats,
Republicans, and independents,” Mr. Bloomberg said on Thursday. “Hell,
I’ve actually been a Democrat, Republican and independent.”

On Thursday, it was down with the plutocrats — just one plutocrat,
actually.

“Let me tell you a little secret: Donald Trump’s economic plan was to
give a huge tax cut to guys like me who didn’t need it — and then lie
about who it was for, to everyone else,” he said.

The appearance, coming just before [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
accepted the party’s nomination, has stirred anger among some
progressives as well as former Bloomberg campaign workers who say he
broke a promise to employ them through November. It has also reignited
questions about the multibillionaire’s pledge to throw his fortune
behind the general-election effort to defeat Mr. Trump.

“He stiffed our party and all the monthly workers he promised to keep on
through November,” Amy Siskind, a prominent progressive activist,
[wrote](https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/1293968913391325185) on
Twitter. “Why is Bloomberg speaking?”

In March, Mr. Bloomberg made an enormous [$18 million
transfer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-dnc.html)
to the Democratic Party and offered up the leases to 13 field offices
for the party’s use. Within weeks of exiting the 2020 race, he put $4.5
million into three major progressive groups — Swing Left, Collective
Future and Voto Latino.

Not long before Joe Biden was set to make his official debut as the
Democratic nominee, several of his former rivals swapped glowing
testimonials about him in a 5-minute **** video.

The deceptively simple television spot, created by the [M\&C Saatchi ad
agency
SS+K](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/11/18/business/media/mc-saatchi-buys-a-stake-in-ssk.html),
features former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Senator Amy
Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas,
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang in a video conference
moderated by Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.

“You can think of this sort of like Survivor, on the out interviews of
all the people who got voted off the island,” Mr. Booker joked.

Instead of relying on the former candidates to record themselves as they
virtually interacted, SS+K sent film crews to six separate locations on
Sunday (Mr. Sanders’s existing audiovisual arrangement was sophisticated
enough for him to manage on his own).

Within 48 hours, the video had been edited and finalized. The effort
involved some 45 editors, technicians, producers and other workers, said
Rob Shepardson, who co-founded SS+K in 1993.

He has worked on campaigns for former President Barack Obama as well as
for clients such as Starbucks and Microsoft. Thursday night’s video was
“at the top” of his list for difficulty and novelty, he said.

“In our experience, it’s never been done before, where you have most of
the Democratic primary candidates together in a session like that,” he
said.

The video was part of a trio crafted for the convention. [The first
spot](https://www.demconvention.com/press-releases/convention-video-united-we-stand-shows-2020-democratic-candidates-coming-together-to-defeat-donald-trump/),
which ran on Monday, also included praise about Mr. Biden from former
candidates, such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Gov. Jay
Inslee of Washington and the California billionaire Tom Steyer. [The
second
video](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election#emma-gonzalez-narrated-a-video-as-the-convention-highlighted-gun-violence),
which aired on Wednesday, focused on gun control and a speech by Emma
González, a survivor of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting and a vocal
gun safety activist.

When Pete Buttigieg was on his way to winning, just barely, the Iowa
caucuses back in February, he was competing for the same voters that
fell in Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s sweet spot: older, moderate voters longing
for a time when politics wasn’t so chaotic.

A regular applause line in his stump speech went: “Are we ready to put
the tweets in the rearview mirror once and for all?”

The Buttigieg campaign fizzled out in South Carolina, where he never
developed any traction with Black voters, who formed the core of the
Biden constituency. Yet his promise to be a sober executive who would
resist the excesses of more liberal candidates such as Senators Bernie
Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, combined with a big-dollar fund-raising
apparatus that for months went unmatched among his 2020 rivals, was
essentially what Mr. Biden rode to victory after Mr. Buttigieg and
Senator Amy Klobuchar dropped out and endorsed him on the eve of Super
Tuesday.

Still only 38 years old, Mr. Buttigieg, perhaps unlike anyone else who
has spoken at the convention, is a man whose political future is
entirely yoked to Mr. Biden winning in November.

Speaking from his hometown, South Bend, Ind., of the progress the
country has made on gay rights, Mr. Buttigieg, the first gay major party
presidential candidate to speak on a presidential debate stage, looked
toward the next decade if Mr. Biden is elected.

“If this much can change between 2010 and 2020, imagine what could
change between now and 2030,” he said. “The day I was born, the idea of
an out candidate seeking any federal office at all was laughable. Yet
earlier this year I campaigned for the presidency, often with my
husband, Chasten, at my side, winning delegates to this very
convention.”

Like others who have addressed a national audience during the Democratic
convention, Mr. Buttigieg framed the stakes of the election as
monumental, a choice between an array of polar opposite outcomes to be
determined by the result of the Nov. 3 election.

“It’s up to us,” he said. “Will America be a place where faith is about
healing and not exclusion? Can we become a country that lives up to the
truth that Black lives matter? Will we handle questions of science and
medicine by turning to scientists and doctors? Will we see to it that no
one who works full time can live in poverty?”

If Mr. Biden wins, Mr. Buttigieg is certain to earn consideration for a
plum cabinet appointment. If he loses, Mr. Buttigieg will be in South
Bend without a job and, given Indiana’s heavy Republican lean, not much
of a future in elected office until the next presidential campaign.

A video paying tribute to Beau Biden, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s late son,
aired as part of the convention proceedings on Thursday night, ahead of
Mr. Biden’s speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination.

Beau Biden, the former attorney general of Delaware, [died of brain
cancer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/05/31/us/politics/joseph-r-biden-iii-vice-presidents-son-beau-dies-at-46.html)
in 2015 at age 46. His death was another devastating public loss for Mr.
Biden, whose first wife and daughter were killed in a car accident in
1972. Mr. Biden’s empathy and his capacity to [connect with people
dealing with
grief](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/30/us/politics/joe-biden-beau-biden-death.html)
are often cited as among his most distinctive qualities as a politician.

The tribute showed photo after photo of Beau Biden. In some of them, he
wore military fatigues; he was a member of the Delaware Army National
Guard and served in Iraq.

The tribute included portions of the eulogy that President Barack Obama
[delivered at his
funeral](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/07/us/beau-biden-funeral-held-in-delaware.html).
“He did in 46 years what most of us couldn’t do in 146,” Mr. Obama said.

“Some folks may never know that their lives are better because of Beau
Biden, but that’s OK,” Mr. Obama added. “Certainly for Beau, acclaim was
never the point of public service.”

At the beginning of Thursday’s program, a segment cited Beau Biden’s
death and highlighted Mr. Biden’s leadership of the cancer “moonshot”
that was established by the Obama administration. And later Thursday
night, the convention aired a video showing Mr. Biden’s granddaughters
talking about their grandfather.

Joseph R. Biden Jr. received a striking endorsement Thursday night from
a 95-year-old Republican who served in World War II and the Korean War.

“I have been a Republican since the 1960s, I’m a member of the N.R.A.
and I voted for Trump,” the veteran, Ed Good, said. “I think Trump has
been the worst president we’ve ever had.”

“Like me on the day of my jump into Germany,” he added, “I think Joe
Biden cares about doing his proper duty for the United States.”

Mr. Good’s endorsement reinforced the theme of bipartisan support for
Mr. Biden that Democratic leaders have been hammering during the
convention. Several prominent Republicans have given speeches or
appeared in video montages, and regular Republican voters have been
featured as well.

It also spoke to a theme that the event highlighted on Thursday in
particular: Mr. Biden’s connections to the military and how he would
approach the role of commander in chief.

Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, whose legs were amputated after she
was wounded in Iraq, excoriated President Trump’s handling of the
military and foreign relations, and a video highlighted the military
service of Mr. Biden’s son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015.

In searing terms, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois vouched for Joseph
R. Biden Jr.’s ability to be commander in chief, endorsing him in a way
that she, [a military veteran whose legs were amputated after her
helicopter was shot down in
Iraq](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-vice-president-joe-biden.html),
is uniquely positioned to do.

Service members deserve a leader “who understands the risks they face
and who would actually protect them by doing his job as commander in
chief,” Ms. Duckworth said, in a speech that followed a video about Mr.
Biden’s connections to the military. “Instead, they have a coward in
chief who won’t stand up to Vladimir Putin, read his daily intelligence
briefings or even publicly admonish adversaries for reportedly putting
bounties on our troops’ heads.”

Her speech was a fierce denunciation of the performance and character of
President Trump, who she said had “let tyrants manipulate him like a
puppet on a string.”

“Joe Biden would never threaten to use our military against peaceful
Americans, because unlike Trump, Joe Biden has common sense and common
decency,” Ms. Duckworth said. “Donald Trump doesn’t deserve to call
himself commander in chief for another four minutes, let alone another
four years.”

Ms. Duckworth also spoke in emotional detail not only about her own
struggles after her injury, but the stress it placed on her husband.

“When I was wounded, he rushed to Walter Reed,” she said. “When I woke
up, he held my hand and helped me through the excruciating pain. He was
my anchor as I relearned to walk, helping me through every step, every
stumble. You see, military service doesn’t just take courage and
sacrifice from those in uniform — they’re required from their families,
too.”

Mr. Biden, “understands those sacrifices, because he has made them
himself,” she said, pointing to his son Beau Biden’s service in Iraq.
“Joe knows the fear military families live with because he’s felt that
dread of never knowing if your deployed loved one is safe. He
understands their bravery because he has had to muster that same
strength every hour of every day Beau was overseas.”

Ms. Duckworth’s military background and compelling personal story led
Mr. Biden to [seriously consider her as his running
mate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-biden-vp.html),
though he ultimately concluded that choosing her would invite legal
battles because she was born abroad to a father who was an American
citizen and a mother who was not.

Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, had expected a big week as
a host of Milwaukee’s convention that wasn’t.

Ms. Baldwin, who in 2012 became the first openly gay woman to be elected
to the Senate, focused on one of the most popular elements of Obamacare
in her prime-time speech: the provision that allows those under 26 to
remain on their parents’ health plans.

“When I was 9 years old, I got sick, really sick,” Ms. Baldwin recalled.
“I was hospitalized. But since my grandparents were the ones raising me,
and our family’s health plan didn’t cover grandkids, they were forced to
pay out of pocket for my three-month hospital stay.”

“I was marked ‘child with a pre-existing condition,’” she added. “You
see, there’s another part of my story: the part where I ran for office,
the part where I served in Congress, the part where I worked with Joe
Biden and Barack Obama to make sure kids and grandkids, if they’re
dependents, can stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re
26.”

Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey focused his convention remarks on the
middle class, describing Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a champion of unions and
working Americans.

Mr. Booker, whose own presidential campaign emphasized a message of
unity and who was a leader on gun policy in particular, sharply
criticized President Trump for describing the economy as “good” when “40
million Americans are at risk of losing their homes, 30 million aren’t
getting enough food to eat, and 5.4 million people have lost their
health care because of this crisis.”

If Mr. Biden is elected, “together, we’ll fight for those who keep us
healthy, who keep us safe, who teach our children,” he said. “We’ll
stand for those who cook and serve and clean, who plant and harvest, who
pack and always deliver — whose hands are thick with calluses like my
grandad’s were.”

Mr. Booker described his grandfather as an example of the American
dream: Raised in the South under Jim Crow, he moved to Detroit and got a
union job on an assembly line, which enabled him to climb into the
middle class.

“That’s the American dream: Together we work, together we rise,” Mr.
Booker said. “Like his generation, up out of the Depression, let’s now
work together and stand together — and America, together we will rise.”

President Trump said Thursday evening that he would send law enforcement
officers to polling places in November, and suggested falsely that
states might send absentee ballots only to Democratic voters.

“We’re going to have everything,” Mr. Trump said in response to a
question from the Fox News host Sean Hannity about whether the
administration intended to monitor polling places for evidence of fraud.
“We’re going to have sheriffs and we’re going to have law enforcement
and we’re going to have hopefully U.S. attorneys, and we’re going to
have everybody, and attorney generals.”

He then repeated his frequent, baseless claims that universal mail-in
voting would lead to widespread fraud. (Several states already vote by
mail, and there is no evidence that it has led to significant fraud.)

“They’re going to be sending out 51 million ballots to people — they
have no idea why it’s coming, who it’s going to,” he said.
“Unfortunately, they may have a very good idea, the people sending
them. They may send them to all Democrat areas, not to Republican areas,
as an example. Could be the other way, too, but I doubt it.”

Speaking for a full half-hour from the White House — in a sharp break
from the tradition of deferring to a presidential rival during a
convention week — Mr. Trump also bashed the Democratic Party and cast
false aspersions on Mr. Biden’s mental health, though he conceded that
he planned to watch Mr. Biden’s address later in the night.

“I will, I’ll watch,” the president said. “I may not be able to watch
all of it.”

The president also told Mr. Hannity that he had “watched some, not that
much” of the Democratic convention leading up to Thursday, adding: “Lot
of hate.” When Mr. Hannity noted that the convention had featured plenty
of talk about the president, Mr. Trump replied: “Yeah, I’d say so\!”

The appearance began shortly after 9:30 p.m., and it was clear that Mr.
Trump was watching his own interview in real time. “I just watched the
young man on your screen\!” Mr. Trump told Mr. Hannity, after the host
ran footage of protesters in Portland, Ore.

It is a longstanding protocol that presidential candidates stay
relatively quiet during the week their opponent formally accepts the
nomination. But Mr. Trump has refused to yield the spotlight, going out
of his way to try to dampen Mr. Biden’s parade.

Shortly before the Democratic convention began on Thursday, Mr. Trump
published agitated posts on Twitter falsely claiming that the Democrats
“are trying to STEAL this election” and reposted pro-Trump tweets from
the right-wing pundits Mark Levin and Dan Bongino, both of whom appeared
on “Hannity” before the president called in.

Mr. Trump also made an afternoon appearance near Scranton, Pa., where
Mr. Biden spent part of his childhood.

On Fox News on Thursday, Mr. Hannity — one of Mr. Trump’s loudest media
cheerleaders — seemed to guide Mr. Trump through the interview, teeing
up some of the president’s regular talking points. Mr. Hannity cued Mr.
Trump to attack the former vice president’s “mental acuity,” to which
Mr. Trump replied: “I don’t want to get into that. Pretty obvious what’s
going on.” (There is no evidence that Biden is suffering from mental
health problems.)

Mr. Trump also said falsely that Mr. Biden had not answered questions
from reporters since July. Mr. Biden’s last formal news conference took
place in July; since then he has responded to queries on a few occasions
and sat for an interview with People magazine. He is participating in an
ABC News interview on Friday.

The president also previewed next week’s Republican National Convention,
saying he hoped it would contain more live segments than the Democrats’
version. “I think it’s pretty boring when you do tapes,” Mr. Trump said.

As Democrats built toward their coronation of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and
President Trump called into Sean Hannity’s show on Fox News, federal
election regulators released the latest fund-raising figures in the race
on Thursday night.

Mr. Trump’s official super PAC, America First Action, took in $13.4
million last month, those filings showed. Roughly three-quarters of that
came through the group’s dark-money sister non-profit, making the
origins of the cash untraceable.

The biggest gift with a name attached to it — a $2 million one — came to
Mr. Trump’s group from Patricia J. Duggan of Florida, a prominent
Scientologist who has poured hundreds of millions into the church.

One of Mr. Biden’s official super PACs, Priorities USA Action, reported
taking in $6.9 million in July, with roughly 40 percent of that coming
from its comparable dark-money arm that does not disclose donors.

Big donors supporting Mr. Biden through that group last month included
Seth MacFarlane, the creator of “Family Guy,” who contributed $700,000,
and the hedge-fund billionaire James Simons, who gave $2 million,
according to the filings.

Thursday marked a filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission,
America’s election watchdog. But as robust disclosures were processed
and made public by the agency in recent days, there was one newly
registered candidate for president for whom no data had posted as of
early Friday: Kanye West, whom Republican activists have sought to [help
put on the
ballot](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/politics/kanye-west-president-republicans.html)
as a third-party candidate in several states.

By now it’s no secret: Democrats want their supporters to vote as soon
as possible.

Alex Padilla and Jocelyn Benson, the secretaries of state of California
and Michigan, repeated a pitch that Democratic convention viewers have
seen from Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and others this
week: Please request your absentee ballot now and send it back right
away.

President Trump, Mr. Padilla said, “has admitted he is trying to
sabotage the post office to undermine voting by mail. It’s a direct
attack on our elections.”

Ms. Benson made sure voters understood their responsibility.

“Our job is to make sure that everybody can vote safely, whether in
person or by mail,” she said. “Your job is to make sure you vote.”

Both Ms. Benson and Mr. Padilla, Democratic officials who oversee
elections in their states, have expanded mail voting efforts during the
coronavirus pandemic, as Mr. Trump has sowed doubts about the legitimacy
of mail voting even as he has voted by mail himself in Florida’s primary
contests.

Mr. Padilla, [who is among the ambitious Californians in the
mix](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/us/who-from-california-would-replace-kamala-harris-in-the-senate.html)
to replace Senator Kamala Harris if she becomes vice president, is
sending ballots to every registered voter in the state. Ms. Benson sent
absentee ballot applications to everyone on the Michigan voter rolls.

After a pitch to text the Biden campaign for help registering to vote
and requesting an absentee ballot, Ms. Benson again stressed the urgency
of voting quickly.

“If you are voting from home, request and return your ballot as soon as
possible,” she said.

Mr. Padilla added: “Request your ballot now and send it in right away.”

Two states elected the first Native American members of Congress in
2018, an important moment for a diverse array of individual communities
facing a common set of dire economic, educational and health care
challenges.

[Sharice
Davids](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/08/us/politics/sharice-davids-native-american-kansas.html),
a former mixed martial arts fighter and a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation,
was elected in Kansas, and [Deb
Haaland](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/06/us/deb-haaland-new-mexico-congress.html),
a community organizer and a member of Laguna Pueblo, won in New Mexico.
Ms. Haaland addressed the convention Thursday.

“I’m a symbol of our resilience,” she said. “As the embodiment of
America’s progress as a nation, I know we can’t take our democracy for
granted, especially now as people are dying, as our land is abused, as
our Constitution is under attack.”

Ms. Haaland, the former chairwoman of New Mexico’s Democratic Party,
represents a relatively liberal district that includes most of
Albuquerque. She has been a vocal critic of the president’s crackdown on
immigration and promoted native sovereignty as a professed
“35th-generation New Mexican.”

When John Lewis died, the country lost one of its last links to the
civil rights movement.

Mr. Lewis, who for the last 33 years represented Atlanta in Congress,
fought until his final days for legislation to protect the right to
vote.

During the final night of the Democratic National Convention, the party
played a nearly five-minute tribute to Mr. Lewis, drawing on his legacy
with tributes from figures including Elijah Cummings, himself a civil
rights leader and congressman from Baltimore who died last year.

“From Day 1, John Lewis was a role model for members of Congress,”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “Because he brought with him a heft, a
weightiness of purpose.”

The video was followed by a performance of “Glory,” the Academy
Award-winning song by John Legend and Common from the film “Selma.” The
film focused on the voting rights marches from Selma, Ala., to
Montgomery in 1965, including the Bloody Sunday march, during which Mr.
Lewis was badly beaten by state troopers on the Edmund Pettus bridge.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta invoked John Lewis, an icon of her
city and the civil rights movement, at the Democratic convention, urging
Americans to “pass on the gift John Lewis sacrificed to give us”: the
right to vote.

“People often think that they can’t make a difference like our civil
rights icons, but every person in the movement mattered,” Ms. Bottoms
said. “Those who made the sandwiches, swept the church floors, stuffed
the envelopes — they, too, changed America, and so can we.”

Echoing a message [former President Barack Obama delivered at Mr.
Lewis’s
funeral](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/us/politics/john-lewis-funeral-barack-obama.html),
and one that has become an implicit theme of this week’s convention, Ms.
Bottoms warned, “If we fail to exercise our right to vote, we can lose
it.”

Ms. Bottoms, who was a contender to be Mr. Biden’s running mate, gained
national prominence for her response to the protests in Atlanta after
the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, striking a delicate
balance between expressing solidarity with the protesters and warning
against violence and property destruction.

She also made headlines in July, as coronavirus cases were spiking in
Georgia, by imposing a local mask mandate and other restrictions over
the objections of Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican. Mr. Kemp [sued
her](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/brian-kemp-georgia-keisha-lance-bottoms-atlanta.html)
for, he argued, violating his legal authority to set consistent
statewide rules; he dropped the lawsuit this month and said he would
issue an executive order instead.

Ms. Bottoms herself was one of the most prominent politicians [to
contract
Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/world/coronavirus-updates.html#link-7bb0157d).

In her speech on Thursday, she condemned officials who she said were
using the pandemic “to spread misinformation and interfere with voting,
forcing many in 2020 to still risk their lives to exercise their sacred
right to vote — a right that has already been paid for with the blood,
sweat, tears and lives of so many.”

WILMINGTON, Del. — Like all other nights of the Democratic National
Convention, Thursday, too, was virtual. But in Joe Biden’s hometown,
some of the former vice president’s fans were celebrating together
anyway — at a safe distance.

An outdoor viewing area, drive-in-movie-style, was set up near the venue
where Mr. Biden spoke, replete with oversize American flags, a stage and
a large screen.

Half an hour before the convention kicked off, attendees milled in the
parking lot under a sliver of a moon as upbeat music — some of it
familiar from Mr. Biden’s campaign events — played.

As the convention got underway, and speakers hit their applause lines,
attendees blared their horns in approval.

Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s verbosity, which has gotten him into trouble over
the years, is offset by a willingness to listen quietly as people tell
him their problems, an empathetic gift the writer Michael Kruse
memorably labeled [“Joe Biden’s
superpower.”](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/01/25/joe-biden-2019-profile-grief-beau-car-accident-224178)

Conveying that warmth has been a challenge during a digital, socially
distanced convention, but organizers sought to underscore his compassion
— in part, to contrast him with President Trump — in the lead-in to Mr.
Biden’s big speech on Thursday.

Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware who was sworn into office
a decade ago by Mr. Biden, offered a testimonial to the nominee’s
“respect for the dignity of all people.”

“Joe knows the power of prayer, and I’ve seen him in moments of joy and
triumph, of loss and despair, turn to God for strength,” Mr. Coons said.

“Joe’s comforted me in my toughest moments, as he has so many others,”
he added. “I’ll never forget how Joe took the time to offer me words of
comfort as my father lay in hospice.”

“That compassion, that empathy,” Mr. Coons said, “is part of his
character.”

Over the first three nights of the Democratic National Convention, three
actresses — Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington and Tracee Ellis Ross —
guided viewers through a most unusual convention program.

On the fourth night, Julia Louis-Dreyfus brought in some levity as well
as some pointed jabs at President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

She first met Mr. Biden while she was starring on the show “Veep.”
Shortly after that meeting, she recalled, she was asked to be on the
cover of a magazine — specifically, the onboard magazine of Amtrak,
which Mr. Biden famously rode every day between the Senate and his
children in Wilmington, Del.

“The day it came out, my phone rang, and it was the vice president
telling me he loved the cover and the whole article,” Ms. Louis-Dreyfus
said. “Joe Biden not only knows how to read, but also he reads
everything.”

Later, she took a sharper tone.

“Just remember,” she said, “Joe Biden goes to church so regularly that
he doesn’t even need tear gas and a bunch of federalized troops to help
him get there.”

To get information about voting, she said, voters should text 30330,
which “would be the president’s golf score if he didn’t cheat.”

“OK, look, I’ll admit that was a little nasty, but we all know he’s a
cheater, and I’m proud to be a nasty, nasty woman,” she went on. “You
know, when Donald Trump spoke at his inauguration about American
carnage, I assumed that was something he was against, not a campaign
promise.”

In an exchange with the former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, Ms.
Louis-Dreyfus also mispronounced Vice President Mike Pence’s name,
mocking some conservative commentators’ mispronunciations of Kamala
Harris’s name:

> **LOUIS-DREYFUS:** I cannot wait to see her debate our current vice
> president, Micah Paints.
> 
> **YANG:** It is pronounced Ponce, I believe.
> 
> **LOUIS-DREYFUS:** Oh, some kind of weird foreign name.
> 
> **YANG:** Not very American sounding.
> 
> **LOUIS-DREYFUS:** Yeah. That’s what people are saying.

Of the four actresses serving as hosts, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus has the
closest relationship with Mr. Biden. The two filmed [a spoof
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da5tjfpKyac) for the White House
Correspondents’ Dinner in 2014. When Ms. Louis-Dreyfus disclosed that
she had breast cancer, in 2017, Mr. Biden tweeted his support.

“We Veeps stick together. Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with
you, Julia,” [he
wrote](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/913531470001602565?s=20).

When Andrew Yang began his 2020 presidential campaign back in November
2017, he was less than an afterthought. When major newspapers wrote
stories about potential 2020 candidates and left him out, Mr. Yang
himself often emailed reporters with a polite reminder that he was, in
fact, a Democratic candidate for president of the United States.

Nearly three years later Mr. Yang is a household name, a breakout star
of the presidential election cycle who built himself an enduring
following from supporters who embraced his call for a universal basic
income and his dire warnings about the coming loss of blue-collar jobs.
His presidential campaign lasted longer and was more successful than
those of a handful of the party’s anointed stars — including Senator
Kamala Harris, who wound up the Democratic nominee for vice president.

So when Mr. Yang was initially left off the initial list of speakers at
this week’s convention, [he was
hurt](https://twitter.com/andrewyang/status/1293211531551952897). Though
supportive of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he encouraged
social media efforts to win him a slot. The campaign worked, and there
was Mr. Yang as the opening speaker for the final night of Mr. Biden’s
virtual convention.

“Hello America\!” Mr. Yang said in remarks he delivered Thursday from
CNN’s New York studio, where he is a paid contributor to the network.
“It’s great to have this time with you on the final night of the
Democratic National Convention.”

Mr. Yang noted that a lot of the dire predictions he had made during his
campaign had already come true, citing his slogan: “Make America Think
Harder,” which was abbreviated MATH and sold on copious amounts of
campaign merchandise.

“You might know me as the guy who ran for president talking about MATH
and the future,” Mr. Yang said. “Unfortunately for all of us, that
future is now. The pandemic has accelerated everything. If you’re like
me and my wife, Evelyn, you don’t know if your child’s school is
reopening this fall. Seventy-two percent of Americans believe that this
is the worst time we have ever experienced. And 42 percent of the jobs
that are now lost — millions of jobs — will never return.”

Then Mr. Yang did something he often did on the campaign trail but has
not been done much by major speakers during the Democrats’ four-day
convention: Make a direct appeal to Trump voters to get behind Mr.
Biden.

“Back in 2016, if you voted for Trump, or didn’t vote at all, I
understand. Many of us have gotten tired of our leaders seeming far
removed from our everyday lives,” he said. “But we must give this
country a chance to recover — and recovery is only possible with a
change of leadership and new ideas.”

Then Mr. Yang finished with the sort of self-aware joke that won him
raves throughout the campaign.

“Now I’ll turn it over to a great Democrat with us throughout the
evening,” he said. “We have 11 Emmys between the two of us. How is that
for math? One of my favorite actresses, Julia Louis-Dreyfus.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California initially had a plum speaking slot at
the Democratic convention, but then he had to cancel to deal with
wildfires ravaging his state.

But Mr. Newsom found time to film — on his own iPhone, framed vertically
with a tree behind him — a short testimonial to former Vice President
Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of
California, an old political ally of Mr. Newsom’s.

“I confess this is not where I expected to be speaking here tonight,” he
said. “I’m about a mile or so away from one of over 370 wildfires that
we’re battling here in the state of California.”

Mr. Newsom offered a plea to viewers to address climate change before
catastrophes strike elsewhere.

“Climate change is real,” he said. “If you are in denial about climate
change, come to California.”
