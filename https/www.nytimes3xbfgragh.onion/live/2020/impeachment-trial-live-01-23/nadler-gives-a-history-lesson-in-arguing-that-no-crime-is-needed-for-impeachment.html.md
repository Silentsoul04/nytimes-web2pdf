## [Schiff ends the day with a fiery push for Trump’s removal.](#schiff-trump-removal)

</div>

</div>

Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead impeachment
manager, stepped back to the Senate lectern around 10 p.m. Eastern to
deliver one final argument for the day. It turned out to be a
stemwinder, jolting the sleepy Senate to attention as Mr. Schiff argued
more explicitly than ever before for President Trump’s removal from
office.

The president’s prosecutor began by re-evaluating the now familiar
transcript of Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr
Zelensky of Ukraine, urging senators to hear it with fresh ears after
two days of arguments by the House. But his challenge to senators was a
straightforward one: Do you really believe that this president, the one
on this call, has put the nation’s interests before his own and will do
so in the future?

“You know you can’t trust this president to do what is right for this
country,” he said. “You can trust he will do what’s right for Donald
Trump.”

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

What, Mr. Schiff asked, if China interfered in the coming election to
help Mr. Trump? Does anyone not expect him to accept it?

“If you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed,” Mr.
Schiff concluded. “Because right matters. Because the truth matters.
Otherwise, we are lost.”

The trial was set to reconvene on Friday at 1 p.m. for the managers to
discuss the second impeachment charge, obstruction of Congress, and
close out their case.

Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, wanted a change of
perspective. So as the third day of President Trump’s impeachment trial
stretched into yet another late night, he climbed a flight of stairs and
took a seat in the Senate’s visitors’ gallery perched above the chamber.

Legs crossed, he looked down on his colleagues and the Democratic House
managers, arranged like pieces on a board.

“Want to see what it’s like for you guys,” he said for reporters to
hear.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, emerged from a cloakroom with
a magazine in hand, returned to his desk and began flipping through the
pages. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, abandoned her
desk and stood against the back wall of the chamber, where colleagues
came and went.

The managers, though, showed no signs of tiring as they approached eight
hours of oral arguments.

Representatives Zoe Lofgren of California and Jason Crow of Colorado
plowed through Mr. Trump’s decision to withhold $391 million in military
aid from Ukraine to ramp up the pressure on its leaders to deliver
politically beneficial investigations he sought. They said it was the
third official act undertaken as part of Mr. Trump’s abuse of power.

“If there was no quid pro quo, then why did everybody know about it?”
Mr. Crow asked.

When a federal watchdog pressed the administration for details on the
decision to withhold security aid to Ukraine, the White House ultimately
declined to respond, according to documents released on Thursday by
Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. The administration
instead pointed to a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget
that asserted the hold was “appropriate” so as to avoid “conflict with
the president’s foreign policy.”

Brian Miller, a senior associate counsel to the president, responding to
the request, wrote, “The White House does not plan to respond separately
to your letters.” The Defense Department also declined to respond to the
watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, saying that it needed
“prior coordination with the other agencies involved.”

The watchdog found last week that the budget office violated the law
when it withheld nearly $400 million over the summer for “a policy
reason.”

As senators filed back into the chamber to resume opening arguments
after a brief dinner break, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South
Carolina, told reporters he would resist calls from conservatives next
week to try to call the whistle-blower and the Bidens to testify at the
trial.

“There’ll be a lot of pressure on me to call the whistle-blower, to call
Schiff, to call Hunter Biden and Joe Biden,” Mr. Graham said. “I’m not
going to give in to that pressure, because I don’t think it will serve
the Senate and the country well, there’s ways to do this outside of this
trial.”

The president was “having the reaction that a normal person would have
if they thought they were being accused of something they didn’t do,”
Mr. Graham said, adding that the experience was “very emotional.”

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

And he quickly shot down the idea that Mr. Trump should attend the
trial, a possibility the president floated this week. “In case you’re
listening,” Mr. Graham said, “don’t come.”

The Senate impeachment trial has taken a 30-minute dinner break, giving

run to the cameras and talk to reporters.

The presentation by the House managers will resume when the break is
over. (That could be longer than 30 minutes, since lawmakers rarely
stick to schedule.) It’s unclear how much longer the presentations will
go, but several hours more is a good
guess.

Mark it down: The first joke of President Trump’s impeachment trial took
place just before 6 p.m. on Thursday. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of
New York, one of the House managers, strode up to the lectern and in
somber tones thanked the chief justice, the senators and the White House
lawyers. Then he told a story about running into a fellow New Yorker who
asked if he had heard the latest outrage. Mr. Jeffries told the senators
that he assumed Mr. Trump, back in town after a trip overseas, had again
done something outrageous.

“Someone voted against Derek Jeter on his Hall of Fame ballot,” Mr.
Jeffries said the friend told him, referring to the Yankees shortstop.
Several senators in the chamber chuckled.

“I understand that, as House managers, certainly we hope we can subpoena
John Bolton, subpoena Mick Mulvaney,” Mr. Jeffries went on. “But perhaps
we can all agree — subpoena the Baseball Hall of Fame to try to figure
out who out of 397 individuals, one person, goes against Derek Jeter.”
There were more chuckles, including from Senator Lindsey Graham,
Republican of South Carolina.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

After the joke, Mr. Jeffries moved to the more serious issues of the
day, focusing on the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine for
investigations by withholding a White House meeting.

The [video cameras in the Senate
chamber](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/19/business/media/senate-impeachment-trial-media.html)
have been almost exclusively focused on one place during the impeachment
trial — a small area at the front of the room where the chief justice
and those speaking at the lectern appear.

Taking photos and other video of the space is not allowed, so in order

## [Democrats seek to poke holes in Trump’s expected defense.](#democrats-strategy-trump)

</div>

</div>

House managers had a very clear strategy when they walked into the
Senate chambers on Thursday: Poke holes in the defenses they expect
President Trump’s lawyers will try to employ when it’s their turn this
week.

The White House defense team claims that impeachment cannot be valid
without a crime. So for more than an hour, Representative Jerrold Nadler
of New York methodically walked through the history of constitutional
law to preemptively assert that such a defense is wrong.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers also argue in their legal brief that the president
was interested only in combating corruption in Ukraine. So the House
managers zeroed in on evidence on Thursday that shows the president was
concerned about corruption claims about former Vice President Joe Biden
and his son — not corruption generally.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

And because they expect the president’s legal advisers to repeatedly
raise the Bidens when they present their defense, the House managers
spent hours debunking the accusation that the Bidens did anything
improper in Ukraine.

Taken together, Thursday’s presentations by the House managers were
meant as a shield against what they expect is coming, most likely on
Saturday, when Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Jay Sekulow,
the president’s personal lawyer, get their chance in the well of the
Senate.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader,
applauded the House managers during a break in the case for
“pre-empting” the arguments from the president’s team. But Mr.
Sekulow was undeterred a few minutes later.

“I am confident that whether it is Saturday, or Monday or Tuesday that
the case will be made defending the president,” he said. “I have no
doubt.”

## [Pelosi keeps a tight grip on impeachment.](#pelosi-impeachment)

</div>

</div>

Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s role in the impeachment of Mr. Trump may be
formally over, but by her own design, the matter is not out of her
hands.

Even in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled
through Poland and Israel in remembrance of the 75th anniversary of the
liberation of Auschwitz, she had [her hand firmly on the
tiller](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/23/us/politics/pelosi-trump-impeachment.html)
of the prosecution of the president.

In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the
Democrats’ case.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

She selected the group of seven House impeachment managers from among
her closest and most loyal advisers, placing at its helm Representative
Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, a trusted protégé whom she
privately calls “the general.”

Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at
the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her
eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers’ written briefs before they
were filed.

And the multipronged media campaign to make the case for Mr. Trump’s
removal is being run out of her office, by her communications director
and other staff.

“Look, she cares a lot about this,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of
New York and the minority leader, said in a brief interview.

## [Galleries draw visitors eager to watch the trial unfold.](#galleries-trial-senate)

</div>

</div>

The presentations at the Senate impeachment trial on Thursday have been
some of the most dense yet, starting with a historical lecture about the
constitutional roots of impeachment and later delving deeply into the
details of President Trump’s actions.

But that hasn’t kept the public away.

The public galleries in the Senate were as full as they have been all
week, with almost 200 people listening quietly as the House managers
presented their case. The galleries no doubt included some Senate staff
members and others who were assigned to be there. But there appeared to
be plenty of regular attendees, too — people just eager to watch a bit
of history unfold.

President Trump is nowhere near the Capitol, but the House managers are
still using his words against him.

At several points on Thursday, the House members prosecuting the
articles of impeachment have used video clips of Mr. Trump as evidence
of his motives in pressuring Ukraine for investigations into the Bidens.

Building his case that Mr. Trump wanted Ukrainian investigations that
benefited him politically, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House
manager, showed several clips, including one in which Mr. Trump referred
to the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered with his campaign in
2016.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

“There was a lot of corruption having to do with the 2016 election
against us, and we want to get to the bottom it and it’s very important
that we do,” Mr. Trump said in the clip, his voice echoing through the
chamber.

Mr. Schiff quickly made his point: “He’s not concerned about actual
corruption cases, only matters that affect him personally.”

Later, as Mr. Schiff argued that Mr. Trump only cared about
investigations into the Bidens, he used a video clip of the president’s
own words, as he discussed his interest in working with Ukraine on
corruption.

“And let me tell you something, Biden’s son is corrupt. And Biden is
corrupt,” the president said in the clip.

## [Democrats make a strategic decision in focusing on the Bidens. Trump’s lawyer sees a mistake.](#democrats-make-a-strategic-decision-in-focusing-on-the-bidens-trumps-lawyer-sees-a-mistake)

</div>

</div>

The House managers made a strategic decision on Thursday to focus
extensive attention on the actions of former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.

The lengthy presentation — by Representative Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas,
one of the House managers — was aimed at proving that [there was no
basis to President Trump’s
assertions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/22/us/politics/biden-ukraine-trump.html)
that the former vice president and his son did improper things in
Ukraine.

“Common sense will tell us that this allegation against Joe Biden is
false,” Ms. Garcia told the senators.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

But allies of Mr. Trump quickly pounced on the extended discussion about
the Bidens to insist that the impeachment trial should include scrutiny
of their actions, and potentially a move to call them as witnesses.

Mr. Trump’s Republican defenders have long argued that [the president’s
demand](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/01/22/us/politics/impeachment-articles-arguments.html)
that Ukraine announce investigations into the Bidens was not improper
because he was merely interested in rooting out corruption in that
country.

At least one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers suggested the Democrats made a
mistake in focusing on the former vice president and his son.

“They have opened the door,” said Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer for Mr.
Trump and a member of his impeachment legal defense team. “It’s now
relevant.”

Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri and a staunch ally of the
president, made the same point in a tweet during a break after the
presentation.

<div class="css-nj25e3">

> WOW, House managers make extended argument that Hunter Biden’s work w/

</div>

The rules of the Senate trial say the senators are [supposed to be
sitting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/21/us/politics/senate-impeachment.html)
in their seats throughout the presentation. In President Trump’s trial,
they are treating that rule rather liberally.

At one point Thursday morning, when Representative Jerrold Nadler of New
York finished his presentation, 19 seats on the Senate floor belonging
to a mix of Republicans and Democrats were empty, according to Peter
Baker, The New York Times’s chief White House correspondent, who was
sitting in the press gallery.

Most were only vacant for a few minutes. It appeared, Mr. Baker said,
that several senators were treating the end of Mr. Nadler’s presentation
— which was followed immediately by one from a fellow House manager,
Representative Sylvia R. Garcia of New York — as an unofficial break.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

Ten minutes after the end of Mr. Nadler’s presentation, 10 seats were
still empty. Five minutes after that, most of the senators had wandered
back in, and only four seats were empty.

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic presidential candidate,
was one of the senators who left, at 1:59 p.m. She returned 15 minutes
later, taking her seat again at 2:14 p.m.

## [Rand Paul takes a break from doodling to silently make a point.](#rand-paul-takes-a-break-from-doodling-to-silently-make-a-point)

</div>

</div>

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky had a white legal notepad in front of him
as Thursday’s impeachment trial began — and he was busy doodling.

On the top page, Mr. Paul had created an extensive, and impressive,
doodle of the United States Capitol. Drawn with a blue ballpoint pen,
the drawing covered the entire bottom third of the paper.

At one point, Representative Sylvia Garcia of Texas, a House manager,
showed a video clip of [George P. Kent, a State Department
official](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/07/us/politics/george-kent-impeachment-testimony.html),
being
[asked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/11/07/us/politics/george-kent-transcript.html)
whether some Republicans, like Mr. Paul, believed that what President
Trump did in Ukraine was the same as what former Vice President Joseph
R. Biden did when he tried to get a corrupt prosecutor fired.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

Looking up from his doodle, Mr. Paul smiled and raised a fist with his
index finger extended, as if to say, “Yes\!” Then, when Mr. Kent
answered by saying that what Mr. Biden did was very different than what
Mr. Trump did, Mr. Paul lowered his arm.

And he went back to his doodle.

Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, began the House presentation on Thursday with
an hourlong lecture on the constitutional history of impeachment.

He insisted that the history of the Constitution makes it clear that a
criminal violation is not necessary to impeach the president. In making
the argument, he cited words from some of President Trump’s key allies
in his impeachment defense: [Alan
Dershowitz](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/17/us/politics/alan-dershowitz-trump.html),
a member of the president’s impeachment team; William P. Barr, the
attorney general; and [Senator Lindsey
Graham](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/impeachment-trial-live-01-23/senator-lindsey-graham-misses-a-clip-of-a-speech-he-made-during-clintons-trial-in-1999#live-blog-list),
Republican of South Carolina.

He concluded his presentation with a forceful assertion to the senators:
“Impeachment is aimed at presidents who act as if they are above the
law, at presidents who believe their own interests are more important
than those of the nation, and thus at president who ignore right and
wrong in pursuit of their own gain.”

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

“Abuse. Betrayal. Corruption,” he said. “Here are the core offenses, the
framers feared most. The president’s abuse of power, his betrayal of the
national interest, and his corruption of our elections plainly qualified
as great and dangerous offenses.”

Drawing on legal scholars and liberally quoting historical figures, Mr.
Nadler argued that the founders of the nation envisioned that
impeachment would be required for presidential abuses of power like the
misconduct the House alleged when it passed two [articles of
impeachment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/12/10/us/politics/articles-impeachment-document-pdf.html).

As senators settled in for another long day of arguments from the House
managers, there was already talk among lawmakers and their aides of a
potentially abbreviated weekend trial schedule.

Under one proposal being discussed, the Senate could convene as a court
of impeachment early on Saturday, around 10 a.m. and meet for a far
shorter session than usual. That would theoretically allow senators who
wanted to travel home — or for Democrats running for president, [to
campaign in early voting
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment-democratic-candidates.html)
— for 36 hours before the trial resumes on Monday.

The Senate’s impeachment rules normally require the trial to meet every
Monday to Saturday at 1 p.m. until a verdict is reached. That late daily
start time is meant to accommodate Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.,
who maintains a morning case schedule at the Supreme Court before
presiding over the trial. But Chief Justice Roberts does not have court
business on Saturdays.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

The decision may also depend on the president’s lawyers, who are
scheduled to begin their defense against the House charges on Saturday.
If they want to move the trial along as quickly as possible, they could
ask for an early start on Saturday but also that the session be allowed
to run into the evening. Or they could simply shorten their arguments.

“I suspect we’ll start on Saturday, and then we’ll go, probably another
day or two, but who knows,” Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers said
Wednesday night. “I mean we’ve got to make that determination, with our
team.”

Any change would require consent from both Democrats and Republicans.

</div>

</div>

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of the
impeachment managers in 1999, left the Senate chamber just minutes
before House Democrats played a video of him speaking during President
Bill Clinton’s trial.

In the clip, Mr. Graham gave a broad definition of a “high crime”: “It’s
just when you’re using your office in a way that hurts people, you’ve
committed a high crime,” he said.

One of the Republicans’ talking points is that there was no crime
underlying President Trump’s conduct, therefore it was not impeachable.
[That argument is widely
disputed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/20/us/politics/trump-impeachment-legal-defense.html).

Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, who sits next to Mr.
Graham on the Senate floor, briefly patted the South Carolina
Republican’s empty seat as the video began to
play.

As Democrats spoke in the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence announced
that President Trump had asked him to [invite to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel to
Washington](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/23/world/middleeast/israel-peaceplan-kushner.html)
next week to discuss “regional issues, as well as the prospect of peace
here in the Holy Land.”

Mr. Pence, who is visiting Jerusalem, said at Mr. Netanyahu’s request he
had also invited Benny Gantz, an opposition leader in Israel. Mr.
Netanyahu said he would “gladly accept.”

It is another instance of the administration moving forward with
legislative and diplomatic work while the impeachment trial is going on
in the Senate.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

On Wednesday, Republican senators held a ceremonial event to formally
send Mr. Trump’s revised North American trade pact to his desk for his
signature.
