\subsection{Frequently Asked
Questions}\label{frequently-asked-questions}}

 Should I refinance my mortgage?

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html}{It
could be a good idea,} because mortgage rates have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html}{never
been lower.} Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to
some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be
aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

 What is school going to look like in September?

It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this
fall, requiring the grind of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html}{online
learning},
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html}{makeshift
child care} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html}{stunted
workdays} to continue. California's two largest public school districts
--- Los Angeles and San Diego --- said on July 13, that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html}{instruction
will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students
and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students.
They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For
other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach.
\href{https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/}{Many
systems}, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html}{hybrid
plans} that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your
municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your
community.

 Is the coronavirus airborne?

The coronavirus
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html}{can
stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air}, infecting people
as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is
highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help
explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches
and restaurants.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html}{It's
unclear how often the virus is spread} via these tiny droplets, or
aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick
person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with
contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia
Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales,
talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
who
\href{https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798}{have
outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health
Organization}.

 What are the symptoms of coronavirus?

Common symptoms
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html}{include
fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of
breath.} Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html}{The
C.D.C. has also} added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a
new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for.
Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may
appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

 Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?

So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two
days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44
percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who
were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World
Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by
people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html\#link-1f302e21}{but
she later walked back that statement.}
