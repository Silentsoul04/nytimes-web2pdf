Debates during this midterm election cycle have been notable largely for
their

and the
\href{//www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/politics/first-draft/2014/10/23/?entry=3311\&_php=true\&_type=blogs\&ref=politics}{occasional
backhanded compliment}.

But on this day in 1980, Ronald Reagan, the former governor of
California and the Republican presidential nominee, showed how
congeniality could be a winning strategy.

In the only debate of the campaign, Mr. Reagan sought to be calm and
reassuring in contrast to President Jimmy Carter's focus on scoring
points with sharp retorts, The New York Times reported at the time.

While the candidates differed over economic strategy and taxes, the
debate was made memorable by Mr. Reagan's ``there you go again'' remark
(insisting that Mr. Carter was misrepresenting his positions) and when
Mr. Reagan asked viewers: ``Are you better off than you were four years
ago?''

The Times reported that there was ``no clear winner'' in the debate. A
week later, there was, as Mr. Reagan won the election handily.
