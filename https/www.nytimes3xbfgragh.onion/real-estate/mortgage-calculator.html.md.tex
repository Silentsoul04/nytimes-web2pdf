Use this calculator to figure out what you will pay each month for your
mortgage --- the amount of money you intend to borrow to buy your new
home. Enter the numbers in the box for each item, or use the slider.
Your monthly payment will appear on the right.

That monthly payment includes repaying what you've borrowed(the
principal) as well as the bank's fee for borrowing the money(the
interest).

Mortgage Loan Type?

Choose the mortgage term. A 15-year fixed mortgage will have a higher
monthly payment because you will be paying back more of the loan each
month than you would if the loan lasted 30 years. But you will pay more
interest overall with a 30-year loan.
