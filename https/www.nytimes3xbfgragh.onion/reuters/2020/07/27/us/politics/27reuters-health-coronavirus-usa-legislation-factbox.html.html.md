WASHINGTON — The Republican leadership of the U.S. Senate has introduced
its proposal for the next coronavirus relief package, a $1 trillion plan
called the Heals Act.

Below is a look at how it compares with the Heroes Act that passed the
Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in May:

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Republican plan: Would reduce the expanded unemployment benefit from the
current $600 per week, which expires on Friday, to $200 a week, in
addition to state unemployment benefits, and extend the program for two
more months. After that, states are to pay employees about 70% of the
income they had before they lost their jobs.

Democratic plan: Extends weekly enhanced unemployment payments of $600
through January 2021.

DIRECT PAYMENTS

Senate Republican plan: Includes $1,200 per individual; Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell promised "even more support for families who care
for vulnerable adult dependents."

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Democratic plan: $1,200 per family member, up to $6,000 per household.

LIABILITY PROTECTION:

Republican plan: Includes as one of its core proposals measures to
protect businesses and institutions from coronavirus-related lawsuits if
they are following government guidelines.

Democratic plan: did not include anything on this and Democratic leaders
have pushed back against the idea.

SCHOOLS

Republican plan: Includes $70 billion for helping schools to reopen and
$30 billion for colleges and universities.

Democratic plan: $100 billion to support the educational needs of
states, school districts and institutions of higher education in
response to coronavirus.

TESTING, CONTACT TRACING AND TREATMENT

Republican plan: $16 billion for coronavirus testing; $25 billion for
hospitals.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Democratic plan: $75 billion for testing, tracing and isolation
measures, and to support hospitals and healthcare providers and ensure
free access to treatment for individuals.

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM

Democratic plan: Gives small businesses more flexibility with how they
use loans from this program (previously they were required to use 75%
for payroll expenses, or be forced to pay it back as a loan)

Republican plan: Would allow the hardest-hit smallest employers, whose
revenue has declined by 50% or more, to get a second forgivable loan
under the program. To qualify, businesses must have 300 or fewer
employees.

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

Democratic plan: Nearly $1 trillion in aid to state, local, territorial
and tribal governments to help pay first responders, healthcare workers
and teachers.

Republican plan: Does not include new money, but Republicans said it
would give state and local leaders more flexibility in spending the $150
billion passed into law in March.
