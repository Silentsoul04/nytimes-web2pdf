WASHINGTON --- The Republican leadership of the U.S. Senate has
introduced its proposal for the next coronavirus relief package, a \$1
trillion plan called the Heals Act.

Below is a look at how it compares with the Heroes Act that passed the
Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in May:

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Republican plan: Would reduce the expanded unemployment benefit from the
current \$600 per week, which expires on Friday, to \$200 a week, in
addition to state unemployment benefits, and extend the program for two
more months. After that, states are to pay employees about 70\% of the
income they had before they lost their jobs.

Democratic plan: Extends weekly enhanced unemployment payments of \$600
through January 2021.

DIRECT PAYMENTS

Senate Republican plan: Includes \$1,200 per individual; Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell promised "even more support for families who care
for vulnerable adult dependents."

Democratic plan: \$1,200 per family member, up to \$6,000 per household.

LIABILITY PROTECTION:

Republican plan: Includes as one of its core proposals measures to
protect businesses and institutions from coronavirus-related lawsuits if
they are following government guidelines.

Democratic plan: did not include anything on this and Democratic leaders
have pushed back against the idea.

SCHOOLS

Republican plan: Includes \$70 billion for helping schools to reopen and
\$30 billion for colleges and universities.

Democratic plan: \$100 billion to support the educational needs of
states, school districts and institutions of higher education in
response to coronavirus.

TESTING, CONTACT TRACING AND TREATMENT

Republican plan: \$16 billion for coronavirus testing; \$25 billion for
hospitals.

Democratic plan: \$75 billion for testing, tracing and isolation
measures, and to support hospitals and healthcare providers and ensure
free access to treatment for individuals.

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM

Democratic plan: Gives small businesses more flexibility with how they
use loans from this program (previously they were required to use 75\%
for payroll expenses, or be forced to pay it back as a loan)

Republican plan: Would allow the hardest-hit smallest employers, whose
revenue has declined by 50\% or more, to get a second forgivable loan
under the program. To qualify, businesses must have 300 or fewer
employees.

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

Democratic plan: Nearly \$1 trillion in aid to state, local, territorial
and tribal governments to help pay first responders, healthcare workers
and teachers.

Republican plan: Does not include new money, but Republicans said it
would give state and local leaders more flexibility in spending the
\$150 billion passed into law in March.
