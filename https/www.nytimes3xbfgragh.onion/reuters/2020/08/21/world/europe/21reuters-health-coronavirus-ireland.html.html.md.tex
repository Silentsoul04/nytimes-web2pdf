DUBLIN --- Ireland's prime minister on Friday accepted the resignation
of Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary after his attendance at a social
event which may have breached COVID-19 regulations drew a wave of public
anger.

"His attendance at this event was wrong and an error of judgment on his
part. I have accepted his resignation," Prime Minister Micheál Martin
said in a statement.

"People all over the country have made very difficult,
personal~sacrifices in their family lives and in their businesses to
comply with COVID regulations. This event should not have gone ahead in
the manner it did."
