BEIJING --- Sinovac Biotech Ltd's coronavirus vaccine candidate
CoronaVac was approved in July for emergency use as part of a programme
in China to vaccinate high-risk groups such as medical staff, a person
familiar with the matter said.

China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a unit of state-owned pharmaceutical
giant China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), also said it had
obtained emergency use approval for a coronavirus vaccine candidate in
social media platform WeChat on Sunday.

CNBG, which has two vaccine candidates in phase 3 clinical trials, did
not say which of its vaccines had been cleared for emergency use.

China has been giving experimental coronavirus vaccines to high-risk
groups since July, and a health official told state media in an
interview aired last week that authorities could consider modestly
expanding the emergency use programme to try to prevent possible
outbreaks during the autumn and winter.

Officially, China has given little details on which vaccine candidates
have been given to high-risk people under the emergency use programme
and how many people have been vaccinated.

State media reported in June, prior to the emergency use programme, that
employees at state firms travelling overseas were allowed to take one of
the two vaccines being developed by CNBG, while China's military had
also approved the use of CanSino Biologics' vaccine candidate.

Seven vaccines against the coronavirus are in final trial stages around
the world, and four of them are from China.

But no vaccine has yet passed the final stage of trials proving it is
safe and effective - conditions usually required to be met to get
regulatory approval for mass use. COVID-19 has killed over 800,000
people worldwide.
