  El Encebollado de Rossy serves homey and expertly prepared versions of
  coastal Ecuadorean specialties. On the weekends, the chef and co-owner
  Rossy Alarcón arrives at 4 a.m. to begin making stock for her
  encebollado, a fish soup thickened with yuca and garnished with
  paper-thin slices of red onion.

  Pastrami Masters is perhaps the city's only halal Jewish deli with a

  brisket are nearly identical to the ones at David's Brisket House in
  Bedford-Stuyvesant, which has the same owners.

  whose best-known creation is a pancake will be able to keep up. They

  The first JoJu opened in 2011 on a crowded strip of Elmhurst, Queens,
  selling Vietnamese banh mi in wax-paper egg-roll bags off a menu in
  Chinese and English. Eight years later, a second JoJu appeared on
  Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, with iPad kiosks and branded
  takeout boxes in lemongrass-green. The banh mi remain exemplary, if
  not wholly traditional, with classic pâté and quivery head cheese
  offered alongside Korean bulgogi. Twice-fried fries come heaped with
  pickled daikon and carrots, cilantro and jalapeño, and lashed with
  spicy mayo, a demi-glace of pork stock and the kind of bright-hot
  green sauce that anoints Peruvian roast chicken. The chef, Julie Wong,
  said, ``I wanted to embrace Queens as a melting pot.''

  The Tavern by WS is very nearly another case of an aging brand getting
  funky on the dance floor to prove that the old man's still got it.
  (The initials stand for Wine Spectator, whose publisher is one of the
  owners.) But somewhere in an unseen kitchen behind those walls a
  brigade of cooks is working like crazy to keep that from happening.
