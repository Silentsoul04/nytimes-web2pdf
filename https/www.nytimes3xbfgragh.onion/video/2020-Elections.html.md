## Highlights From the Democratic National Convention: Night 4

#### On the last night of the convention, Joseph R. Biden Jr. officially accepted the Democratic nomination for president. In the most important speech of his career, he said that Americans “will overcome this season of darkness.”

</div>

  -   
    “Welcome to the fourth night of the 2020 Democratic National
    Convention: ‘Uniting America.’ OK, these last few nights have been
    going so well, we’ve decided to add a fifth night where we will just
    play Michelle Obama’s speech on a loop.” “We’ve cried out for
    justice. We have gathered in our streets to demand change. And now
    we must pass on the gift John Lewis sacrificed to give us: We must
    register and we must vote.” “Our military spouses hold their
    families together, praying for their loved ones’ safety wherever
    they’re deployed and serving as caregivers to our disabled
    servicemembers, and then picking up the pieces and starting again,
    whenever the next tour or the next war arises. Joe Biden understands
    these sacrifices because he’s made them himself. When his son Beau
    deployed to Iraq, his burden was also shouldered by his family. Joe
    knows the fear military families live because he’s felt that dread
    of never knowing if your deployed loved one is safe.” “A couple of
    years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. And I was absolutely
    terrified. One of the first people who called me was Joe. His real
    warmth and kindness on that call — man, I gotta say, it made me
    cry.” “I am very excited to present to you a group of people that
    ran in the 2020 Democratic primary against Joe Biden. You could
    think of this sort of like ‘Survivor’ on the out-interviews of all
    the people that got voted off the island.” \[laughing\] “Bernie —
    Bernie, don’t you laugh, because I’ve got questions for you like,
    Why does my girlfriend like you more than she likes me? But let’s —”
    “Because she’s smarter than you, and that’s the obvious answer,
    right?” \[laughing\] “Hi, my name is Brayden Harrington and I am 13
    years old. And without Joe Biden, I wouldn’t be talking to you
    today. About a few months ago, I met him in New Hampshire. He told
    me that we were members of the same club. We stutter. It was really
    amazing to hear that someone like me became vice president. I’m just
    a regular kid. And in this short amount of time, Joe Biden made me
    more confident about something that’s bothered me my whole life.”
    “If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of
    us, not the worst. I’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness.
    It’s time for us, for We the People, to come together. And make no
    mistake: United we can and will overcome this season of darkness in
    America. We’ll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness
    over privilege. So it’s with great honor and humility I accept this
    nomination for president of the United States of America. As
    president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the
    virus that has ruined so many lives. Because I understand something
    this president hasn’t from the beginning: We will never get our
    economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in
    schools, we’ll never have our lives back, until we deal with this
    virus. While he’s no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day.
    Beau served our nation in uniform, a year in Iraq, a decorated Iraqi
    War veteran. So I take very personally the profound responsibility
    of serving as commander in chief. I’ll be a president who will stand
    with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries:
    The days of cozying up to dictators is over. Just a week ago
    yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in
    Charlottesville. Close your eyes — remember what you saw on
    television. Remember seeing those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white
    supremacists coming out of fields with lighted torches, veins
    bulging, spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in
    the ’30s. Remember the violent clash that ensued between those
    spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. And
    remember what the president said when asked? He said there were,
    quote, ‘very fine people on both sides.’ It was a wake-up call for
    us as a country, and for me a call to action. At that moment, I knew
    I’d have to run, because my father taught us that silence was
    complicity and I could never remain silent or complicit. May history
    be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness
    began here tonight, as love and hope and light join in the battle
    for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle we will win, and
    we’ll do it together, I promise you.” \[music, Coldplay, “A Sky
    Full Of
Stars”\]
