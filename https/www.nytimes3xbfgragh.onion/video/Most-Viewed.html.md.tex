  It's Friday on the streets of Kashmir's largest city. It's the day
  Muslims normally gather to pray. But in recent weeks, it's also become
  a day of protest. Indian authorities are working hard to keep a lid on
  displays like this. But they can't change how people feel. As protests
  break out across Kashmir, Indian officials repeat what has become a
  well-worn soundbite. ``There have been no major law and order
  situations reported from across the Valley. Life is slowly returning
  to normal.'' ``And the situation is returning back slowly to the
  normal.'' But things here don't seem normal. Kashmir has been a
  conflict zone for decades. But when India moved to strip the region of
  its autonomy on Aug. 5, the situation came to this: thousands more
  troops and a curfew bringing daily life to a standstill. Phone lines
  and internet access were shut down, cutting off around eight million
  Kashmiris from the outside world. So, we came to see what's actually
  happening here. We visit a neighborhood known for frequent clashes
  between protesters and Indian security forces. People, here, are in
  mourning. Fahmida Shagoo was at home with her children and her in-laws
  on Aug. 9. Police started firing tear gas at protesters outside.
  Fahmida's husband, Rafiq, helped rush her to the hospital. But doctors
  could not revive her. A sudden death and no one to hold accountable.
  In addition to tear gas, for years, Indian forces have used pellet
  guns to quell unrest in Kashmir. These shotguns fire cartridges full
  of lead pellets that lodge themselves in the flesh. They are
  supposedly non-lethal, but can cause life-changing disabilities.
  Parvez Sofi says he was at home when he heard a commotion outside.
  When he opened the door to see what was happening, he became a target.
  In the name of maintaining law and order, Indian forces have license
  to shoot with near impunity in Kashmir. There is no official number
  for the injured. But in just one hospital here, sources told us over
  60 people had been admitted with pellet wounds since the lockdown
  began. Still, this doesn't stop some people. And lives here have been
  upended in other ways, too. This woman's 22-year-old son, Mehraj
  Ud-Din, was arrested. She doesn't know why he was taken. Since then,
  authorities have been giving her conflicting information. This is not
  an isolated case. Since early August, thousands have been arrested
  without being charged. And there's no indication when or if they'll be
  released. Although some landlines have been reconnected, Kashmir is
  still largely cut off from the rest of the world. That helps
  authorities keep stories like these quiet. But as the days pass,
  they're getting louder.
