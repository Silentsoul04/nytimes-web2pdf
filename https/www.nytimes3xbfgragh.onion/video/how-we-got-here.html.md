## Why the Iowa Caucuses Are So Important

#### Protests in the 1960s, a mimeograph machine and a long-shot candidate all contributed to Iowa’s unlikely role in the presidential election process.

</div>

  -   
    This was Iowa caucus night back in the mid-1970s. And these are
    members of the national media covering the voting. It was so unusual
    to see national media in Iowa back then that people actually paid to
    watch them. “The Democratic Party charged $15 a head for people to
    watch the media watch the people.” See, in previous years, Iowa’s
    caucuses just hadn’t attracted national attention. “There are 3,000
    frozen media members in downtown Des Moines …” Just over a decade
    later, Iowa is the place to be. “… It’s Iowa caucus night. Let’s
    party.” \[shouting\] The caucuses are now a key part of the
    presidential election cycle. “Bush, 57.” They’re the first chance to
    see what kind of support candidates have among voters. So how did we
    get here, from caucuses that only Iowans seem to care about to the
    national spectacle we see today? Turns out, a lot of it was
    accidental. For most of Iowa’s history, its caucuses were dominated
    by political insiders. There was little room for input from
    rank-and-file members. An historian writing in the 1940s put it like
    this: “The larger number of party voters were deprived of a voice.”
    But the old ways start coming to an end in 1968. The country’s in
    turmoil, and so is the Democratic Party, mostly over the Vietnam War
    and civil rights. Basically, the party establishment wants to handle
    things one way, and many rank-and-file members have other ideas. All
    this comes to a head as the Democrats hold their national
    convention. Protesters gather outside. So do police. Inside, the
    mood is also tense. All this division leads the Democratic Party to
    rethink the nomination rules to include the voices of all party
    members in the process. This is how we come to the moment when Iowa
    becomes key to electing a president, basically by accident. First
    up, how Iowa became first to hold a presidential contest. It starts
    with new rules to give everyday members more of a say. So by 1972,
    winning Iowa now involves four stages. Iowans choose their top
    candidates, first at the precinct level. These are the caucuses at
    the heart of this story. But technically, there’s further voting at
    the county, congressional district and state levels. The new rules
    make things a lot more inclusive, but this creates new delays.
    Committees need to be formed, and everyone needs to have up-to-date
    party materials. The problem is, the state party only has an old
    mimeograph machine to make copies of all this. It’s really slow. So
    because of an old machine and a bunch of new logistics, the party
    decides it needs at least a month between each step to do it all.
    The national convention is set for early July, so you’d think that
    the state-level convention would happen about a month before, in
    June. Except, the party can’t find a venue that’s available to hold
    everyone. That little detail helps push everything earlier in a
    chain reaction. See what’s going on here? The precinct caucuses now
    have to happen early in the year. The party chooses a date that
    makes Iowa’s the first presidential contest. The New Hampshire
    primary has been the first kickoff contest since the 1950s, but Iowa
    Democrats aren’t necessarily looking for national attention. They
    just think it’ll be fun to be first. Still, attention is what they
    get. The story begins with George McGovern. “People didn’t know much
    about the Iowa caucuses. As a matter of fact, there wasn’t a great
    deal of interest in them.” He’s the long-shot candidate. He’s been
    at the bottom of national polls. “He often walked the campaign trail
    alone, little known by the voters.” Most people think this guy,
    Edmund Muskie, is going to be the big winner in Iowa. “That
    challenge is great, but we can meet it.” Then comes caucus night. As
    the people vote, state party officials gather at their headquarters.
    Richard Bender is one of them. “And we had about 10 or 12 press
    people show up. These press people included one guy, Johnny Apple.”
    Johnny Apple, a 37-year-old political correspondent for The New York
    Times. Iowa’s Democrats aren’t ready to publicize the results right
    away. They hadn’t expected much demand. According to Bender, only
    Johnny Apple asked for them that night. “I happen to be fascinated
    with such things, so I made it my business, beforehand, to
    understand it.” Bender sets up a phone tree to gather results from
    across the state. He adds them up himself with a calculator. And the
    next day, Apple’s article helps swing the national spotlight onto
    the caucuses. He’s got quite the story to tell. Muskie’s won, but
    just barely. Not the runaway win people were expecting. And McGovern
    comes in a strong second. No one expected that, either. The reformed
    caucus rules helped a long-shot candidate rise to the top. And
    because this is happening so early in the election now, and because
    Apple’s article gives the results national coverage, something else
    happens. “That got picked up by some of the national news shows.”
    “The Democratic front-runner has been damaged in Iowa.” “And wow,
    all of a sudden, we were being paid attention to.” McGovern
    eventually wins the Democratic nomination. “I accept your nomination
    with a full and grateful heart.” He loses the presidential election,
    but some haven’t forgotten what those early caucuses did for
    McGovern, including Georgia’s former governor, Jimmy Carter. Three
    years later … “There was a major headline on the editorial page of
    the Atlanta Constitution that said, ‘Jimmy Carter’s running for
    what?’ \[laughter\] And the ‘What’ was about this big. \[applause\]
    I’m running for president.” … Carter heads to Iowa before any other
    Democratic candidate. He’s got no national profile. “He didn’t have
    hordes of press following him around. It was a very lonely
    campaign.” Washington pundits call his candidacy laughable. “I
    remember when we couldn’t find a microphone.” “Jimmy Who?” becomes a
    catchphrase. Carter’s own campaign film plays it up. “Jimmy who?” “I
    don’t know who he is.” But as long as Iowans come to know him and
    like him, Carter bets that the media will start paying attention,
    just like with McGovern four years earlier. Carter campaigns as
    locally as possible. One day, he learns that he’s been invited on a
    local TV show. “And I said, that is great. I can’t believe it. I
    said, ‘What are we going to do?’ He said, ‘Do you have any favorite
    recipes?’ And I said, ‘What do you mean, recipes?’ He said, ‘Well,
    this is a cooking show.’ Well, they put a white apron on me and a
    chef’s hat. That was my only access to TV when I first began to
    campaign in Iowa.” His opponents are in Iowa, too, but they spend
    far less time there. Carter wins. “Surprisingly top of the class
    after his win in a somewhat obscure race in Iowa against the
    others.” “You can’t tell until we go to the other 49 states, but
    it’s encouraging for us.” A year later … “I, Jimmy Carter, do
    solemnly swear —” … he becomes the 39th president. Now we need to
    head to 1980 because we haven’t talked about the Republicans yet.
    Here’s the state’s Republican chairman that year. He’s asked why
    Iowa’s caucuses have become so important. “I think because Jimmy
    Carter got his start in Iowa in 1976.” The Republicans in Iowa are
    keen to copy the Democrat’s success, and one candidate in particular
    gets inspired by Carter’s underdog win: George H.W. Bush. He’s
    running against Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and others, and he’s near
    the bottom of the pack. “Your name isn’t really a household word,
    but Ronald Reagan can —” But Bush goes big in Iowa. He gets a
    surprise win. It’s a far cry from just months before. “I was an
    asterisk in those days. And my feelings got hurt. And now, I’m no
    longer an asterisk.” Bush is now the third underdog to get a boost
    from the caucuses. The next morning on CBS, he distills the essence
    of this new Iowa effect. “We will have forward, ‘Big Mo’ on our
    side, as they say in athletics.” “ ‘Big Mo?’ ” “Yeah. Mo —
    momentum.” Bush loses to Reagan, but becomes vice president. And
    the desire to capture the “Big Mo” from Iowa has only grown, thanks
    in large part to Iowa’s embrace of being first, and the media storm
    that descends every four years. That’s despite the fact that most
    candidates who win … “This is a job interview.” … don’t become
    president. Plus, many point out that the state’s overwhelmingly
    white population doesn’t reflect the country’s diversity. “I
    actually think that we can find places that represent that balance
    of urban and rural better.” But the race to get the “Big Mo” out of
    Iowa persists because it’s the first chance to upend expectations,
    and put political fates in the voters’
hands.
