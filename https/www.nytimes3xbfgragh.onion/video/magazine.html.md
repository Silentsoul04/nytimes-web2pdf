## The Night Fox News and Trump Became One

#### When Sean Hannity of Fox News appeared onstage at a rally with President Trump — and called the press corps “fake news” from the podium — it was the culmination of the network’s shift from its “fair and balanced” founding days to a post-Ailes MAGA messaging machine.

</div>

  -   
    “Promises made. Promises kept.” This is the night Fox crossed the
    line between where the network ends and President Trump begins. And
    I’m going to tell you how we got here. “America, you have the power.
    Tomorrow, you can shock the world again.” “Hello everyone. We are
    out here live on Facebook at President Trump’s rally in Cape
    Girardeau.” This is not just any rally. It’s the night before a
    historic midterm election. Control of Congress, the future of
    Trump’s presidency, it’s all on the line. Missouri is a key
    battleground. And team Trump is pulling out all the stops to fire up
    the base. This is the birthplace, the hometown of Rush Limbaugh.
    There’s no more sacred ground in conservative media. “What an honor.
    This is so exciting\! I have been watching Trump rallies” — Lo and
    behold, word goes out, Sean Hannity will be among the presenters.
    Well, that would be astonishing. Mind you, this is the top person in
    all of cable news — Fox News’s PR department, their phones are
    ringing off the hook. Sean Hannity is supposed to be like an opinion
    columnist. Fox allows him to take great liberty, but he still has
    to, at least, abide by some measure of news standards. Talent for a
    news organization should not be openly campaigning with a candidate.
    It erases any line between the news organization and the campaign.
    Hannity completely denies it, tweets out: “I will not be on stage
    campaigning with the president.” He says he’s just covering the
    final rally for his show. “Sean Hannity, come on up, Sean Hannity.”
    That one small step for Sean Hannity would be a giant step for the
    network that pledged to make the news “fair and balanced.” So, how
    did we get to this moment? It all started with an Australian media
    mogul who wanted to take on the world. Rupert Murdoch, from the
    minute he steps ashore in the United States in the ’70s, is all
    about upending the elitist news environment. He wants to blow up the
    entire media system here. “With a publishing empire in New York
    alone, that includes The Post, New York Magazine, Village Voice.”
    Murdoch’s expanding his empire in the United States just as a new
    right-wing radio star enters the scene. “Rush Limbaugh, talent on
    loan from God.” Rush Limbaugh is a national hit — he is huge.
    “That’s more like it\!” Limbaugh is a game changer for the
    conservative base. But what Limbaugh doesn’t have is the gravitas of
    a news operation. Murdoch sees a big opportunity and he finds the
    perfect accomplice. “I’m here with Roger Ailes, who has been called
    the Ernest Hemingway of campaign advisers.” Roger Ailes was in the
    Nixon White House. He knows Watergate happens because The Washington
    Post, this beacon of credibility, this mainstream news organization,
    takes down a president. Ailes and Murdoch want that kind of power.
    They start in 1996. The two men make their pitch to the base. “So,
    what will our Fox News be? It will be different and it will be fair,
    because it has to be. Because a very large audience is begging it to
    be.” “On the record. Fair and balanced.” There was a brilliance to
    it. We are fair and balanced because the others aren’t. This makes
    us different. It’s a bullhorn, not a dog whistle, to those people
    who have felt left out by the news conversation. This is for me. For
    a long time, they’re struggling to get any notice. And then, they
    get a gift: the Monica Lewinsky scandal. It’s a salacious story
    tailor-made for Fox. “Get ready with your clicker to turn your
    volume up.” It gripped the base and starts to solidify their
    audience. “The president’s on trial. Our team will keep you
    informed.” And everything flows from there. “On the ground in Lower
    Manhattan.” “Strike happened shortly after dark.” They established
    their news division. “Are American policies too strict or not strict
    enough?” And that news division gave heft to their commentariat. —
    “Since the April deadly shooting” “They’re gonna go after the
    guns.” “Yes.” Ailes also newsified his commentators. “Those who want
    reparations for slavery are misguided.” “Should people who illegally
    sneak into this country be given a free ride?” Sean Hannity, he’s
    not just in a studio in a Lacoste shirt talking to a microphone.
    It’s a news desk. It has flashing headlines. It’s got all the
    accoutrements of news. “We can get you to jump in and listen to
    Hillary.” For many years, it was fair and balanced. “So, let me go
    back to the single mother issue here.” Hannity would square off
    against a liberal named Alan Colmes. “They hate the nuclear family.”
    “Liberals hate the nuclear family?” “Let him, let her finish her
    point.” “Yeah, would you stop interrupting? I’m trying to make a
    point here.” “I lost my head.” But let’s face it, he got his butt
    kicked on almost every debate. It was fair and balanced on the
    surface. But there was a lot more at play underneath it that tilted
    the scales to the right. It’s the secret of their success. “This is
    a Fox News alert.” We’re a news organization like anybody else. And
    we’re going to tell you those other news organizations are wrong.
    They’re lying to you. “These people are not journalists. These are
    not news channels. What you just saw is nothing but left-wing
    propaganda.” “This was a retweet” — “All right, whatever it is.”
    “And it came from sources” — “I told you whatever it is, you
    shouldn’t tweet, ever\!” One thing you have to do if you want to run
    for president as a Republican, it is believed you must visit Rupert
    Murdoch at the Fox headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. You have to
    inform him of your plans. So, Trump informs Rupert that he is
    running for president. And Rupert is eating soup. And as we hear
    this story, he doesn’t even look up from his soup. Rupert is not
    ready to buy into the idea of a Trump presidential run, let alone, a
    Trump presidency. Ailes has the same reaction. And the sentiment
    comes through loud and clear. Trump’s getting pounded on Fox.
    “Loser?” “Loser is Trump, who seems to think this campaign is
    about him.” “It is simply bad anti-terror policy to overreact and
    prohibit Muslims, even if you could, which you can’t\!” “I find him
    offensive.” “I don’t think you’re a first-time offender making a
    personal crack at a woman.” “I just think that belief in Trump is
    misplaced.” It would drive Trump crazy. And he would call Ailes and
    yell and it gets to the point where Trump’s own staff has to try to
    keep him away from the television. And then there’s the bitter proxy
    war with Megyn Kelly. It begins on the national debate stage.
    “You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs.” Trump is
    furious. “You know, you could see there was blood coming out of her
    eyes, blood coming out of her, wherever.” “This afternoon, Fox chief
    Roger Ailes demanding Trump apologize for his latest Twitter tirade
    against host Megyn Kelly.” What it settles into is this really
    interesting power struggle, because Ailes doesn’t take orders from
    candidates. “Before we get to the issues, let’s address the elephant
    not in the room tonight.” Trump doesn’t take orders from anybody.
    “Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening’s presidential
    debate.” They both need each other. Trump needs the Fox audience.
    Fox needs Trump’s ratings. So, there’s just this battle for control
    of effectively, really the party. “Donald Trump is the
    front-runner.” Thirty seven percent to Kasich’s 34.” “Trump is
    leading in Idaho.” “All my money on Trump.” Fox might have been hard
    on Trump, but it didn’t matter. The base loves him. It’s looking
    like Trump’s probably on his way to becoming the Republican nominee.
    “We rarely see black chips here at this table.” Trump isn’t a
    Murdoch kind of guy in terms of temperament, in terms of policy. But
    Murdoch and Ailes have to make a choice: Get behind Trump or risk
    losing their base and their ratings. “This is the great wall of
    Trump, I guess? I don’t know.” In March 2016, Murdoch sends a
    signal: He’s ready to get behind Trump. He tweets out the Republican
    Party would be quote, mad not to unify. Over the course of several
    weeks, you see the different parts of the Murdoch empire get behind
    Trump. “So, big news today is Donald Trump has agreed to sit down
    with yours truly.” The big moment comes when Megyn Kelly goes to
    Trump Tower to make peace. Trump visits Ailes for lunch at the Fox
    headquarters and that’s another breaking of the bread — the truce is
    complete. “Roger Ailes, the architect of the Fox News Network” — But
    a few months later, literally as Trump’s cinching the nomination,
    Ailes is ousted over sexual harassment allegations. “Rupert Murdoch,
    who hired Ailes” — Murdoch takes the helm. He’s back in the
    newsroom. He’s part of the action. It’s just a wild, fun ride.
    Through most of the summer, everyone, including Trump, still thinks
    that Clinton’s probably going to win. Rupert Murdoch and Rupert
    Murdoch’s sons, James and Lachlan, all believe the true future of
    the network is with a Megyn Kelly. Someone who can be Trump critical
    — “Mr. Trump is off base” — and can appeal to sort of moderate
    centrist, suburban Republican women and ideally, some independents.
    They need to grow. “Hillary Clinton has called Donald Trump to
    concede the race.” Trump winning starts to change this calculus
    dramatically. And we start to see a shift in Fox’s primetime lineup.
    “Donald Trump’s son” — Greta Van Susteren? Gone. “He’s right here to
    go on the record.” “I have decided to pursue a new challenge.” Megyn
    Kelly, she lands a big job at NBC. Gone. Bill O’Reilly’s also forced
    out over sexual harassment allegations. Suddenly, their primetime is
    far more pro-Trump than it ever was under Ailes. The new faces? The
    hard-right commentator Tucker Carlson. “Admit the world’s poor they
    tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer, and dirtier and
    more divided.” And the conservative radio star Laura Ingraham. “A
    conservative Republican like Donald Trump to remind us what it was
    all about, freedom.” “What the mainstream media will never tell
    you.” Anchoring it all is Sean Hannity. Ailes used to tell me that
    Hannity’s show was segmented, that its appeal was limited to a
    shrinking hardcore base. But it turned out this wrong. “That I would
    be the bridge between two generations of the Fox News channel. This
    is the next generation.” Trump is ratings gold. His rise to power
    turned Hannity into Fox’s biggest star. And the affection was
    mutual. “One of the reasons I’m supporting Donald Trump this year is
    number one, he’s going to” — Weeks after Ailes was forced out,
    Hannity actually appeared in a video for the Trump campaign. There
    was a stern reprimand from Fox, but it was an early sign that times
    were changing. With a freewheeling Murdoch now running the show and
    Trump in the White House, “fair and balanced” gets lost in the
    ratings chase. The network actually drops the slogan eventually —
    there’s virtually no limit on how far Hannity can go. “As I have
    been warning, Mueller is out to get the President, and it appears at
    any cost. Here’s what happened.” Fox and Trump are now both vying
    for the base’s affection, but the base overwhelmingly only wants
    Trump and Trump cheerleading. “We’ve been talking about for about a
    week now, blanketed in red, white and blue” — The feedback loop is
    just amazing. It becomes an echo chamber. If you ever see daylight
    between them, it’s because one of them isn’t properly giving the
    base what it wants to see. “Do not fall for it, Mr. President.”
    “We’re already on the right track, Mr. President.” “Mr.
    President, I understand the pressure that you are under from every
    side. But the wall at our southern border is a promise that you
    made, ran on, got elected on and must keep.” “From Cape Girardeau,
    Mo., it is our election eve edition.” Which brings us back to the
    rally in Missouri, on the eve of the midterms. Remember, Hannity
    claimed he would just be covering the rally for his show. “Let me
    describe the scene here if I can for everybody. They’re, like,
    firing out hats and T-shirts. I mean, this is, literally, like a
    rock concert.” To Fox News it should be a political event. It’s not
    a rock concert. “There never has been anybody like him. I was
    speaking to Sean Hannity backstage. Do we love Sean, by the way?”
    But the problem is, Sean Hannity is in the band and he’s about to go
    up there and play lead guitar. Here we go — being on stage is just a
    whole other level of involvement. It’s breaking down that last
    little bit of independence that Fox says it expects from even its
    opinion hosts. “By the way, all those people in the back are fake
    news.” It has always been part of Fox’s m.o. to attack the rest of
    the media as biased. But doing it from a stage with the press in the
    building, including his own Fox colleagues — he’s pointing at them,
    among others, saying “fake news.” That was a big deal. This moment
    is a joint play to the base. Now, they’re the real leader of the
    party. “So, anyway. You’re right. U.S.A.” After much uproar, Fox
    says they don’t condone anyone taking the stage. So, they don’t name
    the people who took the stage and that’s all. The tepid response is
    a reflection of where Fox stands right now. It still has real news
    and real journalists. So, they need to signal they’re not officially
    approving what Hannity did, but they will only go so far. The
    opinion hosts are still the ones plugging into the Trump base,
    drawing the ratings and leading the attack against the so-called
    fake news. “By the way their ratings dropped through the floor last
    night” — With a new Murdoch taking the reins at Fox News, there’s
    speculation this dynamic might change. But today, Trump and the
    network are as friendly as ever. “And our friends, Tucker, Sean,
    Laura — through the roof last night.” With 2020 coming into view,
    and both Trump and Fox working to feed the base, how much closer can
    they
get?
