\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is professor Allan Lichtman. He's taught history at American
  University for almost 50 years. He's a former steeplechase champion.
  ``It's a race designed for horses but run by people.''
  ``Tic-Tac-Dough.'' And a former quiz show winner. ``I had a 16-show
  winning streak. Won four cars.'' But we're not here to talk about any
  of that. We're here because ``Allan Lichtman'' ``Allan Lichtman''
  ``Allan Lichtman'' is the Nostradamus of presidential elections. He's
  accurately predicted them for four decades. Yes, even that one.
  ``Donald Trump sent me a note. Congrats professor. Good call. In his
  big Sharpie letters.'' Now Allan's ready to tell us who will win in
  2020. But we'll come back to that. Allan Lichtman is certain we've
  been thinking about elections all wrong. ``The pollsters and the
  pundits cover elections as though they were horse races. But history
  tells us voters are not fooled by the tricks of the campaign. Voters
  vote pragmatically according to how well the party holding the White
  House has governed the country.'' So polls are worthless? ``They are
  snapshots in time. None of this in the end has any impact whatsoever
  on the outcome of a presidential election.'' So Allan Lichtman
  designed a better system to predict presidential winners. He calls it
  ``The Keys to the White House.'' And like some other politics these
  days, there's a Russian involved. ``In 1981, I met Vladimir
  Keilis-Borok. Vladimir turned to me and said, we are going to
  collaborate.'' By the way, Vladimir wasn't a historian or a
  politician. He was a leading expert in predicting earthquakes. ``This
  point, I thought the guy was either nuts or KGB.'' He wasn't. ``We
  recast American presidential elections as stability, the party holding
  the White House keeps the White House. And earthquake, the White House
  party is turned out of power.'' So they got to work. ``We looked at
  every presidential election from 1860 to 1980.'' What they found were
  13 keys. Only two of which have anything to do with the traits of the
  candidates. Allan has used the keys to accurately predict every
  election. First in 1984, calling it two years early before anyone even
  knew who Reagan's contender would be. In 1988, calling it in spring
  when Bush was trailing Dukakis. Again in `92, `96 and in 2000, when he
  called it for Al Gore? Hey, Allan. ``No, no, I wasn't wrong. I
  correctly predicted that Al Gore would win the popular vote. When I
  first developed the system in `81, you had to go all the way back to
  1888 to find a divergence between the popular vote and the Electoral
  College vote.'' So Allan eventually started calling the winner, not
  just the popular vote, which was useful 16 years later when, well, you
  know. ``I'm a Democrat. And the toughest thing in being a forecaster
  is to keep your own politics out of it.'' But that's enough history,
  professor. Let's get to it. What do Allan's 13 keys predict for 2020?
  ``And remember, an answer of `true' always favors the re-election of
  the White House party. If six or more of the keys are false, you get a
  political earthquake.'' OK, No. 1: The White House party gained House
  seats between midterm elections. ``Republicans lost the U.S. House
  midterms in 2018. So false.'' No. 2: There is no primary contest for
  the White House party. ``No Republicans challenged Trump for his
  renomination. So true.'' No. 3: The incumbent seeking. The sitting
  president is running for re-election. ``Doesn't look like he's
  stepping down, so true.'' Four: There is no third-party challenger.
  ``Despite claims by Kanye West to be running, this is a two-party
  race.'' This is looking pretty good for Trump so far. No. 5: The
  short-term economy is strong. ``The pandemic has pushed the economy
  into recession. False.'' Six: Long-term economic growth during this
  presidential term has been as good as the past two terms. ``The
  pandemic has caused such negative G.D.P. growth in 2020 that the key
  has turned false.'' No. 7: The White House has made major changes to
  national policy. ``Through his big tax cut, but mostly through his
  executive orders, Trump has fundamentally changed the policies of the
  Obama era. So true.'' No. 8: There is no social unrest during the
  term. ``There has been considerable social unrest on the streets, with
  enough violence to threaten the social order. So false.'' No. 9: The
  White House is untainted by scandal. ``My favorite key. As I
  predicted, Trump was impeached. Plus he has plenty of other scandals.
  So false.'' No. 10: The White House has no major foreign or military
  failures abroad. ``We've had some very difficult moments with Donald
  Trump. But so far, true.'' 11: The White House has a major success
  abroad. ``While Trump hasn't had any big splashy failures, he hasn't
  had any major successes either. So false.'' 12: The incumbent-party
  candidate is charismatic. ``Donald Trump is a great showman. But he
  only appeals to a narrow slice of the American people. And as a
  result, false.'' 13: The challenger is uncharismatic. ``Biden is a
  decent empathetic person, but he's not inspirational or charismatic.
  So true.'' That means --- ``The keys predict that Trump will lose the
  White House.'' That's Allan Lichtman's prediction. And Allan Lichtman
  is always right. ``Don't just take my word for it. There are forces at
  play outside the keys --- voter suppression, Russian meddling. It's up
  to you the voters to decide the future of our democracy. So get out
  and vote. Vote in person. Vote by mail. As Abraham Lincoln said, the
  best way to predict the future is to choose it.'' {[}MUSIC PLAYING{]}
