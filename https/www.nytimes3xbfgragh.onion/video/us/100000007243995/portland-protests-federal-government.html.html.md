## Videos Show How Federal Officers Escalated Violence in Portland

#### Peaceful protests were already happening for weeks when federal officers arrived on July 4. Our video shows how President Trump’s deployment ignited chaos.

</div>

  -   
    Federal officers in military gear … … clouds of tear gas … … crowd
    control munitions … \[shots fired\] … and locals who want those
    officers gone. “What are you guys protecting?” “Get the
    \[expletive\] out of our city\!” In just over a week, the chaotic
    scenes in Portland grabbed the nation’s attention and raised
    questions about whether the U.S. government is exceeding its
    authority and violating civil rights. The officers came because of
    an executive order signed by President Trump in late June to protect
    federal property from destruction. “If we didn’t take a stand in
    Portland, you know, we’ve arrested many of these leaders. If we
    didn’t take that stand, right now you would have a problem like —
    they were going to lose Portland.” So what’s going on here? And what
    methods are the officers using to protect federal sites? Crowd:
    “Breonna Taylor\!” The protests against racism and police
    brutality, which started in May, had largely been peaceful and were
    held across Portland. But after federal officers arrived in the city
    on July 4, demonstrations became centered around this U.S. District
    courthouse and this building housing federal agencies. Both are
    property of the U.S. government. The buildings have clearly been
    vandalized, and the Department of Homeland Security has a mandate to
    protect them. That’s usually done by officers from the Federal
    Protective Service. But on the ground in Portland, we have seen a
    new task force, including U.S. Marshals … … BORTAC, a unit of
    Customs and Border Protection … … and a special response team from
    ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. According to a
    government memo leaked to The Times, these units are insufficiently
    trained to perform crowd control. But that hasn’t stopped them from
    trying. Night after night, videos show these officers emerging from
    the two federal buildings as protesters draw near. Hundreds of
    videos reviewed by The Times show that although protesters were
    antagonistic, officers often responded with disproportionate force.
    \[shouting\] They blanketed streets with tear gas. “Are you OK?”
    They struck protesters with batons … … and used flash bangs, pepper
    balls and other less-lethal munitions to clear the streets.
    \[chanting\] Their actions often appeared to escalate rather than
    de-escalate matters. And in some instances, they attacked when there
    was no apparent threat. On July 11, protester Donavan La Bella was
    at the federal courthouse when an officer appears to have fired at
    his head in retaliation for tossing a spent tear gas canister.
    “\[expletive\] you\!” \[shot fired\] La Bella’s mother told local
    media he suffered skull fractures and needed surgery. Later that
    night when field medics sought officers’ help for a wounded
    protester, they were aggressively cleared away. On July 18, a Navy
    veteran was batoned and pepper-sprayed in another unprovoked attack.
    His right hand was broken, and he needs surgery. Sometimes members
    of the press were hit. “He got shot in the back, obviously, and he’s
    wearing press —” This photographer, Mathieu Lewis Rolland, told The
    Times that a volley of 10 projectiles were fired into his back. “Ow,
    ow, ow\!” In the middle of all this, protesters were detained in
    ways that alarmed civil rights advocates and former Homeland
    Security officials. “Can your people identify themselves as law
    enforcement?” On July 15, several federal officers were filmed
    driving in unmarked vehicles in the blocks around the courthouse.
    “How are we supposed to know who you are? How are we supposed to
    know you’re not kidnapping us and you’re civilians kidnapping us?”
    One protester was detained at this location nearby. “What are you
    doing?” Federal officers wouldn’t identify themselves … “Use your
    words\!” … but patches on the right and left sides of their uniforms
    match those used by members of BORTAC, the tactical unit from
    Customs and Border Protection. They drove the protester away in an
    unmarked car. D.H.S. says federal officers have made 43 arrests
    since July 4. Agents do have the authority to make arrests if they
    believe that a federal crime has been committed, like damaging
    federal property or attacking officers. Crowd: “Hey, hey, ho, ho,
    these racist cops have got to go.” In recent days, the controversy
    mobilized a larger and more diverse crowd of protesters.
    \[chanting\] A so-called wall of moms led marches through Portland’s
    streets and to the federal courthouse where officers cleared them
    away. The federal presence has also inflamed tensions. Some
    demonstrators damaged paneling on the courthouse and tried to set
    them alight. Others threw water bottles and fired fireworks toward
    the building. On Wednesday, July 22, Portland’s mayor joined the
    protests and was caught in a cloud of tear gas. “This is a egregious
    overreaction on the part of the federal officers. This is not a
    de-escalation strategy. This is flat-out urban warfare.” At around
    the same time, a Customs and Border Protection plane was spotted
    circling overhead. C.B.P. officials told The Times it was sending a
    live video feed of the crowd to law enforcement on the ground.
    Crowd: “No justice, no peace\! Protesters and local officials say
    this is all a case of federal overreach. Oregon’s attorney general
    has sued the federal government to stop arresting people. “Gas\!
    Gas\! Gas\!” The president has doubled down, promising to send more
    federal officers to cities governed by his political rivals.
    “Because we’re not going to let New York and Chicago and
    Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore, and all of these — Oakland is a
    mess — we’re not going to let this happen in our country. All run by
    liberal Democrats.” The results could look like a national police
    force acting under presidential orders, able to ignore local demands
    and arrest residents. In Portland, it has been a recipe for chaos.
    \[explosion\]
