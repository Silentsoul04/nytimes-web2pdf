## Highlights From the Democratic National Convention: Night 3

#### Kamala Harris made history in accepting her official nomination for the vice presidency: She became the first woman of color to join a major party’s national ticket.

</div>

  -   
    “Hey, everybody, it’s me, Kamala.” “Tonight we are going to hear
    from so many phenomenal women who are working to help us build that
    more perfect union.” “Tonight I’m thinking of the girls and boys who
    see themselves in America’s future because of Kamala Harris — a
    black woman, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and our
    nominee for vice president. This is our country’s story: breaking
    down barriers and expanding the circle of possibility.” ♫ “I’m in
    love with my future, and you don’t know ...” ♫ “Donald Trump’s
    ignorance and incompetence have always been a danger to our country.
    Covid-19 was Trump’s biggest test. He failed miserably. Today
    America has the most Covid deaths in the world and an economic
    collapse.” “My mom worked hard and paid taxes, and the Obama
    administration told her she could stay. My dad thought you would
    protect military families. So he voted for you in 2016, Mr.
    President. He says he won’t vote for you again after what you did to
    our family.” “The wife of a U.S. Marine veteran was deported to
    Mexico.” “Instead of protecting us, you tore our world apart.” “My
    mom is a good person, and she’s not a criminal.” “Donald Trump
    hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t. And the consequences
    of that failure are severe: 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs
    gone, while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst
    impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly
    diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never
    before. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know
    about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American, and
    that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a
    democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it
    easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They understand
    that in this democracy, the commander in chief does not use the men
    and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to
    protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful
    protesters on our own soil. This president and those in power, those
    who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting
    on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their
    policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you
    to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter.” “With
    only one nomination received and pursuant to our rules, I hereby
    declare that Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic candidate
    for vice president.” “She is the first black woman, first South
    Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.” “This is a
    historic pick.” “Someone who looks like us on a presidential ticket,
    that’s crazy.” “That I am here tonight is a testament to the
    dedication of generations before me: women and men who believed so
    fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty and justice for all.
    This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th
    Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right. Yet
    so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still
    prohibited from voting long after its ratification. But they were
    undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized and
    testified and rallied and marched and fought, not just for their
    vote, but for a seat at the table. My mother taught me that service
    to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she
    were here tonight, but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I
    keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet
    tall, who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. On
    that day she probably could have never imagined that I would be
    standing before you now and speaking these words: I accept your
    nomination for vice president of the United States of America. Make
    no mistake: The road ahead is not easy. We may stumble. We may fall
    short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our
    challenges honestly. We will speak truths, and we will act with the
    same faith in you that we ask you to place in us. God bless you, and
    God bless the United States of America.” \[music and
applause\]
