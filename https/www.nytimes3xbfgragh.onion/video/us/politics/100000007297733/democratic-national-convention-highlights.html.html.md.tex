  ``Hey, everybody, it's me, Kamala.'' ``Tonight we are going to hear
  from so many phenomenal women who are working to help us build that
  more perfect union.'' ``Tonight I'm thinking of the girls and boys who
  see themselves in America's future because of Kamala Harris --- a
  black woman, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and our
  nominee for vice president. This is our country's story: breaking down
  barriers and expanding the circle of possibility.'' ♫ ``I'm in love
  with my future, and you don't know ...'' ♫ ``Donald Trump's ignorance
  and incompetence have always been a danger to our country. Covid-19
  was Trump's biggest test. He failed miserably. Today America has the
  most Covid deaths in the world and an economic collapse.'' ``My mom
  worked hard and paid taxes, and the Obama administration told her she
  could stay. My dad thought you would protect military families. So he
  voted for you in 2016, Mr. President. He says he won't vote for you
  again after what you did to our family.'' ``The wife of a U.S. Marine
  veteran was deported to Mexico.'' ``Instead of protecting us, you tore
  our world apart.'' ``My mom is a good person, and she's not a
  criminal.'' ``Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job, because he
  can't. And the consequences of that failure are severe: 170,000
  Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone, while those at the top take in
  more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation
  around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions
  threatened like never before. But more than anything, what I know
  about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about
  every American, and that they care deeply about this democracy. They
  believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we
  should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not
  harder. They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief
  does not use the men and women of our military, who are willing to
  risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy
  against peaceful protesters on our own soil. This president and those
  in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they
  are counting on your cynicism. They know they can't win you over with
  their policies. So they're hoping to make it as hard as possible for
  you to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter.''
  ``With only one nomination received and pursuant to our rules, I
  hereby declare that Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic
  candidate for vice president.'' ``She is the first black woman, first
  South Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.'' ``This is a
  historic pick.'' ``Someone who looks like us on a presidential ticket,
  that's crazy.'' ``That I am here tonight is a testament to the
  dedication of generations before me: women and men who believed so
  fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty and justice for all. This
  week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment.
  And we celebrate the women who fought for that right. Yet so many of
  the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited
  from voting long after its ratification. But they were undeterred.
  Without fanfare or recognition, they organized and testified and
  rallied and marched and fought, not just for their vote, but for a
  seat at the table. My mother taught me that service to others gives
  life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight,
  but I know she's looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about
  that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall, who gave birth
  to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. On that day she probably
  could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and
  speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of
  the United States of America. Make no mistake: The road ahead is not
  easy. We may stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we
  will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak
  truths, and we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to
  place in us. God bless you, and God bless the United States of
  America.'' {[}music and applause{]}
