  Since mid-October, this has been the scene on the streets of Santiago,
  Chile. Protesters say they're fed up with growing inequality. Most
  come out in peace but they're met with force, and the situation
  quickly escalates. Chile is supposed to be one of Latin America's more
  stable democracies, a model for success since the country's
  dictatorship ended in 1990. But this brutal crackdown suggests the
  security tactics haven't changed all that much. Police have fired
  pellets and rubber bullets. These rounds are often shot at close
  range, hitting people where they can do maximum damage: the eyes. More
  than 180 protesters have been partly blinded. And the numbers continue
  to rise. I follow Carlos Puebla into the eye trauma unit of a public
  hospital. The waiting room is full of people who tell me a similar
  story. I'm back with Carlos Puebla. Dr. Carmen Torres, who removed his
  eye several days ago, tries to insert an implant. But the pain is too
  intense. Dr. Enrique Morales is tracking what doctors see here as an
  epidemic of eye trauma. The government denies any wrongdoing. Later,
  my official request to the minister and to the police were also
  declined. International human rights groups are investigating
  allegations of abuse. But that process rarely succeeds in bringing the
  powerful to account. After all, it was Chile's president, Sebastian
  Piñera, who set the stage for the violent clampdown. Since then, at
  least five deaths, more than 180 severe eye injuries, 1,800
  hospitalizations, 5,000 arrests, plus allegations of torture and
  sexual violence. Many of the victims say they were not acting
  aggressively when they were shot. All they can do now is file a
  lawsuit and wait. The police violence hasn't deterred people from
  coming out --- to the contrary. A few days after I met him in the
  hospital Pablo Verdugo is back on the streets, taking care to protect
  his face and eyes from tear gas.
