Geraldine A. Ferraro's campaign manager said today that off- color
remarks by Vice President Bush and others in his campaign ''have gone
beyond decency.'' The aide asked for an immediate apology.

The remarks by the campaign manager, John Sasso, were the sharpest
reaction thus far from Mrs. Ferraro's campaign staff to the Vice
President's use of a locker-room vulgarity in a private conversation
with a longshoreman while campaigning Friday in Elizabeth, N.J.

Mr. Bush's remark, which was picked up by a television microphone, was
that ''we tried to kick a little ass last night'' in the
Vice-Presidential debate Thursday. Mr. Bush has sought to pass the
comment off as an ''old Texas football'' expression,

Mr. Sasso sought out reporters today to make his comments after Mrs.
Ferraro, the Democratic nominee for Vice President, finished addressing
a crowd of several thousands Polish-Americans attending a breakfast in
Niles, Ill., near Chicago. Mr. Sasso said comments made by Mr. Bush, his
wife, Barbara, and his press secretary, Peter Teeley, were ''very
patronizing.''

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

''I don't know if they are using that tone because Mrs. Ferraro is a
woman or an Italian-American or a person who rose from humble origins,''
he said. In any case, he said, ''they ought to stop immediately and
apologize.

''The comments are very insulting, the tone is done intentionally to
insult,'' he added.

An aide to Mr. Bush characterized Mr. Sasso's remarks as ''ridiculous.''

Mrs. Ferraro's running mate, Walter F. Mondale, said today that Mr.
Bush's comment reflected an effort to ''avoid taking Geraldine Ferraro
seriously as a candidate for the Vice Presidency.''

''She's earned the right to be taken seriously,'' Mr. Mondale said.
''It's time to put those kinds of inappropriate comments aside.''
Ferraro Attacks Reagan

Mrs. Ferraro avoided making any comment on the matter today but went on
the attack in another area by accusing President Reagan of making a
''reckless comment'' when he joked about bombing the Soviet Union. Mrs.
Ferraro said the remark had jeopardized the safety of the United States.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Reagan quipped before his weekly radio broadcast on Aug. 11 that he
had signed legislation to outlaw the Soviet Union and that bombing would
begin ''in five minutes.''

Assailing Mr. Reagan as she spoke here, Mrs. Ferraro said: ''That was no
joke. Our President's reckless comments jeopardized our safety. The
President whose job it is to defend this country made a serious
mistake.''

Mrs. Ferraro, whose comments were enthusiastically applauded, said she
had ''confirmed'' that Soviet military forces had gone onto partial
military alert after Mr. Reagan's remarks. 'An Old Sports Expression'

Asked for a response to Mr. Sasso's charges about the Vice President's
remarks, Shirley Green, Mr. Bush's deputy press secretary. called them
''utterly ridiculous.'' She said the the Vice President's phrase ''is an
old sports expression claiming victory that anyone familiar with sports,
men and women, have heard.''

But when Mr. Sasso was asked how Mrs. Ferraro viewed the comments, he
replied: ''She doesn't like it. No decent person would like it. The tone
of Mr. Bush's comments have gone beyond decency.''

Mrs. Bush, while bantering with reporters on Monday, characterized Mrs.
Ferraro as a ''four-million-dollar - I can't say it, but it rhymes with
rich.'' Mrs. Bush later apologized and said she had not meant to suggest
Mrs. Ferraro was ''a witch.'' On Thursday, Mr. Teeley characterized
Representative Ferraro as ''too bitchy.''

Mr. Sasso said Mrs. Ferraro has not addressed the comments in a sharper
tone because she was a ''very dignified lady.''

''She wants to talk about arms control and how were are going to reduce
the deficit,'' he said. Opposition on Abortion

Mrs. Ferraro is on a campaign swing through the Middle West, where she
has appeared before large and enthusiastic crowds. But she has also been
dogged by critics of her position on abortion. At several stops, she has
been interrupted by hecklers shouting, ''What about the unborn?'' Mrs.
Ferraro supports the woman's right to choose an abortion.

Today she confronted several hecklers directly as she spoke in Niles. In
a dramatic moment, Mrs. Ferraro abandoned her text dealing with budget
cutbacks and said, ''O.K., ladies, hold it,'' to about half a dozen
hecklers.

As the heckling was suspended, Mrs. Ferraro said that she had offered
her position on abortion in the nationally televised debate Thursday
night. She continued by saying that she supported various freedoms under
the Constitution, including freedom of speech.

''Now my father, who came here from Italy, loved this country so much
that during the Second World War, he bought war bonds and those bonds
sent bombs over Italy and over his parents' home,'' she said.

''We have a Constitution that protects us here,'' she added.
