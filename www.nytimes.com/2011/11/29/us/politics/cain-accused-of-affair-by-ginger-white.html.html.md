An Atlanta woman came forward in an interview broadcast Monday night
with details about what she called a 13-year affair with Herman Cain,
the Republican presidential contender whose campaign was already
struggling to overcome damage from accusations of sexual harassment.

The woman, Ginger White, made the disclosure in an interview with Fox 5
News in Atlanta, becoming the fifth person to accuse Mr. Cain of
improper behavior. Ms. White is not, however, claiming that harassment
took place. Rather, she described what amounted, in her words, to a
romance.

“It was pretty simple,” Ms. White said. “It wasn’t complicated. I was
aware that he was married. And I was also aware I was involved in a very
inappropriate situation, relationship.”

Ms. White showed the news station some of her cellphone bills that
included 61 phone calls or text messages to and from a number she said
was for Mr. Cain’s private cellphone. The contacts were made during four
different months — as early as 4:26 a.m. and as late as 7:52 p.m. The
most recent were in September.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The television station said that it had sent a text message to the
number Ms. White gave it and that Mr. Cain had returned the call. In the
call, Mr. Cain said that he “knew Ginger White” and that she had his
number because he was “trying to help her financially.”

Mr. Cain, speaking on Monday afternoon to Wolf Blitzer on CNN,
acknowledged knowing Ms. White, whom he called an acquaintance, but
denied having a sexual relationship with
her.

“I have nothing to hide,” he said. “I did nothing wrong.”

Asked directly by Mr. Blitzer, “Was this an affair?” Mr. Cain responded,
“It was not.”

The accusations come as Mr. Cain’s standing has been falling in recent
polls with his campaign battling not only the earlier accusations of
sexual misconduct but also the reaction to the candidate’s trouble
answering questions on subjects like President Obama’s handling of the
conflict in Libya.

In her interview, Ms. White told Fox 5 News that Mr. Cain had showered
her with gifts and flown her around the country to meet him at various
engagements after they met in the late 1990s in Louisville, Ky., when
Mr. Cain was president of the National Restaurant Association.

After that first meeting, Ms. White said, she and Mr. Cain had drinks,
and he invited her back to his hotel room, where they planned their next
meeting. It went on like this for years, she said, until Mr. Cain began
to seriously consider the presidency. She said their sexual relationship
ended about eight months ago.

Ms. White said she came forward after seeing how Mr. Cain, a businessman
who lives in Atlanta, treated the women who had accused him of
harassment.

“It bothered me that they were being demonized,” Ms. White said. “I felt
bad for them.”

She said she also “felt trapped,” after a tipster alerted the local Fox
station about her and other news outlets began to call.

“I wanted to give my side before it was thrown out there and made out to
be something filthy,” Ms. White said. “Some people will look at this and
say that is exactly what it is. I’m sorry for that.”

A lawyer for Mr. Cain, L. Lin Wood, released a statement about Ms.
White’s claim on Monday night. “This appears to be an accusation of
private, alleged consensual conduct between adults — a subject matter
which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public,” he
said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. White is an unemployed single mother. Before the interview, Fox
learned that she had filed a sexual harassment claim against an employer
in 2001. That case was settled. The station also found a bankruptcy
filing nearly 23 years ago in Kentucky, and several eviction notices in
the Atlanta area over the past six years.

The station also reported that Ms. White had a former business partner
who once sought a “stalking temporary protective order” against her for
“repeated e-mails/texts threatening lawsuit and defamation of
character.” The case was dismissed, but it was followed by a libel
lawsuit against Ms. White. A judge entered an order against Ms. White
because she failed to respond to the lawsuit, Fox reported.

Mr. Cain went on CNN on Monday afternoon to pre-emptively address Ms.
White’s claims, saying, “I want to give you a heads-up and everyone a
heads-up.”

Mr. Cain took a nonchalant attitude in his attempt to get ahead of the
story, saying he was not concerned for himself or his reputation. “I am
more worried that this is going to hurt my wife and my family,” he said.
“I can take the lumps.”

He refused to go into any detail about Ms. White, and also told Mr.
Blitzer that he had already informed his wife, whose response was, “Here
we go again.”

Accusations of sexual harassment against Mr. Cain began surfacing at the
beginning of this month, all dating from the years that he ran the
National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Mr. Cain has repeatedly
denied the allegations.

Asked on CNN whether he would consider dropping out of the race, as his
campaign has been in crisis mode and off its message for weeks now, Mr.
Cain said, “We’re going to stay focused on this campaign.”
