JINDO, South Korea — Of all the images from the loss of a ferry in the
cold waters off the southwest coast of South Korea last week, perhaps
none have angered South Koreans more than those of the captain and his
key crew members awkwardly and quickly fleeing their half-submerged
vessel to the safety of a rescue boat, even as hundreds of their
passengers remained trapped inside.

The captain, Lee Jun-seok, 69, has yet to explain publicly why he
abandoned the ship with people aboard — an apparent violation of
maritime protocol, if not the law — as it sunk beneath the waves.

But a portrait of the ship’s last voyage is emerging from crew members,
survivors and a transcript of the vessel’s final 40 minutes of
communications with emergency dispatchers on shore. It is a scene of
rapidly building chaos in which the captain and his crew faced a series
of tough choices, questionable decisions and mechanical failures —
including the apparent loss of the onboard communications system. Those
factors may have all contributed to the ship’s sinking and the death of
at least scores, and more likely hundreds, of people.

“The Coast Guard will arrive in 15 minutes; please tell your passengers
to wear life jackets,” emergency dispatchers told the ferry about half
an hour after it radioed for help.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

\[*[Find out whether South Korea kept its promises after the Sewol ferry
sank.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/sewol-ferry-accident.html?module=inline)*\]

“Now we have lost our ability to broadcast our messages,” the ship
responded. Crew members, using the ferry’s intercom, had previously
instructed passengers to stay where they were, thinking it would be
safer.

“Even if you can’t use your speaker, do your best to go out and ensure
that your passengers wear life jackets or thick clothes,” emergency
dispatchers said.

“If our passengers evacuate, will they be immediately rescued?” the ship
responded.

“Let them float even with life rings. Hurry\!” the dispatchers
responded. A minute later, they added: “We don’t know the situation
there. So the captain should make a final decision, and he should hurry
to decide whether to evacuate them.”

A communications officer, in a separate part of the ferry, said he never
received instructions from the bridge to tell passengers to abandon
ship. One crew member on the bridge said he heard the captain give the
order to evacuate, but that he did not hear the message broadcast to the
passengers. Survivors have not reported hearing it.

When the ferry, the Sewol, began its overnight journey at 9 p.m. last
Tuesday, embarking from a pier in Incheon, west of Seoul, and heading
toward the southern resort island of Jeju, its voyage seemed like so
many others the ship had taken. The 460-foot-long, five-story ferry
plied this 264-mile route twice a week, along a busy shipping lane down
the west coast of South Korea.

It had 443 passengers on board — 60 percent of its capacity. Most of
them were second-year high school students on what was supposed to be
the last school trip before they entered a pressure-cooker year of
cramming for college entrance exams. The ship also carried a full load
of cargo, including 124 cars, 56 trucks and 105 shipping containers.

Some of the students gathered on the deck watching fireworks bursting in
the night sky. Below deck, others strolled in small groups or gathered
in entertainment rooms to sing karaoke or play video games.

Up in the pilothouse, on the ship’s top deck, the crew worked in four
shifts. This ship left late because of fog, and Oh Yong-seok, 58, a
helmsman, was on a second shift, taking the wheel under the guidance of
a shipmate at 11 p.m. The water was calm, the night quiet, Mr. Oh
recalled in a series of interviews in the past week. The captain stopped
by the bridge from time to time to check on matters.

As Mr. Oh handed over the controls to the third shift, Mr. Oh suggested
that crew members double-check the straps tying down the vehicles and
cargo in the hold, he recalled. On his round, he told them that he had
noticed that several had come loose and he tightened them. Otherwise, he
said, there were no issues. With that, he retired to his berth and fell
into a deep sleep.

The last shift began at 7:30 a.m., under the watch of Park Han-gyeol,
26, the youngest of the ship’s mates. She had been with the company only
six months. On this trip, her shift coincided with the passage of the
ship through the most challenging section of the voyage: a waterway
known for its rapid and unpredictable currents and frequent ship
accidents.

“When the current hits the ship’s side, it can throw the ship off
course,” Mr. Oh said. “It’s not easy to steer there.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Park was navigating this notorious waterway for the first time,
giving instructions to a helmsman at the wheel, according to prosecutors
who have raised the question of how qualified she was for the difficult
passage.

On Monday, prosecutors detained the Sewol’s three remaining ship mates
and its chief engineer for questioning.

Investigators say the Sewol appeared to make a sharp turn to the left
around the time it began to tilt, and they were looking into whether
unsecured cargo may have shifted, contributing to the accident. The
helmsman on duty, Jo Jun-gi, later told reporters that “I made a mistake
of my own, but the ship turned much more than usual.” A prosecutor said
investigators were also looking into “discrepancies” between Ms. Park’s
and Mr. Jo’s versions of what happened.

At 8:48 a.m., Mr. Oh said, he was jolted awake as his body was thrown
against the port side wall of his quarters. The vessel had begun to
list.

He lurched from his room barefoot and scrambled along the corridor of
the ship toward the bridge. The first person he saw was Mr. Lee, the
ship’s captain.

Mr. Lee, who had been in his room, had just clambered out of his cabin
and, with the ship slowly turning onto its side, was now holding onto
the doorway of the pilothouse, trying to pull himself inside and get
control of the ship. Mr. Oh pushed the captain up and into the room and
followed as well.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Soon, all of the ship’s mates and helmsmen had gathered there. Mr. Lee,
clutching onto a pillar near the map table at the center of the bridge,
began barking orders.

“The ship was already listing so heavily everyone was hanging onto
whatever they could grab,” Mr. Oh recalled. “It was clear we were in a
really bad situation.”

That situation would in short order get even worse.

Investigators trying to reconstruct events have been weighing a range of
possible causes, including pilot error; an unexpected current; failure
in the ship’s ballast; loose or unbalanced cargo; a recent addition of
more cabins on the upper deck of the 20-year-old ferry that may have
impaired its ability to recover balance; and loosely abided safety
regulations.

At 8:55 a.m., with the ship tilting and unable to move, someone on the
bridge asked the local maritime authorities to “please come quickly,”
according to the transcript of the ship-to-shore radio communications.

Mr. Lee ordered the crew to right the ship. But Ms. Park said the
ballast motor was not working, Mr. Oh recalled.

At 9:05 a.m., the radio on shore crackled with another urgent message
from the Sewol: “What’s going on with the Coast Guard?” A government
emergency dispatcher began asking ships in the area to go to the Sewol’s
aid.

Two levels below, Kang Hae-seong, one of the ship’s communications
officers, was in the broadcasting room and trying to figure out what to
do. With the ship listing about 30 degrees and cutlery falling off the
shelves, he made an announcement on the public address system urging the
passengers to stay where they were and not to move hastily.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I didn’t have time to look at the manual but I thought I should calm
people down first,” he recalled in an
interview.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Lee said on Friday that he did not order an immediate evacuation
because he feared the passengers would be endangered by the strong
currents and the cold water. Mr. Oh said Mr. Lee first tried to get the
ship’s life rafts deployed. His crew tried but could not make it to the
lifeboats.

By 9:18 a.m., the Sewol reported that it was listing at an angle of more
than 50 degrees. “Impossible to evacuate,” someone on the Sewol’s bridge
told emergency dispatchers by radio.

Down below, Mr. Kang contacted the Coast Guard using his cellphone and
then continued to tell people on the public address system to remain
where they were “a little while longer” because the rescue boats were
coming.

At 9:23 a.m., the bridge sent another distress call: “We are about to
sink.”

As the ship continued to list and filled with water, Mr. Kang and his
colleagues stacked chairs to enable some passengers to climb to the
fourth floor.

“It was chaotic because everyone was just busy saving themselves and
many people weren’t pulling up the people below them,” Mr. Kang
recalled.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Oh said he heard Mr. Lee, before leaving the bridge, give the order
to evacuate, but Mr. Oh did not hear it broadcast. Mr. Kang, the
communications officer, said he never received the order. A senior
prosecutor said investigators were still trying to figure out whether it
ever reached the passengers.

At 9:38 a.m., in the ship’s last communication with emergency
dispatchers, the bridge reported that the vessel was listing at 60
degrees. “Those who can evacuate through the port side are trying it,” a
voice said over the radio.

All the crew members began to flee the bridge. More than two-thirds of
the 29-member crew, including the entire navigation team, survived. Only
about a third of the passengers — 174 — got out alive. By Monday, 61
people had been confirmed dead and 241 were still missing.

Mr. Oh saw Mr. Lee slide down the floor of the wheelhouse and crash
through a door in the port-side wall. The helmsman said it was not clear
whether the captain was evacuating or had just lost his grip of the pole
and fell.

He did not see Mr. Lee again until an image of him was broadcast on
television: The captain was in handcuffs, charged with accidental
homicide. He was also charged with abandoning his passengers in a time
of crisis, a crime punishable by up to life in prison.
