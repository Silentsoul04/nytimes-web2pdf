FERGUSON, Mo. --- As residents swept broken glass from the sidewalks
here on Wednesday and painted hopeful messages on boarded-up
storefronts, public officials cautiously said that tighter security
measures and hundreds of additional National Guard troops had helped
stabilize this St. Louis suburb after a
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/25/us/ferguson-photos.html}{night
of arson, looting and violence}.

But under daylong snow showers, anger and frustration over a
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/us/ferguson-darren-wilson-shooting-michael-brown-grand-jury.html}{grand
jury's decision on Monday not to indict a white police officer} in the
August killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, remained
palpable across the region.

West Florissant Avenue, a Ferguson commercial strip now being treated as
a crime scene after an arson spree, was still barricaded by the police
on Wednesday. National Guard troops in camouflage uniforms, who were
largely limited to protecting government buildings two nights earlier,
fanned out across the city, taking up positions along street corners and
at intersections.

Shooting}\label{tracking-the-events-in-the-wake-of-michael-browns-shooting}}

Updates on the events in Ferguson, Mo., following the shooting of
Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, by a police officer on Aug. 9.

Throughout demonstrations on Tuesday night, the Guard responded to
disturbances, turning back demonstrators from a drugstore that had been
surrounded by the police and helping officers make arrests outside the
Ferguson Police Department. And though windows at City Hall were
shattered, a police car was flipped and burned and an AR-15 assault
rifle was stolen from inside the vehicle, law enforcement officials said
the
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/ferguson-missouri-violence.html?ref=us}{more
assertive response} had helped curb the chaos that prevailed on Monday.

Gov. Jay Nixon, whom local officials have criticized for not mobilizing
enough security forces during the worst violence, said on Wednesday that
``the ramped up presence and action of the Missouri National Guard has
been helpful.'' He did not announce additional security measures, but
said he would continue to monitor conditions here. About 1,200 Guard
troops have been in and around the St. Louis region, up from 700 earlier
this week.

Across the country, largely peaceful protests resumed over the grand
jury's decision, with hundreds of people once again pouring into the
streets. In St. Louis, about 200 protesters staged a mock trial of
Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Mr. Brown, and at one point
marched on the steps of City Hall, chanting loudly.

As the demonstrators gathered just outside the entrance, dozens of
officers, many in riot gear, moved in and ordered the protesters to
disperse. Some reluctantly complied, but others questioned why they were
not allowed to be there. In one case, officers used tear gas on a man
running alongside the building and then tackled him. Three protesters
were arrested, including one charged with assaulting an officer. No one
was injured, the police said.

In Southern California, demonstrators chanting ``Black lives matter''
closed the 101 freeway for a time on Wednesday, echoing tactics that had
brought traffic to a standstill in cities across the country a day
earlier. In New York City's Harlem neighborhood, members of Mr. Brown's
family and their supporters appeared at a prayer event organized by the
Rev. Al Sharpton. Mr. Sharpton and Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the
Brown family, again criticized how St. Louis County prosecutors had
handled the investigation into Mr. Brown's death and said the grand-jury
process seemed tilted in Officer Wilson's favor.

``They try to vilify our children but put the shooter on a pedestal,''
Mr. Crump said. ``We scratch our heads and say, `Why does this happen
over and over again?'~''

Although unrest in Ferguson had diminished drastically from Monday
night, when the town endured the worst violence since Mr. Brown's
killing, residents and officials were concerned about flare-ups over the
Thanksgiving holiday, which could bring more people into the region.

The outcry over the grand jury's decision was also reshaping life in
subtler ways. The Thanksgiving Day parade in St. Louis was postponed
because of the unrest, and some people were urging a boycott of the
traditional Black Friday shopping as a protest against inequalities in
the justice system.

For many here and across the country, Mr. Brown's killing laid bare
myriad issues of racial inequality. And when the St. Louis County
prosecutor announced that a grand jury had not indicted Officer Wilson,
many saw it as yet another injustice for blacks.

On Wednesday, federal officials said they would investigate the burning
of a church on West Florissant Avenue where Michael Brown's father was a
congregant. Carlton Lee, the pastor of the Flood Christian Church, which
was gutted on Monday night, said he believed his church had been
targeted by arsonists because of his public calls for Officer Wilson's
arrest. Pastor Lee said he had received threats against himself and the
church for months.

Federal investigators have determined that there was a break-in at the
church and a fire was set, said John Ham, a spokesman for the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

``It made my stomach turn that people are that evil,'' Pastor Lee said.
``We're a house of prayer. We don't preach hate.''
