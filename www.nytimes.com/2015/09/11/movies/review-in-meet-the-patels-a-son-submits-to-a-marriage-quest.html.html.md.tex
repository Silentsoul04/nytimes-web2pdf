``\href{http://www.meetthepatelsfilm.com/}{Meet the Patels}'' is a tidy,
easygoing documentary in which peripheral players prove more intriguing
than its central focus. That would be Ravi Patel, a successful actor
(``Transformers''; the coming TV series
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V7u8Jdo63A}{Grandfathered}'')
in Los Angeles who has separated from his redheaded girlfriend, Audrey,
lacking the nerve to tell his
\href{http://www.gujaratindia.com/}{Indian}-born parents about their
relationship.

Consequently, he takes steps, coordinated by his mother and father, to
find a wife, including a convention for singles of Indian extraction, a
succession of dates across North America, attending a wedding in India
and amassing a heap of ``biodata'' --- essentially résumés circulated by
relatives and friends of young, eligible South Asians.

The vanity inherent in such a film is self-evident, despite Mr. Patel's
self-deprecating wisecracks and frequent animated passages depicting him
with warm, rounded edges. His father, Vasant --- a sensible self-made
immigrant in America with a sense of humor that his son has clearly
inherited --- is far more interesting. Ravi's mother, Champa, whose
marriage to Vasant was arranged by their families, shares a bond with
her husband that is teasing, playful and inspiring. Training the camera
on Ravi is his wry, understated foil: his sister and co-director, Geeta.
Though her matrimonial fortunes are left uncertain --- and she is barely
on screen --- she, too, proves more fascinating than her loquacious
brother.

\emph{``Meet the Patels'' is rated PG (Some material may not be suitable
for children). Discussions of relationships, but nary a prurient
sentiment.}
