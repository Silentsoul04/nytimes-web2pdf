Another year, another “American Horror Story,” this one [subtitled
“Hotel”](http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/american-horror-story/episodes)
and set in a production designer’s dream of a Deco-era downtown Los
Angeles lodging that has survived into the present day.

In the show’s 90-minute fifth-season premiere (Wednesday night on FX), a
pair of leggy, blond European tourists are dropped off at the Hotel
Cortez and check in despite the mustiness, the mysterious moans and the
frightening presence of Kathy Bates behind the front desk. We can buy
that; it’s what European tourists do in horror shows. But checking in
after they’re told there’s no Wi-Fi? What self-respecting young Swede
does that?

There’s a jokey, parodic feeling to that opening sequence that carries
through the rest of the premiere and signifies a small but distinct
change in mood from the earlier seasons of this Ryan Murphy and Brad
Falchuk Grand Guignol anthology series. The show has always been all on
the surface — paper-thin in terms of ideas and drama but drenched in
creepy atmosphere and peekaboo depravity. “Hotel” keeps the depravity
but, for now, appears to have dropped the voluptuous melodrama of the
[“Freak
Show”](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/arts/television/american-horror-story-freak-show-begins-wednesday.html)
and “Coven” seasons. It seems to be going more for burlesque than for
sincere, if over-the-top, homage.

“Hotel” possesses the usual “American Horror Story” framework
(noticeable but not very important), in which a band of lost souls is
trapped together — in a haunted house, a witches’ coven, a traveling
carnival.

In the new season the action takes place on an elaborate set, created by
the production designer Mark Worthington, that recalls the Overlook in
[“The Shining”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cb3ik6zP2I) — as well
as some actual Los Angeles hotels like the Cecil and the Hollywood
Roosevelt — but also invokes movie-palace lobbies and the opulent spaces
of department stores or cruise ships from old Hollywood movies.

That set is easily the most interesting thing about the show so far.
Within it, the usual sorts of things soon begin to happen — a man nailed
to a headboard (that’s how he’s listed in the credits), a blood-soaked
orgy, a rape with a drill-bit dildo. The phantasmagoric accouterments
include Lady Gaga, the most notable addition to the cast, who appears
halfway through the episode as a Joan Crawford-like predator called the
Countess.

“American Horror Story” has always depended on its performers to give
some flesh and feeling to its spindly armature of high design and
old-movie pastiche, and “Hotel” suffers from the absence of Jessica
Lange, who has left the series, and Lily Rabe, who is scheduled to
appear in only a couple of episodes. In Ms. Lange’s absence, the role of
malevolent den mother appears to have gone to Lady Gaga, and that’s a
pretty steep drop-off.

Other members of the “Horror Story” repertory company return and
continue to do amusing work, however. The invaluable Denis O’Hare plays
a bald cross-dresser named Liz Taylor with his typical deadpan
sang-froid, despite earrings the size of small crustaceans and 10-inch
platform heels. Sarah Paulson once again has the “serious” role, this
time as a drug addict with a leopard coat and a big head of Elsa
Lanchester hair.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The story they inhabit this time around barely comes into focus in the
first episode, which plays like a series of vignettes with only the
loosest of connections. People die in the Cortez in horrible ways, for
reasons that don’t promise to be very interesting but which will be
investigated by a detective (Wes Bentley) who has a personal connection
to the hotel. At the same time, a developer played by Cheyenne Jackson,
another addition to the cast, threatens to buy the place and gentrify
it, providing an existential threat to the resident psychos and demons.

Mr. Murphy directed the premiere, mixing a lot of Stanley Kubrick (not
just “The Shining” but also “2001”) with touches of [David
Fincher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znmZoVkCjpI) and [David
Lynch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdNrWmAV0E), while keeping the
camera moving restlessly around the elaborate, claustrophobic set. You
won’t see more dolly shots, crane shots and gratuitous uses of a
fish-eye lens in any other television episode this year.

Whether he and Mr. Falchuk will concoct a narrative — or at least an
atmosphere — entertaining enough to keep us watching through 13 episodes
remains to be seen. It was unusual, for an FX show, that only one
episode of “Hotel” was made available for review, and less than a week
before the premiere. With “Horror Story” and “Scream Queens” on the air
and the new “American Crime Story” in production, perhaps they’re
getting a little overextended. There’s only so much genre reinvention
that two men can do.
