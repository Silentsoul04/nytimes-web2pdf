SEOUL, South Korea — [North
Korea](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/northkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo "More news and information about North Korea.")
has announced a halt to an investigation into the fate of Japanese
citizens said to have been abducted by its agents decades ago,
retaliating for sanctions
[Japan](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/japan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo "More news and information about Japan.")
imposed this week after the North’s latest rocket launching.

North Korea blamed Japan for the development in a report on Friday from
its official Korean Central News Agency, saying that Tokyo’s new
sanctions were “little short of the declaration of its own scrapping” of
a 2014 agreement under which North Korea set up a panel [to investigate
the abduction
issue](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/world/asia/north-korea-agrees-to-investigate-fate-of-japanese-abducted-decades-ago.html "Times article").
The panel and its investigation were terminated as of Friday, the report
said.

Japan’s foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, called North Korea’s decision
“deplorable,” the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported.

North Korea admitted in 2002 that its agents had kidnapped 13 Japanese
citizens in the 1970s and ’80s. Five abductees were later allowed to
return to Japan. The North said the others were dead, but Japan wanted a
full investigation of those cases and the cases of other Japanese who
Tokyo believes were also kidnapped. Resolving [the emotional
issue](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/world/asia/parents-of-japanese-woman-kidnapped-by-north-korea-meet-their-granddaughter.html "Times article")
has been a pressing concern for the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe.

As part of its 2014 agreement with North Korea, Japan eased some
sanctions it had imposed on the North. But on Wednesday, Japan said it
would restore those sanctions and add new ones in response to the
North’s [satellite launch on
Sunday](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/world/asia/north-korea-moves-up-rocket-launching-plan.html "Times article"),
which the United States and its allies condemned as a cover for
developing long-range ballistic missile technology.

The new penalties included expanded restrictions on travel between the
two countries and a complete ban on visits by North Korean ships to
Japan.

Japan was one of the first countries to impose unilateral sanctions on
the North since the rocket launching, which came just weeks after its
[fourth nuclear
test](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-q-a.html "Times article").
Also Wednesday, South Korea shut down a [jointly run industrial
park](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/world/asia/north-south-korea-kaesong.html "Times article.")
in the North, depriving the North Korean government of an important
source of cash.
