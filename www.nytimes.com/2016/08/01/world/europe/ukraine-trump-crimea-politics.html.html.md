Donald J. Trump on Sunday offered a muddled explanation of his views
about the 2014 [annexation of Crimea by
Russia](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/ukraine.html) and
its continued efforts to undermine Ukraine’s control of other parts of
the country, and he amplified his earlier suggestion that, if elected
president, he might recognize Russia’s claim and end sanctions against
it.

In an interview with George Stephanopoulos on the ABC News program
“[This Week](http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek),” Mr. Trump said that if
he were president, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would not send
his forces into Ukraine. He then backpedaled when Mr. Stephanopoulos
pointed out that Russian troops had been there for nearly two years.

“He’s not going into Ukraine, O.K., just so you understand,” Mr. Trump,
the Republican nominee, said when the issue came up. “He’s not going to
go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down.
You can take it anywhere you want.”

“Well, he’s already there, isn’t he?” Mr. Stephanopoulos interrupted.

“O.K., well, he’s there in a certain way,” Mr. Trump replied. “But I’m
not there. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the
world is a mess under Obama with all the strength that you’re talking
about and all of the power of NATO and all of this. In the meantime,
he’s going away. He take — takes Crimea.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Interpreting Mr. Trump’s statements — what he understands about the
current status of Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, and how it would
change in a Trump administration — is difficult given the fractured
nature of the exchange. But they were significant because Mr. Trump has
seemingly embraced Mr. Putin, repeatedly called for better relations
with Russia and shown an unwillingness to condemn Mr. Putin for his
aggressive actions against Russia’s neighbors and its crackdowns on
freedoms at home.

Questions have been raised about the watering down of a section of the
[Republican
platform](https://www.gop.com/the-2016-republican-party-platform/)
dealing with Ukraine amid evidence that wording to support sending
lethal weapons to the Ukrainian government was removed from the text.

Not since 1976, when President Gerald Ford committed a major gaffe in
one of his debates with Jimmy Carter, declaring that “[there is no
Soviet domination of Eastern
Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfyL4uQVJLw),” has the issue of
American support of Eastern European states, both those in NATO and
those outside it, emerged as a major presidential campaign issue. It was
enormously harmful to Mr. Ford, because his statement seemed to suggest
that he did not understand the geopolitics of the region, which his
staff denied.

Ukraine [became a separate nation
in 1991](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/03/world/ex-communist-wins-in-ukraine-yeltsin-recognizes-independence.html)
after the [fall of the Berlin
Wall](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/10/world/clamor-east-east-germany-opens-frontier-west-for-migration-travel-thousands.html)
and the [breakup of the Soviet
Union](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/24/world/end-of-the-soviet-union-yeltsin-asks-bush-to-grant-russians-recognition-by-us.html).
It steadily flirted with the West and with NATO, and Russian officials
feared it would be pulled out of Moscow’s orbit. But a pro-Russian
president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, was democratically elected in 2010 and
remained in power until he was [ousted
in 2014](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/world/europe/with%2Dpresidents%2Ddeparture%2Dukraine%2Dlooks%2Dtoward%2Da%2Dmurky%2Dfuture.html),
ultimately taking up exile in Russia.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Yanukovych had hired a lobbying firm co-founded by Paul Manafort,
now Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, to improve his image in the West and
avoid punishment for veering toward Russia.

The annexation of Crimea in 2014 was seen as both a power grab and a
land grab by Mr. Putin. It was condemned by the United States and its
European allies, which all issued sanctions. Since then, Russian troops,
often out of uniform, have been seen, and sometimes killed, in
Russian-speaking parts of Ukraine where a pro-Russia insurgency has
fought the current Ukrainian government.

Republicans in Congress have long pressed for more assistance to Ukraine
to push back against Mr. Putin, including lethal aid. But all references
to giving lethal aid to the Ukrainian government were kept out of the
party platform.

In early July, a delegate offered a platform amendment to support lethal
aid. A delegate for Senator Ted Cruz from Texas, Diana Denman, said in
an interview that she had pushed for inclusion of the language. But Ms.
Denman said her amendment, as proposed, was never voted on because two
men who were observing the panel’s deliberations moved to table the
amendment, and suggested that it be discussed later.

“They openly said they were hired by the Trump campaign and worked for
Mr. Trump,” Ms. Denman said, adding that she did not recall their names.
In the final version of the Republican platform, the words about weapons
were dropped and replaced by the term “appropriate assistance.”

Mr. Trump acknowledged in the ABC interview that the language had been
watered down, but he said he had nothing to do with it. (Mr. Manafort
has also said he was unaware of the matter.)

“I wasn’t involved in that,” Mr. Trump said. “Honestly, I was not
involved.” But he acknowledged that his supporters were. “They softened
it, I heard, but I was not involved,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump went on to argue that Mr. Putin might have been welcome in
Crimea, sidestepping the issue of whether the Russian leader had
violated the sovereignty of another state to take the territory, where
Russia has a major naval base.

“The people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia
than where they were,” Mr. Trump said. “And you have to look at that,
also.”

He went on to say, “Ukraine is a mess,” but he put the blame for that on
Mr. Obama, not on Mr. Putin.

Jake Sullivan, the chief policy adviser to Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s
Democratic opponent, said the assessment reinforced his lack of
temperamental fitness for the presidency.

“Today he gamely repeated Putin’s argument that Russia was justified in
seizing the sovereign territory of another country by force,” Mr.
Sullivan said. “This is scary stuff. But it shouldn’t surprise us.”
