SEOUL, South Korea — [North
Korea](http://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/north-korea?8qa)
test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine off its eastern coast on
Wednesday, demonstrating a significant improvement in its efforts to
build a harder-to-detect means to strike American and allied forces, the
South Korean military said.

The missile, launched from near Sinpo, a submarine base, flew 310 miles
toward Japan, the South Korean military said in a statement. The
statement said that the test showed that North Korea was making
“progress” after several failed tests of submarine-launched ballistic
missiles, or SLBMs.

All previous such missiles North Korea had launched flew only a short
distance, making those flights too brief to be called successful,
according to South Korean officials. Missile experts have said that
North Korea probably conducted some of its previous tests from a
submerged barge, rather than from a submarine, releasing digitally
altered photographs to exaggerate its missile technology for its home
audience.

Later on Wednesday, in a statement issued after a meeting of its top
security officials, [South
Korea](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/southkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo "More news and information about South Korea.")
confirmed that the latest North Korean SLBM test had been conducted from
a submarine.

The latest missile test came two days after the United States and [South
Korea](http://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/south-korea?8qa) kicked
off one of their annual joint military exercises. North Korea condemns
all such drills as a rehearsal for an invasion and has often responded
with warlike words, or missile tests.

The test also came hours before the foreign ministers of South Korea,
Japan and China were to continue talks in Tokyo to discuss the North’s
growing missile and nuclear threats, as well as territorial and other
disputes in the region.

“We see this SLBM test as an attempt by the North to use the South
Korean-United States military exercise as a pretext to raise tensions,”
the South Korean military said. It also said the test posed a serious
threat to the South’s security and marked a grave violation of United
Nations Security Council resolutions that bar the North from developing
ballistic missile technology.

North Korea’s growing missile threats have been unsettling enough for
the United States and South Korea to decide to deploy the American-built
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or
[Thaad](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/world/asia/south-korea-and-us-agree-to-deploy-missile-defense-system.html),
battery in the South by the end of next year despite a vehement protest
from China.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, noting that the launch marked the
first time that a North Korean missile had penetrated his country’s air
defense identification zone, where it tries to identify and locate
passing aircraft for security purposes, called the test “a grave threat
to our country’s security.”
