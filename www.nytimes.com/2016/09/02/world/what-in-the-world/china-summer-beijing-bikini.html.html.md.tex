Summer on the streets of Chinese cities yields a panoply of exotic
sights and sounds: old men loudly jousting over mah-jongg tiles,
sidewalk barbecues grilling tough-to-identify animal parts, and the
unmistakable growl of a clearing throat --- that ends with an inevitable
splat.

But nothing defines China's most sweltering season (or bewilders
foreigners) more than the curious sartorial habits of grown men who
neatly roll up their shirts to reveal bellies, often in glorious
plenitude, without the teeniest hint of shame (nor the teeniest hint of
a six-pack).

The exposed midriff, visible in shops, restaurants and hospital waiting
rooms, often has a companion flourish, with practitioners rolling up
their pants legs to just below the knee.

This, it will be explained upon asking, is a makeshift form of
air-conditioning known as the Beijing Bikini. (Others somewhat
disparagingly describe the phenomenon as ``bang ye,'' which roughly
translates as ``exposing yourself like a grandfather.'')

It is on display anywhere where temperatures sizzle --- urban or rural,
private space or public sphere, recreational park or commercial shop.

Social convention bars women from engaging in similar displays of flesh.

Although adherents, often with cigarette and beer in hand, attest to the
Beijing Bikini's cooling health benefits, they face mounting hostility
from educated upstarts or busybody bureaucrats who find the summer
parade of bulging tummies uncouth and unbecoming of a great nation.

Chinese newspapers wage periodic propaganda campaigns against the look,
but it endures and is increasingly visible abroad, proudly displayed by
Chinese tourists outside New York City art museums, Buckingham Palace in
London and the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
