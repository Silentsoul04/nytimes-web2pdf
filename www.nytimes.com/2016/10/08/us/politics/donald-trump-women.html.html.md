<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Donald J.
Trump](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html)
issued an unusual [videotaped
apology](http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000004698416/trump-responds-to-outrage-over-lewd-remarks.html)
early Saturday after a 2005 recording surfaced that showed him speaking
in extraordinarily [vulgar
terms](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html)
about women, setting off an uproar in the Republican Party.

“Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am,” he said.
“I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.”

[The
apology](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/donald-trump-apology.html)
came as the presidential nominee faced extraordinary censure from
Republican leaders after the tape was made public. The recording
captures Mr. Trump speaking about pushing himself on women and boasting
that he could get away with “anything” because of his celebrity.

In the three-minute recording, which was [obtained by The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html),
Mr. Trump recounts to the television personality Billy Bush of “Access
Hollywood” how he once pursued a married woman and “moved on her like a
bitch, but I couldn’t get there,” expressing regret that they did not
have sex. But he brags of a special status with women: Because he was “a
star,” he says, he could “grab them by the pussy” whenever he wanted.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“You can do anything,” Mr. Trump says.

He also said he was compulsively drawn to kissing beautiful women “like
a magnet” — “I don’t even wait” — and talked about plotting to seduce
the married woman by taking her furniture shopping. Mr. Trump, who was
59 at the time he made the remarks, went on to disparage the woman, whom
he did not name, saying, “I did try and fuck her. She was married,” and
saying, “She’s now got the big phony tits and everything.”

On Friday night, Speaker Paul D. Ryan withdrew an invitation for Mr.
Trump to appear alongside him in Wisconsin this weekend. [Mr. Ryan
described himself in a statement as
“sickened”](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/08/us/politics/how-paul-ryan-and-mitch-mcconnell-have-disavowed-trumps-words-but-not-their-support.html)
by Mr. Trump’s remarks.

Hours before his video apology, Mr. Trump released a statement on Friday
afternoon expressing regret “if anyone was offended” by his comments,
but he tried to play down the tape as a snippet of “locker room banter.”

His running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, brushed off the banter at
a rally in Rossford, Ohio. “They’ll say, this time we got him,” Mr.
Pence said. “This time we got another thing, another issue that’s come
forward. Then they turn on the next television the next morning, and
Donald Trump is still standing stronger than ever before and fighting
for the American people.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Pence also telephoned Mr. Trump on Friday night and urged him to
show humility, according to an adviser to the nominee who requested
anonymity to reveal a private conversation. (Mr. Trump had already
decided to apologize when Mr. Pence called, the adviser
noted.)

## Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell Reject Donald Trump’s Words, Over and Over, but Not His Candidacy

How the two top Republicans in Congress have responded to Mr. Trump’s
comments.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, issued a statement late
Friday night calling on Mr. Trump to express contrition — and possibly
offering other Senate Republicans cover to disavow the nominee if he
refused to apologize.

“As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs
to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full
responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his
comments on that tape,” Mr. McConnell said.

While neither Mr. Ryan nor Mr. McConnell immediately withdrew formal
support for Mr. Trump, Republican leaders in Washington held anguished
discussions throughout the evening about how the party should proceed
with a badly wounded and potentially toxic nominee. They cannot remove
their nominee from the ticket, but some Republican lawmakers called on
Mr. Trump to step down voluntarily, including Senator Mark S. Kirk of
Illinois, who previously said he would not support Mr. Trump, and
Representatives Mike Coffman of Colorado and Barbara Comstock of
Virginia.

Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who also has not endorsed Mr. Trump, recorded
a [live
video](https://www.facebook.com/mikeleeUT/videos/10154626306667431/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED)
on Facebook in which he asked the candidate, “with all due respect, to
step aside.”

Mr. Trump, seeking to minimize the import of the disclosure despite the
public rebuke by Mr. Ryan, announced late Friday evening that he would
no longer travel to Wisconsin as planned and would send Mr. Pence in his
stead. Mr. Trump said he would spend Saturday preparing for his second
[debate](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/us/politics/presidential-debate.html)
with Hillary Clinton, set to take place Sunday in St. Louis.

Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly attacked and mocked Mrs. Clinton’s
marriage in recent weeks, also sought to implicate Bill Clinton in his
coarse conduct.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even
close,” Mr. Trump [said in a
statement](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/statement-from-donald-j.-trump).
“I apologize if anyone was offended.”

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">In a statement, Donald J. Trump
said that vulgar remarks he made in an “Access Hollywood” tape in 2005
about women “don’t reflect” who he

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And in his video apology later, he said: “I’ve said some foolish things.
But there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other
people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied,
attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Mrs. Clinton over her
husband’s affairs and how she responded to them.

The disclosure of the recording comes at the end of a punishing two
weeks, during which Mr. Trump has faced intense backlash over his
treatment of women and intensifying scrutiny of his personal finances
and views on national
security.

## More Than 160 Republican Leaders Don’t Support Donald Trump. Here’s When They Reached Their Breaking Point.

Which statements caused Republicans to bail on Donald Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mrs. Clinton’s campaign condemned Mr. Trump forcefully for the comments
captured on the recording. Her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of
Virginia, said in response to the remarks, “It makes me sick to my
stomach.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More Republicans joined in the denunciation, including [Gov. Gary
Herbert and Representative Jason
Chaffetz](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/29/us/politics/at-least-110-republican-leaders-wont-vote-for-donald-trump-heres-when-they-reached-their-breaking-point.html#tape),
both of Utah, who had said this summer that they would vote for Mr.
Trump, and on Friday retracted their support.

“Donald Trump’s statements are beyond offensive & despicable,” Mr.
Herbert wrote on Twitter. “While I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I
will not vote for Trump.”

Mr. Trump had already been on the defensive on Friday after telling CNN
that he still believed the exonerated defendants known as the Central
Park Five were guilty of a 1989 rape of a female jogger despite DNA
evidence to the contrary that later overturned their convictions.
Earlier in the day, he also asserted, again without evidence, that the
Obama administration was allowing illegal immigrants to enter the
country in order to vote in November.

Also in the last week, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had
[declared a $916 million
loss](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html)
on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could
have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up
to 18 years.

For Republicans on the ballot this fall, the uproar over Mr. Trump’s
past statements about women touched off an agonizing political cycle,
marked by partial denunciations of Mr. Trump — and demands from
Democrats that their denunciations go further. Republican candidates for
the House and Senate, and for governorships across the country,
chastised Mr. Trump sternly but stopped short of renouncing him as their
choice for the presidency.

One Republican senator seeking re-election, Kelly Ayotte of New
Hampshire, who was criticized this week when she called Mr. Trump a role
model for children, said his comments were “totally inappropriate and
offensive.”

Ms. Ayotte, one of the most prominent women in the party, was facing
immense pressure Friday night from other Republicans to disavow Mr.
Trump entirely, and was said to be considering it. In an illustration of
the Democratic onslaught, her opponent, Gov. Maggie Hassan, called Mr.
Trump’s comments inexcusable.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It is beyond comprehension how Senator Ayotte could continue to support
this man for the highest office in the land, let alone call him a role
model,” Ms. Hassan said.

Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, said, “There
are no excuses for Donald Trump’s offensive and demeaning comments.” He
was clearly worried about how they might affect his own re-election
campaign, adding, “He alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone
should suffer the consequences.”

Another Republican to turn his back on Mr. Trump on Friday was Jon M.
Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, who just a week ago said he
planned to vote for Mr. Trump. He [told The Salt Lake
Tribune](http://www.sltrib.com/news/4444721-155/after-video-huntsman-says-it-is)
that the nominee should withdraw from the race.

“In a campaign cycle that has been nothing but a race to the bottom — at
such a critical moment for our nation — and with so many who have tried
to be respectful of a record primary vote, the time has come for
Governor Pence to lead the ticket,” Mr. Huntsman told the newspaper.

Mr. Trump’s behavior has at times startled and unnerved women in his
life, from employees at his company to the contestants in his beauty
pageants, The Times found after interviewing dozens of them for [an
article in
May](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html).
They described unwanted romantic advances and unending commentary on the
female form.

Temple Taggart, Miss Utah in 1997, was uncomfortable with how forward
Mr. Trump was with young contestants like her in his first year as the
owner of Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she
recalls it, he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, ‘Oh, my God. Gross.’ He
was married to Marla Maples at the time,” she said. “I think there were
a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like, “Wow, that’s
inappropriate.”

Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood
Action Fund, suggested Mr. Trump had discussed committing a violent
crime in his 2005 conversation with Mr. Bush.

“What Trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault,” said
Ms. Laguens. “Trump’s behavior is disgusting and unacceptable in any
context, and it is disqualifying for a man who is running for president
of this country.”

The recording of Mr. Trump talking to Mr. Bush was made as they sat on a
bus on the set of a soap opera where Mr. Trump was making a cameo
appearance. The conversation was recorded after he had married Melania
Trump, his third and current wife. At one point, the conversation in the
video was interrupted when an actress arrived to take Mr. Trump and Mr.
Bush to the set. Mr. Trump seemed excited.

“You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start
kissing them,” Mr. Trump says. “It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t
even wait.”

Ms. Trump was pregnant at the time that Mr. Trump’s remarks were
recorded in mid-September 2005; their son, Barron, was born the next
March.
