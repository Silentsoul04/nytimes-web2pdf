To listen to Donald Trump describe the American economy is to hear about
a horrifying alternate reality in which the recession that started at
the [end of 2007](http://www.nber.org/cycles.html) is still with us. The
truth is very different. The recovery that began in the middle of 2009,
though not perfect, has steadily created jobs and lifted wages.

More than [15.2 million
jobs](http://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CES0000000001) have
been added since early 2010. The 4.9 percent unemployment rate is half
of what it was in the depths of the recession in 2009. On Friday, in its
monthly employment report, the [Department of Labor
said](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/business/economy/jobs-report.html?_r=0)
that average hourly wages jumped 2.8 percent, to $25.92, in October from
a year earlier, the biggest such increase since 2008.

Add these findings to a recent [report from the Census
Bureau](http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-158.html)
showing a decline in the number of people in poverty and the percentage
of people without health insurance, and it is clear that by almost every
economic measure the country is doing better than it was just a few
years ago.

Mr. Trump refuses to acknowledge these truths, presumably because he
believes that his best shot at the White House is to insist that the
economy is in terrible shape and that he alone can fix it. When the data
don’t agree with his dystopian vision, he calls them “[phony
numbers](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/business/economy/unemployment-labor-department-data-politics.html).”
His campaign called Friday’s employment report
“[disastrous](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/statement-on-the-disastrous-jobs-report-underscores-the-total-failures-of-t).”
Little wonder that 370 economists, including eight Nobel Prize winners,
have signed a
[letter](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/11/01/prominent-economists-including-eight-nobel-laureates-do-not-vote-for-donald-trump/)
denouncing him for peddling “magical thinking and conspiracy theories
over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.”

There is no doubt that the economic recovery has not touched every
American equally. About one-quarter of the unemployed, or two million
people, have been out of work for [27 weeks or
more](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf). Some 81 percent
of people between the prime working ages of 25 and 54 are in the labor
force (employed or looking for work), an increase from last year but
still lower than in early 2007 when it was 83 percent. The [poverty
rate](http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html)
fell to 13.5 percent last year, from 14.8 percent, but it is higher than
it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. For many people, health
insurance remains too expensive.

The next president and Congress need to focus on those whom the recovery
has left behind. Hillary Clinton would increase investments in
infrastructure, help lower the burden of student loans and expand access
to affordable health care. Mr. Trump’s main policy idea is to cut taxes
for the wealthy, a reprise of the old trickle-down economics that has
consistently failed. His plans to impose big tariffs on imports would
start a trade war, leading to big job losses, and his vow to repeal the
Affordable Care Act could strip as many as [20 million
people](http://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2016/03/03/20-million-people-have-gained-health-insurance-coverage-because-affordable-care-act-new-estimates)
of their health insurance.

Better policies could make the economy stronger. Mrs. Clinton has them.
Mr. Trump does not.
