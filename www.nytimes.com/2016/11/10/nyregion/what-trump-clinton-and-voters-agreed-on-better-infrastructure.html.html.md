At the end of a stunning and divisive election that left many Americans
feeling further apart than ever, there was perhaps one area of common
ground: infrastructure.

In a triumphant victory speech early Wednesday, President-elect Donald
J. Trump cited the issue as a top priority for his administration.

“We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges,
tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to
rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to
none.”

The sentiment was echoed across the country on Election Day as voters
supported dozens of local ballot measures intended to improve public
transportation. In Los Angeles, Seattle and Atlanta, voters were poised
to approve spending billions of dollars on buses, rail lines and other
projects.

During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to spend nearly $1
trillion on infrastructure, [seeking to outshine Hillary
Clinton](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/us/politics/trump-clinton-infrastructure.html)
on an issue that is a growing concern for many Americans.

But with little support from Washington in recent years, many
communities have moved forward with their own plans to improve public
transportation through local ballot measures. In Los Angeles County on
Tuesday, voters approved a half-cent increase in the sales tax to raise
nearly $120 billion for the transportation system.

In the Seattle region, voters appeared likely to have approved a $54
billion proposal that would include building 62 new miles of light rail.
The proposition was winning on Wednesday with about 55 percent of the
vote.

“Local regions with some vision are taking matters into their own hands
and going directly to the voters to try to tackle real local problems,”
said Peter Rogoff, the chief executive of Sound Transit, the
transportation agency serving multiple counties in the Seattle region.

While Mr. Trump did not specifically mention trains or buses during his
brief victory speech, he said during the campaign that he supported
spending money on transit. As a resident of New York City and a real
estate developer, Mr. Trump appears to understand how important public
transit is for cities, said Art Guzzetti, the vice president of policy
for the American Public Transportation Association.

“The magnitude of the need is such that you’re going to need all the
partners chipping in to the solution,” Mr. Guzzetti said of the
country’s vast infrastructure needs.

Mr. Trump’s campaign released a [proposal last month to pay for
infrastructure
projects](http://peternavarro.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/infrastructurereport.pdf)
that included giving tax credits to private investors. This year, Mr.
Trump suggested he might create a federal infrastructure fund supported
by government bonds that investors and citizens could purchase.

On Wednesday, transit supporters celebrated the success of the local
ballot measures, which consoled some who were disappointed by Mrs.
Clinton’s loss. A proposal in Atlanta to increase the sales tax to pay
for transit improvements received about 72 percent support.

New funding will help pay for light rail along the [Atlanta
BeltLine](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/us/atlanta-beltline.html), a
popular pedestrian and bike project, said Keith Parker, the chief
executive of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority.

“The customers are telling us that they really believe in mass transit,”
he said.

Of 49 measures on local or state ballots, at least 33 appear to have
passed, said Jason Jordan, the executive director of the [Center for
Transportation Excellence](https://www.cfte.org/), a research center
that backed the ballot measures.

“We expected a historic year going into Election Day, and we got it in
terms of the largest number of measures we’ve ever tracked and the
largest dollar amount invested,” Mr. Jordan said.

Many of the ballot measures were concentrated in the West, where leaders
are pressing for new transit options. On the [East Coast, older
systems](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/nyregion/no-silver-bullet-as-subways-in-the-northeast-show-their-age.html)
like the century-old subway networks in New York and Boston are
struggling to both maintain aging equipment and expand to meet rising
ridership.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In New Jersey, voters approved a constitutional amendment that would
dedicate all the state’s gas tax revenue to transportation. Gov. Chris
Christie, a Republican who is overseeing Mr. Trump’s presidential
transition team, had agreed to a deal to raise the [state’s gas tax this
month by 23 cents per
gallon](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/nyregion/as-days-of-cheap-gas-end-in-new-jersey-drivers-descend-for-a-last-fill-up.html)
to pay for improvements to roads, bridges and public transit, but the
amendment ensures the money would not be diverted to other budget needs.

One of the country’s largest infrastructure proposals is a plan
supported by the Obama administration to build a new rail tunnel under
the Hudson River from New Jersey to New York, part of a larger project
known as the Gateway program that could cost more than $20 billion. The
current century-old tunnel used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains
was damaged during Hurricane Sandy.

On Wednesday, supporters of the project praised Mr. Trump’s comments,
adding that the tunnel was “precisely the kind of infrastructure program
that warrants continued and increased public investment,” according to
John D. Porcari, the interim executive director of the Gateway
Development Corporation, which is being created to oversee the project.
Mr. Christie canceled an earlier plan to build a tunnel under the river,
but he supports the new proposal.

In Los Angeles County, a place known for its reliance on cars, nearly 70
percent of voters approved a transportation proposal, known as Measure
M, which required two-thirds of the vote to pass. The financing will
allow the region to expand on recent projects like the new [Expo Line
light
rail](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/us/la-metro-expo-line-santa-monica.html)
connecting downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica, and to improve bus
service and repave local streets.

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who supported the transportation
measure, called it a “new day” for his city and other American cities.
Many people who live in Los Angeles do not have a car, he said, and the
new rail line there has surpassed expectations for ridership.

“A lot of people are looking for a place they can read the paper, check
their emails and not worry about the headaches of a traffic jam,” he
said.
