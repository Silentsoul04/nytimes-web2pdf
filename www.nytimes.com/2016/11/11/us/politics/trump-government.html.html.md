WASHINGTON — After President-elect Donald J. Trump promised to “[drain
the
swamp](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-lobbyists-swamp-campaign.html)”
that he sees in the nation’s capital, his millions of supporters are
expecting vast changes in the sprawling federal bureaucracy, and
conservative activists are drooling at the chance to remake, resize or
reduce the reach of government.

Mr. Trump repeatedly told voters during the campaign that he would shut
down the Environmental Protection Agency and repeal the Affordable Care
Act. He said the Education Department is “massive, and it can be largely
eliminated.” He has made the federal work force of 2.8 million employees
a target, declaring that “you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.”

But the one-time real estate mogul has largely avoided specifics about
cuts he might make, and much of his agenda imagines changes that would
require huge increases in federal spending: tripling the number of
border patrol agents; supplying the military with more warships and
fighter jets; increasing spending on infrastructure; undertaking new
efforts to confront cyberterrorism; and aggressively working to remake
trade policies.

Whatever change he envisions will likely be vastly more difficult to
enact than his army of supporters believe. Veterans of Washington’s many
fights over policy warn that the city is full of ingrained
bureaucracies, each of which has entrenched support on Capitol Hill. And
while Mr. Trump will have some executive authority, legal, practical and
political limitations will constrain his efforts.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He doesn’t possess the executive power to reorganize the government at
whim,” said Jody Freeman, a law professor at Harvard University who
served in the first Obama administration. “There are some minor things
presidents can do, in terms of creating new offices in cabinet agencies.
But the notion that he can single-handedly abolish agencies is
fanciful.”

## Energy and the Environment

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The first indication of Mr. Trump’s intentions may come as he appoints
members of his cabinet, sending signals about his priorities. Sarah
Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, has expressed
interest in **running the** **Energy Department**. In a CNN interview
last year, she promised to dismantle it. “If I were in charge of that,
it would be a short-term job,” she said.

Mr. Trump has also suggested a significant **reshaping of the agency’s
role**, which includes oversight of the **National Nuclear Security
Administration** and the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Mr. Trump has
indicated that he would like the agency to focus chiefly on energy
extraction, and some people close to him believe he may choose oil and
gas magnate Harold Hamm to run it.

As Mr. Trump prepares to slam the brakes on President Obama’s climate
change regulations and ramp up fossil fuel production, he has **vowed to
gut the Environmental Protection Agency.** “We are going to get rid of
it in almost every form,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That would be difficult. Mr. Trump would need an act of Congress to
eliminate the agency entirely, Ms. Freeman said. The **Clean Air Act**
and **Clean Water Act** include specific provisions that give the agency
legal powers, and changing that would require action by Congress as
well. “Any effort to interfere with that would immediately be challenged
in court,” Ms. Freeman said.

## Health and Education

**Ditching the** **Affordable Care Act**, Mr. Obama’s signature
legislative achievement, is close to a certainty.

But not every part of the law can easily be overturned, and some of the
initiatives that have changed the way the government pays for health
care in the **Medicare** program are supported by Republicans. The ****
[**Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Innovation**](https://innovation.cms.gov/) and the **Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute**, both deeply unpopular with congressional
Republicans, will probably be
eliminated.

“I imagine they’ll focus on getting rid of the individual and employer
mandates, insurance marketplace requirements and Medicaid expansion,”
said Lanhee J. Chen, a scholar at the Hoover Institution and a former
policy adviser to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.

Within the government’s health agencies, Mr. Trump’s campaign also
proposed **eliminating the** **Food and Drug Administration’s** “food
police,” which it said “dictate how the federal government expects
farmers to produce fruits and vegetables and even dictates the
nutritional content of dog food.”

But the proposal was quickly taken down from the campaign’s website. The
Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which **strengthened the**
**F.D.A.’s** oversight of food, is popular among many Republicans as
well as with food manufacturers, tarnished by massive food recalls.

Andy Roth, the vice president for government affairs at the Club for
Growth, a conservative advocacy group, praised Mr. Trump’s comments on
**scaling back the** **Education Department**. Mr. Trump has proposed
sending $20 billion to the states for school choice programs.

“Bureaucrats in D.C. don’t know how to provide for an education like a
parent can,” Mr. Roth said. But he said he is largely mystified about
the president-elect’s plans. “Trump is a huge question mark,” he said.
“And we honestly don’t know which way he is going go.”

## Economy

The president-elect has vowed to double the nation’s rate of economic
growth through a combination of broad tax cuts, new trade policies and
smart deregulation.

But analysts say he is unlikely to undertake a major overhaul of the
various government agencies that handle economic affairs, such as the
Departments of **Treasury**, **Commerce**, **Labor**, **Agriculture**,
**Transportation** and **Housing**. At the Treasury Department, the
[**Financial Stability Oversight
Council**](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Pages/home.aspx)
and the [**Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau**](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/), both created under the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Law, may have their wings
clipped, since neither is popular with congressional Republicans.

“I think Dodd-Frank is the major reason the economy has not grown at the
usual pace of recovery following a recession,” said Peter Wallison, a
senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative
Washington think tank.

[A brief
note](https://www.greatagain.gov/policy/financial-services.html) this
week on Mr. Trump’s transition website promised to “**dismantle”
Dodd-Frank** — but few foresee an absolute overhaul since that would
require ambitious legislative action in Congress. Even Senator Mitch
McConnell, the majority leader, signaled Wednesday that he intends to
move cautiously.

## Law Enforcement and National Security

Some conservatives may also be disappointed when it comes to Mr. Trump’s
approach to the nation’s military and intelligence establishment. Mr.
Trump lashed out during the campaign at Mr. Obama’s foreign policy, his
handling of wars in the Middle East and the government’s effort on
immigration. But the president-elect’s prescription for change is likely
to result in more spending, not
less.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump wants to **root out waste and abuse at the** **Department of
Defense**, even as he calls for **increasing the size of** **the Army**
to 540,000 active duty soldiers, increasing **the Navy** to 350 ships
and providing **the Air Force** with 1,200 fighter jets. And he promises
to pay for all of that with a “full audit” at the Pentagon that
eliminates duplicative bureaucracy and ends unwanted programs.

But history suggests he will fail in any overhaul of military programs,
said Amy Zegart, the co-director of the **Center for International
Security and Cooperation** at Stanford University. She predicted that
change would be opposed by legions of defense and intelligence
bureaucrats, as well as powerful members of Congress whose turf would be
threatened.

“Forging change will be much, much harder than he expects,” she said.

At the **Justice Department**, Mr. Obama significantly expanded efforts
to investigate unconstitutional policing and demanded changes in police
departments that have shown patterns of excessive force or other abuses.
Mr. Trump has not said what changes he was considering but has declared
that “the war on our police must end.”

A spokeswoman for the president-elect declined on Thursday to provide
any information about Mr. Trump’s thinking about the size and shape of
government. For now, conservative activists say they are unsure of what
to expect from the new president-elect.

“I would hope that he would embrace some radical program terminations,
but I’m not holding my breath,” said Chris Edwards, the editor of a blog
for the Cato Institute **on downsizing government**. In a
[post](https://www.cato.org/blog/trump-spending-cut-ideas) on Thursday,
Mr. Edwards called Mr. Trump “timid” and noted he had not pledged to
eliminate subsidies for schools, farms, housing, energy and transit —
cuts that conservatives crave.
