<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — Representative Mike Pompeo was once pointedly asked why his
committee’s inquiry into the 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic
compound in Benghazi, Libya, had dragged on longer than the Watergate
investigation. He did not flinch.

“This is worse, in some ways,” he said, during an appearance on “Meet
the Press” in late 2015.

A sharp, pugnacious Kansas congressman and former Army tank officer with
degrees from West Point and Harvard, Mr. Pompeo was often an unyielding
critic of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — accusing her of
orchestrating a wide-ranging cover-up of the Benghazi attacks.

On Friday, President-elect Donald J. Trump, who defeated Mrs. Clinton
after a bitter campaign, selected Mr. Pompeo to run the Central
Intelligence Agency.

If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Pompeo would become one of the most
overtly partisan figures to take over the C.I.A. — a spy agency that, at
least publicly, is supposed to operate above politics and avoid a direct
role in policy making.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the same time, the C.I.A. has been central to America’s secret wars
waged in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, giving the agency
a shadow role in the counterterrorism policy of the past two presidents.

As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Pompeo (pronounced
Pom-PAY-oh) has used his platform to denounce efforts in recent years to
rein in some of the most polarizing counterterrorism programs of the
post-Sept. 11 era.

He has advocated a return to the bulk collection of Americans’ domestic
calling records — which Congress restricted though legislation last year
— and he has denounced President Obama’s decision in 2009 to close
C.I.A. black-site prisons and also to require government interrogators
to strictly adhere to the rules of the Army Field Manual.

After a visit to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2013,
he told a congressional committee that a hunger strike by detainees was
a “political
stunt.”

## Donald Trump’s Cabinet Is Complete. Here’s the Full List.

A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Friday, some lawmakers — even Democrats — complimented Mr. Pompeo’s
work ethic and grasp of policy details. Representative Adam B. Schiff of
California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee,
praised Mr. Pompeo as “bright and hard-working.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“While we have had our share of strong differences — principally on the
politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi — I know that he is someone
who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a C.I.A.
director,” Mr. Schiff said.

It appears that Mr. Pompeo’s role in the Benghazi inquiry was a
significant factor in Mr. Trump’s decision to select him to lead the
C.I.A. Some members of the president-elect’s transition team viewed a
competing candidate for the position, former Representative Mike Rogers
of Michigan, as “soft” on Benghazi because Mr. Rogers, as chairman of
the House Intelligence Committee, oversaw a report that they believed
was not tough enough on Mrs. Clinton.

By contrast, Mr. Pompeo’s relentless questioning of Mrs. Clinton during
her October 2015 appearance before the House Select Committee on
Benghazi raised his profile in Republican circles. When the committee
concluded its work this year, Mr. Pompeo’s position on Mrs. Clinton’s
role was an outlier even from most of his Republican colleagues.

The select committee found [no new evidence of
wrongdoing](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-benghazi.html)
by the Obama administration or Mrs. Clinton, but Mr. Pompeo and another
Republican member of the committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio,
said they were convinced that there had been a cover-up. When the
committee released its findings in June, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Jordan filed
a 48-page addendum that said the attacks showed the State Department was
“seemingly more concerned with politics and Secretary Clinton’s legacy
than with protecting its people in Benghazi.”

The chairman of the select committee, Representative Trey Gowdy,
Republican of South Carolina, did not put his name on the addendum.

After graduating first in his class at West Point, Mr. Pompeo served as
an armored Cavalry officer and was deployed in Germany during the final
years of the Cold War. After leaving the Army, he attended Harvard Law
School and was an editor of the Harvard Law Review.

He arrived in Congress in 2011, after a sometimes bitter campaign
against Raj Goyle, a Democratic state representative. During the
campaign, one of Mr. Pompeo’s aides promoted an article on Twitter that
referred to Mr. Goyle, an Indian-American, as a “Turban Topper.”

In an interview Friday, Mr. Goyle said that Mr. Pompeo personally
apologized to him for the incident, but that the campaign staff member
was never
fired.

## The Two Americas of 2016

A view of two imaginary nations created by slicing the country along the

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As we are entering an era where relations with Muslim and minority
communities in America are extremely sensitive, his record and his
approach should be scrutinized during the confirmation hearing,” Mr.
Goyle said.

Mr. Pompeo has close ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the
billionaire conservatives who are among the most significant activists
in financing Republican candidates nationwide. Their company, Koch
Industries, and its employees have contributed $357,000 to Mr. Pompeo
since 2009.

He has common cause with many senior Republican lawmakers on a range of
issues, including a distaste for the agreement the United States and
five world powers struck with Iran in 2015 to significantly limit
Tehran’s nuclear ability for more than a decade in return for lifting
international oil and financial sanctions.

In [an
op-ed](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/07/14/rep-mike-pompeo-one-year-later-obama-s-iran-nuclear-deal-puts-us-at-increased-risk.html)
this summer on the Fox News website, Mr. Pompeo wrote that the United
States should “walk away from this deal.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Indeed, some members of the transition team pushed for Mr. Pompeo
because they believe that picking an incumbent lawmaker would help
foster better relations between Congress and the intelligence agencies.
Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and now the
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Friday
that Mr. Pompeo “will undoubtedly develop a close working relationship
with Congress in his new post.”

But some Senate Democrats indicated that Mr. Pompeo could face a
difficult confirmation hearing, citing some of his past comments,
particularly his praise for the C.I.A.’s former detention and
interrogation program.

That program “was ineffective, it was brutal and it stands in direct
violation of American values,” Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of
California, said in a statement. “We can never return to that dark
time.”

Ms. Feinstein, a member of the Intelligence Committee, led an
investigation into the C.I.A.’s program that produced a voluminous
report — most of which remains classified.

In her statement, she said she planned “to speak with Congressman Pompeo
about this issue during his confirmation process.”
