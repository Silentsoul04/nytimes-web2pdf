President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday named Gov. Nikki Haley of
South Carolina as his choice to become ambassador to the United Nations,
adding to his prospective cabinet a former critic with whom he had
sparred bitterly.

Ms. Haley's name had previously been mentioned as a possible contender
to become Mr. Trump's secretary of state, and she met with
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/us/politics/donald-trump-transition.html}{Trump
transition officials last week} in New York.

Her selection was first reported by the The Post and Courier newspaper
in Charleston, S.C. The news of Ms. Haley's selection came after days of
criticism of Mr. Trump's early picks as a homogeneous bloc of older,
white men. If confirmed, Ms. Haley would step down as governor and be
replaced by the state's lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, who was an
early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump.

Ms. Haley, 44, supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the
Republican primaries, and she was a prominent and frequent critic of Mr.
Trump early in his run.

That criticism was thought to have kept her off Mr. Trump's list of
vice-presidential candidates, although her name was mentioned in passing
before he chose Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana.

List.}\label{donald-trumps-cabinet-is-complete-heres-the-full-list}}

A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new
administration.

\href{http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/13/nikki-haley-turns-on-donald-trump-in-rebuttal-address/}{Ms.
Haley called out Mr. Trump} in January when she gave the official
Republican rebuttal to President Obama's State of the Union address, and
she later took him to task for his failure to
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/29/nikki-haley-faults-donald-trump-for-not-condemning-white-supremacists/}{condemn
groups like the Ku Klux Klan}.

``Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to
make a difference,'' Ms. Haley said in the State of the Union rebuttal.
``That is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down
the volume.''

In a follow-up interview on the ``Today'' show on NBC, Ms. Haley --- the
daughter of immigrants from India --- said, ``Mr. Trump has definitely
contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk.''

Mr. Trump
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/18/donald-trump-turns-his-fire-on-nikki-haley/}{responded
harshly} to that address, calling her ``weak'' on immigration and noting
that she had asked him for campaign contributions.

``She's very, very weak on illegal immigration,'' Mr. Trump said.
``She's very, very weak on illegal immigration. You can't have that.''

The following month, she condemned Mr. Trump for not speaking out
against white supremacy more forcefully.

Ms. Haley drew on South Carolina's experience last year with the murder
of nine African-Americans in a Charleston church, saying that was
exactly the kind of hate that Mr. Trump refused to repudiate.

``The K.K.K. came to South Carolina from out of state to protest on our
Statehouse grounds,'' she said at a rally in Georgia. ``I will not stop
until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the K.K.K. That is not
a part of our party. That is not who we are.''

Supporters of Mr. Trump were angered that Ms. Haley called him out, and
many took to Twitter and mocked her Indian heritage, making fun of her
Indian given name. Some of that sentiment reappeared on social media
once word began circulating that Ms. Haley was likely to be chosen to be
part of the Trump administration.

Still, in a primary season interview with CNN, Ms. Haley urged Mr. Trump
not to take her comments personally, and said that she considered him a
friend.

``I have disagreements with other presidential candidates,''
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0SOJkZFr5A}{Ms. Haley said}.
``There's lots of things, but I will say tone matters, message matters
and responsibility matters.''

If nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Haley, now in
her second term as South Carolina governor, would succeed Samantha
Power, who has represented the United States at the United Nations since
2013.
