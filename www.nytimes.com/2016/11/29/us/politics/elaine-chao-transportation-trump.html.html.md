WASHINGTON — She is a woman and an immigrant, a fixture of the
Republican establishment for two decades. She is a savvy and
professional practitioner of the capital’s inside game.

And now she is going to work for President-elect Donald J. Trump.

Mr. Trump named Elaine L. Chao on Tuesday as his choice to be the next
secretary of transportation, elevating someone whose background and
experience are in many respects completely at odds with the brash and
disruptive tenor of his anti-Washington campaign.

But her selection also signaled Mr. Trump’s understanding of the need to
surround himself with people who can help him accomplish the most
ambitious parts of his agenda, even if they come from the political
establishment he has so often scorned.

His transportation secretary is likely to be one of the more essential
players. Mr. Trump, a real estate magnate, has said that infrastructure
redevelopment will be a priority of his first 100 days in office. And
Ms. Chao has experience — politically and personally — in navigating the
competing centers of power in the capital. She is married to Senator
Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This will be her second time serving in a White House cabinet if she is
confirmed. As secretary of labor under President George W. Bush, she was
[the only
official](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/washington/10chao.html) in
his administration to serve all eight years.

Before that, she worked in various departments across the federal
government. She was a White House fellow under President Ronald Reagan
and the director of the Peace Corps under President George Bush, who
also named her deputy transportation secretary.

“That says something,” said Richard F. Hohlt, a veteran Republican
consultant and friend of Ms. Chao’s. “She knows how to work a
bureaucracy, and she knows how to last.”

Her résumé speaks to the ease with which she runs in powerful circles in
Washington and beyond. She has worked for Harvard’s Kennedy School of
Government as well as the conservative Heritage Foundation. She was also
a frequent commentator on Fox News, a role that several of Mr. Trump’s
other cabinet picks and candidates share, like K. T. McFarland, [whom he
named as his deputy national security
adviser](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/us/politics/donald-trump-kt-mcfarland.html).

That is not her only connection to the world of Rupert Murdoch, whose
News Corporation includes Fox. She sits on the company’s board of
directors.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She adds some diversity to a cabinet that is so far heavily older, white
and male. Ms. Chao, 63, was born in Taiwan and moved to the United
States with her family when she was
8.

## Donald Trump’s Cabinet Is Complete. Here’s the Full List.

A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new
administration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the public aspects of her life are well known, Ms. Chao has also
played an [integral, behind-the-scenes role in her husband’s political
career](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/us/politics/girding-for-a-fight-mcconnell-enlists-his-wife.html),
most recently as he fought off efforts to unseat him in 2014. Described
by friends and colleagues as unrelenting, she occasionally stepped out
into the public eye to take on her husband’s antagonists.

Sometimes they also came for her, and she was happy to take them on as
well. After a liberal Kentucky group suggested in 2013 that Ms. Chao was
somehow connected to the flight of American jobs to China — a jab
evidently intended to portray Mr. McConnell as too cozy with American
business interests — she starred in a commercial and rushed to his
defense. “Far-left special interests are also attacking my ethnicity,
even attacking Mitch’s patriotism, because he’s married to me,” she
said. “That’s how low some people will stoop.”

Mr. Trump was impressed by her energy and drive, a senior transition
official said, speaking anonymously to reveal the private interactions
between Ms. Chao and the president-elect. He also admired her
no-nonsense attitude, this official said.

But now that she is in line for a prominent position in Mr. Trump’s
cabinet, it is her own ties to business that are likely to come under
scrutiny. As labor secretary, [she faced
criticism](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/washington/10chao.html)
that her department favored business and was lax on enforcement and
worker safety.

At the time, she dismissed those concerns as “partisan.”

Her time out of government service is likely to be the biggest area of
focus for labor and other left-leaning interests, though her
confirmation in the Senate does not appear to be in any doubt. Senator
Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, praised her government
service on Tuesday, and said he hoped to work collaboratively with her
and Mr. Trump on an infrastructure plan, which would have to make it
through the Senate her husband leads.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I hope Secretary Chao shares that ambitious goal and is willing to work
with Democrats,” Mr. Schumer said.

A particular area of interest for her critics will be her position on
the board of Wells Fargo, which has been [tainted by
revelations](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-fined-for-years-of-harm-to-customers.html)
that its managers tolerated and even encouraged its employees to sign
customers up for services they did not want.

But other private-sector work could prove to be an asset. She was a
banker for Citicorp and helped close transactions that involved
transportation financing.

The financing issue she will confront now is altogether different,
however. Despite the consensus that the nation’s infrastructure is in
dire need of an overhaul, Congress and the White House have been unable
to agree on how to pay for it.

“That’s where the creative thinking takes place,” said Ray LaHood, who
served as transportation secretary under President Obama. He also worked
with Ms. Chao when he served in Congress and she was labor secretary.
Given her understanding of the complexities of the private sector and
the dysfunction of Washington, Mr. LaHood added, Ms. Chao was a strong
candidate.

“I’m as optimistic as I’ve been in a long time about the potential she
brings to finally get something done on infrastructure,” he said.
