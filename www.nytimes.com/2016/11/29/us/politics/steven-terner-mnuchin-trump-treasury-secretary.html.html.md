WASHINGTON — Steven Mnuchin, a financier with deep roots on Wall Street
and in Hollywood but no government experience, is expected to be named
Donald J. Trump’s Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, people close
to the transition say.

Mr. Mnuchin, 53, was the national finance chairman for Mr. Trump’s
campaign, and his selection would elevate a wealthy loyalist to a
pivotal economic post. He began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he
became a partner, before creating his own hedge fund, moving to the West
Coast and entering the first rank of movie financiers by bankrolling
hits like the “X-Men” franchise and “Avatar.”

If confirmed, Mr. Mnuchin would play a critical role in carrying out Mr.
Trump’s promised economic policy changes, including the enactment of a
large package of tax cuts, sweeping changes to foreign trade agreements
and the fulfillment of a huge new infrastructure spending program. He
could also help lead any efforts to roll back President Obama’s nuclear
deal with Iran and the administration’s opening to Cuba by reimposing
sanctions on Tehran and Havana.

Mr. Mnuchin’s selection fits uneasily with much of Mr. Trump’s campaign
attacks on the financial industry. Mr. Trump, in a campaign ad intended
as a closing argument, portrayed the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as
the personification of a global elite that the ad said had “robbed our
working class.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The selection of Mr. Mnuchin (pronounced mi-NEW-chin) came as Mr. Trump
moved on Tuesday to fill the ranks of his domestic policy team with
seasoned Washington insiders chosen to help smooth the way in Congress
for his two marquee campaign promises: the repeal of Mr. Obama’s health
insurance coverage law and the large package to repair infrastructure,
which could reach $1 trillion.

Mr. Trump also took time Tuesday night to have dinner with Mitt Romney,
whose name has been mentioned as a potential secretary of state, and who
has become a source of contention among members of the transition
team.

## Donald Trump’s Cabinet Is Complete. Here’s the Full List.

A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new
administration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who called Mr. Trump a
“phony” and a “fraud” during the Republican primaries, sat down for a
four-course meal Tuesday night at Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin
restaurant at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.

Mr. Romney emerged several hours later to heap compliments on the
president-elect, who has bristled privately that Mr. Romney never
apologized for insulting him during the race.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There was no apology, but Mr. Romney said he had been impressed by Mr.
Trump’s victory speech on election night, his transition effort and his
personnel decisions.

“He did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in accomplishing:
He won the general election,” Mr. Romney told reporters.

The appointments on Tuesday included[Elaine L.
Chao](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/politics/elaine-chao-transportation-trump.html)
— a veteran of past Republican administrations who is married to Senator
Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader — as
transportation secretary. She will be charged with steering the
infrastructure initiative through a divided Congress and the federal
bureaucracy. Mr. Trump also
[announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/politics/tom-price-secretary-health-and-human-services.html)
that he would nominate Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia,
a physician who has been a fierce opponent of the health care law, as
his secretary of health and human services — tasked with leading his
efforts to dismantle the measure.

And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump will announce Wilbur Ross, the billionaire
investor, as his secretary of commerce, according to the transition
team.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The moves suggested that Mr. Trump was seeking experienced policy makers
who have deep relationships in Washington to shepherd his most sweeping
pledges.

In Ms. Chao, Mr. Trump is turning to a former secretary of labor under
President George W. Bush. Her experience on Capitol Hill will be
necessary to take on what will have to be a bipartisan infrastructure
effort in Congress. Aides said Mr. Trump’s
[choice](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/politics/tom-price-secretary-health-and-human-services.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2FThe%20Trump%20White%20House&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&module=Collection&region=Marginalia&src=me&version=newsevent&pgtype=article)
of Mr. Price underscored the president-elect’s commitment to move
swiftly — as early as his first day in office — to roll back the
Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement,
and replace it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Chao, who was born in Taiwan, brings a third woman to cabinet-level
positions in a Trump administration and an additional degree of
diversity to the president-elect’s team, so far filled largely with
conservative white men who have scoffed at political convention.

Democrats said they were cautiously optimistic about working with Ms.
Chao to forge a bipartisan infrastructure deal. “I hope Secretary Chao
shares that ambitious goal and is willing to work with Democrats to
rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying
jobs along the way,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is set
to become the new minority leader.

But Ms. Chao was quickly criticized by liberal groups who said she was
emblematic of the very corporate-driven political establishment Mr.
Trump had promised to dismantle. Some policy analysts argued that as
labor secretary she had inadequately protected employee rights, and the
Center for American Progress called her selection an “ominous sign for
workers.”

The selection of Mr. Price, who has served in Congress since 2005,
revealed deeper partisan
divisions.

Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of
the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called Mr. Price “a
brilliant choice,” adding, “I’m glad that we’ll have a doctor who knows
health care inside and out leading the way.”

But Democrats and their allies voiced alarm.

Richard J. Fiesta, the executive director of the Alliance for Retired
Americans, which represents retired union members, said he was
“horrified” by the selection of Mr. Price. Marcia D. Greenberger, a
president of the National Women’s Law Center, a research and advocacy
group, said Mr. Price “would have a devastating impact on women’s
health.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump has an ally whose nomination is expected to be
well received on Wall Street, a number of traders and bankers contacted
on Tuesday said.

Since Mr. Trump’s victory, United States equity markets have hit record
highs, with financial institutions leading the way. Having a Treasury
secretary with broad experience as a financier is likely to sustain the
view that a Trump administration will look favorably on Wall Street, not
least in terms of pulling back some regulations put in place by Mr.
Obama.

Mr. Mnuchin was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. When Mr. Trump won New
York’s Republican presidential primary contest in April, Mr. Mnuchin
attended the victory party. The next day, he accepted Mr. Trump’s
invitation to become the campaign’s national finance chairman.

Mr. Mnuchin, the son of a Goldman Sachs partner, joined the firm after
graduating from Yale. He worked there for 17 years, rising to oversee
trading in government securities and mortgage bonds.

He would be the third Goldman Sachs alumnus to serve as Treasury
secretary, and the announcement of his appointment drew swift
condemnation from liberal groups who said he had cashed in on the
country’s financial collapse.

“He purchased a bailed-out bank for pennies on the dollar and then
aggressively foreclosed on tens of thousands of families,” Jon Green, a
spokesman for the Take on Wall Street campaign, said in a statement.
“Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy
should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The group was apparently referring to Mr. Mnuchin’s role in 2009 in a
group that bought the failed California mortgage lender IndyMac from the
government. He became the chairman of the company, renamed OneWest,
which was ultimately sold to CIT, the nation’s largest small-business
lender, in 2015 for more than twice the price the group had paid.

During Mr. Mnuchin’s tenure, OneWest faced allegations that it had
foreclosed improperly on some borrowers. Fair-housing groups also filed
a complaint with the federal government, claiming that OneWest was not
meeting its legal obligation to make loans in minority neighborhoods.

Mr. Mnuchin was the latest in a string of wealthy donors whom Mr. Trump
has selected for top posts in his cabinet, including Mr. Ross; Todd
Ricketts, a Republican megadonor and an owner of the Chicago Cubs, who
is expected to be the deputy commerce secretary; and Betsy DeVos, a
school choice activist and Republican fund-raiser, who he
[announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/donald-trump-president-elect.html)
would be his education secretary.

Mr. Mnuchin has conducted past business deals with the president-elect —
but not always under the best of circumstances. Mr. Mnuchin’s hedge
fund, Dune Capital Management, helped finance construction of a Trump
project in Chicago. In 2008, Mr. Trump sued Dune and other lenders to
extend the loan terms. The parties ultimately settled.

The selections on Tuesday came as Mr. Trump huddled with advisers and
potential cabinet officials in Trump Tower in Manhattan.

Among the issues is whether Mr. Trump should name Mr. Romney as his
secretary of state. After their dinner, Mr. Romney told reporters that
Mr. Trump “continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people
together, and his vision is something which obviously connected with the
American people in a very powerful way.”

He said Mr. Trump’s conduct since winning the election gives “me
increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead
us to that better future.”
