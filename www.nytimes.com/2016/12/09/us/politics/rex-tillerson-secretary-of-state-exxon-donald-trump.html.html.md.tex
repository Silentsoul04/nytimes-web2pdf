Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has
emerged as President-elect Donald J. Trump's top choice to become
secretary of state, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
search process.

The news is the latest turn in what has become the most extended drama
of Mr. Trump's transition effort, with a rotating cast of seeming
front-runners to become America's top diplomat. Choosing Mr. Tillerson
would add to a long list of wealthy businesspeople in high-ranking Trump
administration posts.

As Exxon's top official, Mr. Tillerson has extensive experience working
with foreign leaders. Some of his foreign relationships, especially
those with Russia, could come under particular scrutiny during a Senate
confirmation hearing.

List.}\label{donald-trumps-cabinet-is-complete-heres-the-full-list}}

A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new
administration.

Mr. Tillerson, 64, who met with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at Trump Tower in
New York, has been strongly recommended by a number of business leaders.
It is unclear when Mr. Trump expects to announce his choice for the job.

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has been
described by Mr. Trump's advisers as still in the running. But Mr. Trump
has privately said conflicting things on his views of Mr. Romney,
advisers said, and has indicated to several people that he is unlikely
to be named. Mr. Romney harshly criticized Mr. Trump during the
presidential campaign.

Mr. Tillerson has worked to strengthen Exxon Mobil's ties with Russia.
The company has various joint ventures with the oil giant Rosneft around
Russia, and has contributed to social programs in education and health.
In 2012, the Russian government awarded Mr. Tillerson the country's
Order of Friendship decoration.

Western sanctions against Russia prohibiting the nation from certain
energy development activities have slowed Exxon Mobil's investments,
particularly a joint venture with Rosneft that was supposed to start
drilling for oil in the Kara Sea in 2014. Mr. Tillerson has spoken out
against sanctions, in part because Exxon Mobil is unable to collect
revenues from an investment in an oil and gas consortium it belongs to
that operates off Sakhalin Island.

In addition, Exxon Mobil has close connections with the Qatari national
oil company, and has partnered with the Qataris in building a liquefied
natural gas terminal on the Gulf of Mexico coast that is designed for
importing gas and possibly for exporting it as well.

Mr. Tillerson assumed the role of chairman and chief executive of Exxon
Mobil on
\href{http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/about-us/management/rex-w-tillerson}{Jan.
1, 2006}. During his tenure, the company has acknowledged the science
underlying climate change and said it supports a carbon tax. It has also
expressed support for the Paris climate agreement.

``We believe that addressing the risk of climate change is a global
issue,'' he said at the company's annual shareholder meeting in May,
adding that it would require the cooperation of governments, business
and individuals.

By contrast, Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax created by the
Chinese for business reasons, and has named a climate change denier,
Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, as his choice to lead
the Environmental Protection Agency.

\subsection{Outsiders, Insiders and Multimillionaires in Trump's
Cabinet}\label{outsiders-insiders-and-multimillionaires-in-trumps-cabinet}}

President-elect Donald J. Trump's cabinet and top staff are shaping up
to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and
former military officers who have been critical of the Obama
administration.

Some climate activists said that despite Exxon Mobil's statements on
climate change, it could be doing far more.

Jamie Henn, a co-founder of the climate action group
\href{http://350.org/}{350.org}, said that while Exxon Mobil and its
representatives had been careful to say they supported the Paris
agreement, under which nearly every nation has agreed to reduce
emissions, ``a read of their public energy assessments make it clear
they have no intention of helping the world meet that target or adjust
their business plans in that direction.''

One initial contender for the secretary-of-state post, Rudolph W.
Giuliani, a loyal Trump ally, is no longer in the running after removing
his name from contention on Nov. 29, according to a statement Friday
from the transition team.

``Rudy Giuliani is an extraordinarily talented and patriotic American,''
Mr. Trump said in the statement. ``I will always be appreciative of his
24/7 dedication to our campaign after I won the primaries and for his
extremely wise counsel. He is and continues to be a close personal
friend, and as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice and can see
an important place for him in the administration at a later date.''

Mr. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, will remain on the transition
team.
