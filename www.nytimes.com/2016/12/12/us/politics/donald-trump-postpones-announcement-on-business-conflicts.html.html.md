WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump said late Monday night that
“no new deals will be done” by his real estate business while he is in
the Oval Office, a promise that appeared meant to address ethical
concerns about conflicts of interest between his elected position and
his real estate empire.

But the move is unlikely to satisfy critics, including the government’s
official ethics office, who have said the only way for Mr. Trump to
avoid such conflicts is to entirely divest his stake in the Trump
Organization.

Mr. Trump [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/808528428123254785)
just after 11:30 p.m. that he would leave his businesses before his
inauguration and that his grown sons, Eric and Donald Jr., along with
other executives, would manage them. [He
added](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/808529888630239232),
“No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office,” and promised
to hold a news conference soon to discuss the plans.

Mr. Trump had originally said, in an earlier Twitter post, that he would
announce his business plans during a news conference on Dec. 15. But
officials with the transition confirmed on Monday that the news
conference had been delayed.

Now, he will not hold it until January — most likely before his
inauguration and after a vacation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida,
officials said, confirming a report in Bloomberg News.

The officials said building a cabinet had consumed more of Mr. Trump’s
time than expected. And they said he needed more time to decide how to
deal with the large, iconic real estate holdings that are part of the
global Trump business.

Even if Mr. Trump and his children stop making new deals, the Trump
Organization already has a large basket of investments and branding
deals that present apparent conflicts of interest around the world.

In Washington, Mr. Trump and his family recently opened the Trump
International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue — in a building rented from a
federal government agency that Mr. Trump will soon oversee. Mr. Trump is
also part-owner of a hotel in Las Vegas, where a dispute with workers is
pending before the National Labor Relations Board, which Mr. Trump will
also oversee by appointing its members.

The Trump Organization has business partners in the Philippines, Brazil,
India, Turkey and other nations where Mr. Trump himself has acknowledged
a conflict of interest over real estate projects. At the same time, he
will need to deal with top officials in Turkey over matters like the
fight against the Islamic State and the continued crackdown on
dissidents there after an attempted coup.

Mr. Trump, at least so far, has not given any hint that he intends to
sell these assets or sever ties with business partners; he says he will
instead turn over management of the operations to his children. His
family continues to personally profit from the investments, which ethics
experts said could present a conflict of interest even if Mr. Trump and
his family do not enter new deals.

Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics adviser under President George
W. Bush, said Mr. Trump’s latest Twitter posts meant very little in
terms of eliminating conflicts.

“It makes no sense to say ‘no new deals,’” Mr. Painter said, questioning
why the president-elect would make an announcement just before midnight
on a Monday. “What is he talking about?”

“Is he going to continue to borrow money from foreign banks like Bank of
China? That is a deal,” Mr. Painter said. “Or collect rent from foreign
government-owned companies? That is a deal. Will he still be hiring
people, or having people stay in his hotels?”

The news conference this week would have been Mr. Trump’s first since
the election. He had announced last week it on Twitter, promising to
“discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in
order to fully focus on running the country.”
