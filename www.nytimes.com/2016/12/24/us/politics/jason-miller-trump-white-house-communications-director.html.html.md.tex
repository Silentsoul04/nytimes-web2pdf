Jason Miller, who was named as White House communications director by
President-elect Donald J. Trump two days ago, has informed Mr. Trump
that he will not take the job, according to a statement from Mr. Miller.

In the statement, Mr. Miller said he wanted to spend more time with his
family. His wife is expecting their second child in January, he said.

``It's clear they need to be my top priority right now, and this is not
the time to start a new job as demanding as White House communications
director,'' Mr. Miller wrote.

A veteran of several Republican campaigns, Mr. Miller was an avid
supporter of Mr. Trump, appearing regularly on television on his behalf
throughout the campaign. He had been a principal spokesman during the
transition period.

In the statement, Mr. Miller said that Sean Spicer, who was recently
named press secretary, would serve as communications director, as well.
