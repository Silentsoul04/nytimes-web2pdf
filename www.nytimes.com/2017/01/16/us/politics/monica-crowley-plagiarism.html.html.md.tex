Monica Crowley, who was selected just weeks ago to serve in a
high-profile post on President-elect Donald J. Trump's National Security
Council, has decided against taking the position after
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/business/harpercollins-pulls-monica-crowley-book-for-plagiarism.html}{allegations
that she plagiarized} key passages in a 2012 book.

Ms. Crowley, whose name was briefly floated as a candidate for White
House press secretary, has been dogged by accusations of plagiarism in
recent weeks, beginning with
\href{http://money.cnn.com/interactive/news/kfile-trump-monica-crowley-plagiarized-multiple-sources-2012-book/?sr=fbmoney010717kfile-trump-monica-crowley-plagiarized-multiple-sources-2012-book0531PMStoryLink\&linkId=33126237\&sr=twCNN010717/?sr=fbmoney010717kfile}{the
discovery by CNN} that she copied several passages in a book she
published with HarperCollins. A later
\href{http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/monica-crowley-plagiarism-phd-dissertation-columbia-214612}{report
in Politico} unearthed similar issues in her doctoral dissertation.

``After much reflection, I have decided to remain in New York to pursue
other opportunities and will not be taking a position in the incoming
administration,'' Ms. Crowley said in
\href{http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/16/crowley-forgo-post-trump-white-house/}{a
statement to The Washington Times}.

``I greatly appreciate being asked to be part of President-elect Trump's
team, and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda
for American renewal,'' she said.

She did not address the allegations of plagiarism.

Ms. Crowley is the second official announced by the transition team to
decide not to go to the White House, following Jason Miller, who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/us/politics/jason-miller-trump-white-house-communications-director.html}{was
to be} the communications director.

One person close to the transition said that Ms. Crowley's role would
have involved overseeing certain speeches, something that would have
been difficult after the plagiarism claims.

HarperCollins has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/business/harpercollins-pulls-monica-crowley-book-for-plagiarism.html}{withdrawn
the digital edition} of Ms. Crowley's book ``What the (Bleep) Just
Happened?''

Published by Broadside Books,
\href{https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/harpercollins-to-start-conservative-imprint-broadside-books/}{a
conservative imprint} at HarperCollins, it is a critical look at Barack
Obama's presidency. It sold out 20,000 copies in hardcover, Publishers
Marketplace said.

Mr. Trump's transition team had labeled the plagiarism reports ``a
politically motivated attack'' and defended Ms. Crowley's ability to
serve.

``Monica's exceptional insight and thoughtful work on how to turn this
country around is exactly why she will be serving in the
administration,'' transition officials said in a statement to CNN.

``HarperCollins --- one of the largest and most respected publishers in
the world --- published her book, which has become a national best
seller,'' the statement said. ``Any attempt to discredit Monica is
nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract
from the real issues facing this country.''

Most publishers do not check for plagiarism, fabrication or factual
inaccuracies.
