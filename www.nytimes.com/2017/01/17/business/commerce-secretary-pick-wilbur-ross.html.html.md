Wilbur L. Ross, nominated to be the nation’s next commerce secretary, is
a very wealthy man with his hands in myriad businesses ranging from
banking to energy and real estate loans to the auto parts industry.

The billionaire investor, who made much of his money investing in
troubled companies, said in a filing released on Tuesday that he will
seek to sidestep potential conflicts of interest by divesting at least
80 assets and investment funds over the next several months. He will
also step down from positions with more than two-dozen funds or
companies in which he has a financial interest. Mr. Ross, 79, also
intends to divest himself of holdings in many of those entities.

The day before Mr. Ross is to appear before the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation for his confirmation hearing on
Wednesday, the federal Office of Government Ethics released his 57-page
disclosure statement detailing his extensive financial holdings. By
Tuesday afternoon, the ethics agency had posted an agreement it has with
Mr. Ross spelling out his plans for divestiture of holdings that could
pose a conflict with running the Commerce Department.

The filings reveal that Mr. Ross holds board positions with 82 companies
or foundations — many of the businesses are associated with WL Ross and
Company, his private equity firm, which is a division of Invesco. The
filing notes that Mr. Ross has an art collection valued at over $50
million; $150 million in cash in several brokerage accounts; and a wide
assortment of stocks and bonds.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The filing lists Mr. Ross as having assets ranging from $337 million to
$687 million and income between $16 million and $55 million. The figures
include some assets and income from his wife.

The disclosure filing and ethics agreement note that unvested shares
received as part of his compensation at Invesco will vest shortly after
he leaves the firm.

Mr. Ross sold his firm in 2006 to Invesco, an Atlanta-based investment
company, for about $375 million. In recent years, he has pulled back on
the daily operations of the business.

To remove the potential for conflict, Mr. Ross said in the ethics
agreement that he will resign from WL Ross and a number of Invesco
affiliates. But Mr. Ross does intend to retain unpaid positions in
several companies that own personal residences. He also plans to retain
financial interests in seven investment vehicles, including one involved
with the shipping industry.

The financial disclosure probably understates Mr. Ross’s net worth
because it does not place a value on the underlying assets held by many
of the investment funds in which he has stakes. Mr. Ross is one of
several wealthy business people President-elect Donald J. Trump has
nominated to join his cabinet. Mr. Trump’s choices have been criticized
for being at odds with the populist tone of his presidential campaign.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Ross’s selection has drawn scrutiny because he has bought struggling
companies — some already in bankruptcy — and tried to breathe new life
into them by using strategies that included layoffs and reworking of
union contracts and benefit packages.

During the confirmation hearing, Mr. Ross is likely to be asked about
job losses at some of the steel companies, coal companies and auto parts
companies that he has managed through his firm. He may face questions
about his firm’s overseas investments. He is vice chairman of the Bank
of Cyprus, the biggest bank in that European island nation.

Mr. Trump is expected to lean on Mr. Ross to help shape trade policy. In
the past, Mr. Ross has supported Mr. Trump’s call to rework trade deals
with foreign countries.

Yet Mr. Ross has located plants in other countries. Mr. Ross is chairman
of International Automotive Components Group, an auto parts manufacturer
with facilities in Mexico, a country that has been a frequent target of
Mr. Trump’s anti-trade barbs.

In the filing, he said that about 90 days after being sworn-in as
commerce secretary, he will assign the rights to annual payments he
receives from a profit-sharing plan at Rothschild, a company he used to
work for, to a public charity. He said he receives “approximately
“$1,000 a year in distributions from this plan.”
