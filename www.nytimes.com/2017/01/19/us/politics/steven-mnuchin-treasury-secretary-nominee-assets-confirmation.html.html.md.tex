WASHINGTON --- Steven T. Mnuchin, President-elect Donald J. Trump's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/politics/steven-terner-mnuchin-trump-treasury-secretary.html}{pick
to be Treasury secretary}, failed to disclose nearly \$100 million of
his assets on Senate Finance Committee disclosure documents and forgot
to mention his role as a director of an investment fund located in a tax
haven, an omission that Democrats said made him unfit to serve in one of
the government's most important positions.

The revelation came hours before Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs
banker, began testifying on Thursday before the Senate Finance
Committee, which has historically been bipartisan in its demands for
transparency from nominees. Mr. Mnuchin was ready to outline his vision
for the economy and defend himself against claims that he headed a bank
that ran a ``foreclosure machine'' during the financial crisis.

``The Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all
Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic
recovery to show up in their communities,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, the
ranking Democrat on the committee. ``When I look at Mr. Mnuchin's
background, it's a stretch to find evidence he'd be that kind of
Treasury secretary.''

In a hearing marked by sharp exchanges, Mr. Mnuchin struggled to answer
questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and
whether he thought such loopholes should be closed.

Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, pointedly asked Mr.
Mnuchin if he was using Cayman Islands corporations to avoid taxation.
He responded that he was working on behalf of his clients, in accordance
with the law.

``Let me just be clear again: I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in
any way to avoid paying taxes for myself,'' Mr. Mnuchin said. ``I would
love to work with the I.R.S. to close these tax issues that make no
sense.''

He added: ``I would support changing the tax laws to make sure they are
simpler and more effective.''

Republicans came to Mr. Mnuchin's defense, suggesting that none of his
omissions were willful, and they gave strong indications that they would
vote for him.

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, defended Mr. Mnuchin's
business record and described him as extremely qualified for the job.

``Objectively speaking, I don't believe anyone can reasonably argue that
Mr. Mnuchin is unqualified for the position,'' Mr. Hatch said. ``If the
confirmation process focused mainly on the question of a nominee's
qualifications, there would be little, if any, opposition to Mr.
Mnuchin's nomination.''

But the process was also focused on Mr. Mnuchin's financial disclosure
form, and that prompted intense scrutiny.

\subsection{Donald Trump's Cabinet Is Complete. Here's the Full
List.}\label{donald-trumps-cabinet-is-complete-heres-the-full-list}}

A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new
administration.

``In his revised questionnaire, Mr. Mnuchin disclosed several additional
financial assets, including \$95 million worth of real estate --- a
co-op in New York City, a residence in Southampton, New York, a
residence in Los Angeles, California, and \$15 million in real estate
holdings in Mexico,'' Democratic staff members of the Senate Finance
Committee wrote in a memo on Thursday. ``Mr. Mnuchin has claimed these
omissions were due to a misunderstanding of the questionnaire.''

According to the memo, Mr. Mnuchin also initially failed to disclose
that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment
fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, along with management posts in
seven other investment funds.

And he belatedly disclosed that his children own nearly \$1 million in
artwork.

Asked about the omissions at the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin described them as
a simple mistake made amid a mountain of bureaucracy.

``I think as you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms
is quite complicated,'' Mr. Mnuchin said, noting that he had handed over
5,000 pages of disclosures. ``Let me first say, any oversight, it was
unintentional.''

But Democrats pounced and tied Mr. Mnuchin to Mr. Trump's campaign
pledge to ``drain the swamp'' in Washington.

Pressed as to whether his failure to disclose the information was an
ethical lapse, Mr. Mnuchin insisted that he was following the guidance
of his lawyers and made an innocent error.

``I assure you that these forms were very complicated,'' he said,
explaining that he had pledged to be forthcoming to ``the best of my
knowledge.''

Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was unsatisfied with
the response and shot back, ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to
understand the words `list all positions.'''

To that, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader,
added: ``Never before has the Senate considered such an ethically
challenged slate of nominees for key cabinet positions. Mr. Mnuchin's
failure to disclose his Cayman Islands holdings just reeks of the swamp
that the president-elect promised to drain on the campaign trail.''

And American Bridge, the so-called Democratic super PAC, said Mr.
Mnuchin's holdings were a sign that Mr. Trump's government would not
look out for working class Americans.

``By slamming through Mnuchin, Senate Republicans are becoming
accessories to Trump's future corruption, helping him stack his cabinet
with shady billionaires who, like Trump, will rig the government to
serve their own interests at the expense of the American people,'' said
Shripal Shah, vice president of American Bridge.
