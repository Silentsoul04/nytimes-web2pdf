MEXICO CITY — In his first major speech since the change of
administrations in the United States, President [Enrique Peña
Nieto](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/world/americas/unrest-mexico-pena-nieto-gas-prices-trump.html)
of [Mexico](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/mexico?8qa)
promised a robust dialogue with President Trump based on shared
interests and mutual respect, but insisted that Mexico’s sovereignty —
and the protection of its citizens — would be the guiding forces for his
government.

The two leaders are preparing to meet next week, and Mr. Peña Nieto’s
speech outlined a broad platform that Mexico hopes to pursue in the face
of what many have seen as a hostile stance from the new American
president.

Mr. Peña Nieto stressed that any reassessment of the bilateral
relationship or renegotiation of decades-old accords, including the
North American Free Trade Agreement, would be part of a broader package.
Negotiations would include more than just trade, he said; they would
also encompass migration and security, two issues where Mexico plays a
strategic role for the United States.

“We will bring to the table all themes,” he said. “Trade, yes, but also
migration and the themes of security, including border security,
terrorist threats and the traffic of illegal drugs, arms and money.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The address was the most comprehensive explanation of Mexico’s foreign
policy aspirations in recent months. The government remained relatively
quiet during Mr. Trump’s political ascendancy, and even after his
election, adopting a nonaggressive approach in the face of the fear and
anxiety permeating the nation. On Monday, Mr. Peña Nieto, while offering
a fulsome defense of Mexico’s sovereignty, maintained that engagement
was the answer.

“The solution is neither confrontation nor submission,” he said. “The
solution is dialogue and negotiation.”

At the same time, there was no mistaking the nationalist tones woven
into his speech. That was perhaps the one element of the address that
did align with Mr. Trump’s vision for America, as the Mexican president
seemed to borrow the “America first” message for his own purposes.

With his government shaken by [corruption
scandals](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/world/americas/mexico%2Dcorruption%2Djavier%2Dduarte.html),
escalating
[violence](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/world/americas/mexico-drug-war-violence-donald-trump-wall.html)
and rising gasoline prices, Mr. Peña Nieto has the [lowest
popularity](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/world/americas/mexico%2Dpena%2Dnieto%2Dtrump%2Dturmoil%2Dgasoline.html)
of any president in decades. Some analysts feel that the threat posed by
Mr. Trump could be a means to bolster the poor standing of Mr. Peña
Nieto’s party while offering Mexicans a message of unity sorely lacking
in recent years.

“We are a sovereign nation, and we will act as such,” Mr. Peña Nieto
said. “The exercise of sovereignty implies that, in the process of
negotiation, our only interest is that of Mexico and those of Mexicans.”
He made clear that that pledge extended to Mexicans living in the United
States.

But he stopped short of full-blown nationalism. He described a Mexican
future categorically different from the one outlined by Mr. Trump for
the United States in his inaugural address on Friday. Where America
would reassess its adherence to free markets and its station as a
guardian of the liberal democratic order, Mexico would “reaffirm itself
as a nation open to the world, that participates in global markets with
high-value goods and services.”

Where Mr. Trump has questioned the benefits of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, blaming it for the loss of jobs in the United States to
the benefit of Mexico, Mr. Peña Nieto defended the pact. In the face of
calls for the agreement to be upended, he argued that the ties between
the United States, Mexico and Canada should deepen. Telecommunications,
energy and electronic trade should be incorporated into any new
agreement, he said.

At the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump’s aides said he would [move
quickly to renegotiate the
agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html?ref=business).

Mr. Peña Nieto and his aides have been preparing for months to deal with
the free trade issue. Even as some have [questioned Nafta’s benefits to
Mexico](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/world/americas/mexico-donald-trump-nafta.html),
where salaries are stagnant and the poverty rate has hardly moved, the
government has consistently defended the accord. But it has chosen a
strategy of negotiation that would both allow some changes and ask for
some of its own — and tie those changes to broader negotiations on
security and migration as a way to give Mexico some leverage in the
debate.

That leverage exists in Mexico’s increased policing of its southern
border, which serves as a first line of defense against both migrants
headed to the United States and terrorist threats.

Similarly, Mexico has long complained about the flow of guns and money
that enter the country from the north. About 70 percent of the firearms
seized in Mexico from 2009 to 2014 were traced back to the United
States, [according to a 2016
report](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-223) from the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, amounting to more than 73,000
guns.

The speech was notable for what it said about the evolving relationship
between Mexico and the United States, which have long been wary
neighbors but in recent decades have moved past animosities toward a
vision for a more shared future. Much of that was predicated on open
borders and trade, as well as on a mutual interest in preventing
transborder criminal enterprises like drug cartels. How that will be
carried out in the future is in question.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And in response to Mr. Trump’s biggest campaign promise, to build a wall
to halt the flow of people and drugs from Mexico to the United States,
Mr. Peña Nieto renewed his promise to keep Mexico open to the world, and
to the United States.

“Mexico does not believe in walls,” Mr. Peña Nieto said in his address.
“Our country believes in bridges.”
