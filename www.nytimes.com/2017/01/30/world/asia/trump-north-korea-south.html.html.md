SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump assured South Korea’s acting
president on Monday of the United States’ “ironclad” commitment to
defend the country, agreeing with Seoul to strengthen joint defense
capabilities against North Korea.

Mr. Trump’s assurances came amid anxiety in South Korea over the future
of the alliance with the United States. During his campaign, Mr. Trump
cast some doubt on the United States’ defense and trade commitments,
saying that South Korea was not paying enough to help keep 28,500
American troops in the country.

But speaking by phone to Hwang Kyo-ahn, the acting president of South
Korea, Mr. Trump said that the coming visit to South Korea by Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis reflected the close friendship of the two countries
and the importance of their alliance. Mr. Mattis is scheduled to visit
South Korea on Thursday on his first official trip abroad, which also
includes a stop in Japan.

“President Trump reiterated our ironclad commitment to defend the
R.O.K., including through the provision of extended deterrence, using
the full range of military capabilities,” the White House said in a
statement after Mr. Trump’s phone conversation with Mr. Hwang, using the
initials for South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.

“The two leaders agreed to take steps to strengthen joint defense
capabilities to defend against the North Korean threat.”

Mr. Hwang’s office quoted Mr. Trump as saying that the United States
would cooperate with South Korea “100 percent” and that bilateral
relations would be “better than ever before.”

The two leaders shared the need for firm action to persuade North Korea
to rethink its nuclear weapons development program and vowed to respond
strongly if the North attempted military provocations, it said.

Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Hwang followed North Korea’s [recent
warnings](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/world/asia/north-korea-trump-icbm-test.html?_r=0)
that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic
missile “anytime and anywhere,” in a rebuke to Mr. Trump.

Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the
United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can
cover the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a
long-range missile that could fly over the Pacific.

In a New Year’s Day speech, Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, said his
country had reached a “final stage” in preparing to test an
intercontinental ballistic missile. The next day Mr. Trump said in a
Twitter post, “It won’t happen\!”

It remains unclear how close North Korea is to building a reliable
intercontinental ballistic missile, although North Korea has boasted of
successfully testing crucial technology in the past year, such as
long-range engines and heat shields for such a missile.

Mr. Hwang, the prime minister of South Korea, is serving as acting
president because President Park Geun-hye’s powers were suspended after
the country’s Parliament [voted to impeach
her](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-geun-hye-impeached.html)
in December on charges of corruption and abuse of power.

The Constitutional Court of South Korea is expected to decide in the
coming weeks whether [to formally end her
presidency](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/world/asia/south-korea-president-park-impeachment.html)
or reinstate her.
