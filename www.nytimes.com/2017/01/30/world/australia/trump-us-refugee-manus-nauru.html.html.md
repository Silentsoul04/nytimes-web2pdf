SYDNEY, Australia — President Trump confirmed that his administration
would honor a refugee resettlement deal for the United States to accept
migrants Australia has detained on the Pacific islands of Nauru and
Manus, the Australian prime minister said on Monday.

Mr. Trump agreed to maintain the agreement, reached under the Obama
administration, during a 25-minute telephone call on Sunday, said the
prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. The election of Mr. Trump, whose harsh
talk about immigration was central to his campaign, [left the deal in
doubt](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/world/australia/australia-us-refugee-deal.html),
and its future was considered an early test for relations between the
United States and Australia.

“I thank President Trump for his commitment to honor that existing
agreement,” Mr. Turnbull said during a news conference on Monday in
Canberra, the Australian capital. Mr. Turnbull did not provide details
on how many refugees, who have been banished to Nauru and Manus by
Australia after being intercepted at sea trying to reach its shores,
would be going to the United States under the one-time agreement or when
they were likely to be resettled. Hundreds of people are housed in
offshore detention facilities on the islands in what rights groups
describe as [inhumane
conditions](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/world/australia/papua-new-guinea-asylum-seeker.html).

The deal had been under negotiation for months before being announced in
mid-November, shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. As a presidential
candidate, he pressed for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration,
though his campaign later said that the ban would apply only to migrants
from “terror-prone regions.” His executive order on immigration, enacted
on Friday, [banned immediate
entry](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html)
into the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim
countries, and it further fueled speculation that the deal with
Australia might be derailed.

Dougal Robinson, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center
at the University of Sydney, estimated that fewer than 2,000 detainees
would be sent to the United States. “They’ve already had significant
vetting by Australian authorities and any refugees that will be settled
in the U.S. will be subject to ‘extreme vetting’ by Department of
Homeland Security,” Mr. Robinson said. “If the Trump administration at
any point is going to accept refugees then these refugees are probably
better placed than most others.”

Mr. Trump’s order closed the nation to refugees and people from Iran,
Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The majority of refugees
on Manus and Nauru are from Iran and Iraq, and it is unclear whether a
proven refugee on Nauru and Manus who is from those countries and had
been successfully vetted by the Homeland Security Department would
receive the same treatment as a refugee not from those countries. “We
don’t have a clear indication of the mechanics of the deal and how it
will work,” Mr. Robinson said.

The Australian government has pledged never to accept migrants who
attempt to come to the country by boat. Those who are intercepted at sea
are housed indefinitely on offshore islands, which the government says
is necessary to deter human traffickers who often pack migrants into
boats for the long journeys.

Mr. Turnbull said Monday that Australia had border security arrangements
that were the envy of the world. “We’ve got very strong systems,” he
said. “We’re proud of those, and we’ll maintain them, and where we can,
we will enhance them.”
