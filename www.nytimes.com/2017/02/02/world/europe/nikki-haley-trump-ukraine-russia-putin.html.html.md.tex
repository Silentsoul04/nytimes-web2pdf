UNITED NATIONS --- Nikki R. Haley, the new American ambassador to the
United Nations, condemned Russia on Thursday for its recent ``aggressive
actions'' in eastern Ukraine.

``We do want to better our relations with Russia,'' Ms. Haley said
during her \href{https://usun.state.gov/remarks/7668}{first remarks} to
an open briefing of the United Nations Security Council. ``However, the
dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong
condemnation of Russian actions.''

She made it clear that American sanctions imposed after Russia's
annexation of Crimea would remain in place.

During her Senate
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/politics/nikki-haley-un-ambassador-russia-war-crime.html}{confirmation
hearing last month}, Ms. Haley also expressed support for continuing the
sanctions and accused Russia of committing war crimes in the Syrian
conflict. But her strong criticism of the government of President
Vladimir V. Putin put her at odds with President Trump, who has
expressed a desire for warmer relations with the Kremlin.

Her Russian counterpart, Vitaly I. Churkin, told reporters after the
meeting that it would be ``frivolous'' to speculate on whether the Trump
administration would be friendlier than that of President Barack Obama.

``I don't want to make any predictions,'' Mr. Churkin said. ``My
intention is to try to do my best to establish a good working
relationship with the head of the new U.S. delegation.''

``They're just in their first few days,'' he added.

Mr. Churkin said he expected to meet with Ms. Haley on Friday.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine escalated in recent days, after

Trump spoke by phone} on Saturday with Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump has
said he admires.

Ukraine accused pro-Russian separatists of aggression. Mr. Putin, by
contrast, blamed a financially struggling Ukraine, and its need for
money from the international community, for the escalation. ``The best
way to get that,'' Mr. Putin said Thursday
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/europe/vladimir-putin-hungary.html?ref=world}{on
a visit to Budapest}, ``is to portray yourselves as victims of
aggression.''

The Ukrainian ambassador, Volodymyr Y. Yelchenko, who presides over
Security Council deliberations this month, accused Russia of carrying
out war crimes.
