WASHINGTON --- Tensions over President Trump's nominations turned into a
parliamentary game of chicken on Monday, with Republican leaders vowing
to keep the Senate in session, day and night, until lawmakers confirm
four of his cabinet picks.

After days of grasping at procedural hurdles, Democrats held vigil
against Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump's polarizing nominee for education
secretary, and promised to spend the final 24 hours before her
confirmation vote Tuesday reiterating their objections.

But as Democrats made clear they had no intention of yielding even a
minute of their allotted floor time to debate Mr. Trump's nominations
--- a final act of parliamentary disobedience for a minority party that
lacks the votes to block a nominee on its own --- Republicans stood
their ground.

Daring Democrats to keep their word at the expense of several sleepless
nights, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber's No. 2 Republican,
said the Senate session would not end until lawmakers confirmed four of
Mr. Trump's nominees: Ms. DeVos, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as
attorney general, Representative Tom Price of Georgia to lead the
Department of Health and Human Services, and Steven T. Mnuchin as
Treasury secretary.

The effort could last into Saturday and might involve burning ``a little
midnight oil,'' Mr. Cornyn said.

Short one critical but elusive Republican ``no'' vote against Ms. DeVos
--- a billionaire philanthropist with little experience in public
schools and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-secretary-confirmation-donald-trump.html}{a
remarkably shaky showing} at her confirmation hearing --- Democrats on
Monday did the only thing they could: They talked.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington announced that Democrats would occupy
the floor until the vote on Ms. DeVos's nomination, which is expected
around midday on Tuesday. Ms. Murray is the top Democrat on the
committee that approved Ms. DeVos along a party-line vote, and one of
her most strident opponents.

Publicly, Democrats held out hope that they could woo one more
Republican dissenter to join Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa
Murkowski of Alaska in voting against Ms. DeVos. Both
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/trump-cabinet-nominations-senate.html}{announced
last week} that they would not support Ms. DeVos's nomination.

Their defections, combined with a unified vote from the Democratic
caucus, set up a 50-50 tie on the nomination, which Vice President Mike
Pence would have to break in his capacity as president of the Senate.

Appearing later at a demonstration outside the Capitol, Ms. Murray urged
protesters to pressure Republicans to oppose Ms. DeVos. ``If we can
persuade one more Republican to do the right thing, we can double down
on the message we're all sending to President Trump: The Senate stands
with public education!'' Ms. Murray said.

A deluge of constituent calls and messages against Mr. Trump's nominees
and executive orders has overwhelmed some Senate offices and even the
Capitol phone system in recent days, echoing demonstrations across the
country. Energized by the opposition, Democrats seemed ready on Monday
to resort to sleeping bags if necessary.

Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said Ms. DeVos had
embraced a philosophy that abandoned poorer families. She has been
vehemently criticized by many education advocates for favoring voucher
programs over repairing public schools.

``What do we say to them?'' Mr. Van Hollen asked.
