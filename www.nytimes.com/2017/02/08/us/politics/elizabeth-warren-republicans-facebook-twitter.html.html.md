Some called it a [gift to women’s
rights](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-coretta-scott-king.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news),
and the episode angered many who diagnosed it as a plot to muzzle a
vocal senator, Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts.

Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and Republican of Kentucky,
may have had the procedural right to cut short Ms. Warren’s speech on
the Senate floor [against Jeff Sessions’s nomination for attorney
general](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/republican-senators-vote-to-formally-silence-elizabeth-warren.html)
on Tuesday.

But critics had Twitter, and they roared back, using Mr. McConnell’s
words in a rallying cry against what they saw as an attempt by a
powerful man to silence a woman who was speaking her mind:

“She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she
persisted.”

As Mr. McConnell explained it, Ms. Warren had run afoul of [Rule
XIX](http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX), which
forbids demeaning another senator, as she began reading [a 1986 letter
from Coretta Scott
King](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-coretta-scott-king-jeff-sessions.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)
on the day before the vote on Mr. Sessions’s nomination.

The King letter criticized Mr. Sessions, a Republican, when he was up
for a federal judgeship, for using “the awesome power of his office to
chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens” while serving as
a United States attorney in Alabama.

Regardless of the particulars of Senate practices, Ms. Warren and her
supporters strongly rejected the idea that she had been out of line.

The imagery of a man silencing a woman struck some as all too common,
and his language rang familiar with many women who had their own stories
of being silenced.

“Nevertheless, she persisted” served as a
[hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ShePersisted&src=typd)-[ready](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23letlizspeak&src=tyah)
motto for women at the ready to break barriers.

A broader theme — that women are too commonly shushed or ignored —
emerged on social media. And \#LetLizSpeak began trending. Women and men
drew examples from the historical likes of [Rosa
Parks](https://twitter.com/MikeMcFeelyWDAY/status/829328899947495425)
and the suffrage movement.

The meme was applied to issues like [reproductive
rights](https://twitter.com/dawnlaguens/status/829362941430530048) and
[domestic
abuse](https://twitter.com/marwilliamson/status/829290274140672000).

On Wednesday, [Republicans
defended](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-coretta-scott-king.html)
Mr. McConnell’s actions and accused Ms. Warren of ignoring repeated
warnings to avoid violating the Senate rule. She had also read a letter
from Ted Kennedy disparaging Mr. Sessions.

“You don’t insult — whether it be from a letter, or from a message from
God, or on golden tablets,” said Senator John McCain, Republican of
Arizona. “That’s the rules of the Senate.”

(On Wednesday, Mr. Sessions [was confirmed as the United States attorney
general](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-confirmation.html)
on a near-party-line vote, 52 to 47.)

In the end, Ms. Warren had her say. She [read the statement from Mrs.
King](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/republican-senators-vote-to-formally-silence-elizabeth-warren.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)
