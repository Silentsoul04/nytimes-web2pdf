WASHINGTON — President Trump pledged close security and economic
cooperation with Japan on Friday, opening an elaborate multiday
work-and-play visit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that is intended to
showcase a warm rapport with a central player in Asia.

Hoping to put behind any friction remaining from his sometimes
provocative statements during last year’s presidential campaign, Mr.
Trump hugged Mr. Abe as he arrived at the White House, lavished praise
on him and his nation, and offered strong reassurances about America’s
commitment to Japan’s defense.

“The bond between our two nations and the friendship between our two
peoples runs very, very deep,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference with
Mr. Abe, reading from a prepared text. “This administration is committed
to bringing those ties even closer. We are committed to the security of
Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to further
strengthening our very crucial alliance.”

Speaking without notes later in the news conference, Mr. Trump said he
had hit it off with Mr. Abe personally. “We have a very, very good bond
— very, very good chemistry,” he said. “I’ll let you know if it
changes, but I don’t think it will.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The visit, Mr. Trump’s second with a head of government since being
sworn in last month, was an opportunity for the president to highlight a
positive dynamic with a leader with whom he had already developed a
relationship. But it could prove awkward, after [a show of
détente](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html)
on Thursday night between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.

[Among the topics of
discussion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/trump-abe-meeting-japan-trade-defense.html)
during Mr. Abe’s weekend visit will be whether, and how, to pursue a
bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Japan after Mr.
Trump’s decision to [withdraw from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html),
a sweeping trade deal between the United States and 11 nations that
included Japan.

Mr. Trump also tried to dispel [doubts about his
commitment](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/08/06/national/politics-diplomacy/trump-rips-u-s-defense-japan-one-sided-expensive/)
to a mutual defense treaty with Japan that surfaced during his campaign,
when he said he was prepared to pull back from the pact unless Tokyo did
more to reimburse the United States for defending Japanese territory.

Mr. Trump reaffirmed his support for the treaty on Friday, [as his
defense secretary, Jim Mattis,
did](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/world/asia/us-japan-mattis-abe-defense.html)
during a visit to Tokyo last week. And with his reference to “areas
under its administrative control,” Mr. Trump made clear that the treaty
extended to disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as
the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Abe responded with equal warmth, congratulating Mr. Trump on his
inauguration and welcoming his commitment to the defense treaty while
sidestepping questions about Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership. “With the birth of the Trump administration,
a new genesis will be built between Japan and the U.S. in economic
relations,” he said.

Acutely aware of Mr. Trump’s complaints about foreign competitors, Mr.
Abe stressed that “Japanese businesses have built factories all over the
United States” and invested $150 billion, creating many American jobs.
“Japan, with our high level of technical capability, we will be able
to contribute to President Trump’s growth strategy,” he said. “There
will be even more new jobs being born in the United States.”

He specifically cited Japan’s bullet-train technology, noting that if it
existed along America’s Eastern corridor, it would take “only one hour”
for the president to travel from the White House in Washington to Trump
Tower in New York.

While he stuck to positive themes during their public comments, Mr. Abe
may have questions in private for Mr. Trump about his provocative
statements related to Japan, including his warning to Toyota on Twitter
that he would slap a “big border tax” on the carmaker if it built a new
plant in Mexico and his charges that Japan devalues its currency to gain
economic advantage.

Mr. Abe was the [first foreign leader to visit Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/world/asia/shinzo-abe-donald-trump.html)
after his election in November, and they have spoken a number of times
since then, according to the officials.

By contrast, the president has gotten off to a chilly start with Mr. Xi,
who was angered by Mr. Trump’s decision in November to [take a
congratulatory call from the president of
Taiwan](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/world/asia/china-donald-trump-taiwan-twitter.html)
— which China considers a breakaway province — and his subsequent
questioning of the “One China” policy. Mr. Trump had a fence-mending
call with Mr. Xi on Thursday night and agreed to honor the One China
policy at the Chinese leader’s request.

“We had a very, very good talk last night and discussed a lot of
subjects,” Mr. Trump said. He predicted that he would get along with
China and forge a fairer playing field on trade and currency. “I believe
that will all work out very well for everybody, China, Japan, the United
States and everybody in the region,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even so, Mr. Abe’s visit could fuel suspicions in Beijing that Mr. Trump
intends to make Japan, rather than China, the focal point of his
engagement with Asia. That would be a distinct shift from former
President Barack Obama, who hosted Mr. Xi in 2013 for an informal summit
meeting at the [200-acre Sunnylands
estate](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/us/politics/an-expansive-setting-for-obamas-talks-with-chinas-leader.html)
in Rancho Mirage, Calif.

Mr. Trump’s extended meeting with Mr. Abe, combining business and
pleasure, follows a first few weeks in office for Mr. Trump that have
been marked by tense exchanges with longstanding United States allies
like
[Mexico](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/world/americas/mexico-pena-nieto-donald-trump.html),
[Australia](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/australia/donald-trump-malcolm-turnbull-refugees.html)
and
[Germany](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/world/europe/germany-prepares-for-turbulence-in-the-trump-era.html).

After a working lunch at the White House on Friday, the two leaders
planned to board Air Force One and fly to Palm Beach, Fla., where they
were to head to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s club, for dinner with their
wives and a weekend of relaxation. They will spend Saturday playing golf
together.

A White House official said Mr. Trump was paying for Mr. Abe and his
wife to travel to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, as a “gift” to the leader.
That eliminates potential ethics questions the visit would otherwise
pose for Mr. Trump, who has
[pledged](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-organization-business-conflicts.html)
to contribute to the United States Treasury any profits from foreign
visitors to his company’s properties.
