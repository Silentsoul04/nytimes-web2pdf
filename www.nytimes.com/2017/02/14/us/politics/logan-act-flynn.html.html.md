The [resignation under
pressure](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html)
on Monday night of President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael
T. Flynn, centers on the F.B.I.’s scrutiny of his phone calls in late
2016 with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak. The two apparently
discussed sanctions the Obama administration was developing to punish
Russia over allegations of interference in the 2016 presidential
election; officials have asserted that Russia hacked Democratic emails
and provided them to WikiLeaks for publication to help Mr. Trump.

As a political matter, Mr. Flynn’s fall may have more to do with having
misled the vice president-elect at the time, Mike Pence, who [falsely
told the
public](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcript-january-15-2017-pence-manchin-gingrich/)
that there had been no discussion of sanctions, or with [chaos and
dysfunction](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/12/us/politics/national-security-council-turmoil.html)
on the National Security Council on his watch, than with any realistic
legal exposure. But the affair has elevated interest in a law called the
Logan Act.

## What is the Logan Act?

The Logan Act is [a 1799
statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/953) that bars
private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the
United States and foreign governments. It makes it a felony, punishable
by a fine or imprisonment of up to three years, if an American citizen,
without government authorization, interacts “with any foreign government
or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures
or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof,
in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or
to defeat the measures of the United States.”

## Does the act apply to a president-elect and his transition team?

As a preliminary matter, it remains unclear whether then-President-elect
Trump — as opposed to Mr. Pence — knew about Mr. Flynn’s conversations
with the Russian ambassador. (After the announcement by the Russian
president, Vladimir V. Putin, that he would not expel American officials
in response to new sanctions because there would soon be a different
president, Mr. Trump responded with a Twitter
[post](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/814919370711461890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
that said, “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was
very smart\!”)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But even if Mr. Trump sanctioned the conversation, on its face the Logan
Act appears to apply to a president-elect and his top aides, said
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School constitutional law professor.

“A president-elect is not an official of the United States,” Mr. Tribe
said. “There is no reason why the Logan Act would not apply to the
president-elect since it applies to all private citizens, and the people
working on the transition are all working in a private-citizen capacity.
They have not taken the oath, so they are covered by the act — to the
extent that
matters.”

## What is the history of prosecuting people under the Logan Act?

The Logan Act appears to be a so-called dead letter, meaning a law that
remains technically on the books but is essentially defunct or
toothless.

A [study by the Congressional Research Service
in 2015](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33265.pdf) said nobody has ever
been prosecuted under the statute and identified only one instance of an
indictment under the law: in 1803, the United States attorney in
Kentucky obtained from a grand jury an indictment of a Kentucky farmer
who had written an article in support of creating a separate nation in
the territory west of the fledgling United States that would be an ally
to France. But the prosecutor dropped the case. A recent [draft
scholarly
paper](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=224027017022099121070082026090107120034088085082033007113020114000022115104107023106005038115104046010035023078005096096027102121014024022061107126079029078089015087036049055088087120014001126002121007071106124122018031070093097075101077115022073103030&EXT=pdf)
posted online by a Federal Appeals Court law clerk identified a second
apparent such indictment, involving the [reported arrest
in 1852](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9406E4DB1331E234BC4D53DFB4668389649FDE)
of a man who wrote a letter to the president of Mexico.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Legal scholars have also raised questions about whether the act violates
First Amendment free speech protections, although Mr. Tribe said he
believed it would be constitutional if applied narrowly to core
diplomatic negotiations with another government.

## How has the Logan Act been used?

The Logan Act has functioned primarily as rhetorical ammunition for the
party that holds the White House during partisan disputes over a foreign
policy matter. When White House opponents, usually in Congress, encroach
on diplomatic matters, invoking the Logan Act enables the pro-White
House party to denounce the other side as not just wrongheaded but
lawbreakers.

During the Reagan administration, for example, the Democratic speaker of
the House, Jim Wright of Texas, [tried to help develop a peace deal in
Nicaragua](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/weekinreview/peace-salvo-sandinistas-launch-an-offensive-on-capitol-hill.html)
by interacting directly with its president, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, even
as the Reagan administration took a harder line and supported
overthrowing the Sandinista government. Similarly, during the Obama
administration, 47 Republican senators signed a letter to the government
of Iran [warning the
ayatollahs](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/world/asia/white-house-faults-gop-senators-letter-to-irans-leaders.html)
that President Obama’s successor might not follow through on promises
Mr. Obama was making as part of negotiations over a deal to end Iran’s
nuclear program. During such debates, some White House defenders
portrayed the congressional opposition as having violated the Logan Act.

## Does that mean Mr. Flynn is not in any realistic legal trouble?

Given its history, it seems highly unlikely that the Justice Department
under Mr. Trump will try to prosecute Mr. Flynn for violating the Logan
Act. However, that would not rule out other legal problems.

For example, if it turns out that Mr. Flynn made a false statement not
just to Mr. Pence but also to F.B.I. agents about his conversations with
the Russian ambassador, that could be a [separate
offense](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001) for which
there is a history of prosecuting high-level officials. Most recently,
late in the Obama administration, former Gen. James Cartwright [pleaded
guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/us/marine-general-james-cartwright-leak-fbi.html)
to making false statements to F.B.I. agents investigating a leak about
cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Obama
[pardoned](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/obama-pardons-james-cartwright-general-who-lied-to-fbi-in-leak-case.html)
him before leaving office.
