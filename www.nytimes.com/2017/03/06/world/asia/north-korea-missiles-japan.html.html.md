TOKYO — The apparent success of [four simultaneous missile
launchings](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/world/north-korea-ballistic-missiles.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0)
by North Korea on Monday raised new alarms about the threat to its
neighbors and its progress toward developing an ability to overcome
their ballistic missile defense systems, including those that have yet
to be deployed.

According to the South Korean military, [North
Korea](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/northkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo)
launched four ballistic missiles from its long-range rocket launch site
on Monday morning.

In Japan, analysts said the launches suggested that North Korea could
pose a more serious threat than indicated by previous tests.

Indeed, North Korea said on Tuesday that the tests were conducted by
units “tasked to strike the bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor
forces in Japan in contingency.”

“That would mean a lot in terms of the defense of Tokyo, because North
Korea might have been conducting a simulation of a ‘saturation attack’
in which they launch a number of missiles simultaneously in order to
saturate the missile defense that Japan has,” said Narushige Michishita,
director of the Security and International Studies Program at the
National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “It would be
difficult for Japan to shoot down four missiles all at the same time
because of our limited missile defense.”

The North’s Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday that the launches
were timed to counter a joint United States-South Korean military
exercise. The missile tests came [three weeks after North Korea tested a
missile](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump.html)
during a visit to the United States by Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo
Abe, to meet with President Trump.

Japan’s Coast Guard sent out navigation warnings and stepped up air and
sea patrols on Monday after three of the missiles landed within the
country’s so-called exclusive economic zone, where fishing and cargo
ships are active. The fourth landed outside it, though nearby.

This was not the first time that North Korean test missiles have fallen
within that zone. In both August and September of last year, missiles
came within 125 and 155 miles of the Japanese coastline. Monday’s
missiles landed about 185 to 220 miles west of Akita Prefecture, on the
northern coast of the main island, Honshu. The September launches
involved three missiles fired simultaneously, but this time North Korea
set off four missiles at once, all of which seemed to land successfully.

During a parliamentary committee session Monday morning, Mr. Abe said
that the launches “clearly represent a new threat from North Korea.”

Japan and the United States requested an emergency meeting of the United
Nations Security Council to discuss the launches, most likely for
Wednesday.

The missiles took off from Tongchang-ri, in northwestern North Korea,
and flew an average of 620 miles before falling into the sea between
North Korea and Japan, said Noh Jae-chon, a South Korean military
spokesman. The type of missile fired was not immediately clear, but Mr.
Noh said it was unlikely that they were intercontinental ballistic
missiles, which the North had recently threatened to test launch.

In South Korea, the launch prompted South Korean security officials to
call for the early deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense
System, or Thaad, an advanced American antimissile system. China has
protested Thaad as a threat to its own nuclear deterrence because its
powerful radar would be able to track Chinese missile launches.

Mr. Michishita, of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,
said the missile launches could accelerate a discussion within the
Japanese government about whether Japan should acquire more missile
defense systems, including Thaad. In January, Japan’s defense minister,
Tomomi Inada, visited a United States Air Force base on Guam for a
briefing on Thaad.

After North Korea’s missile test last month, Japan’s governing Liberal
Democratic Party formed a committee to discuss the country’s ballistic
missile defenses, and it plans to debate various options, including
Thaad, early warning satellites and other defense systems that could
intercept incoming missiles.

North Korea’s provocations could also embolden Mr. Abe in his campaign
to raise military spending. “This can be used by the government as a
pretty credible reason why we have to spend more on defense at the
expense of other budget items,” including social welfare programs, Mr.
Michishita said.

The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported in its evening edition that
residents in Akita Prefecture, which sits closest to where the missiles
landed in the Sea of Japan on Monday, were concerned by the increasing
frequency of the tests.

Kazuhiro Asai, director of the Kitaura branch of the Fishermen’s
Cooperative of Akita Prefecture, told The Mainichi Shimbun that members
of the group were frightened by the launches.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea’s leader, Kim
Jong-un, inspected the weekend missile tests. Mr. Kim was quoted as
saying, “the four ballistic rockets launched simultaneously are so
accurate that they look like acrobatic flying corps in formation.”
