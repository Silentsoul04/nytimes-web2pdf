HONG KONG —
[China](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/china?inline=nyt-geo)
warned on Friday that tensions on the Korean Peninsula could spin out of
control, as [North
Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/north-korea?8qa) said
it could test a nuclear weapon at any time and a United States naval
group neared the peninsula — an American effort to sow doubt in
Pyongyang over how President Trump might respond.

“The United States and South Korea and North Korea are engaging in tit
for tat, with swords drawn and bows bent, and there have been storm
clouds gathering,” China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in Beijing,
[according to
Xinhua](http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2017-04/14/c_1120812558.htm),
the state news agency.

“If they let war break out on the peninsula, they must shoulder that
historical culpability and pay the corresponding price for this,” Mr.
Wang said.

The comments were unusually blunt from China, which has been trying to
steer between the Trump administration’s demands for it to do more to
stop North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and its longstanding
reluctance to risk a rupture with the North. The remarks also reflected,
American experts said, an effort by the Chinese to throw responsibility
for what happens back on Washington, after Mr. Trump declared, in
several Twitter messages, that it was up to the Chinese to contain their
neighbor and sometime partner.

In a telephone conversation with Mr. Trump on Wednesday, China’s
president, Xi Jinping, also [called for
restraint](http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1453741.shtml).
But behind the scenes, officials said, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi had reached
some preliminary understandings, during their meeting at the president’s
Mar-a-Lago resort a week ago, about what the Chinese might do to change
the behavior of the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

According to officials who have seen notes of the conversations, the
Chinese have agreed to crack down on their second-tier banks that have
helped finance the North’s trade. But it is unclear what that crackdown
would look like: While much has been made by Mr. Trump about North
Korean “boats” of coal that have been turned away by China, the most
recent statistics show a significant increase in overall trade between
the two countries.

American officials contend that the two countries have also agreed to
share some intelligence — a highly unusual step — about suspected North
Korean shipments of arms and other illicit goods. That would improve the
chances that those shipments can be intercepted, perhaps when they make
port calls. The Bush administration began such a program, called the
Proliferation Security Initiative, more than a decade ago, but attention
to it has waxed and waned.

The North Korean military issued a statement on Friday threatening to
attack major American military bases in [South
Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/south-korea?8qa), as
well as the presidential Blue House, warning that it could annihilate
those targets “within minutes.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Administration officials flatly denied a report on NBC News that the
United States was planning for a pre-emptive strike ahead of any nuclear
test. It was unclear what American forces would strike, and the nuclear
test site where the North has conducted its five previous tests would
make a hard-to-hit target. Moreover, they noted, Vice President Mike
Pence is scheduled to visit Seoul this weekend, and it is almost
impossible to imagine a strike occurring while he was consulting with
the South’s acting president about how to respond to the crisis.

Even if a nuclear test occurs this weekend or in coming weeks, officials
say, the response is likely to be diplomatic, with a ramping up of
economic pressure and the deployment of more military assets. A carrier
group, led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, is headed to the waters
off the peninsula. It includes Aegis cruisers with antimissile
ability.

## North Korea May Be Preparing Its 6th Nuclear Test

Growing evidence suggests that North Korea may soon conduct another
underground detonation in its effort to make nuclear arms.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That is notable because administration officials say they are more
concerned about a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that
could reach the United States — a feat the North has never come close to
accomplishing — than another nuclear test. According to one official,
it’s the combination of a missile and a warhead that is most
worrisome.

The official, and others cited in this article, asked for anonymity to
discuss a matter of national security.

The North, for its part, issued a statement that denounced what it
called the Trump administration’s “maniacal military provocations,”
including the deployment of the carrier group.

“Nothing will be more foolish if the United States thinks it can deal
with us the way it treated Iraq and Libya, miserable victims of its
aggression, and Syria, which did not respond immediately even after it
was attacked,” a spokesman for the general staff of the North’s People’s
Army said in a statement carried by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central
News Agency.

North Korea’s vice foreign minister, Han Song-ryol, said on Friday that
the United States was “becoming more vicious and aggressive” under Mr.
Trump and that “we will go to war if they
choose.”

Mr. Han told [The Associated
Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/7db133ff3bf94648be84d48a1babf4e3/n-korean-official-us-more-vicious-aggressive-under-trump)
that whether North Korea holds another nuclear test would be “something
that our headquarters decides.” But he added an ominous coda: “At a time
and at a place where the headquarters deems necessary, it will take
place.”

The speculation about an imminent underground detonation arises from
satellite photographs that show the test site is fully prepared, and
that holes into the site have been plugged, usually a last step to
contain radiation. But at times the North, knowing it is under space
surveillance, has readied the site but waited to conduct the test.

On Saturday, with Kim Jong-un watching from a raised platform, North
Korea began a military parade in central Pyongyang to celebrate the
105th anniversary of the birth of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the
North’s founding president. The North sometimes uses such occasions to
show off its military advances.

Japan is clearly examining worst-case scenarios.

The Japanese news media reported that the government’s National Security
Council had been discussing the possible evacuation of an estimated
57,000 Japanese citizens in South Korea, should war break out. “We will
take all necessary steps to protect our people’s lives and assets,” said
Yoshihide Suga, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary. The Kyodo News agency
said the council was concerned about the possibility of North Korean
refugees arriving in boats on its shores.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea
could have the ability to deliver missiles equipped with sarin, the
nerve agent whose recent use against civilians in Syria prompted Mr.
Trump to [order a missile
strike](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/syria-strike-trump-timeline.html)
there.

Russia, another neighbor of North Korea, echoed China on Friday in
urging all parties to exercise caution. A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S.
Peskov, called on “all the countries to refrain from any actions that
could amount to provocative steps,” [Reuters
reported](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-russia-idUSKBN17G0RB).

In a phone call on Friday between the Russian foreign minister, Sergey
V. Lavrov, and his Chinese counterpart, Mr. Wang, both said they would
try to revive talks over North Korea, according to the [Chinese Foreign
Ministry](http://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/zyxw/t1453861.shtml).

In South Korea, whose people have lived through saber-rattling involving
the North for decades, there were few signs of panic. Nonetheless, the
South Korean Foreign Ministry warned on Friday that if the North
conducted another nuclear test or launched an intercontinental ballistic
missile, it would suffer an “unbearably strong punishment.” All the
major candidates in the presidential election set for next month have
called on the United States not to do anything that might initiate war
on the peninsula without first seeking the consent of South Korea, its
military ally.

In his remarks in Beijing, Mr. Wang said there was still hope for
renewed negotiations with North Korea on its weapons program. “There can
also be flexibility about the form of renewed talks,” he said.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, visiting Seoul in March, said the
United States would [not
negotiate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/world/asia/rex-tillerson-north-korea-nuclear.html)
with the North unless it first gave up both its nuclear and missile
programs. That was essentially a rejection of talks, since the purpose
of the negotiation would be to end those programs. But the North has
said it will never surrender what it calls its “deterrent” against
American aggression, and President Barack Obama never engaged in
prolonged discussions out of concern the North was just playing for
time.

The Chinese made much of their announcement two months ago that they
were suspending coal imports from North Korea. But while those shipments
seem to have dried up, Chinese overall trade rose 37.4 percent in the
first quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Chinese news outlets [reported on
Friday](http://news.163.com/17/0414/19/CI0OMCIA0001875O.html) that Air
China, the country’s main international airline, would suspend flights
to Pyongyang starting on Monday, leaving only Air Koryo of North Korea
operating regular flights between Pyongyang and Beijing or other Chinese
cities. The move appeared to have been in the works for some time; NK
News, a website about North Korea, [reported last
month](https://www.nknews.org/2017/03/air-china-to-cancel-2017-north-korea-service-following-marathon/)
that the suspension was likely, saying that Air China’s services were
underused and that its flights were often canceled.

Later, Air China issued a statement saying that it had not entirely
abandoned the route from Beijing to Pyongyang, and would arrange flights
if there was enough demand.
