WASHINGTON --- President Trump raised twice as much money for his
inauguration festivities as any previous president-elect in history,
pulling in tens of millions of dollars from wealthy donors and large
corporations eager to woo the nation's new chief executive in the days
after his unexpected victory.

Disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday showed
the contributions from corporate executives, lobbyists and businesses,
as well as small donors, totaled \$107 million. The previous record was
held by President Barack Obama, who
\href{https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/obamas-inaugural-fund-raising-topped-53-million/}{raised
\$53 million} for his 2009 inauguration.

Mr. Trump's inaugural committee is not required to report how it spent
the money on his inauguration festivities, which included more than 20
events and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-crowd.html}{drew
modest crowds} in January. In a statement on Tuesday, the committee said
it was still identifying charities toward which it would direct leftover
money, although it did not detail how much was left.

The disclosures were delivered to the commission by hand on Tuesday and
had not yet been made public online.

The report is likely to only intensify questions about Mr. Trump's

to the populist ideas} raised in recent weeks by several policy shifts
and

among White House staff}.

Inaugural committees face few of the regulations that limit campaigns in
what they can raise and how they can go about raising it. In practice,
that has left it up to each administration to determine its own
restrictions.

President George W. Bush, for example, capped gifts at \$100,000 in 2001
and at \$250,000 in 2005. Mr. Obama accepted gifts only up to \$50,000
in 2009, while banning gifts from lobbyists and corporations altogether.
He loosened those restrictions in 2013 after a bruising campaign,
accepting corporate gifts up to \$1 million and individual gifts up to
\$250,000.

Mr. Trump appears to have set comparatively few limits for his
inauguration. His team said it would not accept donations from
registered federal lobbyists nor would it solicit corporate gifts over
\$1 million. But it did not put a cap on what it would take from
individuals.

Donor packages for the festivities
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/politics/inauguration-donald-trump-president.html}{ranged
from \$25,000 to \$1 million} or more for both individuals and
corporations. Depending on the level of contribution, donors gained
access to a slate of private events with Mr. Trump and his inner circle,
as well as special seating for his swearing-in and other public events.

For Mr. Trump, the fast pace of fund-raising appears to have continued
past Inauguration Day. His re-election campaign, which was incorporated
the same day he took the oath of office, reported last week that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/us/politics/trump-raises-millions-for-2020-re-election-bid.html?rref=collection\%2Fbyline\%2Frachel-shorey\&action=click\&contentCollection=undefined\&region=stream\&module=stream_unit\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=1\&pgtype=collection}{it
had raised \$7.1 million} during the first three months of this year.
