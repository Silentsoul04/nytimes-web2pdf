WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday fired the director of the
F.B.I., James B. Comey, abruptly terminating the top official leading a
criminal investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s advisers colluded with
the Russian government to steer the outcome of the 2016 presidential
election.

The stunning development in Mr. Trump’s presidency raised the specter of
political interference by a sitting president into an existing
investigation by the nation’s leading law enforcement agency. It
immediately ignited Democratic calls for a special counsel to lead the
Russia inquiry.

Mr. Trump explained the firing by citing Mr. Comey’s handling of the
investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, even
though the president was widely seen to have benefited politically from
that inquiry and had once praised Mr. Comey for his “guts” in his
pursuit of Mrs. Clinton during the campaign.

But in his letter to Mr. Comey, released to reporters by the White
House, the president betrayed his focus on the continuing inquiry into
Russia and his aides.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate
occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with
the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to
effectively lead the bureau,” Mr. Trump said in a letter to Mr. Comey
dated Tuesday. White House officials refused to say anything more about
the three occasions Mr. Trump
cited.

## White House Announces Firing of James Comey

Read the letter President Trump sent the F.B.I. director about his
firing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The officials said that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the deputy
attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, pushed for Mr. Comey’s dismissal.
But many in Washington, including veteran F.B.I. officers, saw a
carefully choreographed effort by the president to create a pretense for
a takedown of the president’s F.B.I. tormentor.

“I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the
investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails,” Mr. Rosenstein wrote in
another letter that was released by the White House, “and I do not
understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he
was mistaken.”

Reaction in Washington was swift and fierce. Senator Chuck Schumer of
New York, the Democratic leader, said the firing could make Americans
suspect a cover-up. Mr. Trump lashed back later Tuesday night in a
Twitter
[post](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/862135824745467905):
“Cryin’ Chuck Schumer stated recently, ‘I do not have confidence in
him (James Comey) any longer.’ Then acts so indignant.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many Republicans assailed the president for making a rash decision that
could have deep implications for their party. Representative Justin
Amash, Republican of Michigan, [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/862089192603607041) that
he now supports an independent commission to investigate the Russia
links to Mr. Trump. He called Mr. Trump’s claim that Mr. Comey had
cleared him three times “bizarre.”

“I’ve spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable
rationale for the timing of Comey’s firing,” Senator Jeff Flake,
Republican of Arizona, [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/862124755339685888). “I
just can’t do it.”

In a sign of the F.B.I.’s intense interest in Mr. Trump’s advisers, a
grand jury in Virginia issued subpoenas in recent weeks for records
related to the former White House national security adviser, Michael T.
Flynn, according to an American official familiar with the case. Mr.
Flynn is under investigation for his financial ties to Russia and
Turkey. Grand jury subpoenas are a routine part of federal
investigations and are not a sign that charges are imminent. It was not
clear that the subpoenas, which were first reported by CNN, were related
to Mr. Comey’s
firing.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The dismissal ended the long-deteriorating relationship of Mr. Trump and
Mr. Comey, who repeatedly collided publicly and privately. For Mr.
Trump, a president who puts a premium on loyalty, Mr. Comey represented
an independent and unpredictable director with enormous power to disrupt
his administration.

Mr. Comey learned from news reports that he had been fired while
addressing bureau employees in Los Angeles. While Mr. Comey spoke,
television screens in the background began flashing the news. In
response to the reports, Mr. Comey laughed, saying that he thought it
was a fairly funny prank. Shortly after, Mr. Trump’s letter was
delivered to F.B.I. Headquarters in Washington.

Mr. Comey was four years into a 10-year term, an unusually long tenure
that Congress established to insulate the director from political
pressure. Though the president has the authority to fire the F.B.I.
director for any reason, Mr. Comey is only the second director to be
fired in bureau history. President Bill Clinton fired William S.
Sessions in 1993.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump had already [fired his acting attorney
general](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html)
for insubordination and his [national security
adviser](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html)
for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with Russians. But
firing Mr. Comey raises much deeper questions about the independence of
the F.B.I. and the future of its investigations under Mr. Trump.

In an instance of bizarre timing and optics, the White House announced
late Tuesday night that Mr. Trump would meet on Wednesday in the Oval
Office with Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister.

F.B.I. agents were enraged by the firing and worried openly that Mr.
Trump would appoint a White House ally to lead them. Mr. Comey was
widely liked in the F.B.I., even by those who criticized his handling of
the Clinton investigation. Agents regarded him as a good manager and an
independent director.

“It is essential that we find new leadership for the F.B.I. that
restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement
mission,” Mr. Trump wrote, a remark that particularly upset agents who
saw it as an insult to them.

The White House has not said what precipitated the firing, a significant
question because the Justice Department’s stated reasons were well known
even when Mr. Trump decided in January to keep Mr. Comey on the job. Mr.
Trump watched last week as Mr. Comey testified on Capitol Hill, offering
his first public explanation of his handling of the Clinton email case.
There, Mr. Comey said that he had no regrets about his decisions but
that [he felt “mildly
nauseous”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/james-comey-fbi-senate-hearing.html)that
his actions might have tipped the election to Mr. Trump.

The Clinton controversy centers on a news conference Mr. Comey held last
July, when he broke with longstanding tradition and policies by
[publicly discussing the Clinton
case](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-email-comey.html)
and chastising Mrs. Clinton’s “careless” handling of classified
information. Then, in the campaign’s final days, Mr. Comey announced
that the F.B.I. was [reopening the
investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?_r=0),
a move that earned him widespread criticism. At the time, though, Mr.
Trump and his attorney general, Mr. Sessions, praised Mr. Comey for
actions that are now at the heart of the F.B.I. director’s firing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump “saw an opening” to fire Mr. Comey after the testimony, a
White House official said. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of
staff, argued against it, delaying — but not overruling — the decision.
Mr. Trump received the documents from the Justice Department on Tuesday.
Aides also compiled a stack of news clips criticizing Mr. Comey.

Mr. Comey’s firing came hours after the F.B.I.
[corrected](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/comey-clinton-emails-testimony.html)
his testimony last week about how classified information ended up on the
laptop of the disgraced former congressman Anthony D. Weiner.

Mr. Comey had told the Senate Judiciary Committee that during the
F.B.I.’s investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email
server while secretary of state, officers uncovered evidence that her
aide, Huma Abedin, had “forwarded hundreds and thousands of emails, some
of which contain classified information” to Mr. Weiner, her
husband.

</div>

</div>

<div style="max-width:100%;margin:0 auto">

<div class="css-17dprlf" data-id="100000005077808" data-slug="comey-promo" style="max-width:300px">

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the F.B.I. told Congress that only a few of the emails had been
forwarded and that the vast majority were simply backed up to Mr.
Weiner’s laptop.

Mr. Comey’s deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, a career F.B.I. officer, became
acting director, the Justice Department said. The White House said the
search for a director will begin immediately.

The firing puts Democrats in a difficult position. Many had hoped that
Mrs. Clinton would fire Mr. Comey soon after taking office, and blamed
him as costing her the election. But under Mr. Trump, Mr. Comey [was
seen as an important
check](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/us/politics/james-comey-fbi-sessions.html)
on the new administration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser, said the firing was not
related to Russia. “Today’s actions had zero to do with that,” she said
in a contentious interview on CNN. Democrats were unconvinced.

“Any attempt to stop or undermine this F.B.I. investigation would raise
grave constitutional issues,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat
of Illinois.

Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey marks the president’s latest law
enforcement purge. In late January, Mr. Trump [fired Sally Q.
Yates](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-memo.html),
who had worked in the Obama administration but was serving as acting
attorney general. In March, he
[fired](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/us/politics/preet-bharara-us-attorney.html)
Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, after assuring
the prosecutor months earlier that he could stay on. But the president’s
firing of Mr. Comey was far more consequential, as Ms. Yates and Mr.
Bharara both were holdovers, and might only have served in the Trump
administration for a matter of days or weeks.

A longtime prosecutor who served as the deputy attorney general during
the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Comey came into office in 2013
with widespread bipartisan support. The defining moment in Mr. Comey’s
career — until Tuesday night — came in 2004 during a hospital room
standoff with White House officials who wanted to pressure the Justice
Department to reauthorize a secret wiretapping program. Mr. Comey stood
his ground.

Mr. Trump has been furious with news stories about his campaign’s ties
to Russia. The White House has been critical of the leaks at the heart
of those stories and tried unsuccessfully to enlist Mr. Comey in an
effort to rebut the stories.

In a [Twitter
message](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/859601184285491201)
last week, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Comey of being “the best thing that
ever happened to Hillary Clinton,” and said he gave her “a free pass for
many bad deeds.” After the president accused former President Barack
Obama of wiretapping his office, Mr. Comey publicly declared those
claims untrue.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said in a [post on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/862064341855686656) that
Mr. Comey “should be immediately called to testify in an open hearing
about the status of Russia/Trump investigation at the time he was
fired.”

Before announcing the firing, Mr. Trump called leaders on Capitol Hill
to tell them of his decision. Mr. Schumer told Mr. Trump that he was
making a “big mistake.” Mr. Trump paused.

“O.K.,” he said. “We’ll see.”
