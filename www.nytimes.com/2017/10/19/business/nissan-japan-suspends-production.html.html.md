TOKYO — Nissan Motor said on Thursday that it was suspending production
at all of its Japanese factories after it discovered that uncertified
technicians had conducted vehicle inspections even after a previous
disclosure of the practice led to a major recall.

“We have done something inexcusable to everyone who trusted in our
efforts to prevent a recurrence,” Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan’s chief
executive, said at a news conference. “I apologize deeply.”

Nissan began recalling 1.2 million vehicles from the Japanese market
this month after regulators faulted it for allowing workers who lacked
required credentials to certify the cars. Under Japanese rules, vehicles
are required to pass a final certification before they leave the
factory, to ensure they conform to specifications registered with
regulators for each model.

Only workers who have had special training and testing are supposed to
certify vehicles, but Nissan said unqualified employees had been doing
the work for the past three years. The company said it would have the
recalled vehicles recertified by properly authorized technicians.

No accidents or faults had been linked to the problem, according to
Nissan.

Despite the admonition from transportation regulators that led to that
recall, Mr. Saikawa said on Thursday that the practice of using
unqualified inspectors had continued at four of Nissan’s six factories
in Japan. Production at all six factories would be suspended, he said,
until Nissan could ensure it had enough credentialed workers to carry
out the checks.

About 34,000 additional vehicles received certification from unqualified
inspectors after the problem was discovered, Mr. Saikawa said. They,
too, are expected to be recalled.

The episode is an embarrassment for Nissan and for Mr. Saikawa, who took
over as sole chief executive this year after the company’s longtime
leader, Carlos Ghosn, [stepped
aside](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/business/nissan-executive-carlos-ghosn.html).
Mr. Ghosn remains chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan
alliance, the French-Japanese group of which Nissan is a part.

Japanese regulators have yet to announce any penalties over the improper
vehicle checks, but Nissan could face fines.

The revelation of corner-cutting comes at an awkward time for Japan’s
auto industry. Its reputation for quality has been battered by deadly
safety problems at Takata, the airbag maker that was at the center of
the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of
vehicles. Takata, whose faulty airbags have been blamed for more than a
dozen deaths, [declared
bankruptcy](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/takata-japan-bankruptcy.html)
in June.

More recently, problems emerged at another important supplier to the
industry, Kobe Steel, which admitted this month to [doctoring quality
reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/business/kobe-steel-japan.html)
about aluminum and other materials.

Kobe Steel received some welcome news on Thursday, as a group of
Japanese [automakers
said](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/business/kobe-steel-scandal-safe.html)
they did not believe materials they had purchased from the company had
posed a danger to the vehicles in which they were used or to their
drivers. The carmakers said that while the metal may not have been as
strong as advertised, it still met their safety standards, as well as
those of regulators.

Regulators warned Nissan in mid-September about its practice of using
unqualified workers to certify cars. The practice continued at one of
its factories for a short time after that, the company said, but stopped
before the recall was announced at the beginning of October.

But three other factories continued to use unqualified workers even
after the recall, the company said.
