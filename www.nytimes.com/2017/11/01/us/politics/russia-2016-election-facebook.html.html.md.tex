They made for a wildly varied slide show, designed by Russia to exploit
divisions in American society and to tip the 2016 presidential election
in favor of Donald J. Trump and against Hillary Clinton. The House
Intelligence Committee
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/facebook-google-twitter-russian-interference-hearings.html}{provided
on Wednesday the biggest public platform} to date for a sample of the
Facebook ads and pages that were linked by a trail of ruble payments to
a Russian company with Kremlin ties.

``America, we have a problem,'' said Representative Jackie Speier, a
California Democrat who sits on the House committee. ``We basically have
the brightest minds of our tech community here and Russia was able to
weaponize your platforms to divide us, to dupe us and to discredit
democracy.''

Among the ads the committee made public at Wednesday's hearing were a
Bernie Sanders superhero promoting gay rights ...

... and a shot of Mr. Trump giving a thumbs up and promoting rallies in
Florida.

An image of Jesus arm-wrestling Satan (who, the ad said, was backing
Mrs. Clinton) ...

Image

... and an endorsement of the Black Panthers as fighters against the Ku
Klux Klan.

Image

There was a Confederate flag and a call for the South to rise again ...

Image

... and a yellow ``No Invaders Allowed'' sign posted at the United
States border.

\subsection{Attacking Candidates}\label{attacking-candidates}}

While many descriptions of Russia's stealth influence campaign have
stressed the focus on issues rather than candidates, many of the
Facebook posts did both, often attacking Mrs. Clinton (sometimes via Mr.
Sanders):

But at least one ad attacked Mr. Trump:

And although some of the Facebook pages fell on the liberal or
multicultural side of the political divide, with names like Woke Blacks
...

... most leaned strongly to the right, including Back the Badge...

... and Stop All Invaders.

\subsection{From Both Sides}\label{from-both-sides}}

In some cases, the Russian groups took opposite stands on painful
issues, such as police shootings of black people. A page called Don't
Shoot took aim at police brutality...

Image

... while Being Patriotic suggested that Black Lives Matter activists
were killing police officers.

\subsection{Only a Sampling}\label{only-a-sampling}}

While the ads being made public by Congress were just a sampling of the
large Russian influence operation, independent researchers in recent
weeks have identified and made public a far greater volume of such
pages. Facebook, Twitter and other platforms have shut down the suspect
accounts, but it is still possible to retrieve many of the posts and
images because they were widely shared across the internet.

Perhaps the biggest collection, put together by two American researchers
who asked not to be identified to avoid online harassment, is posted at
\href{https://medium.com/@ushadrons}{a page on Medium}. The researchers
based their searches largely on the pages and accounts named in
\href{http://www.rbc.ru/magazine/2017/11/59e0c17d9a79470e05a9e6c1}{a
Russian media account} based on interviews with former employees of the
Russian company with Kremlin ties, the Internet Research Agency, accused
of much of the fakery.
