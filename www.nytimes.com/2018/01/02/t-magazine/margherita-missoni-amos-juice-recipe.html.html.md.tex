\emph{To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the
homemade recipes they count on to detox, cleanse --- and refresh.}

``My mom always tried to cure us with natural things,'' says the
designer Margherita Missoni Amos. The daughter of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/t-magazine/fashion/angela-missoni-milan-fashion-week.html}{Angela
Missoni} (of the Italian knitwear dynasty) can remember the homespun
remedies of her childhood: She would gargle apple cider vinegar to
soothe a sore throat and breath in thyme essential oils to unblock a
stuffy nose.

Amos's grandmother,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/t-magazine/rosita-missoni-garden-home.html}{Rosita},
is a big believer in cold-pressed juices to fortify one's system. She
swears by a concoction made from carrots, apple, lemon and celery that
has been part of the family's breakfasts for a long time; Rosita used to
drop in a few ice cubes to lend it a refreshing chill.

That simple recipe stuck with Margherita, 34, who now likes to make it
as part of her annual detox in January. Missoni says the juice helps her
feel ``cleaned out and energized'' after rounds of Christmas lunches and
dinners. She fires up a professional-grade cold-press juicer at her
house in St. Moritz --- where she heads for the New Year with her
husband and their sons, Otto, 4, and Augusto, 2 --- and starts her day
with the blend before hitting the slopes. If she needs an extra dose of
comfort, she adds an additional step, courtesy of Rosita. ``I learned
from my grandma to always drink a big cup of hot water with a half of a
lemon squeezed in it'' upon waking, she says. ``It just balances your
stomach.''

Here, Amos shares the recipe for the time-honored Missoni tonic.
