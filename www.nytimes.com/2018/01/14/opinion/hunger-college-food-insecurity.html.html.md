Last fall, students at two of the nation’s premier historically black
colleges, Spelman and Morehouse, [went on a hunger
strike](https://www.bustle.com/p/spelman-morehouse-students-are-going-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-food-insecurity-on-college-campuses-3242622).
They weren’t protesting policymakers in Washington. They were pressuring
their schools to allow students to donate unused meal plan vouchers to
those on campus who needed them.

These students recognized a real problem, one that plagues all sorts of
colleges and universities, especially the community colleges and state
schools that most Americans attend.

An estimated half of all college students [struggle with food
insecurity](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X17741303?ai=1gvoi&mi=3ricys&af=R),
even at elite flagship universities like the [University of
California](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2016-05-11/hunger-uc-berkeley-sizeable-share-students-are-financially),
Berkeley, and selective private schools like [Northwestern
University](http://www.swipehunger.org/northwestern). Former foster
youth, L.G.B.T. students and students of color are at [substantially
increased
risk](http://www.ucop.edu/global-food-initiative/_files/food-housing-security.pdf).
Food insecurity is [strongly
linked](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00091383.2016.1121081?scroll=top&needAccess=true&)
to lower graduation rates.

The new economics of college led us into this mess. The cost of higher
education is at [an all-time
high](http://time.com/money/4543839/college-costs-record-2016/), which
is in sharp contrast to the declining income and wealth of most American
families. And while a college degree is no guarantee of employment, it
still greatly [increases the odds of a middle-class
life](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery/).
It makes sense that students work hard to go to college to achieve
stability, and it is tragic that many fail to complete degrees because
they cannot escape poverty long enough to focus on their studies.

As a researcher who studies how college students live, I hear frequently
from people who say that struggling a bit to get through college is fine
— in fact, it’s better than fine because it teaches you to work hard for
what you want. After all, they had side jobs in college; they ate Ramen
noodles. That’s just how it goes.

But what is happening today is very different. For decades, many
students survived on little to afford college. But over time, the
situation worsened to the point where now, hunger and homelessness
routinely undermine students’ very ability to learn. Even though a far
greater percentage of [college students qualify for financial
aid](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=31) than in the past,
colleges and states have [fewer dollars per
student](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/a-lost-decade-in-higher-education-funding)
to allocate to them.

Students can’t trust in a government safety net, either. It used to be
the case that relatively few low-income women with children attended
college, but those who did could receive welfare while in school. Today,
[one in four college students have a
child,](https://iwpr.org/publications/4-8-million-college-students-are-raising-children/)
and yet most of these parents can’t get aid (or affordable child care)
because of federal work requirements that require them to work 20 to 30
hours a week to get cash assistance.

Food stamps have onerous requirements, too. Students without children
who qualify for food stamps [often cannot receive
them](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/facts-about-snap) without working 20
hours a week on top of going to school. While that might sound easy, it
isn’t — students are competing in a difficult job market for part-time,
low-wage jobs. They are at a disadvantage because they lack flexibility
and, often, experience. And through all of this, the [value of the real
minimum
wage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/29/the-u-s-has-one-of-the-stingiest-minimum-wage-policies-of-any-wealthy-nation/)
continues to decline. No wonder so many children are growing up in
poverty.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In New York, where a forthcoming study by researchers at the City
University of New York reports that 30 percent of community college
students and 22 percent of four-year college students are food insecure,
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recently proposed that every public college open a
free campus food pantry. This is a modest but welcome step, since even
mere acknowledgment of the problem among top policymakers is rare.

The [first federal
briefing](https://partnersforourchildren.org/blog/poc-co-sponsors-federal-briefing-about-food-insecurity-college-campuses)
on college food insecurity took place just last month, and Gov. Jerry
Brown of California is the only state leader to put substantial funding
toward the problem, with a $7.5 million investment.

But while quick fixes are useful for the students who need food now,
they are not long-term, preventive solutions. Charitable donations of
cans of food and cartons of milk must be supplemented with changes to
how food is distributed and priced on campus, and access to the SNAP
food stamp program should be broadened for students.

Colleges themselves have a responsibility to do better, and they can
take a cue from their students. The hunger strikers at Spelman and
Morehouse were part of a growing coalition of youth who have joined
[Swipe Out Hunger](http://www.swipehunger.org/), a nonprofit that
advocates donating unused meal credits. Spelman and Morehouse both
agreed to allocate [14,000 free meals per
year](https://thegrio.com/2017/11/11/morehouse-spelman-students-hunger-strike-ends-free-meals-campus/)
to students in need. Bunker Hill Community College in Boston is one of
several schools that now distribute meal vouchers, and Houston Community
College is [providing grocery
scholarships](http://wihopelab.com/publications/Addressing-Basic-Needs-Security-in-Higher-Education.pdf).

Fundamentally, financial aid must be reformed to address the [real
price](https://tcf.org/content/report/the-real-price-of-college/) of
college, which cannot be calculated without factoring in food and
shelter. Living expenses are educational expenses.

After all, it’s impossible to learn when you’re starving.
