``I'm always absorbing information,'' said Jonathan Neman, 33, a founder
and chief executive of \href{http://www.sweetgreen.com/}{Sweetgreen},
the fast-casual chain known for its hearty farm-to-table salad bowls.
But before he plots his workday, Mr. Neman, who was raised in Los
Angeles, usually hits the waves near his home in Venice Beach, Calif.
Here's how he tackles the rest of the day. (This interview has been
edited and condensed.)

\hypertarget{morning-surf}{%
\subsection{Morning Surf}\label{morning-surf}}

My goal every morning is to do something that grounds me, to prepare me
for that crazy day ahead. I'm usually up by 6 or 6:30. Then I have a few
rituals. I won't check my phone in bed; I like to start the day
peacefully. Then it's either a surf, yoga or run.

I'm very fortunate I'm about a block from the ocean. Surfing is one of
my favorite things in the world, and I'm not good at it at all. It's the
best kind of meditation for me, and it's my favorite way to start the
day. Actually people in the office will notice it. They'll say, ``You're
in a good mood today, did you surf?''

\hypertarget{work-uniform}{%
\subsection{Work Uniform}\label{work-uniform}}

Then it's a quick shower and I pretty much wear the same base layer
every day: black jeans and a black T-shirt. It's one less thing to think
about it. Maybe I'll add one more thing on top. I do have an affinity
for leather jackets.

\hypertarget{grooming}{%
\subsection{Grooming}\label{grooming}}

I use a face wash from a line our friend started called
\href{https://www.thepanacea.com/}{Panacea}. Then I use whatever my wife
has. Give me that good face cream!

\hypertarget{no-car-no-problem}{%
\subsection{No Car, No Problem}\label{no-car-no-problem}}

I live about 20 minutes from work and I either Uber or my wife, who is a
writer and works at a WeWork nearby, will drop me off. I don't have a
car. We do share the car on the weekends, but going back and forth to
work, it's nice to not have to worry about it.

Also it's a really productive time for me. I might catch up on phone
calls. Or I'm into podcasts recently. I've been into
``\href{https://mastersofscale.com/}{Masters of Scale}'' --- Reid
Hoffman started it --- because it's really inspiring. It gets me fired
up on the way to work.

\hypertarget{office-culture}{%
\subsection{Office Culture}\label{office-culture}}

Our office is in this complex called
\href{https://platformla.com/}{Platform}, and there are a lot of other
start-ups here. \href{https://bluebottlecoffee.com/}{Blue Bottle} is
right next to us so I'll grab a coffee before I go in. The three
founders, we still share an office. What's really special is how we work
together. We've been working together for 11 years as best friends and
partners. It works because there is true friendship there and love and
lack of ego.

Our original headquarters was in D.C., but we're all based in L.A. now.
We relocated because most of our growth is coming from here, our
suppliers are mostly here, and we wanted to be on the front lines.

\hypertarget{prep-work}{%
\subsection{Prep Work}\label{prep-work}}

I like to have a little bit of time in the morning to prep my thoughts.
The night before, I write a list of what needs to be done the next day.
I always take a step back and look to see what it is that I want to lead
the company through today, this week or this month. What's the thing
that's really going to move the needle?

My dad, who immigrated to the U.S. in the late '70s from Iran because of
the revolution, is one of my work mentors. He had to start over and
support his family. One thing I got from him is that the work is never
done.

\hypertarget{skipping-meals}{%
\subsection{Skipping Meals}\label{skipping-meals}}

I don't eat anything in the morning. I just have my coffee. Intermittent
fasting keeps me very energized. I've been doing this since I was a kid,
but it's become more of a thing now. I also eat a very big dinner so I
feel like I'm still digesting it the next day.

I do eat an early lunch. I go to the test kitchen we have here and see
what the chef is cooking up. I stay at the office pretty late so I'm not
home until about 9 p.m. I've been cooking a lot more at home lately, but
it's also a highlight when we get to go try somewhere fun for dinner,
usually on the West Side.

\hypertarget{reading-list}{%
\subsection{Reading List}\label{reading-list}}

I just finished
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Onward-Starbucks-Fought-without-Losing/dp/1609613821}{``Onward''
by Howard Schultz} --- it's really interesting and still relevant now
--- and I just began
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021}{``Principles''
by Ray Dalio}. I've gotten a lot of inspiration from outside of our
industry. It's about looking at other business models and brands and
thinking, ``How can we apply that here?'' For example, I've been really
interested in Disney. This brand has lasted so long and stayed
culturally relevant. It starts with this creative spirit layered with
storytelling and magic and the ability to innovate and evolve over time.

\hypertarget{family-first}{%
\subsection{Family First}\label{family-first}}

I'm Persian Jewish and I have a huge family. I'm the oldest of four
boys, and I have 20 first cousins. My wife --- we got married last June
--- has a similar family situation. Every Friday night we have Shabbat.
That's a big part of our life.
