# Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: The Scandal and the Fallout So Far

</div>

Revelations that digital consultants to the Trump campaign misused the
data of millions of Facebook users set off a furor on both sides of the
Atlantic. This is how The Times covered it.

In March, The New York Times, working with The Observer of London and
The Guardian, obtained a cache of documents from inside Cambridge
Analytica, the data firm principally owned by the right-wing donor
[Robert
Mercer](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/us/politics/robert-mercer-donald-trump-donor.html).
The documents proved that the firm, where the former Trump aide [Stephen
K.
Bannon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/business/dealbook/how-some-top-trump-aides-made-their-fortunes.html)
was a board member, used data improperly obtained from Facebook to build
voter profiles. The news put Cambridge under investigation and thrust
Facebook into its biggest crisis ever. Here’s a guide to our coverage.

## Harvesting data and testing election law

The Times [reported that in 2014 contractors and
employees](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html)
of Cambridge Analytica, eager to sell psychological profiles of American
voters to political campaigns, acquired the private Facebook data of
tens of millions of users — the largest known leak in Facebook history.

There was more. Our article first showed how Cambridge received warnings
from its own lawyer, Laurence Levy, as it employed European and Canadian
citizens on campaigns, potentially violating American election law. The
Times also found that tranches of raw data still existed beyond
Facebook’s control.

## What was the Russia link?

In [a companion
piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-russia.html),
The Times reported that people at Cambridge Analytica and its British
affiliate, the SCL Group, were in contact with executives from Lukoil,
the Kremlin-linked oil giant, as Cambridge built its Facebook-derived
profiles. Lukoil was interested in the ways data was used to target
American voters, according to two former company insiders. SCL and
Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature and said the oil
giant never became a client.

## Anger on both sides of the Atlantic

The articles [drew an instant
response](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/cambridge-analytica-facebook-privacy-data.html)
in Washington, where lawmakers demanded that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s
chief executive, testify before Congress. Democrats looking into Russian
interference in the 2016 election — already interested in Cambridge’s
role in providing analytics to the Trump campaign — said they would seek
an investigation into the leak. They were echoed by lawmakers in Britain
investigating Cambridge Analytica’s role in disinformation and the
country’s referendum to leave the European Union.

## Bribes, entrapment and a suspension

The Times reported that Cambridge
[suspended](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/europe/cambridge-analytica-ceo-suspended.html)
its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a British television channel
[released an undercover
video](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/cambridge-analytica-alexander-nix.html)
in which he suggested that the company had used seduction and bribery to
entrap politicians and influence foreign elections. In Washington, the
Federal Trade Commission [moved to
investigate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/business/ftc-facebook-privacy-investigation.html)
whether Facebook had violated an early agreement to safeguard user
data.

## Facebook faces a reckoning

The Times reported on a growing number of Facebook users, including the
singer Cher, [deleting their
accounts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/users-abandon-facebook.html)
— and broke news of the [departure of Facebook’s top security
official](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html),
who had clashed with other executives on how to handling discontent over
the platform’s role in spreading disinformation. The hashtag
\#DeleteFacebook began trending on Twitter.

After [remaining silent for
days](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html)
— spurring another social media hashtag, \#WheresZuck? — Mr. Zuckerberg
[spoke with The
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-q-and-a.html)
about steps Facebook was taking to address users’ anger.

## New Trump adviser, old Cambridge connection

As Facebook reeled, The Times delved into the relationship between
[Cambridge Analytica and John
Bolton](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/bolton-cambridge-analyticas-facebook-data.html),
the conservative hawk [named national security adviser by President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/hr-mcmaster-trump-bolton.html).
The Times broke the news that in 2014, Cambridge provided Mr. Bolton’s
“super PAC” with early versions of its Facebook-derived profiles — the
technology’s first large-scale use in an American election.

*What about 2016?* [*We
examined*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/cambridge-analytica.html)
*the skepticism and evidence around the role Cambridge claimed it played
in Mr. Trump’s win.*

## Another look at ‘Brexit’

The Times and The Observer [reported
allegations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/world/europe/uk-brexit-vote-leave-shahmir-sanni.html)
that the 2016 “Brexit” campaign used a Cambridge Analytica contractor to
help skirt election spending limits. The story implicated two senior
advisers to Prime Minister Theresa May. Testifying to Parliament [a few
days
later](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/world/europe/whistle-blower-data-mining-cambridge-analytica.html),
a former Cambridge employee, Christopher Wylie, contended that the
company helped swing the results in favor of Britain’s withdrawal from
the European Union.

In another report, The Times showed how an employee at Palantir
Technologies — an intelligence contractor founded by the Trump backer
and tech investor Peter Thiel — [helped Cambridge harvest Facebook
data](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/cambridge-analytica-palantir.html).
The article reported that Palantir and Cambridge executives briefly
considered a formal partnership to work on political campaigns. Though
the deal fell through, a Palantir employee continued working with
Cambridge to figure out how to obtain data for psychographic profiles.
Palantir officials said the employee did so in a strictly personal
capacity.

April 4

## How many were affected?

The Times originally reported that Cambridge harvested data from over 50
million Facebook users. But at the bottom of a company announcement
about new privacy features, Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike
Schroepfer, issued a new estimate for the number of users who were
affected: [as many as 87
million](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress.html),
most of them in the United States.

*Facebook is responding to users’ distrust. Read how the company*
[*introduced a central privacy
page*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/technology/facebook-privacy-security-settings.html)*.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>*

April 8

## ‘You are the product’

Amid the crisis, one set of voices remained notably absent: Facebook
users whose data was harvested. So [The Times found
some](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/facebook-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmatthew-rosenberg&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection),
and their reactions ranged from anger to resigned annoyance at how
tech<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>giants use personal
information. As one of the affected Facebook
users<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>put it, “You are the
product on the internet.”

The Times also reported new details on the app used to collect data for
Cambridge Analytica. It was no simple Facebook quiz, as many had
assumed. Rather, it was attached to a lengthy psychology questionnaire
hosted by Qualtrics, a company that manages online surveys. The first
step for those filling out the questionnaire was to grant access to
their Facebook profiles. Once they did, an app then harvested their data
and that of their friends.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Zuckerberg made [his first appearance before
Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/zuckerberg-facebook-senate-hearing.html),
testifying to Senate and House committees. First up was the Senate,
where [he faced tough
questions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html)
about the company’s mishandling of data, and said Facebook was
investigating “tens of thousands of apps” to see what information they
harvested.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

The next day, he faced [an even tougher
crowd](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/business/zuckerberg-facebook-congress.html)
in the House. There, the consensus was that social media technology —
and its potential for abuse — had far outpaced Washington, and that
Congress may have to step in to close the gap. Even Mr. Zuckerberg
seemed to suggest he could be open to some regulation, but neither he
nor lawmakers seemed sure about how exactly to regulate the new breed of
companies.

particularly Mr. Mercer’s daughter Rebekah, who leads the family’s

visited Facebook headquarters to plead the case for Cambridge. Though
the Mercers were once Mr. Trump’s leading patrons in conservative
politics, their standing in the president’s circle has suffered.

## Who audits the auditors?

The Times [reported on a series of
assessments](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/technology/facebook-audit-cambridge-analytica.html)
of Facebook’s privacy programs, conducted by the consulting firm PwC on
behalf of federal regulators. In the assessments, mandated by a 2011
consent decree, PwC deemed Facebook’s internal controls effective at
protecting users’ privacy — even after the social media giant lost
control of a huge trove of user data that was improperly obtained by
Cambridge Analytica.
