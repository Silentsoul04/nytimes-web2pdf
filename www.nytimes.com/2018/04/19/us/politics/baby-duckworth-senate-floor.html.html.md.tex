WASHINGTON --- Maile Pearl Bowlsbey made history in the United States
Capitol on Thursday. And she's only 10 days old.

Cradled in the arms of her mother, Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/tucker-carlson-tammy-duckworth.html}{Tammy
Duckworth}, Democrat of Illinois, baby Maile (pronounced My-lee) now has
the distinction of being the first infant ever brought onto the Senate
floor. Ms. Duckworth brought her daughter to work so that she could be
with her baby and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/science/jim-bridenstine-nasa.html}{vote
against the confirmation of a new NASA administrator}. (Ms. Duckworth,
too, has made history, by becoming the first senator to
\href{https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-birth.html}{give
birth while in office}.)

Tough-minded and staid senators cooed and fussed. ``She's so
beautiful,'' Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, exclaimed.
Reporters, looking down from the balcony, responded with a collective
``aaawwww.'' (``The press is finally interested in something
worthwhile,'' Mr. Schumer quipped.)

Even Senator Mitch McConnell, the ordinarily dour Republican leader from
Kentucky, gave a little wave and smiled.

Maile's arrival was the product of several months of behind-the-scenes
negotiation in the hidebound Senate, whose rules until Wednesday barred
children from coming onto the Senate floor. A few months after Ms.
Duckworth announced she was pregnant, she asked Senator Amy Klobuchar of
Minnesota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, to help
her engineer a rule change, necessary because senators are required to
vote in person.

So it was that on Wednesday, senators voted unanimously that,
henceforth, both male and female senators will be permitted to bring
infants up to age one into the chamber. In an institution where a fair
number of members are in their 80s, this was a monumental change, hardly
as simple as it might seem.

First, Ms. Klobuchar said, there were the discussions over whether the
Senate floor would turn into some kind of nursery.

``But what if there are 10 babies on the floor of the Senate?'' Senator
Orrin G. Hatch, 84, Republican of Utah, asked, according to The
Associated Press. Replied Ms. Klobuchar: ``That would be wonderful and a
delight.''

Then came the concerns about whether there would be diaper changes. Or
breast-feeding. (Ms. Duckworth, Ms. Klobuchar said, has no intention of
doing either while on the Senate floor.)

Some senators wanted an exception only for Ms. Duckworth, an option the
two women rejected because they felt it important for lawmakers to send
a message to the nation --- and to women who might run --- that the
Senate is a welcoming workplace. Some suggested Ms. Duckworth vote from
the Senate cloakroom, which lacks wheelchair access; Ms. Duckworth, a
combat veteran who lost both legs while serving in Iraq, uses a
wheelchair.

And then there was the baby's attire: ``The baby will not be required to
wear pants or a skirt or a tie. The baby will be allowed to wear a baby
cap, unlike senators who can't wear a hat,'' Ms. Klobuchar rattled off
(Baby Maile wore a pink cap on Thursday.). ``Senators are not allowed to
wear sneakers or flip flops, but they are allowed to wear orthopedic
shoes. The babies don't have to wear shoes. They could wear baby
booties. The baby is also not required to wear a Senate pin, because it
would be dangerous.''

Maile's Capitol debut came at a moment of high drama in the Senate, as
lawmakers were split along party lines while voting on the confirmation
of Jim Bridenstine to be the NASA administrator. With Vice President
Mike Pence on hand to break a possible tie, the Senate extended its
customary 15-minute voting window so that Ms. Duckworth could travel
from home, as the corridors buzzed with news of her impending arrival.
Earlier in the day, she had teased baby-lovers by posting a picture of
Maile's outfit
\href{https://twitter.com/tammyduckworth/status/986990557166821376}{on
Twitter}.

Maile is the second child born to Ms. Duckworth and her husband, Bryan
Bowlsbey, who also have a three-year-old, named Abigail. As her
colleagues waited for her arrival, Ms. Klobuchar paced the Senate floor
like an expectant father.

Just outside the chamber, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of
Missouri, lamented she had a plane to catch: ``I'm going to miss a baby,
darn it,'' she said.

But when the brass elevator doors opened in front of her, out came Ms.
Duckworth, her newborn child tucked against her chest, bundled in a
blanket. ``Here she is!'' screamed Ms. McCaskill, who dashed onto the
Senate floor, announcing, ``She's coming!''

Ms. Duckworth wheeled in, to so much commotion that the reason she had
come --- to vote on Mr. Bridenstine --- was almost forgotten. She
signaled her disapproval, flashing a theatrical thumbs down, with baby
Maile, seemingly content, cuddled in her lap.

And she echoed the views of women everywhere as she arrived at the
Capitol: ``It's about time.''
