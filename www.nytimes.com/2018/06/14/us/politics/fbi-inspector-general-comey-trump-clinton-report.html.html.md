<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department’s inspector general on Thursday
painted a harsh portrait of the F.B.I. during the 2016 presidential
election, describing a destructive culture in which James B. Comey, the
former director, was “insubordinate,” senior officials privately bashed
Donald J. Trump and agents came to distrust prosecutors.

The 500-page report criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding
policy and publicly discussing — in a news conference and a pair of
letters in the middle of the campaign — an investigation into Hillary
Clinton’s use of a private email server in handling classified
information. The report was a firm rebuke of those actions, which Mr.
Comey has tried for months to defend.

Nevertheless, the inspector general, [Michael E.
Horowitz](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/us/politics/michael-horowitz-justice-department-inspector-general.html),
did not challenge the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton should not be
prosecuted. That investigation loomed over most of the presidential
campaign, and Mr. Horowitz and his investigators uncovered no proof that
political opinions at the F.B.I. influenced its outcome.

“We found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors
were affected by bias or other improper considerations,” he wrote.
“Rather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor’s
assessment of facts, the law and past department practice.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the report — initiated in response to a chorus of requests from
Congress and the public — was far from an exoneration. Mr. Horowitz was
unsparing in his criticism of Mr. Comey and referred five F.B.I.
employees for possible discipline over pro-Clinton or anti-Trump
commentary in electronic messages. He said agents were far too cozy with
journalists. And he described a breakdown in the chain of command,
calling it “extraordinary” that the attorney general acceded to Mr.
Comey during the most controversial moments of the Clinton
investigation.

The result, Mr. Horowitz said, undermined public confidence in the
F.B.I. and sowed doubt about the bureau’s handling of the Clinton
investigation, which even two years later remains politically divisive.
Mrs. Clinton’s supporters blame Mr. Comey for her election loss. Mr.
Trump believes that Mr. Comey and his agents conspired to clear Mrs.
Clinton of wrongdoing because they were openly hostile to his candidacy.

Mr. Horowitz repeatedly said he found no evidence that the F.B.I. rigged
the outcome. “Our review did not find documentary or testimonial
evidence directly connecting the political views these employees
expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the specific
investigative decisions we reviewed,” the report said.

The report is especially critical of two F.B.I. officials, Peter Strzok
and Lisa Page, [who exchanged
texts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/fbi-trump-russia.html)
disparaging Mr. Trump. Many of those text messages had already been
released, but the report cites a previously undisclosed exchange:

Mr. Trump is “not ever going to become president, right? Right?\!” Ms.
Page wrote.

“No,” Mr. Strzok wrote. “No he won’t. We’ll stop it.”

Ms. Page has left the F.B.I. and Mr. Strzok has been reassigned to human
resources. Like other top F.B.I. officials, they were involved in both
the Clinton case and the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to
Russia. So while the inspector general’s report focuses entirely on the
Clinton case, it has ramifications for the investigation being carried
out by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Any evidence of bias
or rule-breaking in one case could be used to undermine confidence in
the other.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump has repeatedly declared the Russia investigation a “witch
hunt” and was eagerly anticipating the release of Thursday’s report.
He was briefed on it but was notably silent about the conclusions.

The Republican National Committee, though, distributed talking points to
supporters criticizing a “fervent anti-Trump bias” and calling for Mr.
Strzok’s termination. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee
Sanders, offered few remarks.

“It reaffirmed the president’s suspicions about Comey’s conduct and the
political bias among some of the members of the F.B.I.,” she said. But
she referred questions to the current F.B.I. director, Christopher A.
Wray.

Mr. Wray, in a rare news conference, said he took the report seriously
but said that nothing in the report “impugns the integrity” of the
F.B.I. “Our brand is doing just fine,” he
said.

## Read: Justice Dept. Report on the F.B.I.’s Handling of Clinton Inquiry

The Justice Department's inspector general released a report on Thursday
detailing the F.B.I.'s handling of the Clinton email investigation
during the 2016 presidential
election.

<div class="css-17ih8de interactive-body" data-sourceid="100000005955482">

![568 pages, 26.98

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Wray was confirmed last year after the abrupt firing of Mr. Comey,
and the report serves as an unflattering book end to Mr. Comey’s
three-and-a-half-year tenure. The findings sharply criticize his
judgment as he injected the F.B.I. into presidential politics in ways
not seen since at least the Watergate era.

Mr. Comey [held a news conference in
July 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-email-comey.html)
to announce that he was recommending no charges against Mrs. Clinton and
to publicly chastise her email practices. It was highly unorthodox; the
Justice Department, not the F.B.I., makes charging decisions. And
officials have been reprimanded for injecting their opinions into legal
conclusions. Mr. Comey withheld his plans for a public statement from
his bosses at the Justice Department.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so,” the
inspector general wrote, “and we found none of his reasons to be a
persuasive basis for deviating from well-established department policies
in a way intentionally designed to avoid supervision by department
leadership.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then in late October, over the objection of top Justice Department
officials, [Mr. Comey sent a letter to
Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html)
disclosing that agents were scrutinizing new evidence in the Clinton
case.

That evidence did not change the outcome of the inquiry, but Mrs.
Clinton and many of her supporters [blame Mr. Comey’s late
disclosure](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-james-comey.html)
for her defeat. Former campaign aides expressed disbelief Thursday at
another revelation in the report — that Mr. Comey had used a private
email account to conduct official F.B.I. business while he supervised
the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email practices. “I don’t know
whether to laugh or cry,” said Brian Fallon, the former campaign
spokesman.

And Mrs. Clinton herself responded on Twitter, noting only, “But my
emails.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Comey has defended his actions, saying he would have faced criticism
for any decision, so he opted to be transparent. F.B.I. officials have
acknowledged that they made those decisions in part because they assumed
Mrs. Clinton would win, and they worried about appearing to conceal
information to help her.

Mr. Comey and his agents also grew suspicious of Justice Department
prosecutors. Working-level agents wanted prosectors to be more
aggressive — a tension that the inspector general found “caused
significant strife and mistrust” between the two groups.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Comey, too, said his decisions were influenced in part by concerns
that political appointees at the Justice Department did not have the
credibility to close the investigation. [In an Op-Ed published in The
New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/opinion/comey-clinton-inspector-general.html)
responding to the report, Mr. Comey said he believed he was making the
right decisions at the time.

“As painful as the whole experience has been, I still believe that,” he
wrote. “And nothing in the inspector general’s report makes me think we
did the wrong thing.”

Mr. Comey has cultivated a reputation for fierce independence and
supreme self-confidence. Those traits were both assets and
vulnerabilities. Agents [widely saw
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/us/politics/comey-fbi-agents-confidence-survey.html)
as a strong leader.

But Mr. Comey believed that he was the only one who could steer the
F.B.I. through the political winds of the Clinton case, and that left
him alone to answer for the bureau’s actions.

Officially at least, Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton case cost him
his job. After the firing, the White House held up as justification a
Justice Department memo that criticized many of the actions now
highlighted by the inspector general. In that regard, the inspector
general would seem to underscore the stated reason for Mr. Comey’s
dismissal.

But Mr. Trump has muddied this issue. Hours after the firing, he
undercut his own staff and said that he had planned to fire Mr. Comey
even before receiving the recommendation. He said he had been thinking
about the Russia investigation when he fired Mr. Comey. His lawyer,
Rudolph W. Giuliani, added more recently that Mr. Comey was fired for
refusing to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump in the Russia case.

Those comments, along with [Mr. Comey’s account of private conversations
with the
president](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/us/politics/james-comey-memo-fbi-trump.html),
prompted the appointment of a special counsel to begin investigating Mr.
Trump for possible obstruction of justice. That inquiry continues. The
inspector general’s report does not directly affect that case, though
anything that undermines Mr. Comey’s credibility is politically and
legally beneficial to Mr. Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The inspector general is separately reviewing some aspects of the Russia
investigation, including Mr. Trump’s theory — backed up by no evidence —
that the F.B.I. spied on his campaign for political purposes. Those
matters were not covered in Thursday’s report.

Mr. Horowitz’s investigation has already [led to the firing of one top
F.B.I.
official](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/andrew-mccabe-fbi-fired.html),
the former deputy director Andrew G. McCabe. Mr. Horowitz issued a
report in March that said Mr. McCabe had been dishonest about his
contacts with the news media about Mrs. Clinton.

Mr. McCabe has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump’s ire and is central
to his theory that the F.B.I. secretly worked to exonerate Mrs. Clinton.
Mr. McCabe’s wife ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the Virginia
State Senate and received significant campaign donations from an ally of
Mrs. Clinton. Despite the president’s criticism, the inspector general
said on Thursday that Mr. McCabe had not been required to recuse himself
from the Clinton case.

Among Mr. Horowitz’s original tasks was to identify whether F.B.I.
agents improperly disclosed information about the Clinton case to
reporters. But his inquiry was stymied, he said, because improper
contacts with journalists were so common. “The large number of F.B.I.
employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period
impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks,” he wrote.

The report omitted any discussion of a potential leak of information in
fall 2016 to Mr. Giuliani, who was then one of Mr. Trump’s key campaign
surrogates but not yet his lawyer. Shortly before Mr. Comey announced
the discovery of new emails in the Clinton case, Mr. Giuliani appeared
on Fox News and hinted that major news was about to break: “I mean, I’m
talking about some pretty big surprises,” he said.

Mr. Horowitz has indicated that another report addressing leaks is
forthcoming. It is not clear whether Mr. Giuliani’s remarks will be
addressed.
