PARIS — More than art, more than music, what the cultural eminences of
this city really love is gossip. So full credit to Beyoncé and Jay-Z —
known, in tandem, as the Carters — for extending their cone of silence
all the way to the City of Light. Not only did the first couple of
American pop music impose their standard omertà on the songwriters,
musicians, producers and technicians who helped them complete their new
album [“Everything Is
Love”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/arts/music/beyonce-jay-z-surprise-album-everything-is-love.html);
they also got the mandarins of Paris’s largest museum to keep mum about
their first single, whose video was shot in the galleries and the
exterior plaza of the Musée du Louvre.

The video for the single “Apes\*\*t” sees Beyoncé, Jay-Z and their
dancers vamp on Pierre Paulin’s circular gray banquettes, drop verses in
front of I.M. Pei’s entrance pyramid and squirm in formation in front of
Jacques-Louis David’s gigantic “Coronation of Napoleon.” It’s a
firecracker of a song — and, from an art critic’s perspective, more
sophisticated and more genuine than their earlier forays into museums
and galleries, such as Jay-Z’s dreary Marina Abramovic parody [“Picasso
Baby.”](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS797US797&ei=0XomW_7mKNDb5gKwnKb4Dw&q=picasso+baby+youtube&oq=%E2%80%9CPicasso+Baby%E2%80%9D+you+tube&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0i13k1j0i8i13i30k1.6288.7591.0.9302.9.9.0.0.0.0.122.640.2j4.6.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..3.6.638...0j0i22i30k1j0i22i10i30k1.0.oigzrMvEW6A)

First things first: While some fans have exulted that only Queen Bey has
the cash and the clout to privatize Europe’s grandest museum, there is
nothing very rare about filming here. [About 500
shoots](https://twitter.com/MuseeLouvre/status/920265761448480768) take
place at the Louvre every year. The Carters’ clip follows in the
tradition of “[Wonder
Woman](https://geeks.media/wonder-woman-as-an-art-historian),” “Fifty
Shades Freed” and such noble cultural achievements as “The Smurfs 2.”
Film and television shoots serve as an essential marketing for the
Louvre — [attendance is up
again](http://presse.louvre.fr/8-1-million-visitors-to-the-louvre-in-2017/),
after terrorism-induced declines in 2016 — and as of 2015, the [top fee
was just 15,000
euros](https://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/medias/medias_fichiers/fichiers/pdf/louvre-tarifs-sur-le-domaine-du-louvre-et-des-tuileries-2015.pdf),
or about $17,500, for a full day’s shoot in the galleries. There are
hotel rooms here that cost more than that.

Love.”*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/arts/music/beyonce-jay-z-the-carters-everything-is-love-review.html)\]

In the video, directed by [Ricky
Saiz](https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/10/09/fashion/new-york-film-festival-american-red-cross/s/09SCENE-CITY-slide-PWJN.html),
Bey and Jay follow the well-trod tourist route past the Louvre’s three
most famous works — the Venus de Milo on the ground floor, the Winged
Victory of Samothrace atop the broad Daru staircase and the Mona Lisa in
the Denon wing. The couple and their dancers also perform in front of
the large-scale paintings of revolutionary and early imperial France in
the long Grande Galerie: David’s “Oath of the Horatii” and portrait of
Madame Récamier; Théodore Géricault’s “Charging Chasseur” and “Raft of
the Medusa.” (Longtime Louvre watchers will know that Jay-Z is not the
first black artist to rap there: In 2006, [Toni Morrison invited slam
poets](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/books/21morr.html) from
Paris’s banlieues to freestyle in front of Géricault’s shipwreck.)

A hand-held camera pans across the ornate walls of the Apollo Gallery,
built for Louis XIV, and zooms in on its gold-framed ceiling murals. And
there are dance sequences inside and outside the building, staged by the
avant-garde Belgian choreographer [Sidi Larbi
Cherkaoui](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/arts/dance/11sulc.html),
in which performers kneel like protesting football players and do
synchronized abdominal exercises on the Daru stairs.

Why did Beyoncé and Jay-Z decide to stage their reconciliation track at
the world’s most visited museum? Swagger, for one thing: That first
tracking shot of the couple in front of the Mona Lisa, wearing silk
suits of complementary sea-foam green (him) and orchid pink (her), is a
first-order power move that echoes [their selfie
from 2014](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11159162/Beyonce-most-irritating-selfies-of-all-time.html)
in the same gallery. It also relies on Paris’s romance and glamour,
which Jay-Z drew on earlier for the 2011 [duet with Kanye
West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44) (with an unprintable
title referencing the city). This video would make no sense at Madrid’s
imposing Museo del Prado or Vienna’s lush Kunsthistorisches
Museum.

As so often, the couple here present themselves as both outsiders in an
elite institution and as heirs to it; as people excluded from its
narratives but now possessors of it by virtue of their talent, their
taste and, well, their money. Scenes that proudly emphasize racial
difference — a woman combing a man’s hair with an afro pick in front of
the Gioconda — alternate with shots in which Beyoncé appears wholly at
home, especially the one in which she is seated before the Winged
Victory, with her long cream dress bundled around her legs. “Can’t
believe we made it,” she sings, and her arrival in Paris’s most hallowed
hall gets underscored with close-ups that isolate black figures in the
Louvre’s French and Italian painting collection, notably Veronese’s
“Wedding at Cana.” There’s also a flash to [Marie-Guillemine Benoist’s
“Portrait of a
Negress,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Guillemine_Benoist)
painted between French revolutionaries’ abolition of slavery in 1794 and
Napoleon’s restoration of it in 1802. (Her bare breast is
censored.)

Black Frenchmen (and, far less, women) were a common subject for
painters at the time of the Louvre’s founding, yet the Carters are no
Jacobins. As in their previous videos, here too cultural empowerment
goes hand in hand with personal acquisitiveness. Some shots of the
Louvre, particularly those filmed in the gilded Apollo Gallery, feel
more closely allied to the song’s shout-outs to Patek Philippe watches
and Gulfstream airplanes than to the history of painting. But the
couple’s political view of black wealth has far more resonance in the
Louvre’s Egyptian galleries, where Beyoncé boasts that she “bought him a
jet” in front of the Great Sphinx of Tanis. By the end, in one of the
video’s best shots, she and the dancers are going wild in the Louvre
basement, and topless men are jumping for joy in front of the sphinx.
They have not won admission to the museum; they have taken it
over.

I have previously been distrustful of this couple’s quotations of visual
art, whose appeal has too often seemed to be its prestige and expense
rather than its meaning or beauty. Beyoncé has restaged well-known
works: [“Hold
Up”](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/beyonce-accused-of-stealing-pipilotti-rists-visuals-for-hold-up-music-video-a7010966.html)
paid tribute (or just cribbed) the light-footed feminism of the Swiss
video artist Pipilotti Rist, while
[“Countdown”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XY3AvVgDns)channeled
the precise dance moves of another Belgian choreographer, [Anne Teresa
De Keersmaeker](http://www.rosas.be/en/8-anne-teresa-de-keersmaeker).
(There is some flagrant borrowing in this new video too. Scenes of
domestic intimacy seem to rephrase photographs by [Deana
Lawson](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/07/deana-lawsons-kingdom-of-restored-glory),
while the white French officer of Géricault’s “Charging Chasseur” is
counterposed with a casually dressed man on horseback — whose style,
lighting and framing echo [the photography of the French artist Mohamed
Bourouissa](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/arts/design/mohamed-bourouissa-urban-cowboys.html).)
As for Jay, he has been flashing artworks since “[Blue
Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O3USgkwiJA),” (2007), in which a
Damien Hirst spin painting and a light work by Tim Noble and Sue Webster
received the same screen time as Goyard luggage and a fistful of
euros.

But here the pair admirably let the art speak for itself. What is
sexiest in this video are the camera pans, done in low lighting and with
lusty ease, over the visual splendor of the museum’s Denon wing: the
tumbling white-haired man in Veronese’s “Jupiter Expelling the Vices,”
or the shouting [woman in the red
dress](https://books.google.fr/books?id=PfS0boVIzX0C&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234&dq=ewa+lajer-burcharth+necklines+red+dress&source=bl&ots=HmL2lgCild&sig=CkG-0DI8DVDQWnxEwHI_lVarct4&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ewa%20lajer-burcharth%20necklines%20red%20dress&f=false)
that unlocks David’s “Intervention of the Sabine Women.” I know these
paintings like I know my own face, but I never expected to see them in
this context — shown not as pricey baubles but as masterpieces to be
loved for their own sake. In the last shot, Bey and Jay turn away from
the camera, look into each other’s eyes, and then do something that they
did not do in that 2014 selfie: they look at the Leonardo.
