The United States Senate on Monday overwhelmingly voted to approve
President Trump's latest pick to lead the Department of Veterans
Affairs, confirming Robert Wilkie as the next secretary 86 to 9.

Mr. Wilkie, 55, will lead the second-largest department in the federal
government, overseeing about 360,000 employees and the vast veterans
health care system.

He is taking over a department in turmoil. Veterans Affairs, which has
struggled for years to provide timely and efficient care, has been
without permanent leadership since the previous secretary, David J.
Shulkin,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/politics/david-shulkin-veterans-affairs-trump.html}{was
fired} in March. The department is also dealing with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/va-medical-system-chaos.html}{thousands
of job vacancies and staff turnover} at the highest levels.

Mr. Wilkie will be responsible for stabilizing the department and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/politics/veterans-health-care.html}{revamping
the veterans health care system} to make it easier for veterans to take
their benefits to private doctors.

Mr. Wilkie is a career Washington insider who has worked for Senators
Jesse Helms, Trent Lott and Thom Tillis, and was an assistant defense
secretary under George W. Bush.

He has served as acting secretary of Veterans Affairs, and as under
secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, where he handled the
health and welfare of all military personnel.

The son of a highly decorated artillery officer, Mr. Wilkie grew up on
Army bases and has joked that he was born in khaki diapers. After law
school, he served in the Navy and Air Force Reserves.

He was nominated to become secretary after Mr. Trump's first choice fell
through. The president originally nominated the White House physician,
Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/us/politics/ronny-jackson-trump-white-house.html}{withdrew
from consideration} in April after disparaging reports about him
circulated before his scheduled confirmation hearing.

Mr. Trump announced his intention to nominate Mr. Wilkie in May,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/us/politics/trump-va-secretary-robert-wilkie.html}{surprising
even Mr. Wilkie himself}, who had not been told of the decision before
the president slipped the news into remarks he made ahead of a meeting
on prison reform.

Mr. Wilkie, who was sitting in the front row at the event, stood up and
shook Mr. Trump's hand after hearing the news.

He was a largely uncontested choice, receiving backing from both
parties.

In a statement on Monday, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Wilkie for his
patriotism and commitment to serving veterans.

``Under his leadership, I have no doubt that the Department of Veterans
Affairs will continue to make strides in honoring and protecting the
heroic men and women who have served our Nation with distinction,'' he
said.

Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican who is the chairman of the
Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said in a statement on Monday:
``The Department of Veterans Affairs needs a leader who will help move
the V.A., away from problems of the past and toward solutions of the
future.''

Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana who also serves on the
committee, said that confirming Mr. Wilkie was the right choice for
veterans.

But, in a statement, he said: ``Our job doesn't stop today. The Senate
must always hold Mr. Wilkie accountable to the millions of American
veterans he serves.''
