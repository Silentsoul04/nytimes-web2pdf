GENOA, Italy — A bridge in the heart of Genoa collapsed on Tuesday,
killing 37 people as dozens of vehicles and tons of concrete and steel
plunged onto city streets below in a disaster that prompted an emergency
review of Italy’s aging infrastructure.

Adriano Scimpioni said he had just finished his shift at the city’s
garbage collection company when “I heard something like an explosion and
a screech of iron, and in a second we were all covered by a cloud of
dust.”

Mr. Scimpioni went outside, and with his smartphone he started
[broadcasting the
scene](https://www.facebook.com/adriano.scipioni/videos/1637149753056595/)
on Facebook.

“I immediately thought of the victims; I held my tears, with
difficulty,” he said. “We were impotent, we didn’t have the means to
help those who remained underneath.” He said two of his colleagues had
been
killed.

## Before and After the Bridge Collapse

The cable-stayed Morandi Bridge in Genoa, Italy, collapsed on Tuesday.
This bridge uses very few stays, which were constructed from
pre-stressed concrete instead of steel cables. The collapse occurred at
one of the trestles, a vertical framework of upside-down V’s used for
support.

Long before the collapse, [experts warned that the structure was
deteriorating](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/world/europe/italy-genoa-bridge-collapse.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)
and possibly dangerous.

The highway bridge fell by as much as 148 feet just before noon, taking
about three dozen cars and three trucks with it, according to Angelo
Borrelli, chief of the Civil Protection Department.

The calamity presented a serious test of Italy’s new government, a
coalition of populist parties that was [formed only months
ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/world/europe/italy-european-union.html).
They rode to power on a wave of anti-establishment anger, but the
coalition is led by people who had little to no experience governing,
and now must demonstrate that they can manage a crisis and the scrutiny
that comes with it.

Giuseppe Conte, who took over as prime minister in June, traveled to the
scene of the disaster. The office of the city’s public prosecutor said
it would open a criminal inquiry, examining whether the collapse was
because of negligence, and federal authorities indicated that they, too,
would investigate.

Mr. Conte’s deputy prime minister and interior minister, Matteo Salvini,
who is a powerful populist skeptic of the European Union, said that the
bloc’s budget rules might have to be lifted so Italy could overhaul its
infrastructure. “When they tell us that we can’t spend our money because
some E.U. constraints don’t permit it, I wonder whether these
constraints make any sense,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Danilo Toninelli, the transportation minister, said the government had
ordered a comprehensive safety review of Italy’s infrastructure —
including viaducts and bridges built in the 1950s and 1960s during the
country’s postwar boom. Much of the infrastructure, he warned, was
showing signs of age. “This is what Italy needs to do, now,” he said.

In a phone interview, Antonio Occhiuzzi, director of the Institute for
Construction Technology for Italy’s National Research Council, said that
most of the nation’s infrastructure “needs to be carefully re-examined”
because much “was at the end” of its useful life span. He added, “In
some cases it can be reinforced, in other cases it will have to be
demolished and rebuilt
completely.”

Mr. Occhiuzzi said that civil and structural engineering projects in
Italy were complicated by a national patrimony that dates to antiquity.
“Our position, typically, is to try and conserve rather than demolish
and rebuild, as happens in other countries,” he said.

The collapse of the Genoese bridge was a serious alarm, he said,
“because it is not an isolated case — in the last three years, a
number of bridges have collapsed in Italy, and they are all around 50
years old.”

Francesco Faccini, a lecturer at the University of Genoa and an expert
on floods and landslides, said “significant urbanization” of the city’s
flood plains along with, at times, irrational urbanization, led to
channels being narrowed and streams diverted. The result, he said, was a
situation where flooding became more common, especially as the intensity
of downpours has grown in recent
years.

In the Sampierdarena neighborhood under the fallen bridge, gas and
electricity were shut off as workers scrambled to check on the security
of buildings. The electricity was later restored.

Giovanna Santacroce, a 25-year-old ice cream vendor who lives a few
hundred yards from the bridge, said she heard what sounded like thunder.
“Then the light went off for a second and I peeked out of the window and
couldn’t see the bridge anymore,” she said. “On the street people were
crying, debris was everywhere. They ordered us to leave the house, and
we don’t know when we’ll be able to return.”

Pietro Marzullo, a 31-year-old elder care attendant who was driving in
the area when the disaster occurred, said he helped a woman in shock get
away moments later. “Small concrete blocks were scattered everywhere,
rolling down the street and around us,” he
said.

The national police noted that there was a “violent cloudburst” about
the time the section fell, and some witnesses said the bridge was struck
by lightning just before it collapsed, though it was not clear whether
the storm contributed to the failure.

Edoardo Rixi, the deputy transportation minister, said that [the bridge
had shown some “signs of problems” in the
past](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/world/europe/italy-genoa-bridge-collapse.html).
“A bridge like that doesn’t collapse because of a lightning bolt, or a
storm,” he said. “Those who are responsible must be found.”

Mr. Rixi said the entire bridge would be demolished, “with serious
repercussions on traffic, and problems for citizens and
companies.”

Survivors marveled that the toll was not higher.

“I saw the bridge collapse in front of my eyes; the debris from the
collapse landed 20 meters away from my car,” Davide Ricci, who was
driving nearby along the bank of the Polcevera River, [told the Genoese
newspaper Il Secolo
XIX](http://www.ilsecoloxix.it/p/genova/2018/08/14/ADAu8O9-crollo_morandi_testimonianze.shtml).
“It felt as if electricity was traveling from above downward, as if one
of the beams had been struck by lightning.”

One motorist, Corrado Cusano, told the Italian channel Rai News that he
had just driven across the bridge when “I turned around and saw the
bridge collapsing.”

“We were stuck in traffic,” he said. “There was a long line of cars, and
I only saw the bridge collapsing behind me and then I couldn’t see any
cars
anymore.”

Firefighters with rescue baskets were hoisted by cranes onto the piled
wreckage to pull people from the rubble. Others loaded the injured into
paramedic helicopters, or picked their way across the mounds of debris
with dogs trained to sniff and listen for people.

Still [others used power

“I drive on that bridge four times a day and I know that they do

The span is known as the Morandi Bridge, for the engineer who designed
it, [Riccardo Morandi](https://www.archinform.net/arch/1096.htm), who
died in 1989. Like many of his signature structures, the bridge, which
opened in 1967, was built of reinforced concrete. Local news media
reported that it had been under repair, though the nature of that work
was not immediately clear.

“It was a bold structure, designed for a volume of traffic that was much
lower than it is today,” said Diego Zoppi, a Genoese architect. The
bridge, he said, required constant maintenance because it was an
essential traffic hub for the city, connecting Genoa’s eastern and
western suburbs with highways to major cities in the north, like
Milan.

Mr. Morandi designed several major bridges using similar designs and
materials, primarily in Italy but also in Libya, Colombia, Ecuador and
elsewhere.

Giacomo Giampedrone, a councilor for civil protection and infrastructure
in Liguria, the region that includes Genoa, said in a telephone
interview that the bridge and its maintenance were the responsibility of
[Autostrade per l’Italia](https://www.autostrade.it/en/home), a highway
operator controlled by Atlantia, an Italian holding company whose main
shareholder is the Benetton family.

Autostrade per l’Italia and Atlantia did not respond to emails
requesting comment, and their media offices were closed on Tuesday.
Atlantia shares fell by 5.39 percent on the Milan stock market on
Tuesday.

Autostrade’s director for the area of Genoa, Stefano Marigliani, told
the Italian news agency ANSA that the collapse of the bridge “was
unexpected and sudden with respect to the monitoring that the bridge was
subject to.”

“There was no forewarning,” he said.

The bridge carried the A10 highway — a major east-west artery through
the port city that extends west along the coastline to the border with
France — across the Polcevera River. It was one of two just major
highway bridges that span that waterway, in the western part of the
city, and officials warned that the loss of the crossing could
significantly affect the movement of people and goods.

The impact of the collapse “will be devastating for the local economy,”
and the city would be paralyzed for years, said Enrico Musso, an
economics professor at the University of Genoa, and a center-right
politician. A long contested project to build a new highway had only
recently been approved after years of fierce debate, in part because of
concerns about the Morandi Bridge had intensified. “We knew it was not
eternal,” Mr. Musso said.

As night fell, the only audible sound was that of rescue workers
drilling through the concrete blocks to look for more vehicles buried
under the rubble, illuminated by large rescue lights.
