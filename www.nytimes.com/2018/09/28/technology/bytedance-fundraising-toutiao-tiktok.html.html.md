HONG KONG — In the United States, the fortunes of giant social media
companies such as Facebook and Twitter have wobbled as they have been
blamed for abetting abusive discourse and hosting malicious political
influence campaigns.

But in China, the titans of social media are still getting bigger and
richer.

Bytedance, the creator of the news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, the
video-sharing service Tik Tok and a fleet of other entertainment apps,
is in discussions to raise new funding that would value the business at
$75 billion, according to people familiar with the matter who requested
anonymity to discuss confidential talks.

The Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is among the investors involved in
the talks, one of these people said.

A $75 billion valuation would make Bytedance one of the world’s most
valuable private tech companies — Uber was [recently valued at $76
billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/technology/uber-toyota-partnership.html).
It would also give Bytedance financial heft comparable to that of some
publicly traded high-tech leaders. Baidu, maker of China’s dominant
search engine, has a market capitalization of around $80 billion.

A spokeswoman for Bytedance declined to comment. The talks with SoftBank
were reported earlier by The Information.

In the six years since the company’s founding, Bytedance’s apps have
become a major draw for users — and advertisers — in the world’s largest
online population. And the company wants to conquer phone screens far
beyond China, too.

Last year, [it bought
Musical.ly](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/business/dealbook/musically-sold-app-video.html),
a video-based social network popular with teenagers in the United States
and Europe, and folded it into Tik Tok. Musical.ly had been notable for
being one of the rare Chinese social media companies [to have attracted
a significant following outside
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/technology/china-homegrown-internet-companies-rest-of-the-world.html).

Today, half a billion people worldwide use either Tik Tok or its Chinese
edition, Douyin, every month, Bytedance says. By comparison, Instagram,
where short, homemade videos are also a major draw, has more than a
billion users.

Coming from China, where the government maintains strict and
ever-changing controls on information, Bytedance has weathered unique
turbulence as it has grown. Last year, the company had to suspend
updates to its news app Toutiao after China’s internet regulator accused
it of spreading unsavory material. This April, a Bytedance app for
sharing bawdy jokes and videos was [ordered offline
entirely](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/technology/china-toutiao-bytedance-censor.html).

The authorities in Indonesia briefly banned Tik Tok this year for
hosting “negative” content.

Zhang Yiming, Bytedance’s founder and chief executive, offered a display
of contrition after the joke app, Neihan Duanzi, [was
shuttered](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/business/china-bytedance-duanzi-censor.html).
He apologized for the company’s failure to respect “core socialist
values,” and thanked China’s government for enabling tech start-ups’
rapid development.

Mr. Zhang also said that Bytedance would expand its team for monitoring
content to 10,000 people from 6,000.
