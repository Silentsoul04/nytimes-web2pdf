LONDON — It had been billed as a civil rights march to redress
long-festering hurts, one among many that freckled Europe in the heady
days a half-century ago when the streets from Paris to
[Prague](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/20/world/europe/prague-spring-communism.html)
became arenas of revolt.

But that particular protest in Northern Ireland on Oct. 5, 1968,
signaled the beginning of something that endured for three decades,
seeding an insurgency that became known with weary understatement as the
Troubles.

From then until a settlement known as [the Good Friday
Agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/11/world/irish-accord-overview-irish-talks-produce-accord-stop-decades-bloodshed-with.html)
was signed in 1998, some 3,600 people died in conflict that had all the
appearances of civil war, with roadblocks and bomb blasts, sniper fire
and the suspension of civil rights.

The British authorities deployed the army against their own citizens in
a province that had been carved out as a Protestant enclave at the
partition of Ireland in 1921. Protest drawing on centuries of
disaffection turned to armed revolt spearheaded by the underground Irish
Republican Army and its political wing, Sinn Fein, which cast themselves
as the most radical champions of an aggrieved Roman Catholic minority.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the same time, loyalist paramilitary groups challenged the I.R.A.,
supposedly to protect a Protestant majority, fearful that any dilution
of the bond with Britain might destroy its power and identity. Their
activities injected one more element of violence into a war of many
dimensions.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The conflict was not confined to the six counties that make up Northern
Ireland. The I.R.A. drew significant support from groups as disparate as
Irish-Americans in the United States and the Libyan dictator Muammar
el-Qaddafi, who supplied significant amounts of arms and powerful
explosives.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The bombings spread to the rest of Britain, targeting senior figures
including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Mortars were fired at 10
Downing Street, the prime minister’s official residence and office, and
at Heathrow Airport outside London. British troops hunted down I.R.A.
members as far afield as Gibraltar.

Even today, 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement brought a form of
peace, low-level violence persists. Quasi-tribal [divisions are
preserved in huge
murals](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/12/world/belfast-journal-murals-of-troubles-draw-passions-and-tourists.html)
on the gable ends of rowhouses, depicting each side’s heroes. A shared
executive authority, set up as part of the 1998 accord, [has been
suspended](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/world/europe/northern-ireland-stormont-adams.html)
since January 2017, because of intractable disputes between the main
players — largely Protestant unionists seeking continued ties to Britain
and mainly Catholic nationalists pressing for a united Ireland free of
British control.

The Good Friday pact “cooled things down a bit,” said Paul Bew, a
leading historian and emeritus professor at Queen’s University in
Belfast. “But if you are talking about a shared view of history, in
therapy terms it’s like an agreement between a husband and wife who
still can’t stand each other but have to find a way to live
together.”

Most ominously, the Northern Irish issue that preoccupied six British
prime ministers from Harold Wilson to Tony Blair has interposed itself
anew into the halting negotiations on [Britain’s withdrawal from the
European
Union](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/05/world/europe/brexit-northern-ireland-ireland.html),
expected to happen in just six months.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the time of the Good Friday pact, Britain and Ireland were both
members of the European Union, meaning that they could largely dismantle
[the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>border between Ireland and
Northern
Ireland](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/world/europe/a-question-lingers-on-the-irish-british-border-whats-next.html)
in line with the bloc’s commitment to the free passage of goods,
services and people among member nations. But a chaotic British
withdrawal could scuttle that arrangement.

A so-called hard border would “require infrastructure that will damage
economic and social ties along the border,” said Edward Burke, an
international politics professor at Nottingham University in England who
has written a book on the British Army’s campaign in Northern Ireland.
“All the artfully created foundations of the agreement will be
damaged.”

Such weighty considerations might have seemed remote on Oct. 5, 1968,
though the harbingers of deepening division and rival narratives were
already plain enough. Even the geography of the protest reflected the
schism: Unionists called the town where the march took place
Londonderry; nationalists called it Derry. Merely using the wrong term
in the wrong place would invite hostility in the battle of emblems and
perceptions that suffused and sustained the
Troubles.

[Some neighborhoods still remain
segregated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/europe/belfast-catholics-protestants-cantrell-close.html)
by so-called peace walls as high as 45 feet that keep mutually inimical
communities apart.

“I think the Troubles cast a huge shadow today,” said Susan McKay, an
author, journalist and documentary filmmaker from Londonderry. “The
reality is that the areas from which a lot of the Troubles emanated —
the poorest and most deprived parts of Northern Ireland — are still the
poorest and most deprived parts of Northern Ireland. The children and
grandchildren of those who participated in the Troubles the most are
still scarred by them today.”

Fifty years ago, hundreds of nationalist protesters gathered on Duke
Street in Londonderry. Their demonstration, organized by the Northern
Ireland Civil Rights Association — inspired in part by the civil rights
movement in the United States — had been outlawed when unionist
opponents announced plans for a rival march. The organizers resolved to
protest anyhow, fired by a long-simmering discontent with what was
perceived as widespread discrimination.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Suddenly, the terms of battle shifted. Officers from the
Protestant-dominated police force — the Royal Ulster Constabulary —
surrounded the demonstrators with batons drawn, cutting off lines of
retreat. A water cannon sprayed the crowd.

One protester, Deirdre O’Doherty, told the BBC that she fled into a cafe
as “police battered people left, right and center.” One officer burst in
“with a baton in his hand with the blood dripping off it,” she said. “He
was young. He looked vicious. I never saw a face with so much hatred in
my life.”

As the strife deepened, the British Army was deployed.

In time, as the Troubles burgeoned, so, too, did the competing versions
of what lay behind them. For many in Britain, who became stoically
inured to the threat of I.R.A. bombings, it was about suppressing
terrorism. For nationalists, it was a broader fight to throw off the
yoke of colonialism and foreign oppression.

Northern Ireland’s heroes were often its martyrs. On Jan. 30, 1972,
thousands of marchers, most of them Catholics, took to the streets of
the Bogside district of Londonderry to display opposition to the new
policy of internment without trial. British soldiers opened fire,
killing 14 protesters, all of them
Catholic.

The events became known as Bloody Sunday. An official British apology
did not come until 2010, when Prime Minister David Cameron described the
killings as “[both unjustified and
unjustifiable](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/world/europe/16nireland.html).”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Like other turning points in the Troubles, and in the propaganda war
that was one of the era’s most striking features, “Bloody Sunday” became
woven into the republican narrative, offsetting accusations that the
I.R.A. was far more brutal in its tactics than the British Army.

The chronology of the Troubles offers a tally of bloody episodes leading
to yet more carnage in a murky underground war of spies, hit men,
summary executions and still unexplained disappearances.

In less than two weeks in March 1988, for instance, British Special
Forces operatives killed three I.R.A. members in Gibraltar. When their
funerals were held in Belfast’s Milltown Cemetery, a lone extremist from
the loyalist side, Michael Stone, attacked the ceremony with pistols and
grenades, killing three mourners — one of them an I.R.A. supporter — in
front of camera crews, photographers and journalists covering the
burial. Three days later, I.R.A. operatives seized two nonuniformed
British Army corporals mistaken for loyalist gunmen at the funeral of
one of those killed in Milltown Cemetery. The soldiers were beaten and
shot to
death.

Sometimes, the I.R.A. offered warnings of its intention to detonate
explosives in Britain. In 1993, the group told the police that it
planned to detonate [a bomb<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>in
London’s financial
district](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/world/1-dead-40-hurt-as-a-blast-rips-central-london.html),
but the explosion killed a news photographer and injured some 40 people.

But the campaign was not fought exclusively with bombs and bullets. In
1981, Bobby Sands, a jailed I.R.A. commander sentenced on firearms
charges, drew global attention to a hunger strike by inmates in response
to the withdrawal of their special status within the prison system.
Already, by virtue of a since-repealed law that permitted prisoners to
stand as electoral candidates, Mr. Sands had been voted into the British
Parliament.

After 66 days without food, he died at the age of 27. [His
death](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/05/world/sands-dies-in-northern-ireland-jail-on-the-66th-day-of-hunger-strike.html)
drew broad international criticism of the British government for its
handling of the hunger strike.

But Mrs. Thatcher, the prime minister at the time, remained resolute.
“Mr. Sands was a convicted criminal,” she told Parliament in London.
“He chose to take his own life. It was a choice that his organization
did not allow to many of its victims.” Her remark was oddly prophetic.

In 1984, a long-delay time bomb in [a hotel in Brighton,
England](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/13/world/ira-says-it-set-bomb-that-ripped-thatcher-s-hotel.html),
exploded as Mrs. Thatcher, its principal target, and many members of her
Conservative Party elite were there for an annual conference. Mrs.
Thatcher escaped unhurt, but five people were killed.

“Today we were unlucky,” the I.R.A. said in a statement, “but remember
we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always. Give
Ireland peace and there will be no more war.”

It was a reminder of the essentially asymmetric nature of a conflict
that pitted a NATO army against insurgents and irregulars fueled by
competing visions of destiny that have endured far beyond the formal
silencing of their weapons.

Decades later, the Troubles “are so burned into our lives that they are
part of our DNA,” said Monica McWilliams, a former civil rights marcher,
peace activist and feminist leader. “They are with us every day —
especially those of us who were bereaved. It’s a festering sore, because
it’s never been dealt
with.”
