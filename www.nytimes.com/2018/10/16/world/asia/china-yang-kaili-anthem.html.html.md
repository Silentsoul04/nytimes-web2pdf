HONG KONG — Clad in a furry, antler-shaped headband and denim overalls,
the young woman smiled at the camera, waved her arms in the air as if
conducting an orchestra and belted out a garbled snippet of “March of
the Volunteers,” the national anthem of China.

It seemed to be a lighthearted moment. But the police in China saw it
differently. The woman, Yang Kaili, 20, a Chinese live-streaming star
with tens of millions of followers, was detained for five days for
singing the national anthem in a “disrespectful” manner while
broadcasting live.

In a
[statement](https://www.weibo.com/1589614077/GDMdawDuo?from=page_1001061589614077_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime)
posted over the weekend on the microblogging platform Weibo, the police
in the Jing’an district of Shanghai described Ms. Yang’s behavior as “an
insult to the dignity of the national anthem which repelled internet
users.”

According to the police, Ms. Yang was detained under China’s National
Anthem Law, [implemented last
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/asia/china-hong-kong-national-anthem.html),
which threatens up to three years of detention for people who disrespect
the anthem.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In previous live broadcasts, Ms. Yang could often be seen dancing and
singing along to saccharine pop songs. In a sign of the booming
popularity of China’s live-streaming industry, last month Ms. Yang was
even invited to perform on a televised variety show on CCTV, the
state-run broadcaster.

Following the incident, the Chinese live-streaming platform Huya deleted
Ms. Yang’s account and took her videos offline. And in what has become
something of a rite of passage for Chinese celebrities who fall afoul of
the law, Ms. Yang issued two self-critical statements on [her official
Weibo
account](https://www.weibo.com/5195037706/GDaRg9k1k?from=page_1005055195037706_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime),
apologizing for her “stupid, low-level mistakes.”

“I sincerely apologize for the fact that I did not sing the national
anthem in the live broadcast in a serious manner,” she wrote. “My
behavior deeply hurt everyone’s feelings. Sorry. Sorry to the
motherland, sorry to my fans, sorry to everyone online, sorry to the
platform.”

Ms. Yang said she would “stop all live broadcasting work, carry out
self-reformation, painstakingly deepen reflection, fully accept
ideological politics and patriotic education and diligently study the
relevant laws and regulations of the National Anthem Law of the People’s
Republic of China.” Ms. Yang said she would also watch patriotic
propaganda films and participate in volunteer activities.

Earlier this month, Fan Bingbing, China’s most famous actress, also
apologized on Weibo after [being fined nearly $70
million](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/world/asia/fan-bingbing-tax-evasion-china.html)
in unpaid taxes and penalties. In her statement, she said she owed her
success to the policies of the ruling Communist Party.

The Yang incident comes at a time when the Chinese government, under
President Xi Jinping, has stepped up demands for patriotic devotion even
in areas of life that are typically seen as apolitical. Last year, for
example, a large number of Chinese celebrity gossip blogs were [taken
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/world/asia/china-celebrity-news-wechat.html)
as part of the Communist Party’s push to spread “positive energy” and
“socialist core values.”

In mainland China, where nationalistic sentiment runs high and space for
public debate is shrinking, there has been little discussion of the
National Anthem Law since its implementation.

By contrast, conduct surrounding the national anthem has been a subject
of heated debate in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city with broad
protections for freedom of speech. Amid discontent with what many
residents see as Beijing’s growing influence in the former British
colony, some spectators have taken to [booing and catcalling the
anthem](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/asia/hong-kong-china-national-anthem-protest.html)
when it is played before soccer matches in Hong Kong.

Last year, the National People’s Congress in Beijing, China’s
rubber-stamp legislature, demanded that Hong Kong adopt the National
Anthem Law. But the law has yet to be enacted in Hong Kong, which
retains a degree of legal autonomy from the mainland under a framework
known as “one country, two systems.” As a result, spectators have
continued to boo the anthem without being punished, most recently at a
[soccer match between Hong Kong and
Thailand](https://www.scmp.com/sport/hong-kong/article/2168186/hong-kong-beaten-thailand-bumpy-start-gary-whites-tenure-national)
last week.
