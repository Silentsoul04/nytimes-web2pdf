ROSSLYN, Va. — Speaking last month at a Washington think tank, Rushan
Abbas relayed tales of suffering she had heard about China’s repression
of [ethnic Uighur
Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/weekinreview/12wong.html) —
including the detention of members of her husband’s family in a
[widespread system of mass internment
camps](https://jamestown.org/program/evidence-for-chinas-political-re-education-campaign-in-xinjiang/).

Within six days, Ms. Abbas’s ailing sister and 64-year-old aunt
disappeared from their homes in northwest China. No family members or
neighbors have heard from them in more than a month.

Ms. Abbas is an American citizen and Virginia resident; her sister has
two daughters, and both live in the United States. They all assume the
women are [being detained in the
camps](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/opinion/china-re-education-camps.html),
which Western analysts estimate hold up to one million people.

Ms. Abbas said they had fallen victim to [the
persecution](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/world/asia/dodging-chinese-police-in-kashgar-a-silk-road-oasis-town.html)
against which she had been campaigning — and because of her.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m exercising my rights under the U.S. Constitution as an American
citizen,” Ms. Abbas, a business consultant, said from her 12th-floor
office in Rosslyn, Va., overlooking the Key Bridge and Potomac River.
“They shouldn’t punish my family members for this.”

“I hope the Chinese ambassador here reads this,” she added, wiping away
tears. “I will not stop. I will be everywhere and speak on this at every
event from now on.”

Ms. Abbas, 50, is among a growing number of Uighur Americans who have
had family members detained by the Chinese police and placed in the
[anti-Islam camp
system](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/world/asia/china-muslim-camps-xinjiang-uighurs.html)
that is spread [across the northwest region of
Xinjiang](https://supchina.com/2018/08/22/xinjiang-explainer-chinas-reeducation-camps-for-a-million-muslims).
Chinese officials describe the internment as “transformation through
education” and [“vocational
education.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/world/asia/china-muslim-camps-xinjiang-uighurs.html)

The Washington area has the largest population of Uighurs in the United
States, so stories like that of Ms. Abbas are now common here. Chinese
officers aim to silence Uighurs abroad by detaining their family
members.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But that tactic is backfiring. Although some Uighurs abroad are afraid
to speak out for fear that relatives in Xinjiang will be detained, Ms.
Abbas said, there are ones like her who are more willing to voice their
outrage.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Those in Washington could sway United States policy toward China, at a
time when officials are debating a much tougher stand [on defending
Uighurs](http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/how-should-world-respond-intensifying-repression-xinjiang).
Some like Ms. Abbas have acquaintances at think tanks, including at the
conservative Hudson Institute, where she spoke on Sept. 5, and in
Congress and the White House. Ms. Abbas has also spoken to staff members
at the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which is led by
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Representative
Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey.

“Harassing the relatives of U.S. citizens is what Chairman Mao used to
call dropping a rock on your own feet,” said [Michael
Pillsbury](https://www.hudson.org/experts/724-michael-pillsbury),
director for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute, noting that
repression of Uighurs would also erode relations between China and
Muslim nations.

This month, a daughter of Ms. Abbas’s detained sister wrote to Mr. Rubio
about her mother’s plight. The daughter, an American citizen, lives in
Florida, Mr. Rubio’s home state. The other daughter, a legal permanent
resident, lives in Maryland. Their mother, Gulshan Abbas, 56, has severe
health problems.

Asked for comment about issues facing Uighur Americans, Mr. Rubio said,
“The long arm of the Chinese government’s domestic repression directly
impacts the broader Uighur diaspora community, including in the United
States.”

“This is unacceptable, and it takes tremendous courage for these
individuals to even come forward given the growing number of reports of
Chinese government harassment, intimidation and threats aimed at the
Chinese, Uighur and Tibetan diaspora communities living in the United
States,” Mr. Rubio added.

Mr. Rubio is pushing legislation to compel the United States to take
action on behalf of Uighurs. It says the F.B.I. and other government
agencies “should track and take steps to hold accountable” Chinese
officials who harass or threaten people from China who are American
citizens or living or studying here, including Uighurs.

Separately, officials at the White House and the State and Treasury
Departments are discussing [imposing economic sanctions on Chinese
officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/world/asia/us-china-sanctions-muslim-camps.html),
under the Global Magnitsky Act, who are involved in repression of
Uighurs.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spoken about the plight of the
Uighurs and the harassment of Uighur Americans. In April, the State
Department’s chief spokeswoman met with Gulchehra Hoja, a Uighur
American journalist for Radio Free Asia who said two dozen of her family
members had been detained in Xinjiang. Ms. Hoja [testified in
July](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8awQJ2Xnd1U) at the congressional
commission.

In a China policy speech this month, Vice President Mike Pence
[denounced China’s attempts to shape public opinion in the United
States](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-administrations-policy-toward-china/)
through coercion and other means.

[Sophie Richardson](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sophie-richardson),
China director at Human Rights Watch, said, “Beijing’s harassment now
factors into whether citizens of countries like Australia and the United
States feel safe enough to attend public discussions about Xinjiang at
events ranging from congressional hearings in Washington or think tank
talks in Sydney.”

“Ending abuses in Xinjiang now depends in part on ensuring that these
communities are safe to exercise their rights around the world, and on
governments following Germany’s and Sweden’s lead and committing to not
sending Uighur asylum seekers back to China,” she said.

Ferkat Jawdat, a Uighur and American citizen who lives in Chantilly,
Va., last spoke to his mother in February. She was forced to stay in
Xinjiang when he and his siblings came to the United States in 2011
because the Chinese authorities would not give her a passport. She told
him in February that she feared she was going to be put in a camp; Mr.
Jawdat has not been able to reach her since.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Representative Barbara Comstock, Republican of Virginia, pressed Mr.
Jawdat’s case in an Oct. 3 letter to China’s ambassador to the United
States, Cui Tiankai. It asked why Mr. Jawdat’s missing mother,
Minaiwaier Tuersun, “has been imprisoned, why the Chinese government
refused to issue her a passport in 2011, and when she will be released.”

There has been no response from the Chinese embassy, Mr. Jawdat said.

The youngest of four children of a prominent biologist and a doctor, Ms.
Abbas grew up in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, and attended a
university there. She has lived in the United States since May 1989,
when she came as a visiting scholar to Washington State University. She
got a master’s degree in plant pathology there and became an American
citizen in 1995.

Ms. Abbas has been active in Uighur issues for decades. She joined Radio
Free Asia in Washington in 1998 as its first Uighur reporter before
moving to California. She worked as an interpreter for the Defense
Department when it [detained 22 Uighurs in Guantánamo
Bay](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/us/us-frees-last-of-uighur-detainees-from-guantanamo.html),
then [helped with their
relocations](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/world/americas/15uighur.html)
to other countries. She moved back to Washington in 2009 to be an
advocate for Uighurs.

She said she waited one month before speaking to a journalist about the
simultaneous disappearances of her sister and her aunt, Mayinur Abliz,
in the hopes that officials would release them. Now she sees a dark
future for them unless she speaks out.

She plans to mention them at a talk she is scheduled to give on Friday
at Indiana University.

“China needs to respect international laws,” Ms. Abbas said. “This is so
childish, what they’re doing — taking hostage the family members of
someone who left when she was 21.”
