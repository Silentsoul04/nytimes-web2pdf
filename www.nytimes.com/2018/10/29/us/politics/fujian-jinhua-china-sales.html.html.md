WASHINGTON — The United States said on Monday that it would block a
Chinese state-owned technology company from buying American components
because it posed a national security threat, the latest volley in an
[escalating
dispute](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/us/politics/trump-china-trade-war.html)
between the world’s two largest economies.

The company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a manufacturer of
semiconductors, “poses a significant risk” of becoming involved in
activities that might infringe on national security, the [Commerce
Department
said](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2018/10/addition-fujian-jinhua-integrated-circuit-company-ltd-jinhua-entity-list).

\[*Behind accusations that Fujian Jinhua* [*was stealing American
technology*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html)
*to power China’s future.*\]

The move could cripple Jinhua, which relies on American components for
its semiconductors, and followed similar action taken by the Commerce
Department this year to [block sales of components to
ZTE](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/technology/chinese-tech-company-blocked-from-buying-american-components.html?module=inline),
a Chinese telecom company. The ZTE ban was rescinded after President
Trump — [responding to a
request](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/trump-vows-to-save-jobs-at-chinas-zte-lost-after-us-sanctions.html)
from President Xi Jinping of China in May — asked the department to
lighten the penalty. ZTE agreed to pay a large fine, reshuffle its
leadership and undergo compliance monitoring by the United States.

But relations between the United States and China have worsened since
then, and the Trump administration is taking an increasingly hard line
on transactions involving Chinese entities. It is eager to prevent
China’s ascendance as an economic and technological powerhouse and has
begun aggressively scrutinizing foreign deals to prevent Beijing from
gaining access to valuable American intellectual property.

This month, the Treasury Department [outlined how it would
use](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/business/us-china-investment-cfius.html)
new powers that allow the United States to review a wider range of
foreign transactions, including those in sensitive industries like
technology and telecommunications.

“When a foreign company engages in activity contrary to our national
security interests, we will take strong action to protect our national
security,” said Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary. “Placing Jinhua on
the entity list will limit its ability to threaten the supply chain for
essential components in our military systems.”

Jinhua has been on the [Trump administration’s
radar](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html)
for several months. Micron Technology, a computer memory company in
Idaho, accused Jinhua last year of stealing intellectual property. In
July, Micron was barred from selling some of its products in China after
Jinhua and its Taiwanese partner, United Microelectronics, accused
Micron of violating their patents.

Jinhua is opening $5.7 billion factory in China’s Fujian Province and
has become increasingly ambitious in its desire to become a global
player in the memory chip business.

The United States and China have been engaged in a trade war, with Mr.
Trump imposing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and
threatening to hit all imports from China with levies. China has
responded with its own tariffs, and the two countries have exchanged
[increasingly heated
words](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/world/asia/china-trump-election-meddling.html)
in recent weeks.

The United States wants China to open its market to American businesses
and end its longstanding practice of pressuring American companies to
hand over valuable technology as a condition of doing business there.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi are expected to meet in Argentina next month at the
Group of 20 summit meeting, where they plan to discuss trade, North
Korea and other issues.

While Mr. Trump’s tariffs have proved to be unpopular with both
Republican and Democratic lawmakers, his efforts to stop the theft of
intellectual property have drawn praise even from his skeptics on trade.

“China’s state-owned & directed companies lie, cheat & steal at
government’s behest,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida,
said on Twitter on Monday. “Fujian Jinhua must be held accountable for
being part of that illegality. This was the right move today to protect
our tech knowledge.”
