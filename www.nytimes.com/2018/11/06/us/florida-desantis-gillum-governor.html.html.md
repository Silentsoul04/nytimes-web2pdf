TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Ron DeSantis was elected governor of Florida on
Tuesday, handing President Trump an important victory and extending the
Republican Party’s dominance in the nation’s third-largest state.

Mr. DeSantis, a 40-year-old former congressman, fended off his opponent,
Andrew Gillum, one of the strongest candidates Florida Democrats had
fielded in years. Republicans have now won every election for governor
since 1998.

“Every two years there’s one day in November where elites don’t call the
shots, don’t craft the narrative or set the agenda,” Mr. DeSantis told
jubilant supporters festooned in confetti in an Orlando hotel ballroom
late on Tuesday night. “On Election Day, it’s the voice of the people
that rules.”

He thanked President Trump for standing by him “when it wasn’t
necessarily the smart thing to do.”

“I think you are going to get tired of me calling you asking you for
things for Florida,” Mr. DeSantis told the president from afar.

Mr. DeSantis pledged to choose “constitutionalist” judges — he will get
to name replacements in January to three liberal-leaning justices who
are term-limited on the State Supreme Court — fight toxic algae blooms,
protect military veterans and keep scholarships for low-income students
to attend private schools.

Mr. Gillum conceded the race at around 11 p.m. after running behind most
of the night. “We could not be prouder of the way we ran this race,” he
told supporters at Florida A\&M University. “We recognize that we didn’t
win this tonight.”

In an emotional address, in which he appeared close to tears, he
apologized to those who had worked on his campaign. “I sincerely regret
that I couldn’t bring it home for you,” he said. But, he added: “Are we
going to wake up and bask in sorrow and defeat? Or are we going to get
up and reassert ourselves at the mission at hand?”

The crowd, which waited through much of the night in pouring rain, held
up phones and filmed the speech, exchanging hugs and praying. A few
supporters cried.

With Mr. DeSantis’s win, Republicans held onto the governor’s mansion
two years after Hillary Clinton seemed to open a door for Democrats by
only narrowly losing to Mr. Trump in the country’s largest battleground
state. The president may take much of the credit for Tuesday’s success:
He helped elevate Mr. DeSantis, a loyal acolyte, [during the
primary](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/us/politics/florida-governor-election.html)
and rallied twice for him in the final days of the campaign. Going into
the 2020 election, Mr. Trump can now count on a friend in Tallahassee
who will be able to exert influence over the crucial redrawing of the
state’s congressional and legislative districts after the next census.

Florida Democrats, who have now lost three consecutive elections for
governor by about one percentage point, will be left to grapple once
again with what could have been. Senator Bill Nelson, the only Democrat
elected statewide, was losing late on Tuesday to Gov. Rick Scott in a
race even tighter than the governor’s contest. Mr. Scott poured more
than $50 million of his fortune into his campaign, an eye-popping amount
that helped lift Mr. DeSantis and other Republicans down the ballot.

Democrats had [pinned their
hopes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/florida-andrew-gillum-ron-desantis-bill-nelson.html)
on Mr. Gillum, the [mayor of
Tallahassee](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/us/politics/andrew-gillum-florida-governor.html)
and a talented campaigner who upended his party’s orthodoxy and ran as a
defiant progressive instead of the more typical centrist thought to
appeal to independent voters and moderates. Mr. Gillum, who would have
become Florida’s first African-American governor, came close to
succeeding, garnering over a million votes more than Mr. Scott did in
2014. But he ultimately could not overcome the state’s inexorable
demographics: Older white voters who lean conservative vote at far
higher rates than do millennial and minority voters, whom Mr. Gillum
needed to turn out in big numbers to assemble a winning coalition.

  

The Florida story on election night in 2018 played out much as it did in
2016: Big, urban counties that lean Democratic reported a significant
lead for Mr. Gillum. But that advantage was wiped out as results rolled
in from white suburbs and exurbs in red counties, especially in the
conservative Panhandle and on the southwest coast, where Mr. Trump
campaigned last week and turnout was impressively high.

Mr. Gillum’s stunning win in the August primary overshadowed Mr.
DeSantis’s own noteworthy accomplishment: He [defeated Adam
Putnam](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/us/politics/florida-arizona-election-results.html),
the state agriculture commissioner, by an astonishing 20 percentage
points. Mr. Putnam had seemed a lock for the Republican nomination
before Mr. Trump stepped in for Mr. DeSantis, an Ivy League graduate and
former Navy legal officer at Guantánamo Bay and in Iraq who gained a
national audience by vigorously defending the president in frequent Fox
News appearances.

Still, Mr. DeSantis stumbled early on in the general election, starting
the day after the primary, when he went on Fox News lauding Florida’s
economic success under a Republican administration and warned that
electing Mr. Gillum could “monkey this up,” a phrase [seen by many as a
racist dog
whistle](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/us/politics/desantis-monkey-up-gillum.html).
Mr. DeSantis denied any racial intent in his comment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After effectively losing the month of September to various
controversies, Mr. DeSantis [eventually
regrouped](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/politics/florida-desantis-governor.html),
hiring Mr. Trump’s Florida campaign manager from 2016, Susie Wiles. He
sharpened his message against Mr. Gillum, portraying him as a corrupt
radical whose proposals were out of step with the values of most
Floridians.

On Sunday, a day after Mr. Trump’s final visit, Mr. DeSantis drew
hundreds of people to a campaign rally in South Daytona, in his former
congressional district. His “secret weapon,” he said on Tuesday, was his
running mate, State Representative Jeanette Nuñez of Miami, who helped
him solidify support among Cuban-American Republicans and will become
the state’s first female Latina lieutenant governor.

Mr. DeSantis’s campaign platform, derided by Democrats as thin,
essentially came down to promising to continue on the path set by
Florida’s current governor.

“There’s a reason people move to Florida: The people who move to Florida
don’t want Florida to turn into one of those states they came from,”
said Blaise Ingoglia, the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida.
“I don’t think that resonated with independents.”

But many voters said what they found most attractive about Mr. DeSantis
was his friend in the White House.

“I voted Republican all the way,” Renee Wilson, 69, said after voting in
Palm Beach Gardens. “To defend Trump.”
