WASHINGTON — Fresh off three days of private meetings with his personal
lawyers, President Trump renewed his attacks on Thursday on the special
counsel investigation, calling it “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN
AMERICAN HISTORY\!

The barrage, launched on Twitter, ended a period of relative quiet by
the president about the investigation, which has ensnared some of his
former aides.

The president returned on Sunday from a trip to Paris and faced
[criticism at home for his
decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/us/politics/trump-macron-france.html)
to skip a solemn visit to an American cemetery in France, part of events
to mark 100 years since the end of World War I.

When he was back at the White House, Mr. Trump met with his personal
lawyers in private meetings and worked to draft answers to questions
posed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Mueller’s team
has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and any
possible ties to the Trump campaign.

For months, the president’s legal team and aides have pleaded with him
to avoid writing Twitter posts critical of Mr. Mueller, particularly as
presidents in previous administrations have respected a wall between the
White House and the Justice Department on ongoing criminal
investigations. Mr. Trump has long complained publicly and privately
about what he believes to be Mr. Mueller’s conflicts of interest,
despite a Justice Department review and conclusion last year that Mr.
Mueller had none. But by Thursday morning, the president renewed his
personal attacks on Mr. Mueller and said universities would someday
study these conflicts.

But it was unclear what may have motivated Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts on
Thursday morning.

Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, was spotted by an
ABC News crew on Monday en route to see Mr. Mueller’s team. Mr. Cohen
has pleaded guilty to a string of crimes, and said under oath that his
client ordered him to make hush payments to an adult-film actress
claiming in 2016 that she had had an affair with Mr. Trump.

Several of Mr. Trump’s former aides have struck deals with the special
counsel team in exchange for their cooperation in the investigation.
This week, [Jerome
Corsi](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/jerome-corsi-predicts-indictment.html),
a friend of [Roger J. Stone
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/us/politics/roger-stone-trump-campaign-mueller-wikileaks.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer),
a longtime informal adviser to the president, announced that he expected
to be charged with lying to federal investigators after two months of
cooperation with the special counsel team.

Mr. Mueller, whose appointment did not require approval from the Senate,
has sought to ask the president about any possible coordination with
Russia during the campaign and [whether he intended to
obstruct](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/us/politics/trump-tweets-mueller-obstruction.html)
the
[investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/20/us/politics/russia-interference-election-trump-clinton.html).

The special counsel team has negotiated over a possible presidential
interview for nearly a year. After months of back-and-forth with the
president’s personal lawyers, Mr. Mueller’s team [agreed to
accept](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/mueller-trump-russia-investigation.html)
answers in writing about possible conspiracy with Russia. On obstruction
matters, investigators acknowledged that issues of executive privilege
could complicate the prospect of an interview, but they did not abandon
pursuit of it.

The president’s lawyers are said to believe that the special counsel
investigation is winding down, though Mr. Mueller’s team has given no
public indication about its timeline.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers have blanched at the idea of the president sitting
down and being interviewed by Mr. Mueller and his team out of
[concern](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/us/politics/trump-lawyers-special-counsel-interview.html)
that the president might make a false statement. Lying to federal
investigators is a
[felony](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001) that could
carry up to five years in prison.

Mr. Trump’s comments on Thursday renewed concerns on Capitol Hill that
the president could move to fire Mr. Mueller and end his investigation.

Democrats and a handful of Republicans are pushing for Congress to vote
before the end of their session next month on legislation providing [job
protections to special
counsels](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/us/politics/mueller-special-counsel-legislation-senate.html)
like Mr. Mueller.

Two lawmakers — Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who is
retiring at the end of the year, and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of
Delaware — attempted to push through the bill on Wednesday, but they
were blocked by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the
majority leader, who said he had never heard Mr. Trump say he wanted to
shut down the investigation. On Thursday, Mr. Flake and Mr. Coons
pledged to continue asking for the Senate to consider the proposal until
Mr. McConnell agreed to allow a vote.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, joined the
effort on Thursday morning, asserting that Mr. McConnell was in denial
about Mr. Trump’s intentions.

“There is too much at stake to sit around and wait until the president
crosses the line, creating the constitutional crisis we all abhor,” Mr.
Schumer said.

Mr. Trump has previously sought to fire Mr. Mueller. In June 2017, [Mr.
Trump told the White House
counsel](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html)
to take steps to remove Mr. Mueller because of the perceived conflicts.
Mr. Trump cited a dispute with Mr. Mueller several years ago about golf
fees at a Trump golf club in Virginia where Mr. Mueller was a member;
Mr. Mueller’s interview with Mr. Trump to return to his old job as
F.B.I. director, which occurred the day before he was appointed special
counsel; and Mr. Mueller’s work for a law firm that previously
represented Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The White House
counsel refused, and the president dropped the issue.

Mr. Trump has focused his ire on a several prosecutors working for Mr.
Mueller, but the special counsel’s team is broader. It includes F.B.I.
agents working under Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director chosen by
the president, and other Justice Department officials.

As the president has renewed his offensive on Mr. Mueller, critics of
his administration argue that Mr. Trump’s recent appointment to lead the
Justice Department and oversee the Russia investigation has conflicts of
interest of his own.

When Mr. Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week, he named
a loyalist, [Matthew G.
Whitaker](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/mueller-investigation-matt-whitaker.html),
to replace him in an acting capacity. Mr. Whitaker has been publicly
critical of the Mueller inquiry but now has oversight of the special
counsel.
