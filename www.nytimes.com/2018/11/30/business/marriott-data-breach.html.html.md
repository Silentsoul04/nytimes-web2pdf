The hotel chain asked guests checking in for a treasure trove of
personal information: credit cards, addresses and sometimes passport
numbers. On Friday, consumers learned the risk. Marriott International
revealed that hackers had breached its Starwood reservation system and
had stolen the personal data of up to 500 million guests.

The assault started as far back as 2014, and was one of the largest
known thefts of personal records, second only to a [2013 breach of
Yahoo](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/technology/yahoo-hack-3-billion-users.html)
that affected three billion user accounts and larger than a 2017 episode
[involving the credit bureau
Equifax](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/business/equifax-hack-what-we-know.html).

The intrusion was a reminder that after years of headline-grabbing
attacks, the computer networks of big companies are still vulnerable.

The Starwood attack happened roughly the same time as a number of other
breaches at American health insurers and government agencies, including
the United States Office of Personnel Management, in what security
research firms and government officials described as an effort to
compile a vast database of personal information on potential espionage
targets.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Experts don’t know if the Starwood attack was connected to those other
episodes. But Starwood’s data has not popped up on the so-called dark
web, according to Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm, and Coalition,
a cyber insurance provider, which suggested that the hotel attackers
weren’t looking to sell what they took.

“Usually when stolen data doesn’t appear, it’s a state actor collecting
it for intelligence purposes,” said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity
expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.

The breach hit customers who made reservations for the Marriott-owned
Starwood hotel brands from 2014 to September 2018. The properties
include Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis, Four Points, Aloft, Le
Méridien, Tribute, Design Hotels, Element and the Luxury Collection.

Marriott hotels, including Residence Inn and the Ritz-Carlton, operate
on a separate reservation system. The company has plans to merge that
system with Starwood’s.

The names, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, email addresses and
encrypted credit card details of hotel customers were stolen. The travel
histories and passport numbers of a smaller group of guests were also
taken.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Marriott said it had set up a [dedicated
website](https://info.starwoodhotels.com/) and call center to deal with
guests and said it would try to reach affected customers on Friday to
inform them of the breach. The site was having problems staying online
shortly after the attack was announced.

The company is offering one year of free enrollment in a service called
Web Watcher to people who live in the United States, Canada and Britain.
Marriott described it as a service that keeps an eye on websites where
thieves swap and sell personal information and then alerts people if
anyone is selling their information.

“We deeply regret this incident,” Arne Sorenson, Marriott’s president
and chief executive, said [in a
statement](http://news.marriott.com/2018/11/marriott-announces-starwood-guest-reservation-database-security-incident/).
“We fell short of what our guests deserve and what we expect of
ourselves.”

The intrusion went unnoticed for four years by Starwood, which was
acquired by Marriott in 2016 for $13.6 billion. It was uncovered in
early September, when a security tool alerted Marriott officials to an
unauthorized attempt to access Starwood’s guest reservation database.
The alert prompted Marriott to work with outside security experts, who
discovered that the hackers had grabbed a foothold in Starwood’s systems
starting in
2014.

## After Marriott Breach, How to Protect Your Information Online

There are more reasons than ever to protect your personal information,
as major website breaches become ever more frequent.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Nov. 19, digital forensics experts uncovered the full scope of the
attack. It was the second major security breach Starwood has reported.
Its cash register systems were penetrated in 2015.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that it was
aware of the breach and was tracking the situation. It added that any
suspected instances of identity theft should be reported to the F.B.I.’s
Internet Crime Complaint Center at
[www.ic3.gov](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ic3.gov&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1543708313847000&usg=AFQjCNEFY6mpufQ23K8VkSByfEN0fX59Jg).

In recent years, cybersecurity experts said, the hospitality industry
has become a rich target for nation-state hackers looking to track the
travel movements and preferences of heads of states, diplomats, chief
executives and other people of interest to espionage agencies.

Going after hotel customer lists has been part of a broader effort to
obtain giant databases of information. So big, in fact, that they would
be of little use to run-of-the-mill hackers. But to a government, they
would be very useful.

That information could be fed, for example, into an [analysis program
run
by](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/china-trump-cyberespionage.html)a
country’s state security apparatus, Mr. Lewis said. Using “big data”
technology similar to what marketers use in targeted advertising, the
country could try to pinpoint the comings and going of intelligence
agents from other nations. Did they stay, for example, in the same hotel
as a potential source for that country?

The breach could get expensive for Marriott. Verizon cut what it paid to
acquire Yahoo by $350 million after the internet company reported its
breach in 2016. And Equifax reported recovery costs of $400 million from
its 2017 incident, which affected 148 million people.

Despite months of due diligence, finding out there was a major network
attack long after a deal closes is “everybody’s worst-case scenario,”
said Jake Olcott, vice president at BitSight, a computer security
ratings company in Boston.

Several lawsuits were filed against Marriott on Friday, and
investigations were announced by [New York’s attorney
general](https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1068510072396029952),
Barbara D. Underwood, and European regulators.

In Europe, where companies can be fined up to 4 percent of global
revenue under data protection laws, companies must alert government
authorities within 72 hours of a known breach.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Given the volume and sensitivity of personal data taken, and the length
of the breach, Marriott “has the potential to trigger the first hefty
G.D.P.R. fine,” said Enza Iannopollo, a security analyst with Forrester
Research, referring to the European data protection law enacted this
year.

Marriott told shareholders that it did not expect the breach would
affect the company’s long-term financial prospects. The company’s share
price was down more than 5 percent on Friday.

Marriott has also been dealing with [strikes by thousands of
workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/travel/marriott-strikes-hawaii-settle-not-an-francisco-.html)
in nine cities, as well as customer complaints about problems [with
rewards
programs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/business/marriott-hotel-reward-program-members.html)
after efforts to merge data from Starwood’s rewards program into
Marriott’s left the records of millions of customers in limbo.

Lawmakers said the episode was yet another example of why the United
States needs data privacy laws that punish companies for failing to keep
customers’ information private.

“It is past time we enact data security laws that ensure companies
account for security costs rather than making their consumers shoulder
the burden and harms resulting from these lapses,” Senator Mark R.
Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said in a statement.

Privacy advocates said there was no excuse for a breach to go unnoticed
for four years.

“They can say all they want that they take security seriously, but they
don’t if you can be hacked over a four-year period without noticing,”
said Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International, a group
that supports strong data protection laws.
