*Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times
review* [*the week’s
news*](https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology?module=inline)*,
offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important
developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?*

Wise readers\! I’m Raymond Zhong, a Times reporter in China — where, I
contend, something is unfolding right now that carries higher stakes
than any other tech story on the planet.

I know, I’m biased. But hear me out.

China detained [another Canadian
citizen](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/china-canada-huawei.html)
this week, the third to have been snatched up in the country [this
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/world/canada/china-detained-spavor-kovrig.html).
Beijing denies it, but most people in China see the detentions as
retaliation for [Canada’s arrest of Meng
Wanzhou](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/huawei-cfo-arrest-canada-extradition.html),
a top executive at the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The United States has
accused Ms. Meng of fraud, and is seeking her extradition. She remains
in Canada under [round-the-clock
surveillance](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/technology/huawei-executive-canada-bail-decision.html).

In other words, the United States and China’s contest for technological
supremacy has now left four lives hanging in the balance — hostages to
something much larger than themselves.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To recap: Huawei is the world’s leading maker of telecom network
equipment. You probably don’t ever think about this technology, but it
powers our mobile age. Which is why the United States is so nervous that
Huawei has become such a powerhouse supplier. Washington has warned for
years, without specific evidence, that Huawei’s products can be used for
spying by the Chinese government. Ms. Meng’s arrest this month was part
of a [yearslong
effort](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/huawei-meng-hsbc-canada.html)
to curb the company’s rise.

It’s an unenviable position for any company to be in — not least one,
like Huawei, that is privately owned and was [long known for
secretiveness](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/technology/meng-wanzhou-huawei-arrest.html).

In an effort at openness, Huawei this week invited me and a bunch of
other reporters to its campuses in southern China, where we toured some
research facilities and chatted with Ken Hu, the company’s deputy
chairman.

Mr. Hu reiterated points that the company has made for years as it has
come under [scrutiny around the
world](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/technology/huawei-arrest-meng-wanzhou.html).
He said that Huawei had a clean record when it came to major
cybersecurity incidents. He said that “ideological” or “geopolitical”
fears had not cost Huawei the trust of its many customers.

“Concerns about security should not be aimed without basis at any
specific company,” Mr. Hu said. He issued a challenge to governments
that raise concerns about Huawei’s products: “If you have evidence, then
make it public.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He declined to discuss the detained Canadians or Ms. Meng’s arrest.

In a way, Huawei is itself a hostage of [larger
conflicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/business/huawei-meng-arrest-travel.html).
The company has built a globally respected brand. It has won customers
by investing in research and development, providing attentive service —
and driving its employees really, really hard. ([I wrote this week about
Huawei’s intense corporate
culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/huawei-workers-iran-sanctions.html).)

Yet to the company’s fiercest critics, Huawei is tarnished simply by
being Chinese, and hence within arm’s reach of a government that
[conducts aggressive
espionage](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/china-trump-cyberespionage.html)
against American companies and government agencies. For some people in
Washington, it hardly matters that Huawei isn’t state-owned, or that the
Chinese government has never asked it to spy on its behalf. The mere
possibility is enough.

As part of this week’s visit to Huawei, we reporters were treated to a
long presentation on the company’s processes for evaluating products for
security risks. It was a barrage of details, earnestly presented, that I
suspect would have zero chance of changing the mind of anyone in
Washington about Huawei.

Here’s what else caught my eye this week:

■ My colleagues at The Times have produced [another blockbuster
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html)
full of revelations about how user data is collected and shared by giant
tech companies. [Here are five
takeaways](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/facebook-data-sharing-deals.html).

■ The Wall Street Journal [took a
look](https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-been-a-rout-apple-stumbles-in-worlds-largest-untapped-market-11545146399)
at Apple’s near-total failure to win over smartphone buyers in a giant,
fast-growing market: India. The iPhone is clinging to market share there
of around 1 percent, and the company’s revenue in India is half of what
executives once hoped for, according to The Journal’s sources. The
country simply doesn’t have enough people who are willing to pay Apple
prices.

■ Well, it was fun while it lasted. TikTok, [the quirky short video
app](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/technology/tiktok-a-chinese-video-app-brings-fun-back-to-social-media.html)
that is now [a worldwide
hit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/technology/bytedance-app-funding-china.html),
has [a Nazi
problem](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw74gy/tiktok-neo-nazis-white-supremacy),
according to Motherboard. The app’s Chinese parent company, Bytedance,
is no stranger to controversies about [gnarly content on its
platforms](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/china-toutiao-censorship.html).

■ Finally, I urge you to read this [profile of Donald E.
Knuth](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/science/donald-knuth-computers-algorithms-programming.html),
the legendary computer scientist who, for the past 50 years, has been
writing “The Art of Computer Programming” — a multivolume,
still-unspooling bible of its field.
