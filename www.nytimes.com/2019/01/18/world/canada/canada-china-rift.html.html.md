Ian Austen. Like many Canadians, I have China on my mind this week.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A little more than a year ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was
traveling to Beijing, hoping for a free trade deal. How things have
changed. Since Canada carried out an American warrant and [arrested
Huawei's chief financial
officer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/huawei-cfo-arrest-canada-extradition.html),
Meng Wanzhou, in the Vancouver airport last month, Canada seems to have
become enemy No. 1 of the Chinese government. The price has been steep
for three Canadians in particular: [Michael
Kovrig](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/world/asia/michael-kovrig-china-canada.html?module=inline)
and [Michael
Spavor](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/world/asia/michael-spavor-canadian-detained-china.html),
both detained in China and accused of threatening national security, as
well as [Robert
Schellenberg](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/world/asia/china-canada-schellenberg-death.html),
who was hastily retried this week for drug smuggling. His original
sentence of 15 years in prison was [replaced with the death
penalty](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/world/asia/china-canada-schellenberg-retrial.html).

*\[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week?* [*Sign up

In Canada, the sentence has been viewed as a kind of international
ransom. But I wondered how the détente has been perceived in China. I
reached out to my colleague Chris Buckley. An Australian by birth, Chris
has lived in China for more than two decades and studied Chinese
Communist Party history at Renmin University in Beijing. He joined The
Times in 2012.

**What is public opinion of Canada like in China now?**

It’s not simple. When I walk home from work at night, I pass close by
the newly opened Canada Goose store in Beijing, and there have been long
lines of people waiting to go in. On the other hand, I think that most
Chinese people accept their government’s view that Huawei is being
victimized in the West and that Meng Wanzhou was unfairly arrested in
Canada.

**How has the Schellenberg case been reported in Chinese media?**

It’s been getting attention here in China, too, though not on the same
level as it has received in Canada. The cases of Michael Kovrig and
Michael Spavor were reported in the Chinese media, mostly accounts of
their arrests and the Chinese foreign ministry’s pushback against
criticism. Robert Schellenberg’s appeal hearing and detention attracted
more media attention, using the court’s account of the trial. Throughout
all this, the Global Times, which is a brashly nationalist newspaper and
website, has led the way in criticizing the Canadian
government.

**Reporters were invited to observe the trial. Why would China do
that?**

It’s very unusual for foreign reporters to be allowed in to watch
criminal trials. I’ve never been inside a Chinese criminal trial. The
court hasn’t said exactly why it made an exception in Mr. Schellenberg’s
case. But I suspect two reasons. First, the court and government wanted
to show that he received what counts for a proper hearing in China.
Second, if Mr. Schellenberg is being used as a bargaining chip, it makes
sense for the Chinese government to publicize the trial.

**How unusual is it in China for a pending execution to be publicized?**

In heinous murders and crimes like that, the government often publicizes
executions. In a case like this — a drug smuggling case involving a
foreigner — it is much less common. This might be the Chinese government
sending a warning to potential drug traffickers, or maybe a way of
putting pressure on Canada.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What is the feeling among foreigners inside China now?**

Foreigners from Western countries, especially Canada, have been a bit
spooked by the arrests. There is certainly not a mass exit of Westerners
from China. But I think there is a subsection of people who, like
Michael Kovrig — a former diplomat who worked for a policy NGO — have a
government job background and talk to Chinese academics and officials
for their work. For them, especially, his arrest seems to have been
unnerving.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Where do you see this going?**

Ms. Meng’s fight against possible extradition to the United States could
take many months, even longer. How long it takes for Mr. Schellenberg to
work through his appeal and other means for seeking clemency depends
very much on how slow or fast the Chinese government wants to go. So for
Mr. Schellenberg this could be a long, agonizing wait. Meanwhile, Mr.
Kovrig and Mr. Spavor remain in detention and haven’t even been formally
charged with specific crimes. So I think this story will be in the news
for many months to come, and maybe longer.

## Trans Canada

—Robert Lloyd Schellenberg plans to appeal after being [sentenced to
death for drug
smuggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/world/asia/china-canada-schellenberg-retrial.html?module=inline)
this week in China, amid a deepening diplomatic rift between Canada and
China.

—The 18-year-old who fled Saudi Arabia [is ready to experience life as a

She’s less sure about the cold.

—Violent disaster footage used in the Netflix movie “Bird Box” may have
looked like realistic C.G.I. But the scenes were [real
footage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/television/bird-box-netflix-explosion.html)
from the 2013 rail explosion that killed 47 people in Lac-Mégantic,
Quebec.

—In a show of classic Canadian niceness, the country’s air traffic
controllers [sent pizza to their American
counterparts](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/world/canada/shutdown-air-traffic-controllers-pizza.html),
who are working without pay during the U.S. government shutdown.

—Now in its fifth season, [Schitt’s Creek is light, loopy and
feel-good](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/television/schitts-creek-season-5.html)
in the best possible ways, writes television critic Margaret Lyons of
the Canadian sitcom.

## Around The Times

—How is glacier loss affecting the hundreds of millions of people who
depend on them for water? [See the impact in
Kazakhstan](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/15/climate/melting-glaciers-globally.html?emc=edit_aust_20190117&amp;nl=nyt-australia&amp;nlid=6007619620190117&amp;te=1),
in stunning detail.

—An orca pod that made headlines after a mother whale carried her dead
calf for 17 days has another new baby. [This calf looks
healthy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/science/orca-calf-seattle.html)
so far — and it could be a lifeline for the group.

—It’s mid-January, and your Marie Kondo-inspired organizing efforts have
come up short. It might be time to [call on the
pros](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/smarter-living/professional-organizers-productivity-clutter.html?fallback=0&recId=1FukyvaGEjyn7aw714343SyAc60&locked=1&geoContinent=NA&geoRegion=ON&recAlloc=control&geoCountry=CA&blockId=home-living-vi&imp_id=139870849&action=click&module=Smarter%20Living&pgtype=Homepage).

—Most of the couples in the young penguin colony weren’t very promising

Sydney’s
aquarium,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/style/gay-penguins-australia.html)
