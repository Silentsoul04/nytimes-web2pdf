India has a job crisis, and the government would rather you didn’t
notice. Last month, it hastily amended the Constitution [to set aside 10
percent of all government
posts](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/the-124th-amendment-a-look-at-the-facts/article25990756.ece)
for the “economically weak.” But it defined the “economically weak” as
anybody from a household earning less than 800,000 rupees, roughly
$11,200, a year or owning a very tiny bit of land. And as the
sociologist Sonalde Desai has argued, that covers [about 95 percent of
India’s
population](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem/article25962037.ece).

A quota that includes virtually everybody means little. But the new 10
percent quota is even worse than that: It contains a caveat that
explicitly leaves out individuals belonging to India’s disadvantaged
castes, who benefit from other affirmative action measures. That’s a
little bit as if the United States government announced that it was
reserving 10 percent of government jobs for all but the richest 5
percent of Americans, and African Americans need not apply.

How did India get to this point, especially on the watch of Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, who came to power in 2014 partly on the back of
promises to create more jobs? Back then, [the manifesto of his Bharatiya
Janata
Party](https://www.bjp.org/images/pdf_2014/full_manifesto_english_07.04.2014.pdf)
had called India’s labor force “the pillar of our growth.”

According to data [released by the Labour
Bureau](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/unemployment-rate-up-at-4-9-in-2013-14-labour-bureau/articleshow/45796927.cms),
a wing of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, unemployment in 2013-14
was 4.9 percent. But an undisclosed study by the National Sample Survey
Office (NSSO), a government agency that conducts large-scale research,
has [reportedly placed the figure for 2017-18 at 6.1 percent — a 45-year
high](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/unemployment-rate-at-five-decade-high-of-6-1-in-2017-18-nsso-survey-119013100053_1.html).

Measuring employment is inherently difficult in India. One reason is
that the standard definition of what constitutes work — being in regular
employment for a certain number of hours and a regular salary — comes
from industrialized nations. Yet according to
[various](http://www.ihdindia.org/sarnet/books/IEG_2016_ES.pdf)
[reports,](https://www.ilo.org/global/publications/books/WCMS_626831/lang--en/index.htm)more
than 80 percent of Indians who are working or seeking work are in the
informal sector, many of them doing odd jobs for multiple employers.
Their activity is far more complicated for economists to measure
accurately.

Making matters worse — and fueling speculation that the unemployment
situation in India is even more dire than suspected — the government has
withheld official data about jobs. The two members of the NSSO who were
not government officials resigned this week, in protest over the
decision to not release their office’s results even though those had
been cleared for publication.

The other official source economists have traditionally turned to are
the employment statistics of the Labour Bureau. The
office<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>had been releasing this
data regularly for nearly a decade — until 2016, when the Labour
Ministry suddenly decided to[discontinue the
series](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-survey-discontinued-centre-clueless-about-unemployment-2591121).

This information blackout is uncharacteristic for India, which has been
praised, including by the Nobel Prize-winning economist [Angus
Deaton](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPA/Resources/deaton_kozel_2004.pdf),
for playing a pioneering role, globally, in statistical data collection.

Now, analysts have to rely on other sources, indirect evidence and
private studies.

The findings from those are alarming.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The [Center for Monitoring the Indian
Economy](https://www.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=warticle&dt=2018-07-17%2009:45:21&msec=123),
a well-respected business information company that collects primary data
on various aspects of the Indian economy, estimates that [the country’s
unemployment rate in December 2018 reached 7.38
percent](https://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com/)*.*

According to the “[State of Working
India 2018](https://cse.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/State_of_Working_India_2018.pdf),”
a large study conducted by the Center for Sustainable Employment at Azim
Premji University, India’s youth unemployment now stands at 16 percent.
Women hold just 16 percent of<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>jobs in the service sector. In 2011, only 13 percent of senior
officers, legislators and managers were women; by 2015, the figure had
dropped to 7 percent.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that people are hurting. Early last year,
[Indian
Railways](http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,4,1244)
advertised about 89,400 new jobs. Government posts [always are
coveted](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180601-the-jobs-in-india-that-attract-millions-of-applicants)
in India — they mean job security and a decent salary — but [more
than 23 million adults
applied](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/railways-receives-2-3-crore-applications-for-90000-advertised-jobs/articleshow/63898755.cms)
for these positions, defying all expectations. Earlier this year, the
secretariat of the government of Maharashtra, a state in west-central
India, advertised 13 waiting jobs in its canteen. There were [7,000
applicants, many of them university
graduates](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/graduates-among-7-000-who-apply-for-13-waiter-jobs-at-maharashtra-secretariat-1981639).

[India’s growth rate remains
robust](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/world-bank-forecasts-7-3-per-cent-growth-for-india-making-it-fastest-growing-economy/articleshow/64478238.cms),
but the benefits of the country’s growth have been [concentrated almost
entirely at the
top](https://www.oxfamindia.org/sites/default/files/himanshu_inequality_Inequality_report_2018.pdf),
with grim implications for the working classes and the lower-middle
classes, women and the young.

These effects aren’t just the accidental results of the government’s
decision, say, [to ban certain currency bills in
late 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/27/opinion/in-india-black-money-makes-for-bad-policy.html?_r=0&module=inline)
(which proved to be terribly
[misguided](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/opinion/india-and-the-visible-hand-of-the-market.html))
or to transform the indirect tax system into the new Goods and Services
Tax (a move in the right direction but that was poorly executed and
[hurt small
businesses](https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/a-year-after-gst-small-businesses-report-huge-drop-in-sales-struggle-with-high-costs-of-compliance/story-2NezKZ0MJ0EOxsocnavDtJ.html)).
[Inequality has
grown](https://www.oxfamindia.org/sites/default/files/himanshu_inequality_Inequality_report_2018.pdf),
in numerous ways, a recent report indicates.

The Modi government’s economic policy has been disproportionately
focused on a few big corporations, neglecting small firms and traders,
the agricultural sector and most workers. The results are now showing.

Kaushik Basu, the C. Marks Professor of International Studies and
professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser
to the Indian government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World
Bank in 2012-16.
