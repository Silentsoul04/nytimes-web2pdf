NEW DELHI — India’s government has proposed giving itself vast new
powers to suppress internet content, igniting a heated battle with
global technology giants and prompting comparisons to censorship in
China.

Under the [proposed
rules](https://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines),
Indian officials could demand that Facebook, Google, Twitter,
[TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/bytedance-fundraising-toutiao-tiktok.html)
and others remove posts or videos that they deem libelous, invasive of
privacy, hateful or deceptive. Internet companies would also have to
build automated screening tools to block Indians from seeing “unlawful
information or content.” Another provision would weaken the privacy
protections of messaging services like WhatsApp so that the authorities
could trace messages back to their original senders.

The new rules could be imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s
government anytime after the public comment period ends on Thursday
night. The administration has been eager to get them in place before the
date is set for this spring’s national elections, which will prompt
special pre-election rules limiting new policies.

Civil liberties groups and other critics said the changes would violate
constitutional protections for free speech and privacy and put India in
the same league as autocratic countries like China and Russia. Some of
them suggested that the Modi administration was rushing to adopt the
regulations so it could more easily pressure the tech platforms to
remove social media posts by political opponents in the coming election.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The proposed changes have an authoritarian bent,” said Apar Gupta,
executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights
group, which plans to challenge the rules in court if they are enacted.
“This is very similar to what China does to its citizens, where it
polices their every move and tracks their every post on social media.”

India’s proposals add to the growing resistance worldwide against
internet behemoths like Google and Facebook, which once flourished
largely unimpeded. In Europe, officials last year [enacted tough new
rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/technology/europe-gdpr-privacy.html)
to protect people’s online data, forcing the companies to change some
practices. China has long used [a system of internet
filters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/18/world/asia/china-internet.html),
known as the Great Firewall, to block content and shut out global tech
companies. And [in a 2017
review](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/technology/facebook-government-regulations.html),
The New York Times tallied more than 50 countries that had passed laws
in recent years to gain greater control over how their people use the
web.

The result may be a splintering internet, where a onetime unified
information superhighway has become increasingly restricted in certain
areas. In India, the [government has used laws to nudge people
away](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/technology/india-technology-american-giants.html)
from the American tech giants and toward [local
competitors](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/amazon-walmart-flipkart-india.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fvindu-goel&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection),
such as ShareChat, a social network that operates only in Indian
languages, and Reliance Jio, a cellphone giant bankrolled by India’s
richest man.

Mishi Choudhary, founder of SFLC.in, a legal advocacy group in New
Delhi, said Indian governments had tried for nearly a decade to exercise
more control over internet content but had been restrained by the
courts. Now the government is trying again, she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Ministers have said these companies will have to comply with Indian
rules, and Indian rules are pretty regressive,” said Ms. Choudhary,
whose group filed comments opposing the new rules. “We have Indian
morality. We have to keep law and order. And we cannot hurt religious
sentiments.”

India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, which
proposed [the online content
changes](https://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines),
has said the new rules simply build on existing laws and are necessary
to combat false and illegal information on social media. The regulations
also seek to hold foreign tech companies — including Chinese app makers
that have little presence in India now — more accountable. Companies
with more than five million Indian users would be required to set up a
local subsidiary and appoint leaders based in the country.

Ajay Sawhney, the information technology secretary, did not respond to
requests for an interview. Officials have privately suggested that they
will consider the public responses to their draft rules and make
adjustments before issuing a final version.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Working independently as well as through trade groups, Microsoft,
Facebook and dozens of other tech companies are fighting back against
the proposals. They criticized the rules as technically impractical and
said they were a sharp departure from how the rest of the world
regulates “data intermediaries,” a term for companies that host data
provided by their customers and users.

In most countries, including under India’s existing laws, such
intermediaries are given a “safe harbor.” That means they are exempted
from responsibility for illegal or inappropriate content posted on their
services, as long as they remove it once notified by a court or another
designated authority.

In a [filing with the
ministry](https://meity.gov.in/content/addendum1-comments-received-publicstakeholders-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary)
last week, Microsoft said that complying with India’s new standards
would be “impossible from the process, legal and technology point of
view.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The company — whose Hyderabad-born chief executive, Satya Nadella, is a
business icon in India — said the proposal lumped together all
intermediaries, as varied as social networks and Wi-Fi hot spots, even
though each has a different level of control over content that flows
through it. In the filing, Microsoft said it would be difficult to
screen out gambling content, as the rules would require. Filtering the
full range of content demanded by the government would not only violate
privacy and freedom of expression, the company wrote, but would also be
so challenging that “the cost of even attempting compliance will be
prohibitive.”

Trade groups representing the largest tech companies have made similar
arguments in their filings.

Last week, WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook and has some 250 million
active users in India, said it could not meet the proposed requirement
that it trace viral messages to their origin without destroying the
privacy protections that are core to the service.

“WhatsApp cares deeply about creating a space for private conversations
online,” Carl Woog, a company spokesman, said at a news conference in
New Delhi. He said the proposed rules “would require us to re-architect
WhatsApp, leading to a different product, one that would not be
fundamentally private.”

Google and Facebook declined to comment beyond filings made by the
industry groups to which they belong. Twitter, which is [jousting with
India’s
Parliament](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/house-panel-gives-twitter-15-days-to-present-ceo-jack-dorsey/articleshow/67951655.cms)
over claims that it suppresses right-wing content, said in a statement
that it hoped that any changes to the rules would “strike a careful
balance that protects important values such as freedom of expression.”

India began signaling last year that it [planned to impose tough
rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/technology/india-technology-american-giants.html)
on the tech industry, ending the free rein that American tech giants
have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which has been
the world’s fastest-growing market for new internet users. Among other
things, officials discussed European-style limits on what big internet
companies can do with users’ personal data.

The newest proposals on internet content were introduced at a private
meeting with tech companies [in
December](https://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines).
They were on track for quick passage until the details [leaked to The
Indian
Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/),
a local newspaper, which prompted the government to invite broader
feedback.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Officials have offered little public explanation for the proposals,
beyond a desire to curb the kind of [false rumors about child kidnappers
that spread on
WhatsApp](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/23/technology/whatsapp-india-killings-ES.html)
a year ago and that incited angry mobs to kill two dozen innocent
people. That wave of violence has since subsided.

The coming national election has added urgency to the proposals. India’s
Election Commission, which administers national and state elections, is
considering a ban on all social media content and ads aimed at
influencing voters for the 48 hours before voting begins, according to
an internal report obtained by the news media. To buttress its legal
authority to order such a ban, the commission wrote to the I.T. ministry
last week asking it to amend the new rules to specifically prohibit
online content that violates election laws or commission orders.

One of the biggest cheerleaders for the new rules was Reliance Jio, a
fast-growing mobile phone company controlled by Mukesh Ambani, India’s
richest industrialist. Mr. Ambani, an ally of Mr. Modi, has made no
secret of his plans to turn Reliance Jio into an all-purpose information
service that offers streaming video and music, messaging, money
transfer, online shopping, and home broadband services.

In a filing last week, Reliance Jio said the new rules were necessary to
combat “miscreants” and urged the government to ignore free-speech
protests. The company also said that encrypted messaging services like
WhatsApp, “although perceivably beneficial to users, are detrimental to
national interest and hence should not be allowed.”
