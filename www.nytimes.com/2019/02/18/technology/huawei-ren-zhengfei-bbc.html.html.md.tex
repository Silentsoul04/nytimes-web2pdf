Ren Zhengfei had previously avoided passing judgment on the case, citing
respect for the legal process. Now he appears to be sharpening his
language.

BEIJING --- Ren Zhengfei, the founder of the Chinese technology giant
Huawei, has accused the United States of having political motivations in
leveling criminal charges against the company and his daughter, a top
Huawei executive.

The comments, made in
\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47274679}{an interview with the
BBC} that was published Monday, mark a rhetorical escalation. Mr. Ren
and the firm had previously declined to say much on the case, citing
respect for the legal process. But he appears to be sharpening his
language as a hearing nears on whether his daughter should be sent to
the United States to stand trial.

``I object to what the U.S. has done,'' Mr. Ren told the BBC. ``This
kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable.''

Late last month, the Justice Department
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/meng-wanzhou-huawei-iran.html}{unveiled
sweeping charges} against Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng
Wanzhou, outlining yearslong efforts by the Chinese firm to steal
American industrial secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade
economic sanctions against Iran.

Ms. Meng, who is Mr. Ren's elder daughter, was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/huawei-cfo-arrest-canada-extradition.html}{arrested
in December by Canadian authorities} acting at the request of the United
States. She remains in Canada while awaiting a decision by its legal
authorities about whether she will be extradited to the United States to
face charges.

The criminal case against Huawei and Ms. Meng coincides with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/huawei-china-us-5g-technology.html}{a
campaign by American officials to pressure Western governments} not to
use Huawei's equipment in their mobile networks. Washington has long
held that the company's networking gear could be used to help Beijing
spy on Americans, charges that Huawei has consistently denied.

Relations between China and the United States have already been tense as
efforts to resolve
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/trump-china-us-trade.html}{their
monthslong trade war} plod forward.

Mr. Ren, 74, has generally preferred to avoid the spotlight as he built
Huawei into the world's largest supplier of the equipment that enables
modern telecommunications.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/technology/huawei-ren-zhengfei.html}{In
an interview last month} with a group of journalists from international
news outlets, Mr. Ren said: ``I trust that the legal systems of Canada
and the United States are open, just and fair, and will reach a just
conclusion. We will make our judgment after all the evidence is made
public.''

Mr. Ren's latest comments appear to be aimed at a Canadian audience. A
Canadian judge is set in the coming weeks to hear arguments about
whether Ms. Meng should be extradited.

One issue that is likely to factor into the Canadian authorities'
decision is whether her arrest was politically motivated. Chrystia
Freeland, Canada's foreign minister,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/world/canada/china-huawei.html}{has
warned the United States} not to use the extradition process to pursue
political ends. And last month, John McCallum, Canada's ambassador to
China at the time, said Ms. Meng had a good chance of avoiding
extradition because of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/politics/trump-meng-wanzhou-huawei-extradition.html}{remarks
by President Trump}, who had said he was willing to intervene if it
would help secure a trade deal.

Mr. McCallum backpedaled on his observation. But
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/americas/canada-ambassador-china-huawei.html}{he
was pushed out of his job} soon after.
