Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent and 2016 Democratic
primary runner-up whose populist agenda has helped push the party to the
left, embarked on Tuesday on a second run for president, in a bid that
will test [whether he retains his anti-establishment appeal or loses
ground to newer faces who have adopted many of his
ideas.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/on-politics-bernie-2020.html)

A professed democratic socialist whose calls for “[Medicare for
all](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/medicare-for-all-2020.html),”
a $15 minimum wage and tuition-free public colleges have become pillars
of the party’s left wing, Mr. Sanders joins the race at a time when
Republicans are trying to define the Democratic field and its ideas as
out of the political mainstream. In Mr. Sanders, who has not joined the
Democratic Party, Republicans have an easy target to try to make the
face of the opposition.

But Mr. Sanders, 77, starts with stronger support from small-dollar
donors and liberal voters than most other candidates. And he is among
the best-known Democrats in a crowded field, as well as one of the most
outspoken against President Trump, whom he has repeatedly called a
“pathological liar” and a “racist.”

“During our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda,
we were told that our ideas were ‘radical’ and ‘extreme,’” Mr. Sanders
said on Tuesday in an email to supporters. “Three years have come and
gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting
back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of
Americans.”

</div>

*\[Update:* [*Bernie Sanders accuses liberal think tank of smearing
progressive
candidates*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-candidates.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)*.\]*

This time around, Mr. Sanders, enters the race at a far different
electoral moment. Much of his populist agenda has been embraced by other
Democrats, at a time when many voters are eager to elevate female and
nonwhite standard bearers. He will no longer have the Clinton dynasty as
a foil; instead, his competition will include progressives like Senator
Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has broadly supported many of the
same economic positions for years.

And he will face far more scrutiny than three years ago, when much of
the news media and political class treated him as more of an outlier
than as a genuine challenger for the nomination. Already, he has had to
[quell the unease about his campaign’s treatment of
women](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-sexism.html)
that has been disclosed in recent weeks and prompted two public
apologies. His stumbles on issues of race and identity continue to
concern activists who fear he has learned little from his previous White
House bid.

Whether Mr. Sanders can break through in a crowded field of diverse
candidates, many of whom champion the progressive message he made
popular, could go a long way in determining the direction of the
Democratic Party in the age of Trump.

“A lot of people still believe that he is the one who can take Trump
out,” said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of the political group
Democracy for America. The question now, she said, is “how does he
distinguish himself in that bigger
field?”

Republicans have seized on Mr. Sanders’s entrance, eager to ascribe the
socialist label to all Democrats. Soon after his announcement, the Trump
re-election campaign issued a statement denouncing “every” Democratic
candidate for “embracing his brand of socialism.” The president said
pointedly that Mr. Sanders “missed his time.”

In an interview on “CBS This Morning,” Mr. Sanders did not shy away from

“going to say, ‘Bernie Sanders wants the United States to become
Venezuela.’”

“Bernie Sanders does not want to have the United States become the
horrific economic situation that unfortunately exists in Venezuela right
now,” he said. “What Bernie Sanders wants is to learn from countries
around the world why other countries are doing a better job of dealing
with income and wealth inequality than we are.”

Mr. Sanders will start with several advantages, including the foundation
of a 50-state organization; [a massive lead among low-dollar
donors](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/2020-democrats-campaign-funding.html)
that is roughly equivalent to the donor base of all the other Democratic
hopefuls combined; and a cache of fervent, unwavering supporters who
spent the day exulting in his decision to run. A coveted speaker, he can
still electrify crowds in a way few politicians can. He enjoys wide name
recognition, and several early polls had him running second behind
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

The strength of that donor list was quickly apparent: In the 12 hours
after Mr. Sanders formally joined the race, his campaign said it had
pulled in more than $4 million.

\[[*Check out the 2020 Democratic field with our candidate
tracker.*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)\]

And while rising stars like [Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/nyregion/ocasio-cortez-democrats-congress.html)
and Ayanna Pressley have siphoned some of his authority over the party’s
progressive wing, Mr. Sanders still claims to have spawned a “political
revolution” that, true revolution or not, has ignited a generation of
young, socialist-leaning voters and reshaped the Democratic Party.

He is also partly responsible for the party’s decision last year to
[overhaul its presidential nomination
process](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/us/politics/superdelegates-democrats-dnc.html),
including sharply reducing the influence of superdelegates and
increasing the transparency around debates — factors he felt greatly
favored Hillary Clinton in 2016.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Asked what would be different in 2020, Mr. Sanders replied bluntly:
“We’re going to win.”

“Bottom line,” he said, “it is absolutely imperative that Donald Trump
be defeated.” Though he had harsh words for the president, he said he
was fond of [the five other senators who
were<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>running](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html)
for the Democratic nomination. “They are in some cases my friends,” he
said.

Mr. Sanders did not immediately announce where he would campaign first.
Faiz Shakir, the national political director at the A.C.L.U. and a
former adviser to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the former majority
leader, will serve as campaign manager.

With his booming voice and familiar wide-armed grip at the lectern, Mr.
Sanders has long positioned himself as a champion of the working class
and a passionate opponent of Wall Street and the moneyed elite. His
remarks often include diatribes against the millionaires and
billionaires — one of his most common refrains is that the “three
wealthiest people in America own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent”
— as well as denunciations of “super PACs” and the influence of big
money on politics. In particular, he has sharply criticized Amazon and
Walmart over their wages and treatment of workers.

\[*Make sense of the people, issues and ideas* [*shaping American

In his email to supporters, as well as [a campaign announcement
video](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1097828878310096901),
Mr. Sanders laid out a litany of policy issues, familiar to anyone who
has followed him: universal health care, tuition-free public college,
women’s reproductive rights, lower prescription drug prices, criminal
justice reform.

“Our campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that
dominate our economic and political life,” he said.

While some presidential candidates have avoided direct broadsides
against President Trump, Mr. Sanders, ever combative, addressed his
potential opponent head on.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud,
a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American
democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction,” he said.

Born in Brooklyn, with an accent to match, Mr. Sanders ran
unsuccessfully in the 1970s for governor and United States senator in
Vermont before being elected mayor of Burlington in 1981. For 16 years,
he served as the only congressman in the state before he was elected to
the Senate in 2006.

Mr. Sanders has been a [modest
legislator](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/us/politics/bernie-sanders-amendments.html)
and something of a lone wolf in Washington, promoting largely the same
legislative agenda since his early days as a mayor. He voted against the
Iraq War and, in 2008, was one of roughly two dozen senators to vote
against the $700 billion bailout of big banks.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While often viewed as a pesky left-wing gadfly, he is also known to
reach across the aisle, working on legislation with Senator Charles E.
Grassley of Iowa and Senator John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans.
He has [rationalized
voting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/12/1994-crime-bill-haunts-clinton-and-sanders-as-criminal-justice-reform-rises-to-top-in-democratic-contest/?utm_term=.93a0a5d9f1ce)
for the 1994 crime bill, now heavily criticized for some of its
draconian provisions, by saying he had favored progressive parts of the
bill, including the Violence Against Women Act, while strongly opposing
measures that would lead to mass incarceration.

Mr. Sanders is the longest-serving independent in congressional history,
a point of pride for him but one of consternation and annoyance for some
Democrats who are quick to suggest he does not have the party’s
interests at heart. Some Democrats blame him for Mrs. Clinton’s loss in
2016, saying his anti-establishment rhetoric during his campaign
inflamed divisions in the party that proved insurmountable.

One 2016 issue that has resurfaced is his record on gun control,
Democratic strategists have said, given the intensity of the debate
around gun violence following recent mass shootings. In 2005, Mr.
Sanders voted for a law that granted immunity to gun manufacturers and
dealers from most liability lawsuits. Mr. Sanders has also been
criticized for support he received [from the
N.R.A.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-nra-helped-put-bernie-sanders-in-congress/2015/07/19/ed1be26c-2bfe-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html?utm_term=.36a779048ad8)
when he was running for Congress in 1990, in part because he vowed not
to support a bill that mandated a waiting period for handgun sales.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though his message is well worn, Mr. Sanders has indicated that he is
trying to remedy weaknesses from his first presidential campaign,
including his [lack of support from black
voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/us/politics/bernie-sanders-obama-mississippi.html).
In recent months, he has made a series of trips to the South, where in
2016 he drew less than 20 percent of the black vote. During the Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday, [he made a swing through South
Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/us/politics/south-carolina-democrats-president.html)
— where black voters made up about 60 percent of the Democratic primary
vote in 2016 — that included addressing supporters and students and
speaking with lawmakers.

He has also tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials, becoming a
critic of the United States support of Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. Late
last year, the Senate [passed a
resolution](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/yemen-saudi-war-pompeo-mattis.html),
which Mr. Sanders helped introduce, to end American military assistance
for the kingdom’s war there.

But he also continues to draw ire from critics who say that the way he
talks about race and identity is out of step with the calls for
diversity and change within the party.

Almost immediately after making his announcement, Mr. Sanders was
attacked for his response to a question on Vermont Public Radio about
whether he thought he best represented the current Democratic Party.

“We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their
skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their
age,” [Mr. Sanders
said](https://www.vpr.org/post/hes-2020-bernie-sanders-running-president-again#stream/0).
“I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory
society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what
they stand for.”

Whether Mr. Sanders can secure the Democratic nomination may depend on
his ability to change his timeworn message — and adapt to the demands
and yearnings of a party that he helped shape.

“Before 2016, nobody was really talking about universal health care and
universal education as much as he was; he really brought that into the
mainstream for a lot of people,” said Dave Degner, the chair of the Tama
County Democratic Party in Iowa. “If he comes out saying the same things
that he did before, it’s not new
anymore.”
