Hello, person who is, statistically speaking, a human adult aged
approximately “millennial” to “boomer.” The analytics suggest a high
likelihood that you’re aware there is an app named
[TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/technology/tiktok-china-ban-model.html),
and a similarly high likelihood that you’re not totally sure what it’s
all about. Maybe you asked someone younger in your life, and they tried
to explain and possibly failed. Or maybe you’ve heard that this [new,
extraordinarily popular video
app](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/technology/tiktok-a-chinese-video-app-brings-fun-back-to-social-media.html)
is “a refreshing outlier in the social media universe” that’s “genuinely
fun to use.” Maybe you even tried it, but bounced straight out, confused
and sapped.

“Fear of missing out” is a common way to describe how social media can
make people feel like everyone else is part of something — a concert, a
secret beach, a brunch — that they’re not. A new wrinkle in this concept
is that sometimes that “something” is a social media platform itself.
Maybe you saw a photo of some friends on Instagram at a great party and
wondered why you weren’t there. But then, next in your feed, you saw a
weird video, watermarked with a vibrating TikTok logo, scored with a
song you’d never heard, starring a person you’d never seen. Maybe you
saw one of the staggering number of ads for TikTok plastered throughout
other social networks, and the real world, and wondered why you weren’t
at that party, either, and why it seemed so far away.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s been a while since a new social app got big enough, quickly enough,
to make nonusers feel they’re missing out from an experience. If we
exclude Fortnite, which is very social but also very much a game, the
last time an app inspired such interest from people who weren’t on it
was … maybe Snapchat? (Not a coincidence that Snapchat’s audience skewed
very young, too.)

And while you, perhaps an anxious abstainer, may feel perfectly secure
in your “choice” not to join that service, Snapchat has more daily users
than Twitter, changed the course of its industry, and altered the way
people communicate with their phones. TikTok, now
[reportedly](https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2155580/tik-tok-hits-500-million-global-monthly-active-users-china-social-media-video)
500 million users strong, is not so obvious in its intentions. But that
doesn’t mean it doesn’t have them\! Shall we?

-----

## The basic human explanation  
of TikTok.

TikTok is an app for making and sharing short videos. The videos are
tall, not square, like on Snapchat or Instagram’s stories, but you
navigate through videos by scrolling up and down, like a feed, not by
tapping or swiping side to side.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Video creators have all sorts of tools at their disposal: filters as on
Snapchat (and later, everyone else); the ability to search for sounds to
score your video. Users are also strongly encouraged to engage with
other users, through “response” videos or by means of “duets” — users
can duplicate videos and add themselves alongside.

Hashtags play a surprisingly large role on TikTok. In more innocent
times, Twitter hoped its users might congregate around hashtags in a
never-ending series of productive pop-up mini-discourses. On TikTok,
hashtags actually exist as a real, functional organizing principle: not
for news, or even really anything trending anywhere else than TikTok,
but for various “challenges,” or jokes, or repeating formats, or other
discernible blobs of
activity.

### ► **In this series of TikToks,**  
**[@DonJuanFutrell goes shopping and](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6666202402800012550)**  
**[reinvents language](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6666202402800012550).**

### ► **** In this TikTok, [a popular song for memes](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6664754374910151941)  
[is used to express shopping as a outsider.](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6664754374910151941)  

TikTok is, however, a free-for-all. It’s easy to make a video on TikTok,
not just because of the tools it gives users, but because of extensive
reasons and prompts it provides for you. You can select from an enormous
range of sounds, from popular song clips to short moments from TV shows,
YouTube videos or *other* TikToks. You can join a dare-like challenge,
or participate in a dance meme, or make a joke. Or you can make fun of
all of these things.

TikTok assertively answers anyone’s *what should I watch* with a flood.
In the same way, the app provides plenty of answers for the paralyzing
*what should I post?* The result is an endless unspooling of material
that people, many very young, might be too self-conscious to post on
Instagram, or that they never would have come up with in the first place
without a nudge. It can be hard to watch. It can be charming. It can be
very, very funny. It is frequently, in the language widely applied
outside the platform, from people on *other* platforms, extremely
“cringe.”

-----

## So that’s what’s on TikTok.  
What *is* it?

TikTok can feel, to an American audience, a bit like a greatest hits
compilation, featuring only the most engaging elements and experiences
of its predecessors. This is true, to a point. But TikTok — known as
Douyin in China, where its parent company is based — must also be
understood as one of the most popular of *many* short-video-sharing apps
in that country. This is a
[landscape](https://radiichina.com/a-quick-guide-to-chinas-competing-short-video-apps/)
that evolved both alongside and at arm’s length from the American tech
industry — Instagram, for example, is banned in China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Under the hood, TikTok is a fundamentally different app than American
users have used before. It may look and feel like its
friend-feed-centric peers, and you can follow and be followed; of course
there are hugely popular “stars,” many
[cultivated](https://technode.com/2018/06/15/8-lessons-douyin/) by the
company itself. There’s messaging. Users can and do use it like any
other social app. But the various aesthetic and functional similarities
to Vine or Snapchat or Instagram belie a core difference: TikTok is more
machine than man. In this way, it’s from the future — or at least *a*
future. And it has some messages for us.

Consider the trajectory of what we think of as the major social apps.

-----

## Instagram and Twitter could only  
take us so far.

Twitter gained popularity as a tool for following people and being
followed by other people and expanded from there. Twitter watched what
its users did with its original concept and formalized the
conversational behaviors they invented. (See: Retweets. See again:
hashtags.) Only then, and after going public, did it start to become
more assertive. It made more recommendations. It started
[reordering](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/20/17876098/twitter-chronological-timeline-back-finally)
users’ feeds based on what it thought they might want to see, or might
have missed. Opaque machine intelligence encroached on the original
system.

### ► **This TikTok is a piece of** **[unlikely yet](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6666104355344616710?refer=embed)**  
**[sweet comedy about kids and vaccination](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6666104355344616710?refer=embed).**  

Something similar happened at Instagram, where algorithmic
recommendation is now a very noticeable part of the experience, and on
YouTube, where recommendations shuttle one around the platform in new
and often … let’s say
[*surprising*](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/down-youtubes-recommendation-rabbithole)
ways. Some users might feel affronted by these assertive new automatic
features, which are clearly designed to increase interaction. One might
reasonably worry that this trend serves the lowest demands of a brutal
attention economy that is revealing tech companies as cynical
time-mongers and turning us into mindless drones.

These changes have also tended to work, at least on those terms. We
often do spend more time with the apps as they’ve become more assertive,
and less intimately human, even as we’ve complained.

What’s both crucial and easy to miss about TikTok is how it has stepped
over the midpoint between the familiar self-directed feed and an
experience based
[first](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzdwn9/tiktok-cant-save-us-from-algorithmic-content-hell)
on algorithmic observation and inference. The most obvious clue is right
there when you open the app: the first thing you see isn’t a feed of
your friends, but a page called “For You.” It’s an algorithmic feed
based on videos you’ve interacted with, or even just watched. It never
runs out of material. It is not, unless you train it to be, full of
people you know, or things you’ve explicitly told it you want to see.
It’s full of things that you seem to have demonstrated you want to
watch, no matter what you actually say you want to watch.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is constantly learning from you and, over time, builds a presumably
complex but opaque model of what you tend to watch, and shows you more
of that, or things like that, or things related to that, or, honestly,
who knows, but it seems to work. TikTok starts making assumptions the
second you’ve opened the app, before you’ve really given it anything to
work with. Imagine an Instagram centered entirely around its “Explore”
tab, or a Twitter built around, I guess, trending topics or viral
tweets, with “following” bolted onto the side.

Imagine a version of Facebook that was able to fill your feed before
you’d friended a single person. That’s TikTok.

Its mode of creation is unusual, too. You can make stuff for your
friends, or in response to your friends, sure. But users looking for
something to post about are immediately recruited into group challenges,
or hashtags, or shown popular songs. The bar is low. The stakes are low.
Large audiences feel within reach, and smaller ones are easy to find,
even if you’re just messing
around.

### ► **** **[This TikTok is a great example](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6652983964904459522)**  
**[of “Fake Plane Challenge.”](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6652983964904459522)**  

On most social networks the first step to showing your content to a lot
of people is grinding to build an audience, or having lots of friends,
or being incredibly beautiful or wealthy or idle and willing to display
that, or getting lucky or striking viral gold. TikTok instead encourages
users to jump from audience to audience, trend to trend, creating
something like simulated temporary friend groups, who get together to do
friend-group things: to share an inside joke; to riff on a song; to talk
idly and aimlessly about whatever is in front of you. Feedback is
instant and frequently abundant; virality has a stiff tailwind.
Stimulation is constant. There is an unmistakable sense that you’re
using something that’s expanding in every direction. The pool of content
is enormous. Most of it is meaningless. Some of it becomes popular, and
some is great, and some gets to be both. As The Atlantic’s Taylor Lorenz
[put
it](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/what-tiktok-is-cringey-and-thats-fine/573871/),
“Watching too many in a row can feel like you’re about to have a brain
freeze. They’re incredibly addictive.”

-----

## TikTok is just doing  
to you what you told it to do.

In 1994, the artist and software developer Karl Sims demonstrated
“virtual creatures” that moved in realistic ways discovered through
“genetic algorithms.” These simulations, through trial and error,
gradually arrived at some [pre-existing shapes and
movements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBgG_VSP7f8): wriggling,
slithering, dragging and walking.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But some early models, which emphasized the creatures’ ability to cover
a certain distance as quickly as possible, resulted in the evolution of
a very tall, rigid being that simply fell over. In doing so, it “moved”
more quickly than a wriggling peer. It didn’t understand its
evolutionary priority as “creature-like locomotion.” It needed to get to
a certain place as efficiently as possible. And it did.

Older social apps are continuously evolving, too. Their models
prioritize growth and discovery, of course, but also assume the
centrality of *your people*: the accounts you follow and which follow
you, or with whom you communicate directly, and are bound up in their
founding myths and structures: Facebook’s social graph; the News Feed;
the Instagram feed; Twitter’s rigid user
relationships.

### ► **TikTok is often used for**  
**showing off talent like drawing, building**  
**[and “transformation by makeup.”](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6661522824781450497)**  

TikTok though is the towering stick falling far and fast, not caring to
wait to evolve through a wriggling, cumbersome social phase, but instead
asking: Why not just start showing people things and see what they do
about it? Why not just ask people to start making things and see what
happens? If engagement is how success is measured, why not just design
the app where taking up time is *the entire point*? There’s no rule, in
apps or elsewhere, against engagement for engagement’s sake. Let the
creature grow tall and fall upon us all.

-----

## In What Laboratory Was This  
Monster Made?

TikTok is far from an evolutionary fluke. Its parent company, ByteDance,
recently
[valued](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18026250/bytedance-china-tiktok-valuation-highest-toutiao)
at more than $75 billion, [bills itself](https://bytedance.com/) first
as an artificial intelligence company, not a creator of mission-driven
social platforms. TikTok was merged with Musical.ly, a social network
initially built around lip-syncing and dancing and adopted by [very
young
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/business/media/a-social-network-frequented-by-children-tests-the-limits-of-online-regulation.html?module=inline).
It still carries a lot of Musical.ly’s DNA, and its app store reviews
contain more than a little yearning for Musical.ly’s return. It was the
defunct Musical.ly against which the Federal Trade Commission [recently
levied its largest-ever
penalty](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/ftc-tiktok-child-privacy-fine.html)
for mishandling the private data of young
users.

### ► Press, twist and pull written  
on a hand are popular instructions to  
receive a message that is revealed  
to be written on the palm. [“Almost got](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6665427333471554822)  
[kicked out of my house for this one”](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6665427333471554822)  
[claimed a user.](https://www.tiktok.com/share/video/6665427333471554822)  

“ByteDance’s content platforms enable people to enjoy content powered by
AI technology,” its website says. Its vision is “to build global
creation and interaction platforms.” ByteDance’s wildly popular news and
entertainment portal, Jinri Toutiao (translated as “Today’s Headlines,”)
relies heavily on AI — not human editors, or a self-selected feed of
accounts — to curate and create customized streams of largely
user-and-partner-generated content tailored to each of its readers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

These are services where a sort of “filter” bubble — isolating users
into worlds of points of view — isn’t an unintended consequence. It’s
the point. And it’s extremely effective: Both Toutiao and Douyin have
drawn attention from Chinese regulators for, among many other things,
some
[familiar](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-china-cracked-down-on-the-social-media-giant-bytedance)
to any large social-ish platform, and others
[unique](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-china-cracked-down-on-the-social-media-giant-bytedance)
to its speech-constrained political environment, capturing too much user
time. As a result, TikTok’s “Digital Wellbeing” settings include an
option to enforce a password-protected time limit. The company’s other
challenges can be addressed more assertively: an algorithm-first
attention market isn’t just centrally ruled, it’s centrally allocated.

-----

## Why Do People Spend Hours  
on TikTok? It’s the Machines.

All of this goes a long way to explain why, at least at first, TikTok
can seem disorienting. “You’re not actually sure why you’re seeing what
you’re seeing,” said Ankur Thakkar, the former editorial lead at Vine,
TikTok’s other most direct forerunner. On Vine, a new user might not
have had much to watch, or felt much of a reason to create anything, but
they understood their context: the list of people they followed, which
was probably the thing letting them down.

“It’s doing the thing that Twitter tried to solve, that everyone tried
to solve,” he said. “How do you get people to engage?” Apparently you
just … show them things, and let a powerful artificial intelligence take
notes. You start sending daily notifications immediately. You tell them
what to do. You fake it till you make it, algorithmically
speaking.

<div class="css-79elbk" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

American social platforms, each fighting their own desperate and often
stock-price-related fights to increase user engagement, have been
trending in TikTok’s general direction for a while. It is possible,
today, to receive highly personalized and effectively infinite content
recommendations in YouTube without ever following a single account,
because Google already watches what you do, and makes guesses about who
you are. And while Facebook and Twitter don’t talk about their products
this way, we understand that sometimes — maybe a lot of the time — we
use them just to fill time. They, in turn, want as much of our time as
possible, and are quite obviously doing whatever they can to get it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So maybe you’ll sit TikTok out. But these things have a way of sneaking
up behind you. Maybe you never joined Snapchat — but its rise worried
Facebook so much that its prettier product, Instagram, was remade in its
image, and copied concepts from Snapchat reached you there.

And maybe you skipped Twitter — but it still rewired your entire news
diet, and, besides, it’s how the president talks to you, now.

TikTok does away with many of the assumptions other social platforms
have been built upon, and which they are in the process of discarding
anyway. It questions the primacy of individual connections and friend
networks. It unapologetically embraces central control rather than
pretending it doesn’t have it. TikTok’s real influence going forward may
be that the other social media platforms decide that our friends were
simply holding us back. Or, at least, it was holding *them* back.
