WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is expanding its efforts to block
Chinese acquisitions in the United States, moving to force a Chinese
firm that owns Grindr, the gay dating app, to relinquish control over
concerns that Beijing could use personal information to blackmail or
influence American officials, according to people familiar with the
situation.

The action, which is being driven by the [Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/business/what-is-cfius.html),
is unusual given that the panel typically investigates mergers that
could result in control of an American business by a foreign individual
or company, judging whether deals could threaten national security. This
appears to be the first case in which the United States has asserted
that foreign control of a social media app could have national security
implications.

The administration has not announced the move, which will require that
Grindr be sold, or explained it. But officials familiar with the case,
which was first reported by Reuters, say the concern focused on the
potential for the blackmail of American officials or contractors, if
China threatened to disclose their sexual orientation, or track their
movements or dating habits.

Three years ago, a Chinese firm that owns both gaming and credit
services businesses, Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. Ltd., a public company
listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, bought a 60 percent stake in
Grindr, which is based in West Hollywood, Calif., for $93 million. Early
last year, it bought the remaining shares for a little over $150
million.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While there were news reports about both transactions, the United States
did not take action to block the acquisitions. Since then, the United
States’ definition of national security threats has expanded, in part
over concerns by the Trump administration and lawmakers about China’s
ability to gain access to critical American technology.

It is unclear why the panel, known as Cfius, acted now, more than three
years after control of the company switched to Chinese hands. And so
far, there is no public evidence that any information on the app has
been used by the Chinese government.

But Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said he, along with several
other senators, asked Cfius to conduct a review.

“Last year, my office met with a top official from the Treasury
Department to express my serious concerns about the national security
risks associated with a Chinese company buying Grindr,” he said in a
statement. While he said he could not “confirm specific actions by
Cfius,” a highly secretive panel, “it is high time for the
administration and Cfius to consider the national security impact of
foreign companies acquiring large, sensitive troves of Americans’
private data.”

Congress [handed more power to the
panel](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/business/us-china-investment-cfius.html)
last year, allowing it to examine transactions that fell short of
majority control of a company and involved just minority stakes. The
expansion was an effort to counter Chinese minority investments in
Silicon Valley companies that gave investors an early look at emerging
technologies.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Kunlun purchases had never been submitted to Cfius, giving the
government the leverage to go back in after the sale to try to force a
divestment. Calls to Kunlun’s office number were not answered, and
emails seeking comment were not returned.

Grindr has already [faced questions about its control and
use](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/technology/grindr-sets-off-privacy-firestorm-after-sharing-users-hiv-status-data.html)
of personal data. The company faced a huge backlash for sharing users’
H.I.V. status, sexual tastes and other intimate personal details with
outside software vendors. After the data sharing was made public by
European researchers in 2018, the company said it would stop sharing
H.I.V. data with outside companies.

Last year was the first time Cfius appeared to be concerned about the
purchase of companies that contained sensitive data. The government
[killed a proposed merger last
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/moneygram-ant-financial-china-cfius.html)
between MoneyGram, the money transfer firm, and Ant Financial, a
payments company related to the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.

The United States has also embarked on a global campaign to block a big
Chinese telecom equipment giant, Huawei, from building the next
generation of wireless networks, known as 5G, over concerns that it
could divert critical data through China, or be forced to turn over data
running through its networks to Beijing. The White House has essentially
accused Huawei of being an arm of the Chinese government that can be
used for spying or to sabotage communications networks, a charge that
Huawei has vehemently denied.

But the administration’s efforts to control what kind of personal data
is available to China’s intelligence services may have come too late.
China’s ministry of state security and other Chinese groups have already
[been accused of successfully stealing personal
data](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/us-and-other-nations-to-announce-china-crackdown.html)
from American databases.

The [theft of 22 million security
clearance](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/us/breach-in-a-federal-computer-system-exposes-personnel-data.html)
[files](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/us/breach-in-a-federal-computer-system-exposes-personnel-data.html)
from the Office of Personnel Management in 2014, along with [similar
theft of
data](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html)
from the Anthem insurance networks and Marriott hotels, have all been
attributed to Chinese actors by American intelligence officials, who say
they were most likely operating on behalf of the government.

The files stolen in the 2014 government breach contain far more personal
data than the Chinese could probably find on any individual social media
site: They include work history on sensitive United States projects,
information about bankruptcies, medical conditions, relationship
histories, and any contacts with foreigners. The loss of the information
forced the C.I.A. to reassign personnel headed to China, and was
considered among the largest losses of sensitive security information in
decades. The Obama administration declined to publicly concede that the
breach was committed by Chinese intelligence services.

China has taken steps of its own to limit foreign companies’ access to
its citizens’ personal information. A recently enacted cybersecurity law
mandates that user data be stored in the country, where it can be kept
under the government’s control. In response to the law, Apple said it
would open its first data center in China, and formed a partnership with
a Chinese company to run the center and handle data requests from the
government.

Before the law even came into effect, the Chinese government had
[pressured foreign technology companies to operate servers only within
its
borders](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/business/apple-china-data-center-cybersecurity.html)
— meaning the data is available to Chinese authorities under Chinese
law. Amazon and Microsoft have partnered with Chinese firms to offer
cloud computing services to Chinese customers.

The United States has also pressed China to allow insurance companies
and other American firms that control personal data to enter the Chinese
market, a demand that goes back nearly two decades. China has agreed to
do so, and that agreement is expected to be part of the larger trade
deal being negotiated between American and Chinese negotiators.

But the Grindr case could give the Chinese government an excuse to make
its own national security claims if American firms sought to purchase a
Chinese insurance company, or any of its social media firms.
