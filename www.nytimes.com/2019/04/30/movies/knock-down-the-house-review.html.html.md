The big draw of the exuberant documentary “Knock Down the House” — about
four women who ran for Congress in 2018 — is Representative [Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York.](https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/)
The former bartender turned first-time congresswoman is the most
high-profile member of the freshman class of 2019 and scarcely needs an
introduction. Her social media presence alone shows why she has crossed
over into pop celebrity, whether she’s tweet-storming or live-streaming
on Instagram while eating popcorn, talking about staying grounded and
assembling Ikea furniture: “Boom\! I did it.”

The director Rachel Lears [has said in
interviews](https://www.missourireview.com/true-false-film-festival-an-interview-with-rachel-lears/)
that after the 2016 presidential election she reached out to the
progressive groups Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats, which ran
unknowns (or what one organizer in the documentary describes as
“non-career politicians”) in the 2018 midterms. From this pool, Lears
chose four female Democratic candidates — Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush,
Paula Jean Swearengin and Amy Vilela — each with an appealing back
story, a seemingly unbeatable opponent and a progressive platform.
(Lears and her husband, Robin Blotnick, wrote and produced “Knock Down
the House”; she served as its cinematographer while he took on the role
of editor.)

The women’s stories emerge piecemeal in “Knock Down the House,” which
follows them on the campaign trail up to election night and, in one
case, beyond. Some are more sharply delineated — what makes them run and
why — than others. Vilela, who ran in the Democratic primary in Nevada,
seems the most personally invested, having been driven into politics by
an agonizing family tragedy that she speaks about with raw, heart-heavy
candor. Both Bush (from Missouri) and Swearengin (West Virginia) largely
appear fed up with the establishment Democrats representing their
districts. “We’re coming out of the belly of the beast kicking and
screaming,” Swearengin says.

Ocasio-Cortez quickly, and unsurprisingly, emerges as the focus. She’s a
ready-made camera presence: sharp, young, emphatic and a tremendous,
blazingly confident public speaker. Nothing seems to throw her off her
game, whether she’s smiling at passers-by oblivious to her campaign
leafleting or vigorously cleaning the clock of her very
surprised-looking opponent, Joe Crowley, who had been in office since
1999. By the 2018 midterms, Crowley — who had originally been put on the
ballot by [his predecessor, Thomas J.
Manton](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/22/nyregion/manton-plans-to-retire-from-congress-at-end-of-year.html)
— was [the fourth ranking House
Democrat](Democratic%20Caucus%20Chairman%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives,).

He never saw Ocasio-Cortez coming; few did, other than these filmmakers.
Because of Lears’s early access to the candidates, she and her camera
seem to have been in the war rooms right from the start. Quickly and
efficiently, and with the aid of some concise onscreen text and
talking-head interviews, she sketches in how Brand New Congress and
Justice Democrats operated. A lot of this is fascinating but could be
clearer; it’s hazy how the groups coordinated their efforts in 2018, how
they actually run candidates and what running someone fully entails.
There are atmospheric back-room scenes with the candidates and their
teams, but who hired whom?

The timeline jumps around a bit, not always helpfully. Ocasio-Cortez is
already running when the movie opens on her delivering an amusing gender
analysis while putting on makeup. Soon, the movie cuts to Kentucky nine
months earlier where a group of young people with laptops (one
ornamented with a “Bernie for U.S. President” bumper sticker) are
discussing an unnamed potential candidate. There’s talk and a call for a
vote: “All those in favor of moving her to the next round, raise your
hand.” Cut to Corbin Trent, of the Justice Democrats, who says that the
“biggest shared goal” of his group and Brand New Congress is “removing
the corrupting influence of money in politics.”

These two organizations, Trent continues, are offering an alternative
path to Congress, one free of lobbyists and special-interest groups.
“Right now our Congress is 81 percent men,” Trent says. “It’s mostly
white men, it’s mostly millionaires, it’s mostly lawyers.” This peek at
outsider organizations is fascinating and could easily be spun into a
separate documentary, as could the story of Jo-Ann Floyd-Whitehead, a
community organizer who [in 2008, with her husband, helped Barack Obama
win the Democratic
primary](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/nyregion/04race.html). “The
Whiteheads are legendary,” says Ocasio-Cortez as people pore over her
petition to get on the 2018 primary ballot. “This is the war room for
every insurgent campaign in Queens.”

This particular insurgency, of course, was [part of a larger national
shift](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/us/politics/democrats-women-minorities.html)that
“Knock Down the House” (and the Bernie Sanders stickers and T-shirts)
makes clear was only partly in reaction to the Trump presidency. Lears
doesn’t dig into that shift as deeply as she could (this is the rare
time that you yearn for a movie to be longer), but it’s there as the
candidates push forward and their races and the documentary both develop
great urgency. These women are running for office — while driving,
walking, talking and walking some more — to win hearts and minds and
votes. Often, it feels as if they’re running for their lives. They are
also, as Ocasio-Cortez says forcefully, “running to win.”
