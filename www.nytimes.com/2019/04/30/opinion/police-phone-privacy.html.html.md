Law enforcement officers on the doorstep threatening to “come back with
a warrant” is a cliché of police procedural dramas. Things are much less
dramatic in real life: The officers ask if they can take a look around,
and the civilians say yes without putting up a fight.

A key question in so-called
[“](http://ssrn.com/abstract=3369844)consent[](http://ssrn.com/abstract=3369844)-search[”](http://ssrn.com/abstract=3369844)
cases is why people so readily agree to allow intrusions into their
privacy. The answer, as we argue in a [forthcoming
article](http://ssrn.com/abstract=3369844) in The Yale Law Journal, is
that psychologically, it’s much harder to refuse consent than it seems.
The degree of pressure needed to get people to comply is shockingly
minimal — and our ability to recognize this fact is limited.

The legal standard for whether a consent search is voluntary — and thus
whether any contraband police discover is admissible in court — is
whether a reasonable person would have felt free to refuse the officers’
request. Courts tend to judge the voluntariness of consent by looking
for clear markers of coercion. Did the officer phrase the request as a
demand, instead of a question? Were weapons drawn? If not, the search is
likely to be deemed voluntary.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But this approach misunderstands the psychology of compliance. It takes
much less pressure than it seems to secure people’s acquiescence. Police
don’t need to use weapons to get people to accede to their requests;
they just need to ask. Our research shows that a simple, polite
face-to-face request is harder to refuse than we
think.

<div class="css-17dprlf" data-id="100000006451534" data-slug="privacy-mid-nav-module" style="max-width:1050px">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To test how the psychology of compliance operates, we recruited hundreds
of participants to the lab. We approached half of them with a polite but
audacious request: “Before we begin the study, can you please unlock
your phone and hand it to me? I’ll just need to take your phone outside
of the room for a moment to check for some things.”

For the other half, we asked what a reasonable person would do if
hypothetically approached by the same experimenter with the same
request.

Our control group, who merely imagined the interaction, said that most
people would refuse to hand over the phone: Only 14 percent thought a
reasonable person would let us search the phone, and only 28 percent
said they would yield their phone to a stranger. But when we actually
approached people, 97 percent handed over their phone.

In addition, these participants reported feeling significantly more
pressured to comply than the control group imagined feeling. The fact
is, saying no is more difficult, and rarer, than we realize. We believe
this same dynamic plays out the in the law surrounding consent searches.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To be sure, saying no to a police officer is different from a saying no
to an experimenter in a laboratory study. So we also tested whether
people underestimate the pressure to comply with the police as well.

We recruited a separate group of survey respondents and offered them a
monetary bonus if they could predict how often drivers grant consent
when stopped by the police. According to traffic data, upward of 90
percent of drivers say yes when the police ask to search their car. But
our survey respondents’ average guess was far lower: They thought that
only about 65 percent of drivers say yes. Again, people vastly
understated compliance.

*to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.\]*

This tendency to underappreciate the power of social influence is one of
the most enduring and important findings in all of social psychology. In
Stanley Milgram’s famous studies on obedience, for instance, research
participants were willing to heed an experimenter’s instructions to
administer dangerous electric shocks to an innocent, protesting victim.

Mr. Milgram showed that normal people would commit violent acts — not
because they were sadists, but because they were loath to disobey an
authority figure’s directives. This was a result that no one, including
expert psychologists, expected.

Critics of consent searches have also been approaching the issue in the
wrong way. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union have focused
on advocating that the police be required to notify citizens of their
right to refuse consent, much as the police are required to read
custodial suspects their Miranda rights. But this is unlikely to address
the psychological factors at play.

data is no longer your own. We’ll examine who is hoarding your
information — and give you a guide for what you can do about it.* [*Sign

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In another study, we tested what happens when we tell people they “have
the right to refuse”the request to search their phone. We found that
this notification altered people’s beliefs about the consequences of
refusal, but it did not change how free they felt to refuse. Nor did it
reduce the rates at which they handed over their phone to us — a result
consistent with previous studies that have found negligible effects of
Miranda warnings on the rates at which suspects confess to crimes.

The failure of “know your rights” interventions makes sense if you think
about the psychology behind police-citizen interactions. Telling people
about their rights addresses information deficits, but the real reason
people comply is social, not informational. The social imperatives to
comply with a police officer’s request persist even when people are
properly informed of their rights or given a consent form to sign — or
just asked politely.
