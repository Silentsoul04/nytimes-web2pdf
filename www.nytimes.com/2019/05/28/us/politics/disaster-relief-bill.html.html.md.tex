WASHINGTON --- A single House Republican again blocked final passage of
a long-delayed emergency aid package, the second Republican in a week to
use the power of an individual lawmaker to ensure the delay of relief
for communities and farmers still recovering from natural disasters.

House Democrats tried for a second time on Tuesday to use a procedural
vote to pass a Senate-approved
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/congress-disaster-relief.html}{\$19.1
billion package} while most lawmakers are spending a weeklong recess
outside of Washington. But Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of
Kentucky, used the power of a single lawmaker to object to the vote,
pushing for the full chamber to be present to vote on legislation.

``If the speaker felt that this was must-pass legislation,'' Mr. Massie
said, ``the speaker should have called a vote before sending members
home.''

When Representative Sanford Bishop, Democrat of Georgia, tried a second
time to bring up ``an extension of the National Flood Insurance
Program,'' Mr. Massie objected a second time.

Without lawmakers in town, passage through the House would have to be
unanimous. On Friday, Representative Chip Roy, a freshman Republican
from Texas, postponed returning to his Texas district to prevent the
package's passage during an identical procedural vote, calling the
maneuver ``a very swampy thing to do.''

Like Mr. Roy, Mr. Massie outlined his concerns with the vote on the
House floor, complaining about a vote during recess. Separately, Mr. Roy
had also cited fiscal irresponsibility and the decision to leave out the
White House's request for about \$4.5 billion for the southwestern
border as reasons to take issue with the legislation.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, particularly those from states set
to receive money, have fumed about the blockade of a relief bill that
has faced numerous roadblocks on its monthslong odyssey through
Congress. Passage is all but certain when the full chamber returns next
week.

``I urge my friends in this body not to object,'' Representative Steny
H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, said before Mr. Massie's
objection. ``This needs to be passed as soon as possible.''

Representative Nita Lowey of New York, chairwoman of the Appropriations
Committee, called the objection ``heartless.''

Meantime, farmers, military bases and other communities across the
country continue to struggle in their efforts to recover from
hurricanes, wildfires and floods over the last two years without the
guarantee of federal aid. Tornadoes in the Midwest and record flooding
in Oklahoma and Arkansas this week are only adding to the misery.

``The bill is going to be signed into law before the end of the first
week of June,'' Representative Austin Scott, Republican of Georgia, said
in an interview last week after Mr. Roy's objection. ``Quite honestly,
it's a childish stunt.''

Mr. Massie, often a thorn in the side of House leadership regardless of
party, lauded Mr. Roy's decision to block the vote,
\href{https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1131968599168561152}{calling
the gesture} ``Hero level, over 9000'' on Twitter.

``Whether you agree with the disaster relief bill or not, surely you
acknowledge members of congress should be in town to vote on it,'' Mr.
Massie wrote, a sentiment he echoed on the House floor on Tuesday.

House Democrats will likely try to bring the package to the floor for a
vote again on Thursday, when the House briefly convenes again, which a
single Republican can again block.
