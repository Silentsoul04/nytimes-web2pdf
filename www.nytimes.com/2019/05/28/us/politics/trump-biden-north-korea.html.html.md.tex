HOUSTON --- President Trump sided again on Tuesday with the government
of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in mocking Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s
intelligence, an extraordinary alignment of a United States president
and an authoritarian regime against an American politician --- and an
insult that Mr. Biden pooh-poohed by letting an aide rebut it.

During his visit to Japan last weekend, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that
he had ``smiled'' when North Korea described Mr. Biden recently as a
``fool of low I.Q.'' The White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee
Sanders, also said that Mr. Trump and the Mr. Kim's government
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/us/politics/sarah-sanders-meet-the-press.html}{``agree
in their assessment''} of Mr. Biden. American leaders have traditionally
avoided partisan sniping while outside of the country.

Mr. Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential
nomination, did not respond to Mr. Trump's remarks during his one public
event on Tuesday, an education speech in Houston, or in response to
reporters calling out questions afterward. At a fund-raiser in Houston
Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden sought to stay above the fray, reaching for a
line he has used to dismiss Mr. Trump in the past.

``I'm not going to get down in the mud wrestling with this fella,'' Mr.
Biden said. ``I'm not going to do it. I don't want to get into it.
Everybody already knows who he is.''

Earlier in the day, Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr.
Biden, issued a statement calling Mr. Trump's remarks ``beneath the
dignity of the office.''

``To be on foreign soil, on Memorial Day, and to side repeatedly with a
murderous dictator against a fellow American and former vice president
speaks for itself,'' Ms. Bedingfield said.

After her statement was released, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that he was
``actually sticking up'' for Mr. Biden by calling him ``a low I.Q.
individual,'' reiterating the insult while suggesting that his phrasing
was softer than that of the North Korean government.

Another 2020 Democrat, Senator Kamala Harris of California, sharply
criticized Mr. Trump for attacking ``the previous vice president of the
United States'' while in another country.

``It is wrong, it is contrary to our values, and it is contrary to the
best interests of our country,'' Ms. Harris said during a town hall
forum on MSNBC Tuesday night. ``He should not have done it, he is
irresponsible,'' she added, calling his remarks one of many ``examples
of why he should not be president of the United States.''

Mr. Biden, in his remarks in Houston, did needle Mr. Trump for saying
last week that the former vice president had ``deserted'' Pennsylvania
by moving to Delaware decades ago.

``We moved from Scranton, I was 10, the president saying I abandoned it,
to find work,'' Mr. Biden said. ``I was in third grade.''

Mr. Trump narrowly carried Pennsylvania in 2016, and Mr. Biden and other
Democrats are

to win back the state in 2020}.
