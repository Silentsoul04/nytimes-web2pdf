# Biden’s First Run for President Was a Calamity. Some Missteps Still Resonate.

In 1988, Joe Biden was prone to embellishment. Hints of that linger
today. But unlike then, his message to voters is clear: He’s a
stabilizing statesman in a tumultuous time.

Joe Biden was riffing again — an R.F.K. anecdote, a word about “civil
wrongs,” a meandering joke about the baseball commissioner — and aides
knew enough to worry a little.

“When I marched in the civil rights movement, I did not march with a
12-point program,” Mr. Biden thundered, testing his presidential message
in February 1987 before a New Hampshire audience. “I marched with tens
of thousands of others to change attitudes. And we changed attitudes.”

More than once, advisers had gently reminded Mr. Biden of the problem
with this formulation: He had not actually marched during the civil
rights movement. And more than once, Mr. Biden assured them he
understood — and kept telling the story anyway.

By that September, his recklessness as a candidate had caught up with
him. He was accused of plagiarizing in campaign speeches. He had
inflated his academic record. Reporters began calling out his
exaggerated youth activism.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’ve done some dumb things,” Mr. Biden conceded at a stop-the-bleeding
news conference at the Capitol. “And I’ll do dumb things again.”

He vowed that day to fight on. He quit the race within a week.

Thirty-two years later, as Mr. Biden seeks the presidency for a third
time, his disastrous campaign for the 1988 Democratic nomination offers
a revealing look at the personal tics and political flaws of the
front-runner in the 2020 race — traits that, in many ways, continue to
color Mr. Biden’s public life.

Mr. Biden was, and remains, a “gut politician,” as he has long told
associates — swaggering, ad-libbing, liable to get carried away in front
of a crowd. Already this year, he has [boasted of his purportedly
peerless foreign policy

Biden allies insist this run will succeed where his others failed. His
discipline has improved, they say. He is now widely known and admired in
the Democratic Party, affording him more latitude for slip-ups. For the
first time, he enters the race as a genuine favorite, requiring no
introduction.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But interviews with top advisers and confidants from then and now help
explain how Mr. Biden came to see himself as presidential material in
the first place, and suggest that the central tensions and
vulnerabilities laid bare during Biden ’88 remain the most urgent
questions at the core of Biden 2020:

Can he credibly present himself as a man in step with the times without
sounding off-key or stretching the truth, as he did while gilding his
1960s-era biography?

Can he win while mounting another campaign premised as much on personal
characteristics — his decency, his integrity, his presumed electability
— as any particular policy platform?

In both the 1988 race and today, Mr. Biden has seemed to see the nation
at a turning point, in need of a particular kind of leader.

During his first run, he liked to say that presidential history ran in
cycles: bursts of progress and upheaval, followed by periods of
correction in which voters choose a candidate who can “let America catch
its breath.”

His implication then, as a 44-year-old senator from Delaware, was that
he belonged to the first group of political figures: the sprightly
agitators. His pitch this time, as a septuagenarian two-term vice
president, places him firmly in the second camp: He is now the
stabilizing statesman, in his telling, poised to deliver the nation from
the Trumpian tumult.

“It’s kind of funny in retrospect,” said Mike Lux, a top Biden aide in
Iowa in 1988. “A lot of the message was based on sort of ‘time for
generational change.’ Now, he is sort of the opposite of the changing of
the guard.”

These days, Mr. Biden, whose campaign declined to make him available for
an interview, keeps an understated schedule, holding far fewer events
than most rivals. But in his first race, his candidacy could feel like
an exercise in performative stamina — sustained by an uncommon talent
for talk-until-they-leave speechifying and an oversize bottle of Tylenol
that helped ease foreboding headaches on the road.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Storming across Iowa in a maroon and gray campaign van, Mr. Biden asked
his team to blast the “Les Misérables” cassette (*“One day morrrrrrre /
Another day, another destiny”*) because it helped him think. At events,
he would smile almost mockingly at staff members signaling for him to
wrap up, long after they had handed reporters prewritten text with a
semi-wry warning in capital letters atop the page: “Senator may stray
from prepared
remarks.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The downsides of this high-intensity approach became clear in time.
Oversubscribed and running himself ragged — presidential contender,
Senate committee chairman, father of teenagers — Mr. Biden began making
the mistakes that would shape his enduring reputation for carelessness
in speech: loose talk, citation-free borrowing, outright misstatements.
(Twenty years later, he reinforced the trope [almost
immediately](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/us/politics/01biden.html)
upon entering the 2008 presidential race, giving an interview in which
he inelegantly called Barack Obama “the first mainstream
African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a
nice-looking
guy.”)

Other old habits have likewise persisted. Long before he hesitated on
campaign decisions before the 2016 and 2020 elections, Mr. Biden spent
much of his 1988 run doubting its very wisdom: Was the team ready? Was
he?

At one point before his official announcement, he asked his son Hunter
what to do.

“If you don’t do it now, I couldn’t see you doing it some other time,”
Hunter reasoned, according to a Time magazine article in 1987.

“Yeah,” Mr. Biden agreed. “That’s the
thing.”

## ‘I decided I could beat them’

For a while, Mr. Biden’s mouth was his best asset.

He had flirted with a run in 1984, establishing himself as an estimable
orator with a speech in Atlantic City invoking the deaths of President
John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “Just because
our political heroes were murdered,” he said, months before the 1984
primaries, “does not mean that the dream does not still live, buried
deep in our broken hearts.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The flourish seemed to signal the kind of candidate Mr. Biden hoped to
be four years later, when he decided to explore a run more seriously:
aspirational, of the times — but also a bit of a throwback, a bridge
between political moments.

While many Democrats weary of Reagan-era Republicanism envisioned their
party racing to the left, Mr. Biden chafed as some advisers nudged him
toward a kind of zealous populism, an imperfect fit for the candidate’s
within-the-system sensibility. “I wore *sport coats*,” Mr. Biden told
reporters once, explaining his limited involvement in antiwar fervor. “I
was not part of that.”

Presaging his current bet on political centrism, Mr. Biden appeared wary
of catering to the party’s base. Asked in February 1987 if Democrats’
success in the 1986 midterms showed that the country was becoming more
liberal, Mr. Biden gave an unqualified no. “I think my party would make
a big mistake if they read it that way,” he said.

Less clear to Mr. Biden was precisely what he did want to say. In his
2007 book, “Promises to Keep,” Mr. Biden wrote that his early message
felt “a bit opaque, like audiences were hearing me through a veil.”

He struggled to verbalize a campaign rationale that felt true to him, in
“words that felt absolutely authentic.” He went ahead anyway.

“I started looking at the race through the wrong prism,” he wrote. “I
looked around, judged myself against the other potential candidates for
the nomination, and by the beginning of 1987 I decided I could beat
them.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For a time, he had a case. On raw ability, few in the underwhelming
field — known derisively as “the seven dwarfs” in the political press —
could hope to match Mr. Biden, who quickly outpaced many of them in
crowd size and early
fund-raising.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rival camps took notice of Mr. Biden’s progress, viewing him as a
growing force in a primary race that included Gov. Michael Dukakis,
Representative Richard A. Gephardt and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. (Gary
Hart, a former senator and the early front-runner, [dropped
out](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/09/us/hart-drops-race-for-white-house-in-a-defiant-mood.html)
in the spring amid allegations of an extramarital affair.)

“He was going to be a problem,” Joe Trippi, a strategist who worked for
Mr. Hart and later Mr. Gephardt, said of Mr. Biden. “He always had that
ability to connect.”

Ever the tactile politician, Mr. Biden seemed to relish finding the
holdouts in an audience and trying to flip them. At one event in Iowa,
Mr. Biden came upon a woman who refused to turn to face him. He
approached from behind and continued the speech with his hands on her
shoulders. “The woman looked like she’d swallowed her tongue,” the
journalist Richard Ben Cramer wrote in “What It Takes,” his magisterial
book about the 1988 campaign.

Mr. Biden also engendered fierce loyalty on his team, growing close to
several aides who remain part of his extended political family. Staff
nicknames were assigned as a matter of course, “almost like ‘Animal
House,’” said John Anzalone (“Zo” to the candidate), a pollster who
worked on the 1988 campaign and has advised the current one.

But for all the enthusiasm on the ground, there were early signs of
indiscipline, starting at the top.

In February of 1987, Mr. Biden borrowed from a Robert Kennedy speech
without attribution, later saying the remarks had been written for him;
the incident initially went unreported. In April — as one of his
headaches flared, Mr. Biden would later recall — a camera crew caught
him berating a New Hampshire man who asked about his academic history.

“I probably have a much higher I.Q. than you do, I suspect,” Mr. Biden
shot back, before exaggerating his record in school. The clip did not
initially find wide circulation.

By June, on the eve of his planned kickoff, Mr. Biden was still unsure
if he wanted to run at all.

“He said, ‘I just don’t feel right about this,’” recalled Ted Kaufman, a
longtime adviser and close friend who briefly succeeded Mr. Biden in the
Senate when he became vice president.

It was left to Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill, to talk him down: Too many
people, she said, had already committed too much to the cause.

The campaign summoned reporters to Wilmington, Del., for a special
announcement.

## Hints of a troubling pattern  

Much of Mr. Biden’s reluctance owed to concerns about balancing his
duties in Washington. He was right to be worried.

Within weeks of Mr. Biden’s official entry, President Ronald Reagan
[nominated](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/bork-picked-for-high-court-reagan-cites-his-restraint-confirmation-fight-looms.html)
Judge Robert H. Bork, an unflinching conservative, to the Supreme Court.
Mr. Biden, leading the Senate committee overseeing the confirmation
process, was gifted a high-profile showcase, with the court’s balance at
stake.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Quickly, though, the drawbacks of this ostensible political blessing
became clear: His Senate work was dividing his attention and limiting
his preparation for campaign events.

The first major primary debate came just after Mr. Bork’s nomination,
and Mr. Biden has said he was plainly distracted. Reviews were unkind.
“Unless we ditch television for the remainder of the campaign,” [wrote
Tom
Shales](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/07/03/the-diverting-democrats/7d31e08c-fcd3-4cd7-8006-f0ab5b135ea5/?utm_term=.ff508010ed4e)
of The Washington Post, “Biden will never be president.”

A debate in Iowa the next month would prove far more damaging. On the
drive to the venue, Mr. Biden found himself without a closing statement.
An aide, David Wilhelm, suggested he repurpose something that had been
working well on the trail: a refrain — credited to Neil Kinnock, the
British Labour Party leader — about giving citizens “a platform upon
which to stand,” with anecdotes from Mr. Kinnock’s family of Welsh coal
miners.

Not long before, Mr. Biden had received a videotape of Mr. Kinnock’s
remarks from Bill Schneider, a writer and political commentator. The
candidate instantly admired their emotional power. At campaign events,
Mr. Biden had repeatedly attributed Mr. Kinnock’s words properly. At the
debate, compressing his closing argument into the allotted time, he did
not.

“It was an unremarkable moment to me,” Mr. Wilhelm said. “Shows how much
I know.”

Rivals knew better. With a nudge from the Dukakis campaign, several news
outlets, including [The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/12/us/biden-s-debate-finale-an-echo-from-abroad.html),
The Des Moines Register and NBC News, reported weeks later on Mr.
Biden’s lifted passages.

He has suggested his whole life might have changed if he had said two
words on the debate stage: “Like Kinnock …”

But the criticism ran deeper than finger-wagging about proper citation.
The burgeoning scandal seemed to confirm a persistent critique of Mr.
Biden: that he lacked his own vision, his own story to tell.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“He talked as if the details of Kinnock’s background were details of his
own,” Mr. Schneider said. At the debate, Mr. Biden had implied that he
descended from coal miners, like Mr. Kinnock did. (Years later, as Mr.
Biden sought the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Schneider
recalled encountering him shortly after a primary debate. Mr. Biden had
not forgotten Mr. Schneider’s role in the fateful Kinnock affair. “Got
any hot videotapes?” the candidate joked.)

Perhaps most concerning for his 1988 campaign, news accounts began to
hint at a troubling pattern in Mr. Biden’s behavior. The San Jose
Mercury News flagged his failure to cite Robert Kennedy. Newsweek wrote
about the video of Mr. Biden insulting a voter while misstating his
academic record. And that record, according to a rash of new reports,
included an episode of plagiarism in law school.

“It was a tsunami,” Valerie Biden Owens, his sister and longtime top
campaign adviser, said in a recent interview.

Aides believed that reporters — perhaps emboldened by the sensational
fall of Mr. Hart — were overhyping Mr. Biden’s misdeeds. Top advisers
insist to this day that their candidate’s sins were minor, and that he
was wronged.

On Sept. 17, Mr. Biden [called a news
conference](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/18/us/biden-admits-plagiarism-in-school-but-says-it-was-not-malevolent.html)
at the Capitol to explain himself. By turns contrite and simmering, he
said the law school citation issue was not “malevolent.” He took
responsibility for not knowing that he was using Mr. Kennedy’s words in
the February speech. He acknowledged that he had forgotten to cite Mr.
Kinnock at the debate. And he seemed to seethe at reporters’ questions
about the extent of his activism on civil rights and Vietnam.

“I find y’all going back and saying, ‘Well, where were you, Senator
Biden, at the time?’ — you know, I think it’s bizarre,” Mr. Biden said,
adding: “Other people marched. I ran for office.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said he had no plans to drop out.

“I am in this race to stay, I am in this race to win,” he said. “And
here I
come.”

## An excruciating decision

And there he went.

Initially, Mr. Biden convinced himself there was a way to do it all:
defend his name, win the Bork fight, charge into primary season.

“This would have passed,” said Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Biden’s longtime
adviser. “Most of it had no substance to it.”

Others were less certain. Congressional supporters asked Mr. Biden if
they should expect more shoes to drop. “I just, honest to God, don’t
know,” he said, according to Mr. Cramer’s “What It Takes.”

As the campaign team convened in Mr. Biden’s Wilmington living room,
most saw no choice but to quit. Mr. Biden’s eldest son, Beau, then a
college freshman, argued the other side, saying that exiting the race
would validate the allegations.

Mark Gitenstein, a top aide on the Judiciary Committee, feared that Mr.
Biden’s flagging reputation might imperil the Senate vote if he did not
end his candidacy: “If we win Bork, it will be in spite of us,” he told
Mr. Biden, according to Mr. Biden’s book. “If we lose now, it’s going to
be because of us.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Biden had his advisers draft a statement. Reporters were told to
gather at the Capitol for an announcement, six days after the last one.

“With incredible reluctance,” Mr. Biden told them, he was [ending his
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/24/us/biden-withdraws-bid-for-president-in-wake-of-furor.html).

“It’s time for me to assess my mistakes and make sure I don’t make them
again,” he said, while also lamenting “the environment of presidential
politics” that had allowed his biography to be reduced to a few
missteps.

He collected himself. “Lest I say something that might be somewhat
sarcastic,” Mr. Biden said, “I should go to the Bork hearing.”

Within weeks, he would [help defeat the Bork
nomination](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/politics/borks-nomination-is-rejected-5842-reagan-saddened.html),
paving the way for a more moderate choice, Justice Anthony Kennedy, to
join the court.

Within months, he was hitting the speaking circuit again, cautiously
going about repairing his image, even as he smarted over how the
campaign had collapsed.

That is how Mr. Biden found himself in Rochester in February 1988,
settling into his hotel room after a speech. Only snippets remain
memorable to him now: mulling a late-night pizza delivery, waking up on
the floor some time later, straining to understand the impossible
pounding in his head — “something like lightning flashing,” Mr. Biden
wrote in his book.

An aneurysm.

Mr. Biden made it back to Wilmington, weak and gray, before it was
diagnosed. He was hustled to a hospital, where family members gathered.
A priest was called in to administer last rites.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That would prove premature. And after surgery, the family developed a
grand theory of it all — the campaign, the scare, the cosmic plan for
Joe Biden.

In his book, Mr. Biden recalled a conversation with his wife as he was
recovering. The emergency had come in the middle of the primary
calendar, she reminded him. He would have been going full blast across
New Hampshire, campaigning like his life depended on it.

“Would I have stopped long enough for treatment?” Mr. Biden wrote.
“Would I have tried to push through the pain?”

Both of them seemed to know the answer: One loss had prevented a bigger
one.
