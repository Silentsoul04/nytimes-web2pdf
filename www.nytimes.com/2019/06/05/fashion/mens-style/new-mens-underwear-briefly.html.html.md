Here’s a news flash: Guys don’t like shopping for underwear. Luckily,
the same retail forces that disrupted razors, eyeglasses, luggage,
mattresses and hair-loss treatments, have set their sights on men’s
drawers.

In the last decade, a handful of upstart labels are trying to dethrone
old faithfuls like Hanes and Calvin Klein. Hate going to the store? Buy
direct online. Forget to replenish worn-out pairs? Get a subscription.
Can’t choose? Buy several and return rejects for free.

Newcomers like Tommy John and CDLP are also using high-tech fabrics that
promise to stay dry, odor free and comfortable, even in swampy
conditions.

Still can’t decide? We gave six upstart brands a test run, so you don’t
have to.

Founded a decade ago, Tommy John is the Harry’s Razor of the men’s
underwear market, with more than six million pairs sold through its
website or at big American retailers like Men’s Wearhouse and Nordstrom.

**Aha Moment:** Aren’t billowing undershirts the worst? That’s what Tom
Patterson, a former medical device salesman from San Diego, thought
whenever his undershirts would bunch up under his suits. In 2008, with
zero background in clothing, he and Erin Fujimoto (then his girlfriend,
now his wife) designed the [Stay-Tucked
Undershirt](https://tommyjohn.com/products/second-skin-crew-neck-stay-tucked-undershirt-2-0)
with a tapered profile made of Micro Modal, a silky fabric derived from
beech trees. Underwear soon followed.

**Target Guy:** No-nonsense dudes who don’t aspire to be [Shawn
Mendes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PZjo7tpb1w)

**Sales Twist:** Satisfaction guaranteed for first pair (“the best pair
you’ll ever wear or it’s free”).

**Test Drive:** The “horizontal fly” is like a trap door for your
privates. Odd and hysterical at first, but surprisingly functional. ($25
to $45)

If Tommy John is the market leader among these upstarts, Mack Weldon is
its techier brother. Primarily an e-commerce brand, the New York company
recently opened its first shop, at Hudson Yards.

**Aha Moment:** Brian Berger, a former business executive for WebMD, saw
how Lululemon had revolutionized athleisure wear and wondered why the
same had not been done for men’s underwear. So he took gym-friendly
fabrics (breathable, antimicrobial and moisture wicking) and applied
them to boxers and briefs.

**Target Guy:** Tech bros who care more about performance than fashion.

**Sales Twist:** Satisfaction guaranteed for [first
pair](https://help.mackweldon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000864934-What-is-your-Try-On-Guarantee-).
“Loyalty” [members](https://www.mackweldon.com/loyalty) whose spending
reaches $200 get free shipping, 20 percent discount and gifts. Send back
old pairs for [recycling](https://www.mackweldon.com/recycle).

**Test Drive:** The [Airknitx boxer
briefs](https://www.mackweldon.com/products/airknitx-boxer-brief) stayed
dry and ventilated, even after 60 minutes of treadmill and squats at
Barry’s Bootcamp. ($24 to $38)

Instagram savvy, socially woke and unabashedly cheeky, MeUndies is a
case study in millennial marketing. Based in Culver City, Calif., the
company specializes in zany and cartoonish designs that feels like
Underoos for adults.

**Aha Moment:** Jonathan Shokrian, an entrepreneur from Los Angeles, got
the idea for MeUndies while buying underwear for a European vacation at
the mall. He was dismayed by the experience, and a friend on the trip,
[Jonathan
Neman](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/fashion/mens-style/sweetgreens-jonathan-neman-on-ditching-his-car-and-phone.html),
a founder of Sweetgreen, urged him to start his own company. Mr.
Shokrian did, as a subscription service to spare other men from the
mall.

**Target Guy:** Guys who want their underwear to reflect their sparkly
personalities.

**Sales Twist:** Get a fresh pair delivered every month. Also, free
shipping and returns.

**Test Drive:** Warning: if you wear a pair of boxer briefs with
fire-breathing dragons, it will invite conversation from strangers at
the gym, or wherever people can spy your underwear. ($18 to $24)

Nothing says preppy like monogrammed socks, except maybe monogrammed
underwear. That seems to be the thinking behind Nice Laundry, a New York
label that started with athletic, formal and no-show socks, before
adding boxer briefs to its lineup in 2016.

**Aha Moment:** Ricky Choi and Phil Moldavski were working at
LivingSocial, an online marketplace in Washington, D.C., when they
bonded over socks. Mr. Choi, who attended St. Albans School, a prep
school in Washington, liked how his friend dressed (slim jeans, nice
shirt, dark shoes) but was horrified by his ratty old gym socks. They
found their entrepreneurial calling.

**Target Guy:** Possessive prepsters who want to keep track of their
undies.

**Sales Twist:** Free shipping and returns. Old pairs can be sent back
for [recycling](https://www.nicelaundry.com/pages/refresh-recycle).

**Test Drive:** Soft and lounge-y, like that perfectly worn pair of
underwear you love, minus the fraying and holes. ($22 to $34)

Designed in Stockholm, made in Portugal and marketed as earth-friendly,
CDLP started three years ago and became a fashion favorite. The brand is
sold through its website and is carried by influential retailers like
Selfridges, Mr Porter and Barneys New York.

**Aha Moment:** CDLP was founded by two fashionable Swedes — Christian
Larson, a filmmaker and music video director; and Andreas Palm, founder
of a branding agency — who thought that the men’s underwear market
lacked something elegant and eco-friendly.

**Target Guy:** Nordic hipsters with six-pack abs, and effortlessly cool
creative types from Brooklyn.

**Sales Twist:** Free shipping on orders above $69.

**Test Drive:** Silky and sexy, not unlike women’s lingerie, though
geared for men with swagger (not to mention flat stomachs). ($29 to $39;
nine-packs start at $195)

Inspired by the shape of catcher’s mitt, [SAXX
Underwear](https://re-invented.saxxunderwear.com/) features a
hammock-like compartment that offers extra support and cradles and
breathes. The brand appeals to outdoorsy types and is carried by REI and
LL Bean.

**Aha Moment:** During a fishing trip in Alaska, Trent Kitsch, a former
college baseball player living in Vancouver, British Columbia, spent
four days getting chafed by his clammy underwear. He seized on the idea
of an athletic cup and, while still in college, secured a $20,000
student loan and hired a seamstress to create a dozen prototypes.

**Target Guy:** Active bros prone to chafing and discomfort.

**Sales Twist:** 30-day satisfaction
[guarantee](https://www.saxxunderwear.com/pages/comfort-guarantee).

**Test Drive:** Having fabric flaps cradle your nether region is both
strange and comforting. ($24 to $40)
