In a San Francisco courtroom a few weeks ago, Facebook’s lawyers said
the quiet part out loud: Users have no reasonable expectation of
privacy.

The admission came from Orin Snyder, a lawyer representing Facebook in a
litigation stemming from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In a court
transcript, first surfaced by
[Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1164091/facebook-says-social-media-users-can-t-expect-privacy)
and later uploaded in full by Sam Biddle at [The
Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2019/06/14/facebook-privacy-policy-court/),
Snyder and U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria debate what has become an
existential platform question: Does posting, even to a small group of
friends, on social media mean that a user is forfeiting all expectation
of privacy? Yes, Facebook argues:

> There is no privacy interest, because by sharing with a hundred
> friends on a social media platform, which is an affirmative social act
> to publish, to disclose, to share ostensibly private information with
> a hundred people, you have just, under centuries of common law, under
> the judgment of Congress, under the SCA, negated any reasonable
> expectation of privacy.

The judge pushed back, suggesting that if a user had painstakingly
tweaked her privacy settings so that only a tight-knit group could see
her posts, it would be a privacy violation if “Facebook actually
disseminated the photographs and the likes and the posts to hundreds of
companies.” But Snyder didn’t budge, suggesting that sharing any
information with even one human being negates an expectation of privacy.

The [entire transcript is worth a
read](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6153329-05-29-2019-Facebook-Inc-Consumer-Privacy.html),
but this rebuttal from Judge Chhabria set up what I think might be one
of the most revealing exchanges with a tech company representative in
recent memory:

**Chhabria:** You seem to be treating \[privacy\] as a binary thing,
like either you have a full expectation of privacy or you have no
expectation of privacy at all. And I don’t understand why we should
think of it in that way.

**Snyder:** Because, Your Honor, what the plaintiffs are doing here and
what Your Honor’s hypothetical suggests is a brand-new right of privacy
that has never been recognized before.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A generous reading of Synder’s response is that Facebook’s hands are
tied by the legal understanding of privacy. But I’d argue that Facebook
is hiding behind an antiquated definition of the word. Other industry
observers have noticed this recently, too. In a blog post last week,
[Maciej Ceglowski
suggested](https://idlewords.com/2019/06/the_new_wilderness.htm) that
the reason companies like Google and Facebook have taken pro-privacy
positions lately is they’re not talking about the status quo but,
instead, about this outdated definition of privacy. “That language,
especially as it is codified in law, is not adequate for the new reality
of ubiquitous, mechanized surveillance,” Ceglowski wrote.

Ceglowski offered up a different definition, which he calls “ambient
privacy.” Basically, it’s “the understanding that there is value in
having our everyday interactions with one another remain outside the
reach of monitoring, and that the small details of our daily lives
should pass by unremembered.”

There is no such ambient privacy in Facebook’s world, as evidenced by
the transcript. And for good reason. The very notion of ambient privacy
is an existential threat to Big Tech’s business model. Take away that
which violates the ambient privacy and what’s left is not Facebook.

Facebook and the rest of Big Tech built their empires by prioritizing
innovation and embracing a mind-set that enormous, systemic challenges
([“solving
death](https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2152422,00.html),”
[driverless cars,](https://waymo.com/) [bringing the world closer
together](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/bring-the-world-closer-together/))
can be solved through processing power, code and a reimagining of what’s
possible. It’s a mentality that treats complex physical world issues as
software; everything can be updated.

And yet, Snyder and Facebook appear gobsmacked by the idea of Privacy
2.0 and creating a new definition that reflects the way the tech giants
have altered its very meaning. It’s yet another example of what has
become the dismal reality of Silicon Valley: They’re very excited to fix
big problems, as long as they’re not problems that they created.

In the spirit of expectations of privacy, this week’s archive pick is a
[February 1998
editorial](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/09/opinion/police-cameras-in-the-park.html)
on a decision to put cameras in New York’s Washington Square Park. The
similarities to today’s debates on surveillance are striking.

> Even though there is generally no expectation of privacy in a public
> space, most people expect freedom from government monitoring when they
> eat lunch on a park bench or stroll down a street. The growing use of
> police video monitors in New York City may threaten the free and
> anonymous nature of public space …
> 
> Before Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
> expand video monitoring to cover more areas of the city, there needs
> to be significant public debate about the wisdom of 24-hour
> videotaping of lawful movement.

Sounds a bit like the arguments that led to [San Francisco’s ban on
facial
recognition](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco.html)
technology, no?

Chaser: This piece 10 months later, [in
December 1998](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/nyregion/secret-surveillance-cameras-growing-in-city-report-says.html),
about more cameras infiltrating New York.

> Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has endorsed the use of video surveillance
> to enhance public safety. His Police Commissioner, Howard Safir, said
> yesterday that such cameras had proven to be “incredibly effective,”
> cutting crime by 30 percent to 50 percent in public housing projects …
> 
> “You have no right to privacy in a public place,” Commissioner Safir
> added, and “no court order is required” to use cameras.

Makes for an interesting comparison with a [2019 Op-Ed from New York’s
police
commissioner](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/opinion/facial-recognition-police-new-york-city.html?action=click&module=privacy%20footer%20recirc%20module&pgtype=Article)

## Tip of the Week: How to Protect From Bluetooth Snooping

*Today’s tip comes from our Opinion graphics director, Stuart Thompson.*

In a [new piece for Sunday
Review](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/14/opinion/bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html),
Michael Kwet of Yale Law School writes how grocery stores, sports
stadiums and other brick-and-mortar venues are using small
Bluetooth-powered devices called beacons to monitor where you go.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The devices work by sending out constant wireless Bluetooth signals,
which get picked up by your phone’s Bluetooth receiver and can “wake up”
apps on your phone — even when those [apps are
closed](https://docs.gimbal.com/proximity_overview.html#wakeup_app). The
apps record your movements, monitoring whether you lingered by the
low-fat ice cream, for example, and transmit your location to
third-party companies for analysis.

How do you protect yourself from this kind of Bluetooth snooping?

For iOS users, the solution might seem simple: Slide up from the bottom
of your screen and press the Bluetooth icon to turn it off. Easy, right?
Except that’s [not what those buttons
do](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/25/17041440/bluetooth-location-tracking-iphone-android-privacy).
In
[2017](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/apple-clarifies-what-control-center-wi-fi-bluetooth-toggles-do-in-ios-11-2-beta/),
Apple clarified that instead of turning Bluetooth off, the button only
disconnects existing Bluetooth devices — and only for one day. The same
is true for the nearby button controlling Wi-Fi, which can also be used
for tracking.

Apple gives one pop-up notice explaining how it works the first time you
use the button. But afterward, you only see a small warning at the top
of the screen. The Bluetooth antenna remains active on your phone, so
any app with beacon technology installed could still monitor your
location if you haven’t configured your phone properly.

Apple users can turn off Bluetooth entirely by going to Settings \>
Bluetooth and sliding the big button at the top to the “off” position.
(You can turn off Apple’s own location tracking — as well as location
tracking by specific apps — by toggling options in Settings \> Location
Services.) To turn off Bluetooth tracking entirely on Android phones,
make sure [you shut off](https://qz.com/1169760/phone-data/) both
Bluetooth and Location History. But keep in mind turning these functions
back on can reactivate Bluetooth tracking.

## What I’m Reading

The [wildest privacy piece I read last
week](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/laliga-app-spied-on-users-earning-soccer-league-a-fine.html)
is about how a Spanish soccer league’s app is “using their microphones
and location data to listen in and find bars that were pirating streams
of soccer games.”

Some of the Hong Kong protesters are “going dark” to prevent being
surveilled while demonstrating. [Here’s how they’re doing
it](https://www.france24.com/en/20190613-surveillance-savvy-hong-kong-protesters-go-digitally-dark).
