WASHINGTON — Mark T. Esper is a 1986 graduate of West Point, where his
classmates included Mike Pompeo, now the secretary of state. He was an
Army infantryman who fought in the gulf war. He went on to work for a
conservative think tank, then as a lobbyist for one of the nation’s
largest military contractors.

And on Tuesday he was abruptly elevated from his job as Army secretary
to be acting defense secretary, becoming the third person to lead the
Pentagon under President Trump.

Mr. Esper, 55, was catapulted into the role after Patrick Shanahan
[stepped down as acting
secretary](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/patrick-shanahan-defense-secretary.html)
amid revelations about domestic abuse charges in his family and
questions about whether he could be confirmed. Mr. Trump did not say
whether he intended to nominate Mr. Esper to the role permanently, but
in remarks to reporters on Monday, he seemed to give him strong backing.

“Mark Esper is going to be outstanding, and we look forward to working
with him for a long period of time to come,” Mr. Trump said, calling him
“a highly respected gentleman with a great career — West Point, Harvard,
a tremendous talent.”

He is taking over at a time of heightened tensions with Iran, questions
about the role of the United States military on the southwestern border
and debate over national security strategy.

After graduating from West Point, Mr. Esper served in the Army, the Army
Reserve and National Guard in some capacity for more than [two
decades](https://www.army.mil/leaders/sa/bio/?from=wiki). He went on to
the conservative Heritage Foundation and a series of jobs on Capitol
Hill and in the Pentagon. Mr. Esper ended up at Raytheon, a major
military contractor, as the vice president for government relations in
2010.

Mr. Shanahan’s 30-year career at Boeing, the nation’s largest aerospace
company, complicated his nomination, and Mr. Esper’s tenure as
Raytheon’s top lobbyist could leave him facing a similar issue.

In his [2017 confirmation
hearing](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/17-86_11-02-17.pdf),
Mr. Esper said he “spent an overwhelming majority of my time on the
business-end of the company,” but he was personally involved on several
Raytheon contracts, including the radar of the Patriot
surface-to-air-missile system, a key piece of hardware used extensively
by the American military and its allies, including Saudi Arabia and
South Korea.

Despite the potential ethical issues, top Republican lawmakers quickly
championed Mr. Esper’s appointment.

Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, praised Mr. Esper and said he believed
that he was the most likely choice to be nominated.

“I’ve known him for a long time. I think he’s good — in fact, I’ve been
in the field with him to see how he does with troops,” Mr. Inhofe said.
“He does an exceptionally good job.”

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, echoed Mr. Inhofe,
saying he was a good choice, “knows him well” and could vote for him as
a permanent secretary of defense “without equivocation.”

Mr. Esper will take responsibility of one of the largest militaries in
the world as the Trump administration navigates how it will confront
Iran, end the war in Afghanistan and negotiate with Turkey as the
longtime ally of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization moves to buy a
controversial missile system from Russia.

And on Monday, the Pentagon [said it was sending 1,000 more
troops](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-compliance.html)
to the Middle East to bolster security for American forces in the region
after the White House accused Iran of [attacking two tankers in the Gulf
of
Oman](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/world/middleeast/gulf-oman-tanker-attack.html)
last week.

According to a defense official, Mr. Esper’s office was caught off guard
by Mr. Trump’s decision to pick him as acting defense secretary. He
received a phone call from the White House only hours before Mr. Trump
tweeted that Mr. Shanahan was resigning.

As Army secretary, Mr. Esper has pushed to modernize the Army with goals
much in line with the National Defense Strategy announced last year
under the defense secretary at the time, Jim Mattis.

In the Army’s 2020 proposed budget, Mr. Esper moved to cut [legacy
programs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/army-plans-to-cut-back-on-legacy-gear-in-a-push-for-new-tech-11552410807)
such as the CH-47 Chinook helicopter and the M2 Bradley Fighting
vehicle, two mainstays in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, in a move to
better align the Army to fight in great power conflicts with countries
like Russia and China.
