Pete Buttigieg [met his
husband](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/fashion/weddings/mayor-peter-buttigieg-wedding-democratic-party.html)
on a dating app called Hinge. And although that’s unique among
presidential candidates, it’s not unique for Mr. Buttigieg’s generation
— he’s 37 — or other members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community.

In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that use of online dating apps
among young adults had [tripled in three
years](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/5-facts-about-online-dating/),
and nearly six in 10 adults of all ages thought apps were a good way to
meet someone. The rates are higher among queer people, many of whom turn
to digital spaces when stigma, discrimination and long distances make
face-to-face interaction difficult. One study
[reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754360) that in 2013
more than one million gay and bisexual men logged in to a dating app
every day and sent more than seven million messages and two million
photos over
all.

Privacy over our [sexual
selves](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/sexual-privacy) protects
our dignity and autonomy. It allows us to speak our minds and maintain
social relationships. But for queer people, privacy is uniquely
important. Because employers in [29
states](https://www.hrc.org/state-maps/employment) can fire workers
simply for being gay or transgender, privacy with respect to our sexual
orientations and gender identities protects our livelihoods. Privacy can
also make us safer, especially with [anti-queer hate
crimes](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/anti-lgbtq-hate-crimes-rose-3-percent-17-fbi-finds-n936166)
increasing. Privacy lets us both “come out” in our own time and, once we
do, live our best lives out and proud, and modest changes in design and
in the law of platform liability can help us achieve and maintain the
privacy we need to survive and thrive.

The frequency with which queer people using social media, generally, and
mobile dating apps, in particular, amplifies the privacy concerns we
face compared with the general population. All digital dating platforms
require significant disclosure. Selfies and other personal information
are the currencies on which someone decides whether to swipe right or
left, or click a heart, or send a message. But the demand for disclosure
is powerful among gay people. In one peer-reviewed
[study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/law-privacy-and-online-dating-revenge-porn-in-gay-online-communities/BCCE05CF25AA4C2E05CCF8D64980E839/core-reader),
87.4 percent of gay male app users reported sharing “graphic, explicit
or nude photos or videos” of themselves, higher than among those looking
for opposite-sex relationships.

*\[If you use technology, someone is using your information. We’ll tell
you how — and what you can do about it.* [*Sign up for our limited-run
newsletter*](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)*.\]*

Sometimes, the disclosure can cause real pain. [Matthew
Herrick](https://www.cagoldberglaw.com/matthew-herrick-v-grindr-llc/), a
gay man from New York, was stalked and harassed by his ex on the
geosocial app Grindr. His intimate images were disseminated without his
consent, and over 1,000 men were sent to his home and place of business
looking for sex. In 2017, two North Carolina high school students
[created a fake
profile](http://www.towleroad.com/2017/05/catfish-teacher/) and
solicited a nude photo from their teacher, and then distributed the
picture throughout the school. The teacher was at first suspended and
then transferred. And 14.5 percent of gay and bisexual men who use
geosocial dating apps
[report](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/law-privacy-and-online-dating-revenge-porn-in-gay-online-communities/BCCE05CF25AA4C2E05CCF8D64980E839/core-reader)
that someone has shared their intimate images without their consent.
These stories are extreme, but not isolated: striking stories of
extortion, race-based sexual harassment, catfishing and revenge porn are
common on queer dating platforms.

Maintaining privacy in this environment seems difficult. Many people
think we can’t. They blame victims for sharing intimate images, as if
victims are responsible for the bad behavior of their abusers. I
disagree. The problem isn’t online dating or the hard-earned
[freedom](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/558/) queer
people have to live our lives out and proud. It’s the law, or lack
thereof, that contributes to app designs that put our privacy at risk.

Over the past three years, I have studied the designs of different
queer-oriented dating platforms and surveyed and interviewed hundreds of
users. These individuals were diverse on multiple metrics: race, gender,
age, geographic location and apps used. They used dating apps for
different reasons, too, from long-term companionship or friendship to
sex or idle chat. And they had varying degrees of success. Some had
since deleted their accounts; many had not.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Other than their queerness, many shared similar thoughts and strategies
about sharing personal information in an environment with strong
disclosure norms. A plurality felt that sharing intimate images was
impliedly necessary, with the pressure to disclose particularly strong
among gay men. Stephen P., a gay app user from Boston, noted that “if
you don’t share photos, you can’t really participate.” Jason R. admitted
that “it’s the culture; \[it’s\] hard to avoid.” Others shared photos to
verify their identity to others, while some shared photos in the name of
sex positivity.

Despite this, significant majorities share with the expectation that
their images will not be disseminated further. And many take steps to
determine the trustworthiness of the people they meet online. Some
anonymize their photos, sending intimate images without faces or other
identifying characteristics. Many only share photos, graphic or
otherwise, after “chatting with the other person” for some time —
ranging from a few hours to a few weeks — sufficient to “develop a
rapport” or, as Jared S. responded, “feel somewhat comfortable with the
other person.” Often, users share intimate photos only after another
user has shared with them, maintaining power in a social exchange for as
long as possible and relying on reciprocity and mutual vulnerability to
reduce the likelihood of bad behavior. And many rely on the comfort and
familiarity of an app’s exclusive queerness. John H. noted that “someone
who is also gay, also about the same age, also single, also lonely, also
looking for the same thing you’re looking for, just seems less likely to
hurt you than someone else who doesn’t share the same personal
narrative.”

These strategies help develop trust among users, which facilitates
disclosure. [But trust cannot operate
alone](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3278719). The
design of the platforms — the socially constructed processes and code
that make them function — and the laws governing behavior of users on
the platforms have to work together to buttress trust norms and ensure
our safety.

Right now, the law isn’t helping. Tort law, the regime we use to seek
damages from harassers, has been ineffectual because many courts look at
[gay
people](https://www.law.uw.edu/wlr/print-edition/print-edition/vol-93/4/skinner-thompson)
sharing selfies and conclude that they gave up their privacy the moment
they clicked “send.” Despite the tireless work of
[advocates](https://www.cybercivilrights.org/), we’ve only just
introduced a federal revenge porn bill. And the federal law we do have,
Communications Decency Act Section 230, immunizes digital platforms from
most legal liability associated with the bad behavior of their users.
That means that dating apps can ignore hundreds of complaints from their
users about harassment, racism and invasions of privacy. They know no
one is going to punish them for their negligence.

That makes us entirely dependent on the design choices of the platforms
themselves. [Hinge made a
commitment](https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/pete-chasten-buttigieg-hinge-marriage-dating-app-president.html)
to privacy by designing in automatic deletion of all communications the
moment users delete their accounts. Scruff, another gay-oriented app,
makes it easy to flag offending accounts within the app and claims to
respond to all complaints within 24 hours. Grindr, on the other hand,
ignored 100 complaints from Mr. Herrick about his harassment. [If, as
scholars have argued, Section 230 had a good-faith
threshold](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol86/iss2/3/), broad
immunity would be granted only to those digital platforms that deserve
it.

Privacy isn’t anathematic to online dating. Users want it, and they try
hard to maintain it. The problem isn’t sharing intimate selfies, no
matter what victim-blamers would have us believe. The problem is the law
permits the development of apps that are unsafe by design.
