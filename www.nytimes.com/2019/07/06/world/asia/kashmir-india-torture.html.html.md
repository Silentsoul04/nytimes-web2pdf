RAWALPORA, Kashmir — Mohammad Ishaq Lone got a call from the Indian Army
one February night, ordering him to meet soldiers at an outpost near his
house in Kashmir. It was only after he was hauled off to a brightly lit
room, bound and beaten that he discovered why.

A soldier began by punching him in the face, drawing blood, Mr. Lone
said. Another smacked him with a metal rod and began demanding that he
disclose the whereabouts of his brother, who had left home months
earlier to join militants waging a campaign to separate Kashmir from
Indian rule.

Mr. Lone, a pharmacist with two young children, begged them to stop,
saying he did not know where his brother had gone. He recalled screaming
for help before losing consciousness.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“The world around me was collapsing,” he said.

As tensions with the Indian authorities in Kashmir have sharply
increased, Kashmiris are calling for an international investigation into
accounts of abuse and torture by the security
forces.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to[a lengthy new report from Kashmiri
activists](http://jkccs.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TORTURE-Indian-State%E2%80%99s-Instrument-of-Control-in-Indian-administered-Jammu-and-Kashmir.pdf),
thousands of civilians have been summarily arrested and then abused in
[Kashmir](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/world/asia/india-pakistan-crisis.html),
the center of a long and bitter territorial dispute between India and
Pakistan.

Released in May by rights groups in Srinagar, the capital of the
Indian-administered part of Kashmir, the report profiles 432 victims of
torture in detention since 1990.

It includes accounts alleging that Indian security forces had hung
Kashmiris by their wrists, shocked them, forced them to stare at
high-voltage lamps and dunked them in water mixed with chili powder.
Most were civilians accused of having information about militants, the
report said, and 49 of them died during or after being tortured.

In interviews with The New York Times, more than two dozen Kashmiris,
including 15 whose cases are included in the report, shared similar
accounts. The Times reviewed hospital documents and spoke with victims’
relatives to help verify their stories.

Though some forms of torture are explicitly illegal in India, the report
found that security personnel got away with their actions in every case
because of [laws that give them broad
impunity](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/afspa-disagreement-jammu-and-kashmir-armed-militancy-cmp-bjp-pdp-281441-2015-07-09).

India has emphatically denied accusations of abuses in Kashmir. In an
interview, Dilbag Singh, the director general of the police in the
region, said the report was “generalizing things based on data that is
fake or fuzzed.”

In a written response, Lt. Col. Mohit Vaishnava, a spokesman for the
Indian Army, said last month that allegations of abuse were “false and
fabricated propaganda.”

According to data he sent, the Indian Army was aware of 1,052 alleged
human rights abuses between 1994 and May 31, 2019, in Jammu and Kashmir.
Every case was investigated, the data showed, with 997 of them found by
the army to be “false” or “baseless,” and punishment meted out to 70
personnel in other
cases.

Last year, the United Nations also [raised grave human rights
concerns](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/IN/DevelopmentsInKashmirJune2016ToApril2018.pdf)
in Kashmir, logging cases of torture, among other issues, while
detainees were in the custody of Indian security forces from June 2016
to April 2018.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs [wrote in a

that the United Nations’ findings played down wrongdoing by Pakistan in
spreading terror and were “fallacious, tendentious and motivated.”

Accusations of abuses have intensified as the Indian government has
hardened its crackdown against militants and protesters in recent years.

To disperse crowds of protesters, security forces have injured thousands
of people with pellet-firing shotguns. Civilian deaths rose over 200
percent from 2013 through 2018, when at least 160 people were killed,
including from interrogations, [activists
say](http://jkccs.net/2018-deadliest-year-of-the-decade-jkccs-annual-human-rights-review/).
And this year is [on
track](http://jkccs.net/six-monthly-hr-review-271-killings-177-casos-51-internet-blockades/)
to become one of the deadliest, overall, in the last
decade.

Parvez Imroz, the president of the Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil
Society, a group that co-authored the 550-page report on torture, said
the scope of abuse was even larger than the United Nations had reported.

The accusations have come amid a wave of detentions in Kashmir. [A
briefing released on
June 12](https://amnesty.org.in/news-update/amnesty-international-india-calls-for-the-repeal-of-jk-public-safety-act-in-a-new-briefing/)
from Amnesty International found that in the last few years, Indian
armed forces had detained many hundreds of civilians — including
journalists, activists and children — without charge or trial. The
arrests were made under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, which
activists say violates international human rights law.

“Fear is used as a weapon,” Mr. Imroz said.

In an interview with The Times, Nazir Ahmad Sheikh, 61, a farmer who was
featured in the report on torture, said soldiers accused him of being a
militant and detained him in 1994. He said they crushed his legs with a
heavy roller and then poured scalding hot water on them. The men then
forced him to open the lid of a coal heater with his bare hands at an
army camp in northern Kashmir, he said.

“The moment I touched it, some of my tortured and numb fingers fell to
the ground,” said Mr. Sheikh, who also lost both legs below the kneecap
and was forced to beg for money to survive after the ordeal. “A torture
chamber is like a dark well where you cry out loud and no one hears your
voice.”

Hundreds of Kashmiris have joined homegrown insurgency groups since
2016. And tensions reached a breaking point in February, when a suicide
vehicle bombing struck a convoy of Indian paramilitary forces, killing
at least 40 of them. It set off [a tense military
standoff](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/world/asia/kashmir-india-pakistan-aircraft.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmaria-abi-habib)
between India and Pakistan, where a banned terrorist group,
Jaish-e-Muhammad, claimed responsibility.

Over the last year, activists say, the hunt for separatists has
intensified, pulling ordinary Kashmiris into the fold.

Feroz Ahmad Hajam said he was on the way to meet a friend in September
when the police abducted him, locked him in an interrogation cell in
southern Kashmir and burned his feet and shoulders with cigarettes.

When Mr. Hajam, 25, a laborer, said he had no affiliation with
militants, an officer walked up behind him and cut his
throat.

The police have denied his claim and accused him of attempting to kill
himself.

“I feel the knife in my dreams, slitting my throat again and again,” he
said in an interview, writing his answers on a piece of paper because
his vocal cords were so damaged that he can no longer speak.

“I want to talk just once,” he wrote, tears rolling down his cheeks.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, whose Bharatiya Janata Party won
a resounding victory during national elections in May, has vowed to ease
tensions in Kashmir.

But many worry that the government will further alienate locals by
removing special protections that grant the population, which is
majority Muslim, a certain degree of autonomy. Hostility toward the
Indian security forces[has only
increased](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/world/asia/kashmir-civilians-teenagers.html).
Almost every day, life is disrupted by gun battles, bombings or street
protests.

Mr. Lone, 39, who said he was tortured for more than two hours while
being questioned by Indian soldiers in February, said peace was
unlikely.

When Mr. Lone regained consciousness at the army camp in the village of
Rawalpora, he said three soldiers standing on him stomped on his thighs,
struck him with bamboo sticks and screamed at him to get up and walk. He
could not manage even one step.

“It was as if someone was taking me to a butcher’s shop to have me
chopped into small pieces,” he said.

Bloodied and exhausted, Mr. Lone passed out again. He woke up in a
hospital bed surrounded by relatives, who had dragged him from the camp
when the soldiers finished with him.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Several months later, Mr. Lone can barely stand for five minutes. He has
trouble kneeling to pray. His brother, the militant, is still missing.
He worries about his children, ages 8 and 12.

He said the cycle of violence showed no signs of letting up.
