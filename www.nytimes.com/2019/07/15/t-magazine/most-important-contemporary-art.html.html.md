# The 25 Works of Art That Define the Contemporary Age

</div>

Three artists and a pair of curators came together at The New York Times
to attempt to make a list of the era’s essential artworks. Here’s their
conversation.

On a recent afternoon in June, T Magazine assembled two curators and
three artists — **David Breslin**, the director of the collection at the
[Whitney Museum of American
Art](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/whitney-museum-of-american-art);
the American conceptual artist **Martha Rosler**; **Kelly Taxter**, a
curator of contemporary art at the [Jewish
Museum](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/jewish-museum-nyc);
the Thai conceptual artist **Rirkrit Tiravanija**; and the American
artist **Torey Thornton** — at the New York Times building to discuss
what they considered to be the 25 works of art made after 1970 that
define the contemporary age, by anyone, anywhere. The assignment was
intentionally wide in its range: What qualifies as “contemporary”? Was
this an artwork that had a personal significance, or was its meaning
widely understood? Was its influence broadly recognized by critics? Or
museums? Or other artists? Originally, each of the participants was
asked to nominate 10 artworks — the idea being that everyone would then
rank each list to generate a master list that would be debated upon
meeting.

*\[*[*Sign up
here*](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/t-list?module=inline) *for
the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are
noticing and coveting now.\]*

Unsurprisingly, the system fell apart. It was impossible, some argued,
to rank art. It was also impossible to select just 10. (Rosler, in fact,
objected to the whole premise, though she brought her own list to the
discussion in the end.) And yet, to everyone’s surprise, there was a
significant amount of overlap: works by [David
Hammons](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/arts/design/david-hammons-is-still-messing-with-what-art-means.html),
[Dara Birnbaum](https://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/dara-birnbaum),
[Felix
Gonzalez-Torres](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/t-magazine/art/felix-gonzalez-torres-zwirner-new-york-show.html),
[Danh
Vo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/t-magazine/danh-vo-pho-recipe.html),
[Cady Noland](https://gagosian.com/artists/cady-noland/), [Kara
Walker](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/t-magazine/art/kara-walker-father-larry-art.html),
[Mike
Kelley](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/t-magazine/art/mike-kelley-mobile-homestead.html),
[Barbara
Kruger](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/t-magazine/art/barbara-kruger-berlin.html)
and [Arthur
Jafa](https://gavinbrown.biz/artists/arthur_jafa/exhibitions/2019) were
cited multiple times. Had the group, perhaps, stumbled upon some form of
agreement? Did their selections reflect our values, priorities and a
unified idea of what matters today? Did focusing on artworks, rather
than artists, allow for a different framework?

Naturally, when re-evaluating the canon of the last five decades, there
were notable omissions. The group failed to name many artists who most
certainly had an impact on how we view art today: Bigger names of recent
Museum of Modern Art retrospectives, internationally acclaimed artists
and high earners on the secondary market were largely excluded. Few
paintings were singled out; [land
art](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/t-magazine/female-land-artists.html)
was almost entirely absent, as were, to name just a few more categories,
works on paper, sculpture, photography, fiber arts and [outsider
art](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/t-magazine/outsider-art-essay-christine-smallwood.html).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s important to emphasize that no consensus emerged from the meeting.
Rather, this list of works is merely what has been culled from the
conversation, each chosen because it appeared on a panelist’s original
submission of 10 (in two instances, two different works by the same
artist were nominated, which were considered jointly). The below is not
definitive, nor is it comprehensive. Had this meeting happened on a
different day, with a different group, the results would have been
different. Some pieces were debated heavily; others were fleetingly
passed over, as if the group intuitively understood why they had been
brought up; a few were spoken of with appreciation and wonder. What came
out of the conversation was more of a sensibility than a declaration.
This list — which is ordered chronologically, from oldest work to most
recent — is who we circled around, who we defended, who we questioned,
and who we, perhaps most of all, wish might be remembered. *—*

Known professionally by her surname, [Elaine
Sturtevant](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/arts/design/elaine-sturtevant-appropriation-artist-is-dead-at-89.html)
(b. Lakewood, Ohio, 1924; d. 2014) began “repeating” the works of other
artists in 1964, more than a decade before [Richard
Prince](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/richard-prince)
photographed his first Marlboro ad and [Sherrie
Levine](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/12/arts/original-slant-on-originality.html)
appropriated the images of [Edward
Weston](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/edward-weston). Her targets
tended to be famous male painters (largely because the work of women was
less broadly recognized). Over the course of her career, she imitated
canvases by [Frank
Stella](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/arts/design/frank-stella-black-paintings.html),
[James
Rosenquist](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/arts/james-rosenquist-dead-pop-art.html)
and [Roy
Lichtenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/roy-lichtenstein),
among others. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his own puckish
understanding of authorship and originality, [Andy
Warhol](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/arts/design/andy-warhol-inc-how-he-made-business-his-art.html)
approved of Sturtevant’s project and even lent her one of his “Flowers”
screens. Other artists, including [Claes
Oldenburg](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/claes-oldenburg.html),
were unamused, and collectors largely shied away from purchasing the
works. Gradually, however, the art world came around to understanding
her conceptual reasons for copying canonical works: to skewer the grand
modernist myths of creativity and the artist as lone genius. By focusing
on Pop Art, itself a comment on mass production and the suspect nature
of authenticity, Sturtevant was taking the genre to its full logical
extension. Playful and subversive, somewhere between parody and homage,
her efforts also echo the centuries-old tradition of young artists
copying old masters.

In 1968, [Marcel
Broodthaers](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/146915) (b. Brussels,
1924; d. 1976) opened his nomadic museum, the “Musée d’Art Moderne,
Département des Aigles,” complete with a staff, wall labels, period
rooms and slide carousels. His **“**Museum of Modern Art” existed in
various locations, beginning with Broodthaers’s Brussels home, where the
artist filled the space with storage crates for people to use as seats
and postcard reproductions of 19th-century paintings. He painted the
words “musée” and “museum” on two windows facing the street. The museum,
which gently mocked various curatorial and financial aspects of
traditional institutions, grew from there, with sections identified as
17th century, folklore and cinema, among others. At one point,
Broodthaers had a gold bar stamped with an eagle, which he intended to
sell at twice its market value in order to raise money for the museum.
Failing to find a buyer, he declared the museum bankrupt and put it up
for sale. Nobody was interested enough to make a purchase, and in 1972,
he erected a new section of his museum in an actual institution, the
Kunsthalle Düsseldorf. There, he installed hundreds of works and
everyday objects — from flags to beer bottles — depicting eagles, the
symbol of his museum.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 1969, the Guerrilla Art Action Group, an art workers’ coalition,
called for the resignation of the Rockefellers from the board of the
Museum of Modern Art, believing the family was involved in the
manufacture of weapons (chemical gas and napalm) destined for Vietnam. A
year later, [Hans
Haacke](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/arts/design/hans-haacke-gets-establishment-nod-of-approval.html)
(b. Cologne, Germany, 1936) took the fight inside the museum. His
seminal installation, “MoMA Poll,” presented visitors with two
transparent ballot boxes, a ballot and a sign that posed a question
about the upcoming gubernatorial race: “Would the fact that Governor
Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon’s Indochina Policy be a
reason for you not to vote for him in November?” (By the time the
exhibition closed, roughly twice as many participants had answered “yes”
as “no.”) MoMA did not censor the work, but not all institutions were as
tolerant. In 1971, just three weeks before it was set to open, the
Guggenheim Museum
[canceled](https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/07/archives/the-guggenheim-cancels-haackes-show.html)
what would have been the German artist’s first major international solo
show when he wouldn’t remove three provocative works. The same year,
Cologne’s Wallraf-Richartz Museum refused to exhibit “Manet-Projekt
’74,” which examined the provenance of an [Édouard
Manet](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/edouard-manet) painting
donated to that museum by a Nazi sympathizer.

**Thessaly La Force:** There’s one work here that really looks at the
institution of the museum. Rirkrit, you listed Marcel Broodthaers’s
piece.

**Rirkrit Tiravanija:** That’s the beginning of breaking — at least for
me — the institution. The beginning, for me, in Western art, to question
that kind of accumulation of knowledge. I like the Hans Haacke that’s
also on this list. Definitely on my list, but I didn’t put it down.

**Martha Rosler:** I put it down. Hans showed the audience that it was
part of a system. By collecting their opinions and information about who
they were, he was able to construct a picture. I thought that it was
transformative and riveting for anyone who was interested in thinking
about *who* the art world was. Also because it was totally data driven
and it wasn’t aesthetic. It was the revolutionary idea that the art
world itself was not outside the question of: Who are we? It gave a lot
of space for people to think systematically about things the art world
had relentlessly refused to recognize were systematic issues.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Richard Nixon was up for re-election in 1971 when [Philip
Guston](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/t-magazine/art/philip-guston-venice.html)
(b. Montreal, 1913; d. 1980) created an astounding, little-known series
of nearly 80 cartoons depicting the president’s rise to office and
destructive tenure. In Guston’s spindly line drawings, we see Nixon,
portrayed with a phallic nose and testicular cheeks, swimming on Key
Biscayne and drafting foreign policy in China with caricatured
politicians, including [Henry
Kissinger](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/henry-a-kissinger) as a
pair of glasses; the president’s pet dog, Checkers, also makes cameos.
Guston captures Nixon’s bitterness and insincerity while crafting a
poignant meditation on the abuse of power. Despite its enduring
relevance, **** the series languished in Guston’s studio for more than
20 years following the artist’s death in 1980; it was finally exhibited
and published in 2001. The drawings were shown most recently in 2017 at
Hauser & Wirth in London.

**TLF:** Back to my larger question: What do we mean by “contemporary”?
Does anyone want to take a stab at that?

**RT:** I think Philip Guston’s [series of Nixon
drawings](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/arts/design/philip-guston-and-his-barbed-pen-nixon-years.html)
became completely contemporary because it’s —

**Torey Thornton:** A mirror of sorts.

**RT:** It’s like talking about what we’re looking at today.

**TLF:** Well, that’s a question I had, too. Do some works of art have
the capacity to change over time? Do some get stuck in amber and remain
a mirror of that particular moment? What you’re describing is a current
event changing the meaning of Guston’s paintings and drawings.

**Kelly Taxter:** I think that absolutely happens.

**MR:** It’s all about the institution. When you mentioned the Guston
piece, which is great, I was thinking, “Yeah, but there’s at least two
videotapes that were about the same exact thing.” What about
“[Television Delivers
People](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/118185)” \[a 1973 short
film by [Richard
Serra](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/richard-serra) and [Carlota
Schoolman](https://www.moma.org/artists/34941)\]? I’m also thinking of
“[Four More Years](https://www.eai.org/titles/four-more-years)” \[a
documentary about the 1972 Republican National Convention\] by
[TVTV](http://www.vdb.org/artists/tvtv), which was about Nixon, and
“[The Eternal Frame](https://www.eai.org/titles/the-eternal-frame)”
\[a 1975 satirical re-creation of the John F. Kennedy assassination by
[Ant
Farm](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/21/arts/doug-michels-radical-artist-and-architect-dies-at-59.html)
and [T.R. Uthco](https://www.eai.org/artists/t-r-uthco/titles)\], about

**TT:** It’s old. I don’t know. I tried to look at what types of
painting happened and then see who started it.

**RT:** I put Guston on my list.

**David Breslin:** On my longer list, I had [Gerhard
Richter](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/27/magazine/an-artist-beyond-isms.html)’s
[Baader-Meinhof
cycle](https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/art/paintings/photo-paintings/baader-meinhof-56)
\[a series of paintings titled “October 18, 1977,” made by Richter in
1988, based on photographs of members of the Red Army Faction, a German
left-wing militant group that carried out bombings, kidnappings and
assassinations throughout the 1970s\]. It speaks to the history of
countercultural formation. How, if one decides not to peaceably
demonstrate, what the alternatives are. How, in many ways, some of those
things could only be recorded or thought about a decade-plus later. So,
how can certain moments of participatory action be thought about in
their time, and then also in a deferred moment?

**KT:** I thought of all the women painters. I thought of [Jacqueline
Humphries](https://www.greenenaftaligallery.com/artists/jacqueline-humphries),
[Charline von Heyl](http://www.petzel.com/artists/charline-von-heyl),
[Amy
Sillman](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/arts/design/amy-sillman-brings-together-abstraction-and-figuration.html),
[Laura
Owens](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/t-magazine/art/ugly-painting-laura-owens-karen-kilimnik-sam-mckinniss.html).
Women taking up the very difficult task of abstraction and bringing some
meaning to it. That, to me, feels like important terrain women have
staked out in a really serious way. Maybe one or two of those people
deserve to be on this list, but somehow I didn’t put them on.

**DB:** It’s that problem of a body of work versus the individual.

**KT:** But am I going to pick one painting of Charline’s? I can’t. I
just saw that show at the [Hirshhorn
Museum](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/t-magazine/tino-sehgal-hirshhorn-museum-art.html)
in Washington, D.C., and every painting in the last 10 years is *good*.
Is one better than the other? It’s this kind of practice and this
discourse around abstraction — and what women are doing with it — that I
think is the key.

“Womanhouse” existed for just one month, and few material traces of the
groundbreaking art project — room-size installations in a derelict
Hollywood mansion — survive. The collaborative project, conceived by the
art historian [Paula
Harper](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/arts/design/paula-hays-harper-feminist-art-historian-dies-at-81.html)
and led by [Judy
Chicago](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/t-magazine/judy-chicago-dinner-party.html)
(b. Chicago, 1939) and [Miriam
Schapiro](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/arts/design/miriam-schapiro-91-a-feminist-artist-who-harnessed-craft-and-pattern-dies.html)
(b. Toronto, 1923; d. 2015), brought together students and artists who
put on some of the earliest feminist performances and produced painting,
craft and sculpture in one radical context. Working brutally long hours
without running water or heat, the artists and students renovated the
dilapidated building to house numerous installations and showcase six
performances. Chicago’s “Menstruation Bathroom” confronted visitors with
a wastebasket overflowing with tampons painted to look as if soaked with
blood. Faith Wilding [crocheted a large weblike
shelter](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/t-magazine/art/fiber-knitting-weaving-politics.html)
for “Womb Room” — somewhere between a cocoon and a yurt — out of
grasses, branches and weeds. Taken as a whole, the works created a new
paradigm for female artists interested in women’s collective history and
their relationships to domesticity, sex and gender.

**TLF:** I think what’s interesting is that everything here is strictly
art. No one threw a curveball.

**KT:** Is “Womanhouse” strictly art? I don’t know.

**MR:** What is it, if not art?

**KT:** Well, in the way that it existed. It came out of an art school.
It was ephemeral. It was a location that came and went.

**MR:** It was an exhibition space. It became a collective installation.

**KT:** But then it went away, and, until recently, there was very
little documentation available … I think it’s art. I put it there. It’s
certainly institutionalized.

[Lynda
Benglis](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/arts/design/13benglis.html)
(b. Lake Charles, La., 1941) wanted the 1974 profile Artforum was
writing about her to be accompanied by a nude self-portrait. [John
Coplans](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/22/arts/john-coplans-83-an-artist-and-a-founder-of-artforum.html),
the editor in chief at the time, refused. Undaunted, Benglis persuaded
her New York dealer, [Paula
Cooper](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/t-magazine/art/paula-cooper-art-gallery-life-pictures.html),
to take out a two-page ad in the magazine (Benglis paid for it). Readers
opened the November issue of Artforum and saw a sun-tanned Benglis
striking a pose, hip cocked, staring down at the viewer through pointy,
white-framed sunglasses. She wears nothing else and holds an enormous
dildo between her legs. The image caused bedlam. Five editors — Rosalind
Krauss, Max Kozloff, [Lawrence
Alloway](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/03/obituaries/lawrence-alloway-is-dead-at-63-art-historian-curator-and-critic.html),
Joseph Masheck and [Annette
Michelson](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/obituaries/annette-michelson-dead.html)
— wrote a scathing letter to the magazine condemning the ad as a “shabby
mockery of the aims of \[women’s liberation\].” The critic [Robert
Rosenblum](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/arts/design/09rose.html)
wrote a letter to the magazine congratulating Benglis for exposing the
prudishness of people who considered themselves arbiters of avant-garde
taste: “Let’s give three dildos and a Pandora’s Box to Ms. Benglis, who
finally brought out of the closet the Sons and Daughters of the Founding
Fathers of the *Artforum* Committee of Public Decency and Ladies
Etiquette.” The ad became an iconic image of resistance to the sexism
and double standards that continue to pervade the art world.

**DB:** I’m surprised no one included [Cindy
Sherman](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/cindy-sherman). \[Between
1977 and 1980, Sherman made a series of black-and-white photographs of
herself posing in various stereotypical female roles, titled “[Untitled

**KT:** I had such a hard time with that. It was one of those things
that I was like, “This is going to be on other peoples’ lists. It’s so
obvious, I’m not going to put it down.”

**TLF:** No one did.

**RT:** Well, I have Lynda Benglis’s Artforum ad, which has a relation
to photography later on.

**MR:** I thought that was really good.

**KT:** I wanted to put Sherrie Levine’s “[After Walker

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Gordon
Matta-Clark](https://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/gordon-matta-clark)
(b. New York City, 1943; d. 1978) trained as an architect at Cornell
University. By the 1970s, he was working as an artist, cutting chunks
out of vacant properties, documenting the voids and exhibiting the
amputated bits of architecture. Abandoned buildings were easy to find at
the time — New York City was economically depressed and crime-ridden.
Matta-Clark was looking for a new site when the art dealer [Holly
Solomon](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/10/arts/holly-solomon-adventurous-art-dealer-is-dead-at-68.html)
offered him a house she owned in suburban New Jersey that was slated for
demolition. “Splitting” (1974) was one of Matta-Clark’s first monumental
works. With the help of the craftsman Manfred Hecht, among other
assistants, Matta-Clark sliced the whole thing in two with a power saw,
then jacked up one side of the structure while they beveled the cinder
blocks beneath it before slowly lowering it back down. The house cleaved
perfectly, leaving a slender central gap through which the sunlight
could enter the rooms. The piece was demolished three months later to
make way for new apartments. “It was always exciting working with
Gordon,” Hecht once said. “There was always a good chance of getting
killed.”

**TLF:** Why is there no land art?

**RT:** I have Gordon Matta-Clark.

**MR:** Is that land art? “[Spiral
Jetty](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/arts/design/spiral-jetty-is-named-an-official-state-work-of-art-by-utah.html)”
\[the giant coil of mud, salt and basalt constructed in 1970 at Rozel
Point, Utah, by the American sculptor [Robert
Smithson](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/robert-smithson)\] is
land art.

**TT:** That’s crazy\! The jetty 100 percent has to be on my list.

**KT:** “[The Lightning
Field](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/arts/design/lightning-field-restoration-campaign-is-set.html)”
\[a 1977 work by the American sculptor [Walter De
Maria](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/arts/design/walter-de-maria-artist-on-grand-scale-dies-at-77.html)
comprising 400 stainless steel poles staked in the New Mexico desert\],
“[Roden
Crater](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/arts/design/25fink.html)”
\[the American light artist [James
Turrell](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/james-turrell)’s
still-in-progress naked-eye observatory in Northern Arizona\].

**TT:** I thought, “Who can see it? What does ‘influence’ mean, what
does it mean to be influenced through seeing something on a screen?” I
was thinking, “Do I list what I’ve seen versus what I’ve obsessed over?”
At that point, it’s all a reproduction or a sort of theatrical
representation.

**MR:** Totally.

**TT:** I put [Michael
Asher](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/just-looking-michael-ashers-all-nighter/)’s
show in the Santa Monica Museum \[No. 19, see below\] but with something
like that — once it’s gone, it’s reproduction *only*. You can’t visit
it, it doesn’t move somewhere else.

**TLF:** Are the questions that the land artists were asking — are they
no longer questions we’re asking today?

**TT:** There’s no more land.

**MR:** It’s a really interesting question. It’s mainly that, because of
the move to the cities, we’ve become urban-obsessed. The pastoral
question — which also applies to the cities, though we’re not that aware
of it — has receded. But am I wrong that the land-art stuff was also in
Europe? There were Dutch artists and English artists.

**RT:** Yeah, there were. Still are.

**MR:** Land art was international in an interesting way, which
coincided with the [Blue
Marble](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/summer-of-science-2015/latest/blue-marble-earth-photos-comparison)
\[an image taken of Earth in 1972 by the crew of Apollo 17\].

**TLF:** The [Whole Earth
Catalog](https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/08/archives/-whole-earth-catalog-recycled-as-epilog-new-group-to-serve.html).

**MR:** Sure. The idea of the whole earth as an entity made up of actual
stuff rather than a social space.

**RT:** Maybe it also has to do with this idea of property and wealth,
too. The value of land and what it’s used for has changed. It used to be
you could just go out in Montana and probably —

**MR:** Bury some Cadillacs.

**RT:** — dig a big hole. I mean, [Michael
Heizer](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/arts/design/michael-heizers-big-work-and-long-view.html)
still does stuff, but it’s only interior now. He’s just doing big rocks
inside a space. Then again, that’s why Smithson is interesting, because
it’s almost like the non-site now \[Smithson used the term “non-site” to
describe works that were presented outside their original context, such
as rocks from a New Jersey quarry exhibited in a gallery alongside
photos or maps of the site where they came from\].

**TLF:** Then why did you include Gordon Matta-Clark?

**RT:** There are many references for me, but I feel like “Splitting”
hits all the other things that I’m thinking about. With “Splitting,”
it’s like a comic ending. Also, the idea of the house divided and
what’s happening with domesticity — people aren’t able to sit together
at Thanksgiving anymore.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Jenny
Holzer](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/t-magazine/art/jenny-holzer-ibiza.html)
(b. Gallipolis, Ohio, 1950) was 25 years old when she began compiling
her “Truisms,” more than 250 cryptic maxims, terse commands and shrewd
observations. Culled from world literature and philosophy, some of the
one-liners are judgmental (“Any surplus is immoral”), others bleak
(“Ideals are replaced by conventional goals at a certain age”), and a
few echo the half-baked platitudes found in fortune cookies (“You must
have one grand passion”). The most resonant are the political ones, none
more so than “Abuse of power comes as no surprise.” After printing them
as posters, which she pasted among real advertisements throughout
downtown Manhattan, Holzer reproduced them on objects, including
baseball caps, T-shirts and condoms. She projected them on the enormous
Spectacolor LED board in Times Square in 1982, with smaller scrolling
signs to evoke the digital clocks and screens through which we are
continuously fed information (and told what to think) in urban
environments. Holzer continues to use the “Truisms” today, incorporating
them into electronic signs, benches, footstools and T-shirts.

**DB:** Thessaly, when you asked earlier if Trump was in the room,
that’s why I went to Jenny Holzer. In their original iterations,
“Truisms” were these kind of street posters that people were marking
up —

**MR:** But they were never not art-world things.

**DB:** I agree. They came out of the Whitney Independent Study Program.
But I think this is where the work takes on such a different resonance
now. The original intention behind them was that these codes are
free-floating and, of course, unconscious. But I think now the idea that
one is constantly assembling these truths, that it isn’t a list of
unconsciousness, is really alive in that work.

**MR:** It’s an interesting hypothesis. The reason I chose [Barbara
Kruger](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/arts/barbara-kruger-designed-metrocards-are-coming-to-new-york-city.html)
\[No. 11, see below\] instead was that I thought she did an interesting
collision of fashion-world typography with this kind of punk
street-postering. She actually enunciates things people might cleverly
say but would never say in the art world: “Your gaze hits the side of my
face.” Or all kinds of feminist stuff: “You construct intricate rituals
which allow you to touch the skin of other men.” Who says stuff like
that? Who expects to be rewarded by capitalism for saying things they
don’t want to hear? When Barbara joined a high-profile gallery, it was a
change in strategy just when the market recaptured all that dissonant
stuff that they had no idea what to do with. Finally the market figured
it out. Just let the artist do it, and we’ll say it’s art and it’s O.K.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In an age of online piracy, supercuts, remixes, mash-ups and memes that
flare up and fizzle in minutes, it is difficult to appreciate how
radical it was to assemble art out of stolen TV clips 40 years ago. To
create her early masterpiece “Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman,”
Dara Birnbaum (b. New York City, 1946) had to lay her hands on the reels
of the 1970s show “Wonder Woman” and re-edit them to tell a different
story. The piece opens with a looped explosion before we see the actor
[Lynda
Carter](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/style/where-is-lynda-carter-now-wonder-woman.html)
twirl and transform from a meek secretary into a superhero. There is
violence, Birnbaum suggests, in requiring women to be either demure
office girls or scantily clad Amazons. Although Wonder Woman had been
heralded as a feminist role model, Birnbaum didn’t buy it. “I wouldn’t
call that liberation,” she [told
ARTnews](http://www.artnews.com/2018/03/27/icons-dara-birnbaum/) last
year. “How dare you confront me with this supposedly super-powered image
of a woman who is stronger than I am and can also save mankind? I can’t
do that, and I won’t.”

**MR:** Dara figured out how to get her work into the art world, as
opposed to the video people I named earlier, who weren’t interested in
that. In the ’70s, the dealer world couldn’t figure out what to do with
the heterogeneity of works.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[David
Hammons](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/t-magazine/art/steve-cannon-david-hammons.html)
(b. Springfield, Ill., 1943) studied art in Los Angeles at Otis Art
Institute (now Otis College of Art and Design) under [Charles
White](https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/06/archives/charles-w-white-is-dead-at-61-artist-with-work-in-49-museums.html),
the painter acclaimed for his depictions of African-American life.
Hammons absorbed White’s sense of social justice but gravitated toward
radical, unorthodox materials. Early on, he sought to challenge the
institutionalization of art, often creating ephemeral installations,
such as “Bliz-aard Ball Sale,” in which he sold snowballs of varying
sizes alongside New York street vendors and the homeless to critique
conspicuous consumption and hollow notions of value. (The ethos of the
piece continues to inform his engagement with the art world; he works
without exclusive gallery representation and rarely gives interviews.)
In 1988, he painted the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the African-American civil
rights activist who twice ran for the Democratic presidential
nomination, as a blond-haired, blue-eyed white man, a comment on how
skin color unfairly and arbitrarily determines opportunities. **** A
group of young African-American men who happened to walk by as the work
was being installed the following year in downtown Washington, D.C.,
perceived the painting as racist and smashed it with a sledgehammer.
(Jackson understood the artist’s intentions.) The destruction — and the
collective pain it represented — became part of the piece. Now, when
Hammons exhibits the painting, he installs a semicircle of sledgehammers
around it.

**KT:** The “Bliz-aard Ball Sale” was a performance documented with
photographs. It falls into the legacy of performative ephemeral works
that begins with [Judson Dance
Theater](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/t-magazine/postmodern-dance.html)
\[a 1960s dance collective that included [Robert
Dunn](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/15/arts/robert-ellis-dunn-67-a-pioneer-in-postmodern-dance-movement.html),
[Yvonne
Rainer](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/arts/dance/seven-seconds-of-yvonne-rainer-trio-a.html)
and [Trisha
Brown](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/arts/dance/trisha-brown-dead-modern-dance-choreographer.html),
among many others\] and the Happenings \[a term coined by the artist
[Allan
Kaprow](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/10/arts/design/allan-kaprow-creator-of-artistic-happenings-dies-at-78.html)
to describe loosely defined performance art pieces or events that often
involved the audience\] of the 1960s. Why he stays relevant, to some
extent, is because so much of his work happens somehow in secret — his
studio is the street. You can talk around what he’s doing for a very
long time without coming up with a finite answer. He does not follow a
straight line and can be contradictory — he defies expectations.

**DB:** So much of the work begins from a place of opposition, whether
materially or at the site in which it’s made or performed. I chose “How
Ya Like Me Now?” mostly for the ability to misread so much about the
work. In some ways, it’s a point of danger. The fact that a group of
people took sledgehammers to it — why weren’t certain people taking
Jackson seriously as a candidate? Confusing the boundaries between
what’s expected and what isn’t makes Hammons always relevant.

**MR:** I think that work is really problematic, though. It defines why
we’re talking about the art world. That work was offensive, and yet we
understand how to read something against its apparent presentation. It
speaks to us as educated people, and that’s one of the reasons we defend
it. I love Hammons’s work. But I always felt really strange about that
piece, because it didn’t take into consideration that the community
might be offended. Or, he didn’t give a damn. Which, you know, he’s an
artist. So it’s the art world speaking to the art world about this work.
But I also wonder about its problematic appearance just at that moment
when the public was turning against public art in general, and in
particular mysterious public art, which usually meant abstract. But this
was worse — it was not only laughing at the public, it was laughing at a
*specific* public, even if that wasn’t his intention.

[Barbara Kruger](http://www.barbarakruger.com/) (b. Newark, 1945)
briefly studied at the Parsons School of Design in 1965, but her real
education was in the world of magazines. She dropped out early on to
work at Mademoiselle as an assistant to the art director, rapidly became
head designer, and then switched to freelance, conceiving layouts for
House & Garden*,* Vogue ** and ** Aperture, among other publications.
Through these projects, Kruger learned how to command the viewer’s
attention and manipulate desire. A close reader of Roland Barthes and
other theorists focused on media, culture and the power of images,
Kruger brought her professional life and philosophical leanings together
in the early 1980s with her iconic works: agitprop images of terse,
satirical slogans in white or black Futura Bold Oblique type on
close-cropped images primarily from old magazines. They confront gender
roles and sexuality, corporate greed and religion. Several of the most
well-known indict consumerism, including 1985’s “Untitled (When I Hear
the Word Culture, I Take Out My Checkbook),” in which the words slash
across the face of a ventriloquist’s dummy, and “Untitled (I Shop
Therefore I Am),” from 1987.

When [Nan
Goldin](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/t-magazine/a-heroin-chic-photographers-new-project-tackling-the-opioid-epidemic.html)
(b. Washington, D.C., 1953) moved to New York City in 1979, she rented a
loft on the Bowery and embarked on what would prove to be one of the
most influential photographic series of the century. Her subjects were
herself, her lovers and her friends — drag queens, fellow drug addicts,
runaways and artists. We see them fight, make up, have sex, apply
makeup, shoot up and nod off in the several hundred candid images
comprising “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.” Goldin first shared the
pictures as slide shows in downtown clubs and bars, partly out of
necessity (she lacked a darkroom to print but could get slides processed
at a drugstore), partly because these haunts were part of the world of
the photographs. Cult heroes and neighborhood stars, including [Keith
Haring](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/keith-haring), [Andy
Warhol](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/t-magazine/andy-warhol-photo-portraits.html)
and [John Waters](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/john-waters),
appear in some frames, but the focus is on Goldin’s intimates, including
her glowering boyfriend Brian, who beat her nearly blind one night: “Nan
One Month After Being Battered” (1984) is one of the most haunting
portraits in the series. Goldin edited and reconfigured the series
repeatedly, eventually titling it after a song in Bertolt Brecht’s
“Threepenny Opera” and setting it to a playlist that has included
[James Brown](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/james-brown), the
[Velvet
Underground](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/the-velvet-underground),
[Dionne
Warwick](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/nyregion/21computer.html),
opera, rock and blues. A version appeared in the 1985 Whitney Biennial
and the Aperture Foundation published a selection of 127 images as a
book in 1986, which includes some of Goldin’s fiercely honest writing. A
decade later, most of the people pictured in the book had died of AIDS
or drug overdoses. In a recent exhibition at New York’s Museum of Modern
Art, Goldin concluded the sequence of nearly 700 photographs with a nod
to these losses — a snapshot of two graffiti skeletons having sex.

**KT:** [Nan
Goldin](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/arts/design/nan-goldin-oxycontin-addiction-opioid.html)
continues to have a very prominent role in the discourse, whether that’s
about the art itself, like what she’s making, or the problems that we’re
dealing with in the culture of the art world and beyond. That body of
work made visible a whole realm, a whole social structure, a whole group
of people who were invisible in a lot of ways. It talked about the AIDS
crisis. It talked about queer culture. It talked about her abuse. It was
like a confessional, laying bare things that are still really relevant
issues.

**MR:** It has the word “sexual” in it. Do you want to talk about that a
little bit?

**KT:** It has a lot to do with her relationship to sex and love, and
her friends’ relationships to sex and love, and the unraveling of it.
There’s a lot of dirt and degradation in it, and yet there is a lot of
celebration in it, too, I think: being able to see what one might see as
dirty or wrong as right. I saw it when I was a kid. Her prints are super
gorgeous, but sometimes they are just snapshots in the freedom of the
work itself, the freedom that she took with it.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The work of [Cady
Noland](http://ensembles.mhka.be/items/2245/assets/2517) (b. Washington,
D.C., 1956) probes the dark corners of American culture. Many of her
installations, including “[The Big
Slide](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/186274/the-big-slide)” (1989),
involve rails or barriers — allusions to the limits on access,
opportunity and freedom in this country. (To enter Noland’s debut
exhibition at New York’s White Columns Gallery in 1988, visitors had to
duck under a metal pole blocking the door.) “Oozewald” features a
silk-screened version of the famed photograph of President John F.
Kennedy’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, as he’s being shot and killed by
the nightclub owner Jack Ruby. Eight oversize bullet holes perforate the
surface — an American flag is wadded up inside one, where his mouth
would be. Noland disappeared from the art world around 2000, a move that
has become as much a part of her oeuvre as her work. While she can’t
stop galleries and museums from displaying old pieces, disclaimers
noting the artist’s lack of consent often appear on the exhibition
walls. In recent years, Noland has disowned some works entirely, roiling
the market. She has become known as the art world’s boogeyman, but she
might be its conscience.

**TT:** I started having this thing happen where years later, after
thinking about an artist a lot, I started seeing how they’ve influenced
other artists. I realized Cady Noland is so *everywhere* in a weird way.
Particularly within installation art and sculpture. I’ve seen a lot of
work recently that feels like it’s really leaning on something she’s
made. Sometimes, something is made in a certain time and then it loops
back, and it’s relevant again. There’s this overarching criticism or
analysis of Americana in her work. Her name came back in, and it’s
around and around and around.

**MR:** Isn’t that the way the art world always works? Everyone hated
Warhol. Even *after* he was famous, the art world said, “No.” It’s why
we got minimalism.

**KT:** I think Cady occupies a place of resistance, too. I think Cady’s
character — both her resistant character and approach to her work — is
part of the mythmaking of her practice. She’s an elusive Hammons-type
figure. She’s not speaking on the work. *Everybody* else is.

**DB:** So much of the work has to do with conspiracy and paranoia,
which feels way too “right now.” These things that have this immediate
conjuring, like the Oswald figure being shot, or with Clinton and the
Whitewater stuff that she does, with just the quick image of the figure
and a line from a newspaper article. It’s her ability to distill the
information, to get to that paranoid tendency in American culture. To
your point, Kelly, when she’s come up, it’s been through lawsuits.

**MR:** Really?

**DB:** Yeah, she’s suing people for how her work is treated. This is a
total guess on my part, but even if you think about *that* as being a
mode of communication — that if she’s going to function publicly, it’s
going to be through the legal system — you see, even now, I’m making a
conspiracy out of it\!

**KT:** You’re paranoid\!

**DB:** I think we all are.

[Jeff Koons](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/jeff-koons) (b. York,
Pa., 1955) rose to prominence in the mid-1980s making conceptual
sculpture from vacuum cleaners and basketballs. When the Whitney Museum
of American Art invited him to create a billboard-size work for an
exhibition called “Image World,” the postmodern provocateur submitted a
blown-up, grainy photograph, printed on canvas, of himself and Ilona
Staller — the Hungarian-Italian porn star he would later marry — in
campy coital ecstasy, advertising an unmade film. The series that
followed, “[Made in
Heaven](http://www.jeffkoons.com/artwork/made-in-heaven),” shocked
viewers when it debuted at the Venice Biennale in 1990. With descriptive
titles such as “Ilona’s Asshole” and “Dirty Ejaculation,” the
photo-realistic paintings portrayed the couple in every conceivable
position. They appeared at a moment when the country was divided over
propriety in art, with religious and conservative forces rallying
against sexually explicit work. Koons has claimed it is an exploration
of freedom, an examination of the origins of shame, a celebration of the
act of procreation, even a vision of transcendence. “I’m not interested
in pornography,” he said in 1990. “I’m interested in the spiritual.”
Koons destroyed portions of the series during a protracted custody
battle with Staller for their son, Ludwig.

**TLF:** Money defines the art world, too. There are certain artists who
reflect that but who no one named.

**KT:** I thought it was super interesting that we all didn’t go to
that. There are many different art worlds. The one you’re referring to
is one of them.

**MR:** What’s your argument for keeping more commercial artists off the
list?

**KT:** In my opinion, because art is so much more than that. The
artists who are at that level are such a small percentage of the art
being made. I didn’t grow up revering that work.

**TT:** I think there are a lot of younger artists now who are
subliminally or quietly trying to find a way in between, of being like,
“Oh, I’m really interested in the production of this type of studio,
but I also want to be more rigorous and hands-on with my practice.” Or
maybe they’re secretly obsessed with [Jeff
Koons](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/arts/design/28koons.html), but
it’s not something they would ever say for a New York Times interview.
I’m not going to name any names, but I’ve heard it enough to where I’m
like, “This is for real.”

**MR:** Could you name one or two artists you’re talking about?

**TLF:** Name names.

**TT:** Is [Damien
Hirst](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/damien-hirst) an example?

**TLF:** Damien Hirst, [Takashi
Murakami](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/t-magazine/art/takashi-murakami-art-collection-yokohama-museum.html)
…

**KT:** Yeah, we left off Jeff Koons. We left off Damien Hirst.

**MR:** We did.

**TT:** I brought Jeff.

**KT:** I think they’re present. I would like the conversation to be
about some other artists. I could have put in Damien.

**MR:** A more legitimate artist, in my opinion, than Jeff Koons. But
that’s just me, sorry.

**TLF:** Well, who would you want to talk about, then, if we could?

**KT:** I would have picked
“[Equilibrium](http://www.jeffkoons.com/artwork/equilibrium)” \[a
series of works in the mid-1980s that included basketballs suspended in
tanks of distilled water\], if it were Jeff Koons. If it were Damien
Hirst, I would have put “[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the
Mind of Someone
Living](http://www.damienhirst.com/the-physical-impossibility-of)” \[a
1991 piece consisting of a tiger shark preserved in formaldehyde in a
vitrine\]. I think it’s a really good piece that influenced artists on
this list, as did “Equilibrium.” Maybe they should be on the list. Maybe
we’re being disingenuous. I’m totally fine with that. They’re on my long
list. I just took them off. I wanted to talk about some other people for
a change, and some more women, frankly.

**TT:** I hear you. I agree with that.

After dabbling in Detroit’s music scene as a teenager, [Mike
Kelley](http://www.mikekelleyfoundation.org/) (b. Wayne, Mich., 1954; d.
2012) moved to Los Angeles to attend CalArts. In each of the 11 works of
“The Arenas,” originally exhibited at Metro Pictures gallery in 1990,
stuffed animals and other toys sit alone or in eerie groups on dingy
blankets. In
[one](https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/mike-kelley-b-1954-arena-11-5495764-details.aspx),
a handcrafted bunny with a scraggly pompom tail is positioned on a
crocheted afghan before an open thesaurus, appearing to be studying the
entry on “volition,” as two cans of Raid threaten from a distance. In
[another](https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/mike-kelley-1954-2012-arena-8-leopard-5994792-details.aspx),
a stuffed leopard is splayed atop an ominous lump beneath a
black-and-orange coverlet. The works summon up themes of perversion,
shame, dread, vulnerability and pathos. Kelley used toys because he felt
they revealed far more about how adults see children — or want to see
them — than they do about kids. “The stuffed animal is a pseudo-child,”
a “cutified, sexless being that represents the adult’s perfect model of
a child — a neutered pet,” he once wrote. But the toys in Kelley’s
arrangements are faded, soiled, grubby and worn in sordid ways.

**KT:** I think that a lot of Mike Kelley’s work is about class but also
about abuse and other things that kids, at least when they’re teenagers,
begin articulating and thinking about. That series of work was so
abject. There are layers of revelation in it that were pivotal for me
personally, and then as I got older, I realized it had a bigger impact.
And I see it in the work of some of the younger artists today.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Felix Gonzalez-Torres](https://www.felixgonzalez-torresfoundation.org/)
(b. Cuba, 1957; d. 1996) came to New York City in 1979. When he created
“Untitled” (Portrait of Ross in L.A.) in 1991, he was mourning the
loss of his lover, Ross Laycock, who had died of AIDS-related illness
that year. The installation ideally comprises 175 pounds of candies,
wrapped in bright cellophane, an approximation of the body weight of a
healthy adult male. Viewers are free to take pieces from the pile, and
over the course of the exhibition, the work deteriorates, just as
Laycock’s body did. The candies, however, may or may not be routinely
replenished by the staff, evoking eternity and rebirth at the same time
as they conjure mortality.

**DB:** The work engages where we are today, this idea about the
participatory and the experiential. Gonzalez-Torres also makes the point
about responsibility, that an onus comes with this kind of taking. The
idea, too, that it’s referencing one person as the ideal body weight,
that the participatory element is not just this generalized mass thing,
that the referent is just one other person, I think is very profound.

**RT:** I was thinking about AIDS. I almost put the Act Up logo as an
artifact. We should talk about works of art that are more than just art,
addressing all those other conditions. I find it very beautiful in that
way.

**KT:** That work, in a metaphorical sense, is a virus. It dissipates
and goes into other people’s bodies.

**RT:** I don’t even know if the audience really understands. That’s the
thing. They are just taking candies.

**TLF:** I certainly just thought I was taking candies.

**DB:** There’s also the idea of replenishment. He comes back the next
day. The obligation to restore is so much different than the obligation
to take. The person is surviving. The institution is refilling. You
could go away one day and not know that this returns to its own form.
This idea of who knows and who doesn’t, I think, is important to it.

In her photograph “Self-Portrait/Cutting,” [Catherine
Opie](https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=Opie%252C+Catherine) (b.
Sandusky, Ohio, 1961) faces away from the viewer, confronting us with
her bare back, on which a house — the kind a child might draw — and two
stick figures in skirts have been carved. The figures hold hands,
completing the idyllic domestic dream, which, at the time was just that
— a dream — for lesbian couples. This work and others responded to the
national firestorm surrounding “obscenity” in art. In 1989, Senators
Alfonse D’Amato and Jesse Helms had denounced “[Piss
Christ](https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andres-serrano-b-1950-piss-christ-5070403-details.aspx),”
a photograph depicting a crucifix submerged in urine by [Andres
Serrano](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/andres-serrano-lets-objects-do-the-talking.html),
which was part of a traveling exhibition that had received funding from
the National Endowment for the Arts. A few weeks later, the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. opted to cancel a show featuring
homoerotic and sadomasochistic photographs by [Robert
Mapplethorpe](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/t-magazine/robert-mappelthorpe-michael-cunningham-elif-batuman-hilton-als.html),
whose exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University
of Pennsylvania had also received federal funding. In 1990, the N.E.A.
denied funding to four artists because of their explicit themes of frank
sexuality, trauma or subjugation. (In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that
the N.E.A.’s statute was valid and did not result in discrimination
against the artists, nor did it suppress their expression.) By creating
and exhibiting these works when she did, Opie openly defied those
looking to shame queer communities and censor their visibility in art.
“She is an insider and an outsider,”
[wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/arts/design/26opie.html) the
Times art critic Holland Cotter on the occasion of Opie’s 2008
Guggenheim midcareer retrospective. “\[Opie is\] a documentarian and a
provocateur; a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home;
a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream; an American —
birthplace: Sandusky, Ohio — who has serious arguments with her country
and culture.”

**DB:** This question of intimacy — who’s trying to police what I do
with my body and how I choose to constitute what a family is — all these
issues are one, if we’re thinking about how some of these works resound
now. These are still things that we are urgently dealing with. The
presence of motherhood and parenting are profound in the work. The
vulnerability of presenting oneself to one’s own camera like that, which
I think is also incredible in Goldin’s work — the question of who is my
world, and who do I want to be a part of it?

**MR:** In both their cases, it’s about *me and them*, which is a huge
thing that women brought. With the AIDS crisis, there were a lot of
works about “me” in the same way, but it was really a huge change for
Cathy and Nan to be the subject.

**KT:** Also, with Nan, this idea of a community in some sense of
collaboration. As opposed to a photographer taking a picture of you,
you’re taking a picture *with* you.

[Lutz
Bacher](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/obituaries/lutz-bacher-dies-at-75.html)
(b. United States, 1943; d. 2019) is an anomaly in an age of easily
searchable biographies and online profiles. The artist used a pseudonym,
one that has obscured her original name. Few photos of her face exist.
Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that so many of Bacher’s works focus
on questions of exposure, visibility and privacy. After Pat Hearn, the
famed downtown art dealer who represented her, was diagnosed with liver
cancer on January 22, 1997, Bacher installed a camera above Hearn’s
desk, filming continuously for 10 months. We see Hearn sit, make phone
calls, meet with artists; Hearn is featured in the frame less and less
as her illness worsens. Bacher edited 1,200 hours of footage into 40
minutes of video stills upon the dealer’s death in 2000, forming an
unusual window into the inner workings of a gallery, as well as an
intimate record of an influential woman as she stares down death.

**TLF:** Here’s something that I’m wondering: Cady Noland, Lutz Bacher
and Sturtevant are — elusive is one word, anonymous could be another —
people. It’s interesting that they resonate in a time when there is so
much celebrity.

**KT:** I don’t think Lutz was ever elusive.

**MR:** I don’t think so either.

**TLF:** Well, never really named.

**MR:** Pseudonymous.

**KT:** She had a name. It was Lutz.

**TT:** But there’s only two images of her online versus a hundred of
someone else. The pressure to be so present in order for the work to
live properly is something I hear a lot.

**MR:** Look what happened when [Jackson
Pollock](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/jackson-pollock) wound up
in Life magazine. The Abstract Expressionists definitely didn’t want to
be turned into brands. More recently, curators started asking crazy
things, like, “Put your picture up with your label.” No thank you. The
Times reporters now even have little pictures in their bios —
everybody’s been personalized because we don’t remember that the work
is supposed to stand for itself.

[Michael
Asher](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/arts/design/michael-asher-artist-dies-at-69.html)
(b. Los Angeles, 1943; d. 2012) spent his career responding to each
gallery or museum space with site-specific works that illuminated the
architectural or abstract qualities of the venue. When the Santa Monica
Museum of Art (now the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles)
approached the conceptualist in 2001 to mount an exhibition, he tapped
into the history of the institution, recreating the wood or metal
skeletons of all of the temporary walls that had been built for the 38
previous exhibitions. The result was a labyrinth of studs that
effectively collapsed time and space, bringing multiple chapters of the
museum’s history into the present. That work characterized his unique
practice over more than 40 years: In 1970, Asher removed all the doors
of an exhibition space at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., to allow
light, air and sound into the galleries, calling viewers’ attention to
the ways such places are usually closed off — both literally and
metaphorically — from the outside world; for a 1991 show at Paris’s
Centre Pompidou, he searched all the books filed under “psychoanalysis”
in the museum’s library for abandoned paper fragments, including
bookmarks; in 1999, he created a [volume
listing](http://moma.org/d/c/exhibition_catalogues/W1siZiIsIjMwMDA5OTYwMiJdLFsicCIsImVuY292ZXIiLCJ3d3cubW9tYS5vcmcvY2FsZW5kYXIvZXhoaWJpdGlvbnMvMTg1IiwiaHR0cDovL21vbWEub3JnL2NhbGVuZGFyL2V4aGliaXRpb25zLzE4NT9sb2NhbGU9cHQiLCJpIl1d.pdf?sha=9748391a05a89941)

deaccessioned since its founding — privileged information rarely made

*“*Community Action Center,” a 69-minute erotic romp through the
imaginations of artists [A.K. Burns](http://www.akburns.net/) (b.
Capitola, Calif., 1975) and [A.L.
Steiner](https://www.hellomynameissteiner.com/) (b. Miami, 1967) and
their community of friends, is a celebration of queer sexuality as
playful as it is political. We watch as a diverse, multigenerational
cast engage in joyfully hedonistic acts of private and shared pleasure
involving paint, egg yolks, carwashes and corn on the cob. Although the
video opens with the cabaret star [Justin Vivian
Bond](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/t-magazine/entertainment/my-10-favorite-books-justin-vivian-bond.html)
reading lines from Jack Smith’s experimental film “[Normal
Love](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3754?locale=en),” there
is otherwise little dialogue. Instead, the focus is on the dreamlike
visuals — captured with an offhand intimacy on rented and borrowed
cameras — and the visceral sensations they evoke. “Community Action
Center” is the rare ribald work that doesn’t refer to male desire or
gratification, which is partly why Steiner and Burns, who are activists
as well as artists, describe it as “socio-sexual.” Radical politics
needn’t come at the cost of sensuality, however. The piece is meant to
titillate.

**KT:** It’s a really important work, too.

**TLF:** I haven’t seen it.

**KT:** They spearheaded this project to essentially make porn, but it’s
much more than that, with all kinds of people from their queer
community. It includes so many artists that we know and that are making
work now, and very visible, but it was all about figuring out how to
show their body, show their sexuality, share their body, share their
sexuality, make light of it, make it serious, collaborate with
musicians. It’s a crazy document of a moment that opened up a
conversation.

[Danh
Vo](https://www.publicartfund.org/exhibitions/view/danh-vo-we-the-people/)
(b. Vietnam, 1975) immigrated to Denmark with his family after the fall
of Saigon in 1979. “We the People,” a full-size copper replica of the
Statue of Liberty, may be his most ambitious work. Fabricated in
Shanghai, the colossal figure exists in roughly 250 pieces, dispersed
throughout public and private collections around the world. It will
never be assembled or exhibited as a whole. In its fragmented state,
Vo’s statue alludes to the hypocrisy and contradictions of Western
foreign policy. A gift from France to the United States, dedicated in
1886, the original monument was billed as a celebration of freedom and
democracy — values both nations proved willing to overlook when dealing
with other countries. At the time of the dedication, France possessed
colonies in Africa and Asia, including Vietnam, where a miniature
version of the statue was installed on the roof of the Tháp Rùa temple
(or Turtle Tower) in Hanoi. Later, the United States financially
supported the French military in Vo’s home country, waging war in the
name of protecting democracy from Communism. By then, of course, the
Statue of Liberty had welcomed millions of immigrants to the United
States and had become a symbol of the American dream. In the wake of
current violent crackdowns on immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border,
Vo’s fragmented icon has never felt more darkly apropos.

**DB:** I chose this because it totally takes away the masterpiece idea.
It’s the one statue, with many meanings embedded within it, but totally
distributed. The sections are made in China, right?

**RT:** Yes.

**DB:** So it’s also the idea that this object, which is synonymous with
the United States, is now made in what will be the superpower of the
future. It’s signaling what other futures will be, and it gets back to
this idea that “contemporary” is a total unknowingness. We don’t know
what the hell the “contemporary” is, and I think in some ways, these
works affirm that that unknowingness is where we begin.

**KT:** That work had so much violence and anger in it. Anger is a big
part of the work that’s being made by artists now — everyone’s feeling
it — specifically the anger of a displaced person. This idea of what
we’ve done as a country, all over the world.

Ever since 1994, when the 24-year-old [Kara
Walker](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/kara-walker) (b. Stockton,
Calif., 1969) first astounded audiences with cut-paper installations
depicting plantation barbarism, she has plumbed this country’s long
history of racial violence. In 2014, Walker created “A Subtlety,” a
monumental polystyrene sphinx coated in white sugar. The piece dominated
an enormous hall of the Domino Sugar refinery in Brooklyn, shortly
before much of the factory was demolished for condominiums. In a
reversal of her black-paper silhouettes of white slave owners, Walker
gave the colossal white sculpture the features of a stereotypical black
“mammy” in a kerchief, the sort of imagery used by molasses brands to
market their product. Walker’s sphinx also conjures up forced labor in
ancient Egypt. “In my own life, in my own way of moving through the
world, I have a hard time making a distinction between the past and the
present,” she [has
said](https://observer.com/2014/05/kara-walker-on-domino-demolition-it-makes-me-very-sad/).
“Everything is kind of hitting me all at once.”

**MR:** “A Subtlety” made lots of people furious because it was about
the history of labor and sugar in a place that was already about to be
gentrified. It was this gigantic, mammy-like, sphinxlike, female object,
and then it had all these little melting children. “A Subtlety” is part
of a very longstanding tradition that began in the Arab world that had
to do with creating objects out of clay but also out of sugar. So it’s
the impacted value of extractive mining, but it’s also the impacted
value of the labor of slaves. And it’s *also* on the site where wage
slavery had occurred — sugar work was the worst. The Domino Sugar
factory was once owned by the Havemeyers, and Henry Havemeyer was one of
the main donors to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The sugar king was
the art king. So it had all of these things — and then there’s the idea
of all these people taking selfies in front of it. It was extremely
brilliant without having to say a thing.

**TLF:** Martha, you wrote to me in an email that you are against the
idea of the game-changing masterpiece. I thought we should put that on
the record.

**MR:** I’m happy to say that it makes no sense in a contemporary era to
talk about a work in isolation, because as soon as a work is noticed,
everybody then notices what the person did before or who was around
them. Art is not made in isolation. This brings me to the “genius”: The
masterwork and the genius go together. That was one of the first things
women artists attacked. As much as we revere the work of Mike Kelley, he
always said that everything he did depended on what the feminists in
L.A. had done before. What he meant by that, I believe, was that
abjection and pain and abuse are things that are worth paying attention
to in art. And that was something no man would have done at that point,
except [Paul
McCarthy](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/paul-mccarthy), maybe.
The masterpiece idea is highly reductive.

**KT:** This brings up a good point about how there’s a responsibility
to question this. Is that how it’s going to be?

**TT:** No, but listing a work that “defines the contemporary age”
doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be a masterwork.

**MR:** Well, it could be a *bad* masterwork. You could say [Dana
Schutz](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/design/dana-schutz-painting-emmett-till-petzel-gallery.html)
\[the painter of a

2016 work based on a photograph of the mutilated body of Emmett Till,
lynched, in his coffin\]. But the questions of ownership go back to
Sherrie Levine and the Walker Evans work. What’s ownership of an image?
What’s reproduction of a photo? The culture wars of the ’80s all
depended on photographs, whether it was “Piss Christ” or Robert
Mapplethorpe’s work — and we’re still fighting these things. We don’t
want to talk about them. Nobody here named Mapplethorpe — interesting.

**KT:** Thought about it.

**MR:** Nobody mentioned [William
Eggleston](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/t-magazine/william-eggleston-photographer-interview-augusten-burroughs.html)
because we really hate photography in the art world. Nobody named [Susan
Meiselas](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/lens/susan-meiselas-mediations.html).
We always want photography to be something else, which is art, which is
actually what you said about Cindy Sherman’s “[Untitled Film
Stills](https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/cindy-sherman-untitled-film-stills-1977-80/).”
We know it’s not really photography. I’m always interested in the way
art is always ready to kick photography out of the room unless called
upon to say, “Yeah but this was really important for identity, formation
or recognition.” It’s always thematic. It’s never formal.

Birth is the subject of “Baby,” seven photographs by [Heji
Shin](http://www.hejishin.com/) (b. Seoul, South Korea, 1976) that
capture the moments after crowning. Shin illuminates some of the
undeniably gory scenes with a scorching red light. Other pictures are
barely lit at all, and the puckered faces of the almost-born emerge from
menacing black shadows. While these photographs might remind us of our
common humanity, they are hardly sentimental or celebratory — several
are downright scary. This complexity is at the core of Shin’s practice,
from pornographic photographs of chiseled men dressed as beefcake cops
to [colossal portraits of Kanye
West](https://www.galeriebuchholz.de/exhibitions/heji-shin-berlin-2019/)
that debuted shortly after the rapper’s inflammatory conversation with
Donald Trump. (Two Kanye portraits and five of the “Babies” were in the
2019 Whitney Biennial.) At a time when political art is everywhere, with
young artists telling predictably left-leaning audiences exactly what
they want to hear, Shin is an outlier. Her photographs do not answer any
questions. Instead, they ask a lot of their audiences.

**TT:** I was obsessed with the “Baby” photos. I mean, I wanted one
myself. But then my partner was like, “Well what’s the … ” Like, “I’ve
seen pregnancy, what’s the difference?”

**KT:** “A kid could do that?”

**TT:** Or not quite that, but: I understand it aesthetically and I’m
interested in the photo, but what’s it saying and what’s it doing?

**KT:** No one wants to look at that work. No one wants to look at that
act. No one wants to talk about motherhood. No one wants to look at
women like that. No one wants to see a vagina like that. No one wants to
see a human being that looks like that. I think there’s something gross
and revolting and very brave about that work.

In a much-discussed 2016 exhibition titled “91020000” at the New York
nonprofit Artists Space, [Cameron
Rowland](http://www.essexstreet.biz/artist/rowland) (b. Philadelphia,
1988) exhibited furniture and other objects fabricated by inmates often
working for less than a dollar an hour, as well as heavily footnoted
research on the mechanics of mass incarceration. The New York State
Department of Corrections sells these commodities under the brand name
Corcraft to government agencies and nonprofit organizations. Artists
Space was eligible to acquire the benches, manhole cover rings,
firefighter uniforms, metal bars and other objects comprising the
exhibition, which Rowland rents to collectors and museums instead of
selling them. The spare installation recalled those of the Minimalist
sculptor [Donald
Judd](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/obituaries/donald-judd-leading-minimalist-sculptor-dies-at-65.html),
while Rowland’s politically driven approach to Conceptualism and focus
on racial injustice garnered comparisons to Kara Walker and the American
light and text artist [Glenn
Ligon](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/t-magazine/glenn-ligon-adrian-piper-art.html).
[The New
Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/cameron-rowland)
traced Rowland’s artistic ancestry back to “Duchamp, by way of Angela
Davis.”

**TT:** Cameron Rowland’s work is further out on the edges of what’s
considered art. You apply to get a catalog in order to purchase prison
goods. A lot of the work he makes, I don’t even understand how. I still
have a lot of questions, and we’re friends. There’s this unraveling of a
new sort of sideways information that I find really interesting and
confusing at the same time.

## 25\. Arthur Jafa, “Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death,” 2016

At a moment when the volume of images — from pictures of suffering to
bathroom selfies — threatens to preclude empathy, Arthur Jafa’s
seven-and-a-half-minute video, “Love Is the Message, the Message Is
Death,” is a profoundly moving antidote to indifference. Through film
clips, TV broadcasts, music videos and personal footage, Jafa (b.
Tupelo, Miss., 1960) portrays the triumphs and terrors of black life in
America. We see the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Miles Davis; Cam
Newton racing to score a touchdown; a Texas police officer slamming a
teenage girl onto the ground; Barack Obama [singing “Amazing
Grace”](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/arts/obamas-eulogy-which-found-its-place-in-history.html)
at the Charleston church where nine people were murdered by a white
supremacist; and Jafa’s daughter on her wedding day. The film made its
official art-world debut at Gavin Brown’s Enterprise in Harlem just days
after Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2016. Jafa
set the images to Kanye West’s gospel-inflected anthem “Ultralight
Beam.”

**TLF:** Jafa strikes me as more popular, in a sense, if I can use that
word. He crosses over into other worlds.

**TT:** This goes back to David Hammons because — I threw away my
\[Adidas Yeezy\] sneakers Kanye made. \[West alienated many of his fans
when he made [a visit to the White
House](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/us/politics/kanye-trump-white-house-monologue.html)
in October 2018, offering his verbal support of President Trump and
wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap.\]

**KT:** How do you justify that work, then? You still put Arthur Jafa on
the list, which is what I’m really curious about.

**TT:** Because it’s not *my* list. In my head, I thought, “This is
contemporary.” And I think that a good artwork can be problematic. Art
is one of the few things that can transcend or complicate a problem.
“Love Is the Message” can still be a very good artwork and I can
disagree with Arthur Jafa’s approach to it. No one else has done that.
No one else in history has produced a video like that. It’s still moving
things forward, even if they’re moving back a little bit.

**DB:** I think Arthur Jafa is coming out of a lineage of collage and
photomontage artists — from Martha Rosler, sitting right here, to early
artists coming out of the Russian avant-garde — this idea that you don’t
have to agree or adhere to a singular point of view. Each image or piece
of music doesn’t mean something on its own; it’s in the juxtaposition
where meaning comes together. What’s so interesting about the piece is
how seductive it can be, and also, in some ways, it begs for us to
resist that seductive quality because of the violence of some of the
imagery.

[LaToya Ruby
Frazier](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/t-magazine/carrie-mae-weems-influence-latoya-ruby-frazier-laurie-simmons.html)
(b. Braddock, Pa., 1982) was raised in an economically ravaged suburb of
Pittsburgh, where she began photographing her family at the age of 16.
In arresting pictures of her terminally ill grandmother, dilapidated
homes, shuttered businesses and air thick with pollution, Frazier
exposed the effects of poverty and political indifference on
working-class African-Americans. Using her camera as a weapon of social
justice, Frazier highlights the effects of trickle-down economics, union
busting and other policies that have widened the wealth gap across the
nation. Frazier’s series was published as a book, “[The Notion of
Family,](https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/latoya-ruby-fraziers-notion-of-family/)”
in 2014. Since then, she has pursued her blend of art and activism,
embedding herself in Flint, Mich., and other marginalized communities.

**MR:** I am surprised not to see LaToya on this list. Maybe she’s too
young?

**TLF:** Why don’t you state the case for why you’d like to see her?

**MR:** Because she’s not only a sharp, clear and intelligent observer
of black life but specifically of female-centered, working-class, black
life in a small city in the Rust Belt. Most of the African-American
artists we think about deal with urban-centered questions and
relationships. But she knows how to put together activism with social
critique in a way that many other people have been afraid to deal with —
not just with black identity but also class identity. She documented the
closure of the hospital in Braddock, Pa., and called attention to the
fact that the residents’ physical conditions resulted from living in a
town polluted by industry and waste dumping. I think she’s pushed the
boundaries of photography in the art world.
