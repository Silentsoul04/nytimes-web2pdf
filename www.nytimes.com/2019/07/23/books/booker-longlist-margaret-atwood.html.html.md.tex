LONDON --- Margaret Atwood's novel ``The Testaments,'' the highly
anticipated sequel to ``The Handmaid's Tale,'' was announced here on
Wednesday as one of the books in the running for the Booker Prize,
Britain's most prestigious literary award.

``A ferocious nondisclosure agreement'' prevented the prize's judges
from revealing any of the book's plot, they said in a joint statement
announcing the list of 13 competitors. But the novel is ``terrifying and
exhilarating,'' they added.

Atwood, whose novel ``The Blind Assassin''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/08/world/margaret-atwood-is-the-winner-of-britain-s-top-fiction-award.html?searchResultPosition=2}{won
the Booker Prize in 2000}, faces strong competition for the award. Other
nominated books include Salman Rushdie's forthcoming ``Quichotte,''
about a traveling salesman who drives across the United States, and ``10
Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World'' by Elif Shafak, about a
prostitute in Istanbul.

Little is known about ``The Testaments,'' except that it is set 15 years
after ``The Handmaid's Tale'' and is narrated by three female
characters. Last year,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/books/margaret-atwood-sequel-handmaids-tale-testaments.html}{Atwood
said in a statement} that she wanted ``The Testaments'' to explore
parallels between her imaginary dystopia --- in which women are treated
as reproductive serfs --- and the current political climate.

The list of nominees is dominated by novels inspired by political
crises, such as
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/books/review/john-lanchester-wall.html}{John
Lanchester's ``The Wall,''} set on an island surrounded by a concrete
barrier to keep rising seas and immigrants out. The Mexican author
Valeria Luiselli's ``Lost Children Archive,'' about child migrants, has
also made the cut. ``The brilliance of the writing stirs rage and
pity,''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/books/review/lost-children-archive-valeria-luiselli.html}{wrote}
Gaiutra Bahadur, in a review of the book for The New York Times.

The nominated books ``imagine our world, familiar from news cycle
disaster and grievance, with wild humor, deep insight and a keen
humanity,'' said Peter Florence, the chair of the judges, in a
statement. ``These writers offer joy and hope.''

Other books on the list are less political, such as Oyinkan
Braithwaite's comic thriller, ``My Sister, The Serial Killer,'' about
two siblings in Lagos, one of whom has a habit of murdering her
boyfriends. It is ``a bombshell of a book --- sharp, explosive,
hilarious,''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/books/review/oyinkan-braithwaite-my-sister-the-serial-killer.html?searchResultPosition=2}{wrote}
Fiammetta Rocco in The New York Times. ``Only after you turn the last
page do you realize that, as with many brilliant comic writers before
her, laughter for Braithwaite is as good for covering up pain as bleach
is for masking the smell of blood.''

From its inception in 1969 until 2014, the Booker prize was limited to
books by writers from Britain, Ireland and Commonwealth countries (plus
South Africa and, later, Zimbabwe), but that changed in 2014, when it
was opened to works by anyone writing in English. That led to fears it
would be dominated by Americans.

In 2016,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/business/media/paul-beatty-wins-man-booker-prize-with-the-sellout.html?module=inline}{Paul
Beatty's ``The Sellout''} took the prize, and, the following year,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/books/george-saunders-wins-man-booker-prize-lincoln-in-the-bardo.html?module=inline}{``Lincoln
in the Bardo,''} by George Saunders, won. Both writers are American.
After that, criticism of the rule change grew, and non-American authors
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/world/europe/man-booker-prize-americans.html}{complained}
they were being crowded out. In 2018, a literary society that counts
Margaret Atwood, Ian McEwan and Zadie Smith among its members
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/world/europe/man-booker-prize-americans.html?rref=collection\%2Ftimestopic\%2FMan\%20Booker\%20Prize\&action=click\&contentCollection=timestopics\&region=stream\&module=inline\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=3\&pgtype=collection}{demanded
the rule be reversed}.

The closest this year's longlist comes to a book by an American writer
is ``Ducks, Newburyport,'' by Lucy Ellmann, who was born in Illinois,
but moved to Britain when she was 13 and now lives in Edinburgh.

The nominees will be narrowed down to a shortlist of six that will be
revealed on Sept. 3, and the winner, who receives around \$62,000, will
be announced at a ceremony in London on Oct. 14.
