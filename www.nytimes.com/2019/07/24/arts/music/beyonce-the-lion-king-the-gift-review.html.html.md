# Beyoncé Reimagines ‘The Lion King’ as Global 21st-Century Pop

On a companion to the remade film’s official soundtrack, the pop
superstar seeks full-fledged fusions with African

Beyoncé flexes both her musicianship and her cultural leverage with “The
Lion King: The Gift,” her companion album to the state-of-the-art
[remake of “The Lion
King.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/movies/the-lion-king-review.html)
It’s her latest lesson in commandeering mass-market expectations, as she
bends “The Lion King” to her own agenda of African-diaspora unity,
self-worth, parental responsibility and righteous ambition.

Beyoncé was an obvious choice to be cast in an anointed blockbuster: the
25th-anniversary update of “The Lion King,” the 1994 animated Disney
parable set in Africa. Its story of a young lion fleeing and then
reclaiming his birthright had already generated a [1997 Broadway
adaptation](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/14/movies/theater-review-cub-comes-of-age-a-twice-told-cosmic-tale.html)
— still running — and movie sequels. Beyoncé has a voice role in the new
version as the brave, conscientious lioness Nala; she also, of course,
sings on the soundtrack.

On the official soundtrack album, Beyoncé joins in a remake of [“Can You
Feel the Love Tonight,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_USvdbYS1g)
the Oscar-winning song that ended the original “Lion King,” and caps the
existing soundtrack songs with her new one,
[“Spirit,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=civgUOommC8) a dynamic
secular-gospel exhortation to “Rise up\!” Beyoncé wrote and produced
“Spirit” with the British producer Labrinth and with Ilya Salmanzadeh,
a member of Max Martin’s Swedish songwriting stable; it’s also on “The
Gift.”

</div>

But “The Gift” goes much further. With Beyoncé as executive producer and
a songwriter and performer on most of its tracks, it’s essentially an
alternative soundtrack album, tied to the plot of “The Lion King” (and
interspersed with dialogue snippets) but decidedly more Afrocentric and
more attuned to women’s strengths and experiences.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On “The Gift,” the movie’s plot points are springboards for songs like
“Keys to the Kingdom,” “Scar” and “Already.” The album’s first full
song, “Bigger,” is at once maternally protective and acutely aware of
generational cycles and, as the video clip emphasizes, ecological
interdependence: “You’re part of something way bigger,” Beyoncé sings,
adding, “I’ll be the roots/You be the tree,” as a somber beat gathers
under churchy keyboard chords. She follows “Bigger” with a paternal
counterpart: “Find Your Way Back (Circle of Life),” with Beyoncé
recalling a father’s lessons on a track that samples the [Nigerian
singer Niniola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCbjK4259RM).

Like many other Disney projects set outside the United States, in 1994
[“The Lion
King”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/movies/the-lion-king-review.html)
fudged the specifics of a distant (from Hollywood) place with a
well-intentioned but hazy first-world perspective; Africa is just
Africa, without particular cultures, countries or regions. (It’s also
unquestioningly celebrated as a patrilineal monarchy.) The wildlife and
landscape of “The Lion King” suggest the Serengeti plains of Tanzania
and Kenya, and its African names and words are in the Swahili language —
all East African.

Meanwhile, the movie’s music is largely non-African, steeped in
Hollywood and Broadway idioms, with an orchestral score by the German
composer Hans Zimmer ([reworked for the 2019
version](https://variety.com/2019/artisans/production/hans-zimmer-recreates-score-lion-king-1203271637/))
and wordplay-loving, musical-theater-style songs by two Englishmen,
Elton John and the lyricist Tim Rice. At key moments in the 1994
soundtrack, the South African musician Lebo M. (Lebohang Morake)
provided South African-style choir arrangements and his own vocals,
including the indelible opening incantation in “Circle of Life.” He gets
far more prominent billing in the remake.

Untethered to previous productions, Beyoncé has rethought “The Lion
King” as 21st-century global pop, frequently drawing on Africa. Her
throngs of collaborators include musicians, singers and producers from
the U.S., England, Sweden, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana and Cameroon
(though not East Africa). It’s a canny, forward-looking move, both
musically and with an eye to an international market that’s increasingly
receptive to African innovations and non-English lyrics. Beyoncé even
sings in Swahili at the end of
[“Otherside,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMbTX-yDT0) a ballad
invoking life after death.

American and British songwriters — Paul Simon, David Byrne, Peter
Gabriel, [Carlos
Santana](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/arts/music/santana-buika-africa-speaks.html)
— have all found renewal in African music, as jazz musicians did before
them. With “The Lion King: The Gift,” Beyoncé joins their ranks
soulfully and attentively, seeking full-fledged fusions. She mixes
(apparently) personal thoughts and archetypal ones; she savors musical
hybrids and rhythmic challenges; and she digs in to every line she
sings.

Internationalism reigns. [“My
Power”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_ZsbqSg4aE) — with Beyoncé
alongside [Tierra
Whack](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/arts/music/tierra-whack-whack-world-interview.html)
from Philadelphia, Yemi Alade from Nigeria and Nija, Busiswa, Moonchild
Sanelly and DJ Lag from South Africa — is built on the deep bass thuds
and jittery double time percussion of the South African dance music
called gqom. In [“Water,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=essike_sirI)
Beyoncé and Pharrell Williams are joined by Salatiel, a songwriter from
Cameroon, in a bouncy, sinuous track with leaping vocal inflections that
also includes a credit for a Ghanaian songwriter, Afriye. The track for
[“Mood 4 Eva,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i978rjXw3P0) Beyoncé’s
and Jay-Z’s latest celebration of their luxurious life, transforms a
sample from the Malian singer and songwriter Oumou Sangaré.

Some of the album’s guest performers have racked up tens of millions of
streams worldwide without extensive recognition — yet — in the U.S.
Prominent among them is a Nigerian contingent that draws on the crisp,
computerized rhythms that are known internationally as
[Afrobeats](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/world/africa/nigeria-lagos-afrobeats-music-piracy-seyi-shay.html)
(and are clearly related to reggaeton’s ubiquitous dembow rhythm via
West African-Caribbean roots and internet cross-pollination).

The album includes the Nigerian stars Burna Boy (who gets a song of his
own, [“Ja Ara E,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hlE_Fc2jk4) that
suavely warns, “Watch out for them hyenas”) and Mr Eazi (who shares
[“Don’t Jealous Me”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7xLNmYM8yk) with
Tekno, Lord Afrixana and Yemi Alade and “Keys to the Kingdom” with Tiwa
Savage, all fellow Nigerians). Wizkid, the Nigerian songwriter who
collaborated with Drake on the worldwide hit [“One
Dance,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcer12OFU2g) duets with
Beyoncé to praise the beauty of a “Brown Skin Girl”; the track also has
the voice of Beyoncé’s and Jay-Z’s daughter Blue Ivy Carter.

Each song on “The Gift” is a coalition, almost always a trans-Atlantic
one. And the African elements are at the core of the music; they’re not
souvenirs or accessories. Unlike the movie that occasioned it, “The Lion
King: The Gift” is no remake or reiteration, no faraway fable. It tells
a story of its own.
