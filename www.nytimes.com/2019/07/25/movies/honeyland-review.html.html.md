# ‘Honeyland’ Review: The Sting and the Sweetness

</div>

A documentary about a Macedonian beekeeper’s conflict with her neighbors
becomes a lyrical environmental fable.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The opening minutes of “[Honeyland](https://honeyland.earth/)” are as
astonishing — as sublime and strange and full of human and natural
beauty — as anything I’ve ever seen in a movie. A woman makes her way on
foot across wild meadowlands and up a mountainside, carefully stepping
along a narrow ledge to a rocky outcropping, where bees have made a
hive. Without much protective gear, and apparently without being stung,
she extracts several honeycombs and secures them in a sack.

Back home, in the valley — she is one of two permanent residents of a
hamlet in what is now called the [Republic of North
Macedonia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/travel/republic-of-north-macedonia-balkans.html)
— she transplants the colony to a stone wall near her house. In the
coming months, she sings to the bees and talks to them, explaining the
terms of their relationship. When the time comes to take the honey,
she’ll leave half of it for them. It’s not a bargain, exactly, since
the bees have no real say in the matter, but it is a sustainable
arrangement, and one that has survived in this region for generations.

The woman, Hatidze Muratova, is an actual beekeeper, and “Honeyland,”
directed by [Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara
Kotevska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ES4mfYYsII), is a documentary
about her life and labors. Originally commissioned to make a video about
conservation efforts in Macedonia, the filmmakers spent three years with
Hatidze; her mother, Nazife; and the late-arriving people next door.
(More about them shortly). As a result, Stefanov and Kotevska have done
more than record the rhythms and textures of rural life. They have
shaped their observations — more than 400 hours of footage — into a
luminous neorealist fable, a sad and stirring tale of struggle,
persistence and change.

</div>

<div class="css-1u3pw94">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hatidze, born in 1964, lives with Nazife, who is bedridden and partly
blind; a hound named Jackie; and those industrious bees. It’s an austere
existence, but it has its satisfactions, and Hatidze isn’t entirely
isolated from the rest of the world. Skopje, the Macedonian capital, is
only a little more than 12 miles away, and she travels there, on foot
and by train, to sell her honey. Because of its superior quality and her
shrewdness, it fetches a good price. She uses the revenue to buy
household goods, including dye for the graying hair she wears tucked
into a kerchief.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Just as you are settling into Hatidze’s company, appreciating the edges
and contours of her personality and savoring the deep pleasure of her
work, the pastoral calm is shattered. A family rumbles into the village
in a noisy trailer that turns out to be the quietest thing about it. The
patriarch, Hussein, and his wife, Ljutvie, bring chickens, cows and a
small army of children. At first, Hatidze welcomes these neighbors, who
are Turkish speakers like her. She tutors one of the older boys in the
mysteries of the apiary and tolerates periodic invasions of her privacy
from the littler ones.

Though she is too courteous to say so, you have the feeling that Hatidze
views Hussein as a man who may have overestimated his abilities. He has
a habit of blaming other people — Ljutvie and their children, mostly —
for his misfortunes and mistakes. His plan is to herd cows and keep
bees, turning this empty patch of territory into a literal land of milk
and honey, at a scale sufficient to feed his family and his ego.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hussein is not exactly a villain. He’s doing his best. But his crude
methods, his sandpapery personality and the sheer chaos that surrounds
him conspire to disrupt Hatidze’s routines. As relations between them
deteriorate, “Honeyland” touches on what may be a universal feature of
modern experience, familiar to urban apartment dwellers and house-proud
suburbanites, as well as to old-school agrarians. The Rolling Stones
wrote a song about [“groaning and straining with the trouble and
strife.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omGDmvNWLVw) Neighbors are a
nightmare.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the presence of Hussein and his unruly household is also
serendipitous, a gift from the gods of film narrative. This isn’t to
attribute the filmmakers’ remarkable achievement to luck. They draw
comedy and pathos out of the conflict. They render the thick complexity
of experience with poignant clarity. Their movie is quiet, intimate and
intense, but touched with a breath of epic grandeur. It’s a poem
including history.

And one that regards the future with both apprehension and hope. Hatidze
seems to be the last of her kind. Hussein’s rapacious exploitation of
scarce and fragile resources represents the norm, supported by a crude
utilitarian argument. Their struggle feels like a microcosm of the human
predicament at a time of environmental catastrophe, and Hatidze,
precisely because of her modesty and patience, looks like a heroic
figure, offering a warning and an example to the rest of us, her
wasteful, wanton neighbors.

It may be a strange thing to say about a documentary, but “Honeyland”
reminded me of [“The
Lorax,”](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/10/us/speaking-for-the-trees.html)
Dr. Seuss’s great, prescient tale of ecological folly. Like the title
character in that story, Hatidze is a kind of prophet. She speaks for
the bees.
