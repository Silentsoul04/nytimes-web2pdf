# When Kamala Harris and Joe Biden Clashed on Busing and Segregation

</div>

In a contentious exchange during the last round of Democratic debates,
Ms. Harris confronted Mr. Biden about having worked with segregationists
in the Senate and discussed her personal history with busing. Here’s a
refresher.

Perhaps no moment from the first Democratic debates in June was more
dramatic than [the tense exchange between former Vice President Joseph
R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of
California](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html).
The two Democrats sparred on the issues of race, segregation and school
busing.

## What happened

  - About an hour [into the debate held
    June 27](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/democratic-debate-recap.html?module=inline),
    Ms. Harris, a black former prosecutor, leapt into the cross-talk
    with a request to speak “on the issue of race.” She then trained her
    attention on Mr. Biden, and after making clear that she did not
    believe he was a racist, proceeded to sharply criticize him for
    having made “very hurtful” comments about [having worked with two
    segregationist
    senators](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html?module=inline).

  - Ms. Harris then also recalled Mr. Biden’s [opposition to school
    busing in
    the 1970s](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/factcheck-democratic-debate.html?module=inline)
    and opened up about her own history. “There was a little girl in
    California who was a part of the second class to integrate her
    public schools and she was bused to school every day,” she said.
    “And that little girl was me.”

  - Mr. Biden called her remarks “a mischaracterization of my position
    across the board.” Moments later, he added: “I did not oppose busing
    in America,” Mr. Biden said. “What I opposed is busing ordered by
    the Department of Education.”

  - [In
    reality,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/factcheck-democratic-debate.html?module=inline)
    Mr. Biden was a [leading
    opponent](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/joe-biden-james-eastland.html?module=inline)
    of busing in the Senate during the 1970s and 1980s, and his
    opposition went beyond the federal government’s role in the
    practice.

## The fallout

  - Both candidates’ history with busing quickly came under scrutiny
    after the debate. Mr. Biden [staunchly defended his civil rights
    record](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/biden-harris-debate-democratic.html)
    even as news outlets published [a parade of
    pieces](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/biden-harris-debate-democratic.html)
    [documenting](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/joe-biden-busing-timeline.html)
    that Mr. Biden had, in fact, been a [leading
    opponent](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/joe-biden-james-eastland.html?module=inline)
    of busing in the Senate [during the 1970s
    and 1980s](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/joe-biden-busing-kamala-harris.html)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

  - Ms. Harris also [faced questions about her current position on
    school
    integration](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/us/politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-busing-iowa.html).She
    said that busing should be part of “the toolbox” to desegregate
    schools and said she supported school districts and municipalities
    doing “whatever they need to do” on integration measures.” Her
    somewhat vague and muddled answers led some to believe that she and
    Mr. Biden shared the same position on busing — though Ms. Harris
    insisted that was not the case.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
    </span>

  - In [polls taken after the first
    debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/kamala-harris-polls.html),
    support for Mr. Biden generally slipped while support for Ms. Harris
    increased. Ms. Harris [also experienced a surge in
    fund-raising](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/us/politics/kamala-harris-fundraising.html).

  - Mr. Biden eventually said[he had not been
    prepared](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/us/politics/biden-harris-busing-cnn.html)
    for Ms. Harris’s pointed questioning during the debate. He also
    [apologized for the remarks he made weeks
    earlier](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/06/us/politics/joe-biden-barack-obama-south-carolina.html)
    about his working relationships with Southern segregationists.

## What to watch for tonight

  - At Wednesday night’s debate, Ms. Harris will be standing on one side
    of Mr. Biden while Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey stands on the
    other. Don’t be surprised if a confrontation ensues. Mr. Booker
    demanded early on that Mr. Biden apologize for praising
    segregationist senators. And more recently, Mr. Booker [attacked Mr.
    Biden’s plan for criminal justice
    reform](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/biden-criminal-justice.html),
    saying he was responsible for building a “failed system.”

  - For his part, Mr. Biden has said he will not be as “polite” at this
    debate as he was at the last. And he and his team have already begun
    to engage. After Ms. Harris [released a new health care plan this
    week](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all.html),
    Mr. Biden’s campaign was quick to criticize it. Some of his allies
    say privately that they expect him to be much more assertive on
    Wednesday.
