\section{When Kamala Harris and Joe Biden Clashed on Busing and
Segregation}\label{when-kamala-harris-and-joe-biden-clashed-on-busing-and-segregation}}

In a contentious exchange during the last round of Democratic debates,
Ms. Harris confronted Mr. Biden about having worked with segregationists
in the Senate and discussed her personal history with busing. Here's a
refresher.

Perhaps no moment from the first Democratic debates in June was more
dramatic than
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html}{the
tense exchange between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and
Senator Kamala Harris of California}. The two Democrats sparred on the
issues of race, segregation and school busing.

\subsection{What happened}\label{what-happened}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  About an hour
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/democratic-debate-recap.html?module=inline}{into
  the debate held June 27}, Ms. Harris, a black former prosecutor, leapt
  into the cross-talk with a request to speak ``on the issue of race.''
  She then trained her attention on Mr. Biden, and after making clear
  that she did not believe he was a racist, proceeded to sharply
  criticize him for having made ``very hurtful'' comments about
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html?module=inline}{having
  worked with two segregationist senators}.
\item
  Ms. Harris then also recalled Mr. Biden's
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/factcheck-democratic-debate.html?module=inline}{opposition
  to school busing in the 1970s} and opened up about her own history.
  ``There was a little girl in California who was a part of the second
  class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school
  every day,'' she said. ``And that little girl was me.''
\item
  Mr. Biden called her remarks ``a mischaracterization of my position
  across the board.'' Moments later, he added: ``I did not oppose busing
  in America,'' Mr. Biden said. ``What I opposed is busing ordered by
  the Department of Education.''
\item
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/factcheck-democratic-debate.html?module=inline}{In
  reality,} Mr. Biden was a
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/joe-biden-james-eastland.html?module=inline}{leading
  opponent} of busing in the Senate during the 1970s and 1980s, and his
  opposition went beyond the federal government's role in the practice.
\end{itemize}

\item
  Both candidates' history with busing quickly came under scrutiny after
  the debate. Mr. Biden
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/biden-harris-debate-democratic.html}{staunchly
  defended his civil rights record} even as news outlets published
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/biden-harris-debate-democratic.html}{a
  parade of pieces}
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/joe-biden-busing-timeline.html}{documenting}
  that Mr. Biden had, in fact, been a
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/joe-biden-james-eastland.html?module=inline}{leading
  opponent} of busing in the Senate
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/joe-biden-busing-kamala-harris.html}{during
  the 1970s and 1980s}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ms. Harris also
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/us/politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-busing-iowa.html}{faced
  questions about her current position on school integration}.She said
  that busing should be part of ``the toolbox'' to desegregate schools
  and said she supported school districts and municipalities doing
  ``whatever they need to do'' on integration measures.'' Her somewhat
  vague and muddled answers led some to believe that she and Mr. Biden
  shared the same position on busing --- though Ms. Harris insisted that
  was not the case. 
\item
  In
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/kamala-harris-polls.html}{polls
  taken after the first debate}, support for Mr. Biden generally slipped
  while support for Ms. Harris increased. Ms. Harris
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/us/politics/kamala-harris-fundraising.html}{also
  experienced a surge in fund-raising}.
\item
  Mr. Biden eventually
  said\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/us/politics/biden-harris-busing-cnn.html}{he
  had not been prepared} for Ms. Harris's pointed questioning during the
  debate. He also
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/06/us/politics/joe-biden-barack-obama-south-carolina.html}{apologized
  for the remarks he made weeks earlier} about his working relationships
  with Southern segregationists.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-to-watch-for-tonight}{%
\subsection{What to watch for tonight}\label{what-to-watch-for-tonight}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  At Wednesday night's debate, Ms. Harris will be standing on one side
  of Mr. Biden while Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey stands on the
  other. Don't be surprised if a confrontation ensues. Mr. Booker
  demanded early on that Mr. Biden apologize for praising segregationist
  senators. And more recently, Mr. Booker
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/biden-criminal-justice.html}{attacked
  Mr. Biden's plan for criminal justice reform}, saying he was
  responsible for building a ``failed system.''
\item
  For his part, Mr. Biden has said he will not be as ``polite'' at this
  debate as he was at the last. And he and his team have already begun
  to engage. After Ms. Harris
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all.html}{released
  a new health care plan this week}, Mr. Biden's campaign was quick to
  criticize it. Some of his allies say privately that they expect him to
  be much more assertive on Wednesday.
