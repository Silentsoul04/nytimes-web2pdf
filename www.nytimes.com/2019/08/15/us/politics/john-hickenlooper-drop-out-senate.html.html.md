John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor whose low-key brand of
moderate politics made him popular in his home state but limited his
appeal in a Democratic primary filled with urgent progressive energy,
announced on Thursday that he was ending his presidential campaign.

Mr. Hickenlooper has been seriously considering a run for the
Republican-held Senate seat in Colorado that is up for election in 2020
— a key pickup target in the Democrats’ strategy to try to retake
control of the Senate.

“Today, I’m ending my campaign for president,” he said in a videotaped
statement. “But I will never stop believing that America can only move
forward when we work together.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’ve heard from so many Coloradans who want me to run for the United
States Senate,” he added. “They remind me how much is at stake for our
country. And our state. I intend to give that some serious thought.”

Mr. Hickenlooper’s White House bid never gained significant traction and
struggled so acutely that top staff members departed. He failed to break
through in the polls, [raised less money than most of his
competitors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/16/us/politics/democratic-fundraising-2020.html)
and was all but certain to miss the cutoff for the [Democratic
debates](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/democratic-debates) in
September.

A failure to qualify for the debates would have added to a growing list
of humbling moments for Mr. Hickenlooper, 67, who is also a former
Denver mayor, brewpub owner and geologist. All too often he found
himself in front of small, distracted crowds at campaign events. He was
mistaken at one point for [a member of the news
media](https://twitter.com/scottdetrow/status/1143929727654289408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1143929727654289408&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fjohn-hickenlooper-mistaken-for-a-reporter-at-the-democratic-debates-2019-6%3Futm_source%3Dhearst%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_content%3Dallverticals)
and at another for a different candidate.

Mr. Hickenlooper [had been in discussions about
withdrawing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/politics/john-hickenlooper-2020-senate.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)
from the presidential primary since at least early this month and
running for the Senate instead. Colorado is a purple battleground state,
and flipping the seat currently held by Senator Cory Gardner [is all but
mandatory if Democrats hope to have any
chance](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/us/democrats-senate-campaign.html)
of retaking the Senate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A [recent
poll](https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/12/john-hickenlooper-2020-senate-cory-gardner/)
showed Mr. Hickenlooper with more than a 50-point lead over [the current
leading
Democrats](https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/26/f4/625f79044305a2f3bd9b98ce8c4f/kr-colorado-senate-dp-voter-poll-july-2019-xtabs.pdf)
in the race for the party’s nomination for the Senate seat; [another
poll
showed](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:f9273f93-44fc-411d-ab25-6e88b356e58d)
him ahead of Mr. Gardner by 13 percentage points in a head-to-head
matchup. Those surveys were conducted by Democratic polling firms.

After Mr. Hickenlooper’s announcement, the advocacy group that
commissioned one of the polls urged the former governor to challenge Mr.
Gardner.

“As mayor of Denver and governor, John Hickenlooper did what was right
for Colorado, and what is right for Colorado now is for him to defeat
Cory Gardner,” said Josh Morrow, the executive director of the group,
314 Action Fund. “In the Senate, Gardner has pushed the far-right Trump
agenda harder than Trump himself.”

A spokesman for Mr. Gardner’s Senate campaign did not respond to a
request for comment on Thursday.

Mr. Hickenlooper is one of a handful of presidential candidates,
including [former Representative Beto O’Rourke of
Texas](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/politics/beto-orourke-2020-trump.html)
and [Gov. Steve Bullock of
Montana](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/steve-bullock-democrats-2020.html),
who have been encouraged by some Democrats to drop their bids for the
White House and run for the Senate.

At first, he was largely resistant to the idea. But this month, as his
presidential campaign lurched along, Mr. Hickenlooper’s [communications
director told
CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/hickenlooper-schumer-senate-2020/index.html)
that the former governor had not “closed the door to anything.” Senator
Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, has spent months trying to recruit
Mr. Hickenlooper. And during a recent trip to Iowa, Mr. Hickenlooper
hopped into the car of Michael Bennet, Colorado’s Democratic senator and
another presidential candidate, to discuss his impending decision.

*\[Who’s in? Who’s out?* [*Keep up with the 2020 field with our
candidate
tracker*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article)*.\]*

In [kicking off his presidential
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/john-hickenlooper-2020.html),
Mr. Hickenlooper pitched himself as a unifier who could help mend what
he called a “crisis of division.” But in a partisan era in which many
Democrats are seething with anger toward President Trump, messages about
compromise and compassion from Mr. Hickenlooper and some of his rivals
have largely fallen on deaf ears.

On policy, he sought to carve out space for himself as a moderate option
for voters during an election cycle that has seen progressive ideas
flourish. A successful entrepreneur who helped open a chain of
Midwestern pubs and restaurants, Mr. Hickenlooper [staunchly defended
capitalism and rejected
socialism](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/john-hickenlooper-capitalism-socialism.html)
— even when it earned him disdain.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bennet, who served as Mr. Hickenlooper’s chief of staff during his
tenure as Denver’s mayor, said Thursday that Mr. Hickenlooper had
“helped shape the presidential race with his pragmatic viewpoint.”

“He provided a valuable voice in this primary, bringing the ideas and
solutions he successfully championed in Colorado to the national
debate,” Mr. Bennet [said in a
tweet](https://twitter.com/MichaelBennet/status/1162053029417377792).

Rick Ridder, a campaign strategist and organizer in Colorado and a
longtime friend of Mr. Hickenlooper, said the former governor had always
done well by presenting himself more as a brewery owner than a
politician — even though he had been elected several times to serve as
one.

“The presidential campaign made John Hickenlooper look a lot more like a
politician than a brewer,” Mr. Ridder said. “I think he was
uncomfortable in that role.”

Mr. Ridder also said he believed that Mr. Hickenlooper’s candidacy was
harmed by the rules around qualifying for the presidential debates.

“What these debates have done is accelerate the timing so a lot of
candidates don’t quite have the time to find their voice,” Mr. Ridder
said. “John was working on trying to find his voice, and yet he was
thrown into the cauldron before he was ready.”

Mr. Hickenlooper is the second candidate to withdraw from the Democratic
presidential field since it expanded significantly in the spring;
[Representative Eric Swalwell of
California](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/steyer-swalwell-2020.html)
exited the race in July. [Twenty-three
others](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html)
are still seeking the nomination.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As it turned out, the July debates would be Mr. Hickenlooper’s final
opportunity to speak to millions of Americans at once. He spent much of
the evening pushing back on liberal policy ideas like [“Medicare for
all”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/politics/2020-democrats-medicare-for-all-public-option.html)
and the [Green New
Deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/climate/green-new-deal-questions-answers.html).
With momentum behind the more popular and progressive candidates onstage
with him, Mr. Hickenlooper at times appeared under strain.

And yet, when it was his turn to give a brief closing statement, he
began by expressing only unbridled enthusiasm.

“What a night,” he said. “I’ve loved
it.”
