WASHINGTON --- The United States will allow American companies to
continue doing business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications
giant, for an additional 90 days,
\href{https://twitter.com/MariaBartiromo?ref_src=twsrc\%5Egoogle\%7Ctwcamp\%5Eserp\%7Ctwgr\%5Eauthor}{Commerce
Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday.}

The government's reprieve is intended to give rural telecommunications
companies in the United States more time to wean themselves from Huawei,
which supplies many of those providers with parts and equipment. Rural
telecom firms in the United States
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/technology/huawei-rural-wireless-service.html}{have
been scrambling} to figure out how they will replace Huawei equipment
since the Trump administration effectively banned the company from
United States communications networks in May and have been lobbying the
White House for more time.

``As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei's
products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any
disruption,'' Mr. Ross said in a statement.

Huawei has been thrust into the middle of President Trump's trade fight
with China, and the president has given mixed signals about the telecom
giant's fate. After trade talks broke down in May, the Commerce
Department added the company to a United States ``entity list'' that
effectively banned the firm from buying American technology and other
products without government approval.

But after American companies complained that the ban would be hard to
comply with on such short notice, Commerce promptly offered a reprieve
until Aug. 19. Mr. Trump had hinted that he could yield further on
Huawei in exchange for China's purchasing more American farm products,
but no such agreement has emerged.

In a sign that the administration is not completely easing pressure on
Huawei, the Commerce Department said that it was also adding 46
affiliates of Huawei to the entity list.

In a terse statement issued on Monday, Huawei called the addition of the
affiliates ``politically motivated'' and unrelated to national security
and said that it was being treated ``unjustly.''

``These actions violate the basic principles of free market
competition,''
\href{https://www.huawei.eu/press-release/media-statement-regarding-us-commerce-departments-decision-extend-temporary-general}{Huawei
said in the statement}. ``Attempts to suppress Huawei's business won't
help the United States achieve technological leadership.''

Mr. Trump has called the company a national security threat, and the
United States has concerns that Huawei could be used to help the Chinese
government's espionage efforts and to disrupt American
telecommunications infrastructure in the event of a conflict.

``Huawei is a company we may not do business with at all,'' Mr. Trump
said on Sunday.

The temporary relief for Huawei comes as trade negotiations between the
United States and China remain at an impasse.

Mr. Trump agreed last week to delay some additional tariffs on toys and
electronics until December, but the United States is still expected to
slap levies on more Chinese imports on Sept. 1. Earlier this month it
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/business/economy/china-currency-manipulator.html}{labeled
China a currency manipulator} for the first time since 1994. China is
expected to unveil plans to retaliate.

Despite the escalating tension, Mr. Trump said that he and President Xi
Jinping of China were planning to speak and that the two countries would
continue to have trade talks.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been urging Mr. Trump to keep
his hard line on Huawei. Lifting the ban outright would probably be met
with strong bipartisan disapproval.

Speaking on the Fox Business Network on Monday, Mr. Ross said that the
administration would offer another extension through mid-November.

The Trump administration has warned that Huawei poses a national
security threat, and American officials have been warning allies for
months that the United States will stop sharing intelligence if they use
Huawei and other Chinese technology to build the core of their
fifth-generation, or 5G, networks.
