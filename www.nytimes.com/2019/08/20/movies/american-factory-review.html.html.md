“The most important thing is not how much money we earn,” the Chinese
billionaire Cao Dewang says in “American Factory” soon before we see him
on a private jet. What’s important, he says, are Americans’ views toward
China and its people.

In 2016, Cao opened a division of Fuyao, his global auto-glass
manufacturing company, in a shuttered General Motors factory near
Dayton, Ohio. Blaming slumping S.U.V. sales, G.M. had closed the plant —
known as the General Motors Moraine Assembly Plant — in December 2008,
throwing thousands out of work the same month the American government
began a multibillion [dollar
bailout](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/u-s-sells-remaining-stake-in-gm/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAuto%20Bailout&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=9&pgtype=collection)
of the auto industry. The Dayton factory remained idle until Fuyao
announced it was taking it over, investing millions and hiring hundreds
of local workers, [numbers it
soon](https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/breaking-news/fuyao-set-double-hiring-moraine-plant-500-jobs/XIW2hI9dJ3w0Rw5Uw8KVnL/)
increased.

[The veteran
filmmakers](https://www.documentary.org/online-feature/meet-academy-award-nominees-steven-bognar-and-julia-reichert-last-truck-closing-gm)
Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert, who are a couple and live outside of
Dayton, documented the G.M. plant when it closed. They included the
image of the last truck rolling off the line in their 2009 short, “[The
Last Truck: Closing of a GM
Plant](https://www.hbo.com/content/hboweb/en/documentaries/the-last-truck-closing-of-a-gm-plant/synopsis.html).”
That crystallizing image also appears in “American Factory,” which
revisits the plant six years later. The feature-length story they tell
here is complex, stirring,
[timely](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/us/politics/trump-wto-china.html)
and beautifully shaped, spanning continents as it surveys the past,
present and possible future of American labor. (This is the first movie
that Barack and Michelle Obama’s company [Higher Ground
Productions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/business/media/obama-netflix-shows.html)
is releasing with Netflix.)

“American Factory” opens with a brief, teary look back at the plant’s
closing that sketches in the past and foreshadows the difficult times
ahead. The story proper begins in 2015 amid the optimistic bustle of new
beginnings, including a rah-rah Fuyao presentation for American job
seekers. Bognar and Reichert, who shot the movie with several others —
the editor is Lindsay Utz — have a great eye for faces and they quickly
narrow in on the range of expressions in the room. Some applicants sit
and listen stoically; one woman, her hand over her mouth, gently rocks
in her seat, tapping out a nervous rhythm as the Fuyao representative
delivers his pitch.

With detail and sweep, interviews and you-are-there visuals, the
filmmakers quickly establish a clear, strong narrative line as the new
enterprise — Fuyao Glass America — gets off the ground. The optimism of
the workers is palpable; the access the filmmakers secured remarkable.
Bognar and Reichert spent a number of years making “American Factory,” a
commitment that’s evident in its layered storytelling and the trust they
earned. American and visiting Chinese workers alike open their homes and
hearts, including Wong He, an engaging, quietly melancholic furnace
engineer who speaks movingly of his wife and children back in China.

His is just one story in an emotionally and politically trenchant
chronicle of capitalism, propaganda, conflicting values and labor
rights. As the factory ramps up, optimism gives way to unease, dissent
and fear. Some workers are hurt, others are at risk; glass breaks,
tempers fray. Both the Chinese and American management complain about
production and especially about the American workers who, in turn, seem
mainly grateful for a new shot. A forklift operator named Jill Lamantia
is living in her sister’s basement when we first meet her. A job at
Fuyao allows her to move into her own apartment, but like everyone else
she struggles with the company’s demands.

By the time the documentary shifts to China, for a visit by American
managers to the Fuyao mother ship, it has become clear that something
will have to give. The American subsidiary is losing money and Chairman
Cao, as he’s called, is not happy. His frustration can seem amusing, but
as his dissatisfaction mounts, the temperature grows colder and
management becomes openly hostile. For viewers who have never peered
inside a Chinese factory, these scenes — with their singalongs,
team-building exercises and extravagant pageants — may seem strange or
perhaps a gung-ho variation on contemporary corporate management
practice (cue the next Apple confab).

“American Factory” is political without being self-servingly didactic or
strident, connecting the sociopolitical dots intelligently, sometimes
with the help of a stirring score from Chad Cannon that evokes Aaron
Copland. The filmmakers don’t villainize anyone, though a few
participants come awfully close to twirling waxed mustaches, like an
American manager who jokes to a Chinese colleague that it would be a
good idea to duct-tape the mouths of talky American workers. It’s a
shocking exchange — only the Chinese manager appears concerned that
they’re on camera — simply because of the openness of the antagonism
toward the company’s own labor force.

It’s these men and women — Timi Jernigan, John Crane, Shawnea Rosser,
Robert Allen and so many others — whose optimism and disappointment give
the movie its emotional through-line and whose stories stand in contrast
to Cao’s own self-made tale. He recalls that the China of his youth was
poor; now he is, according to [Forbes, one of “China’s
richest”](https://www.forbes.com/profile/cho-tak-wong/#5f04e25416cc)
and his hobbies include golfing and collecting art. You see the fruits
of his endeavors in “American Factory,” in scenes of him relaxing and
pontificating. And working too, of course, always working, including in
a luxurious office where a couple of [socialist realist
paintings](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/arts/design/05revo.html)
show him against the sky like a sleekly updated Mao — an image that the
filmmakers linger on, letting its meaning bloom like a hundred flowers.
