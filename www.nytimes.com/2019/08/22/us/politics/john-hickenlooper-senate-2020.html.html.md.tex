John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/politics/john-hickenlooper-drop-out-senate.html}{ended
his presidential campaign last week}, announced on Thursday that he
would run for a United States Senate seat in his home state, instantly
making him one of the Democrats' best hopes in their quest to retake the
chamber next year.

Mr. Hickenlooper was resistant to the idea of running for the Senate
while he was still in the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2020-election}{presidential
race}, telling reporters that he was ``not cut out to be a senator.''
But discussions about a bid
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/politics/john-hickenlooper-2020-senate.html}{grew
serious in recent weeks} as his campaign faded, senior aides abandoned
him and he failed to secure a spot in the next
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/democratic-debates}{Democratic
debate}.

``I've always said Washington was a lousy place for a guy like me who
wants to get things done,'' Mr. Hickenlooper said
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-63689Ahyuk}{in a video} posted on
his campaign website Thursday morning. ``But this is no time to walk
away from the table.''

Mr. Hickenlooper, who is also a former Denver mayor, brewpub owner and
geologist, will seek to challenge Senator Cory Gardner in a contest that
Democrats view as all but necessary to win if they have any hope of
flipping the Senate in 2020.

While Mr. Hickenlooper's laid-back style and moderate politics never
caught on in the presidential race, he remains popular in Colorado, a
battleground state. A
\href{https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/12/john-hickenlooper-2020-senate-cory-gardner/}{recent
poll} showed Mr. Hickenlooper with more than a 50-point lead over

current leading Democrats} in the race for the party's nomination for
the Senate seat;

poll showed} him ahead of Mr. Gardner by 13 percentage points in a
head-to-head matchup.

The advocacy group that commissioned one of the polls, 314 Action,
hailed Mr. Hickenlooper's decision on Thursday. ``With Governor
Hickenlooper in the race, we have a stronger chance to flip the Senate
and take real action on climate change,'' said Shaughnessy Naughton, the
president of the group, which supports scientists running for office.

In his two terms as governor, Mr. Hickenlooper
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/john-hickenlooper.html}{received
both praise and criticism} for brokering compromises on the environment,
gun control and marijuana. In his announcement video, he emphasized
protecting health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, an
issue that moderate Democrats successfully wielded against Republican
incumbents in the 2018 midterm elections.

He also tried to tie Mr. Gardner to President Trump, who lost Colorado
to Hillary Clinton
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/colorado}{by five
percentage points} in 2016. ``When they play games in Washington, D.C.,
Coloradans take the hit,'' Mr. Hickenlooper said, shooting pool in the
Denver restaurant where he started his business career.

Mr. Gardner's campaign dismissed concerns about a challenge from Mr.
Hickenlooper on Thursday. ``To us Governor Hickenlooper is just another
liberal in the clown car,'' said Casey Contres, Mr. Gardner's campaign
manager. ``Whoever their party nominates will be wildly out of step with
Colorado and we look forward to facing them in the general election.''

Mr. Hickenlooper's Senate candidacy is a new illustration of how heavily
Democrats are relying on Western states to build a majority in the
chamber. Democrats captured two Republican-held Western Senate seats in
2018, in Arizona and Nevada, and they are aiming in 2020 to seize the
other Arizona seat and the Colorado seat that Mr. Hickenlooper is now
contesting.

The regional shift toward Democrats in these increasingly diverse and
urban states has helped the party compensate, in part, for the ground it
has lost across rural America and the Southern states where Democrats
have suffered extinction-level losses in statewide elections.

Democrats will need to pick up at least three seats to take control of
the Senate next year, but the party has struggled to convince some of
its highest-profile names to run. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of
Texas and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana have been urged by some members
of their party to drop out of the presidential race and make Senate
bids, but
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/politics/senate-hickenlooper-beto-abrams-bullock.html}{both
have demurred}.

Mr. Hickenlooper's exit from the presidential contest may have presaged
a new phase of the race, in which candidates who cannot
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/next-democratic-debate.html}{make
the debate stage} will find it increasingly difficult to sustain their
campaigns. On Wednesday, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who also
struggled to break through in the polls,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/jay-inslee-2020-campaign.html}{said
he was ending his bid} for the Democratic nomination.

With Mr. Hickenlooper and Mr. Inslee out of the race, Mr. Bullock is now
the only Democratic governor, current or former, seeking the presidency.
