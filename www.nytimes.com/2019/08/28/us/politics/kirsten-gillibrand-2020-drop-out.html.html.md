# Gillibrand Drops Out of 2020 Democratic Presidential Race

The New York senator anchored her candidacy in issues of women’s

for the next debate convinced her to withdraw.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who presented herself in the
[presidential race](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2020-election) as
a champion of women and families, said Wednesday that she was
withdrawing from the Democratic primary after failing to qualify for a
[third debate](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/democratic-debates)
next month — a development she described as fatal to her candidacy.

Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview that she would endorse another
candidate in the primary but had not yet picked a favorite. Though she
stopped short of saying she would endorse a woman, Ms. Gillibrand, who
has made electing women to Congress a personal cause, said the next
president had to be capable of uniting the country and suggested that a
woman might be best suited for the job.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I think that women have a unique ability to bring people together and
heal this country,” Ms. Gillibrand said, adding, “I think a woman
nominee would be inspiring and exciting.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But she added: “I will support whoever the nominee is, and I will do
whatever it takes to beat Trump.”

newsletter*](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)
*and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.\]*

Ms. Gillibrand, 52, [had anchored her candidacy in issues of women’s
equality](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/gillibrand-family-bill-of-rights.html),
with [a strong emphasis on abortion
rights](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-abortion.html).
She pledged to screen nominees for judgeships based on their support for
the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, and held rallies in two
Republican-leaning states, Georgia and Missouri, where conservative
lawmakers recently passed new restrictions on the procedure.

Ms. Gillibrand also repeatedly challenged former Vice President Joseph
R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner, over his record on women’s
rights. [She assailed him in
June](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/biden-hyde-amendment.html)
for supporting a law that bars federal funding for abortion, a stance
[Mr. Biden soon
recanted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/us/politics/joe-biden-hyde-amendment.html).
In [the most recent primary
debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/democratic-presidential-debate-recap.html),
Ms. Gillibrand criticized Mr. Biden for having opposed a proposal in the
early 1980s to expand the child tax credit; Mr. Biden described that as
ancient history and questioned the sincerity of Ms. Gillibrand’s rebuke.

Her energetic advocacy did not lift Ms. Gillibrand in the polls in a
race full of candidates supportive of abortion rights, including three
other female senators. Like so many other candidates, she found herself
squeezed for a space in a primary contest dominated by Mr. Biden and a
handful of progressives jockeying to overtake
him.

## Who’s Running for President in 2020?

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although Ms. Gillibrand aligned herself with her party’s progressive
wing on a range of issues, from health care and climate to immigration
and campaign finance reform, she did not electrify liberals with her
distinctive ideas, like Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and
Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Nor did she achieve a moment of debate-stage
ignition, like Senator Kamala Harris of California.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And if Ms. Gillibrand never engineered a breakthrough moment for
herself, she also appeared, at times, to suffer from a combination of
ill fortune and
missteps.

Ms. Gillibrand planned outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower
in New York was blotted out by the media frenzy accompanying the
submission of the Mueller report to the Justice Department. An early
appearance on Rachel Maddow’s coveted prime time show was dominated by
Ms. Maddow’s biting introduction of Ms. Gillibrand as a candidate who
once held conservative positions on gun rights and border control. And
by random drawing, Ms. Gillibrand appeared twice on the debate stage
beside Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, whose rivalry consumed both events.

Throughout the race, Ms. Gillibrand averaged less than 1 percent support
in national surveys and struggled to raise money, relying heavily on a
$10 million war chest in her Senate campaign account. She hired nearly
five dozen staff members in Iowa and New Hampshire and retained a
collection of high-powered operatives in her Troy, N.Y., campaign
headquarters. But her funds were nearly depleted over the summer, aides
to Ms. Gillibrand said, and the campaign estimated she would wind up
with about $800,000 left in her coffers.

That depletion reflected, in part, Ms. Gillibrand’s efforts to qualify
for the September debate — an effort that turned out to be in vain. She
poured money into advertising in the early primary states in an effort
to move her poll numbers, but public polling was scarce over the summer
and any improvement for Ms. Gillibrand was not detected in time for [the
debate cutoff on
Wednesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/us/politics/democratic-polls-quinnipiac-suffolk.html).

“I think being able to have a voice on a debate stage, when other
candidates have that, is really important,” Ms. Gillibrand said. “And
without it, I just didn’t see our path.”

week?*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/democratic-polls.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)*\]*

Unlike some other frustrated candidates, she declined to complain about
the Democratic National Committee’s qualifying rules for the debates: “I
think the D.N.C. did the best they could,” she said.

Her exit from the presidential race represents an abrupt setback in a
political career defined, up to this point, by a steady rise to
prominence since her first election to Congress in 2006. A former
corporate lawyer, Ms. Gillibrand won a conservative-leaning House seat
in upstate New York, campaigning as a rural moderate with liberal views
on health care but more conservative inclinations on gun rights and
immigration.

When she joined the Senate in 2009, as an appointee to the seat Hillary
Clinton vacated to take over the State Department, Ms. Gillibrand
revised her stances on a number of issues to better match the politics
of her deep-blue state. She quickly emerged as a champion of progressive
causes including gay rights, paid family leave and fighting sexual
assault in the military, and she became a formidable fund-raiser for
Democratic campaigns.

Yet as a presidential candidate, Ms. Gillibrand found herself shunned by
a class of powerful Democratic Party donors — who had once been
supportive of her political ambitions — after she called on Al Franken
of Minnesota to resign from the Senate amid allegations of groping and
other sexual misconduct toward women. Ms. Gillibrand acknowledged in the
interview that she had paid a political price but [reiterated that she
had no regrets about confronting Mr.
Franken](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/al-franken-kirsten-gillibrand.html).

“We know there were donors who were angry about it and did not support
me because of it,” Ms. Gillibrand said, adding, “I wouldn’t change what
I did, because I would stand with those eight women again
today.”

Ms. Gillibrand said she would return to the Senate and continue to
champion the causes of her presidential campaign. She intends to revive
her political committee, Off the Sidelines, that has been dormant during
the presidential race, and use it to support female candidates for the
House and Senate in 2020.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m really going to focus on electing women up and down the ballot,”
she said.

Despite her past criticism of Mr. Biden, she said she did not see him as
a problematic potential nominee for their party, and credited him with
addressing her reservations about his record on issues of concern to
women.

“I think he clarified his views at the debate, which is why I raised
it,” Ms. Gillibrand said. “I thought it was really important to know
that all candidates on that stage value women and will fight for paid
leave and equal pay and affordable day care and universal pre-K and a
national paid leave plan.”

Ms. Gillibrand said she felt she had helped “move the conversation on
all of these issues.”

But she said she was open to considering other offices after 2020 —
perhaps in the administration of a Democratic president.

“I would absolutely consider anything that was asked of me, because my
goal is to serve,” Ms. Gillibrand said.

For now, she added, “I’m going to do everything I can to make sure our
nominee defeats
Trump.”
