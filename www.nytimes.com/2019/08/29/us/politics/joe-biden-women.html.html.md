ORANGEBURG, S.C. — A hug can be an act of affection. Of encouragement.
Of comfort.

When it comes to hugging Joe Biden, it can also be an act of defiance.

At least, that’s how some of his female supporters see it.

“I told him, don’t apologize, never apologize for anything, ever,” said
Juliette Daniels, 55, a lifestyle blogger who embraced Mr. Biden at a
campaign event in Orangeburg, S.C., last month. Their hug came hours
after he [expressed
regret](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/06/us/politics/joe-biden-barack-obama-south-carolina.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
for warmly invoking [relationships with segregationist
senators](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html),
something that Ms. Daniels considered unnecessary because “he was
already vetted by Barack.”

“He’s just so warm,” she continued.

While plenty of voters chalk up their early support for Mr. Biden to
[strategizing about
electability](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/politics/joe-biden-trump-2020.html)
rather than explicit enthusiasm for his campaign vision, others at his
events across the country, like Ms. Daniels, are often moved to
demonstrate how close to — and protective of — the former vice president
they feel. It’s a reminder of the good will Mr. Biden has from many
Democratic voters even as he has grappled with
[gaffes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/us/politics/joe-biden-gaffes.html)
and a
[series](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/us/politics/joe-biden-hyde-amendment.html)
of
[controversies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-eastland.html)
this summer.

A hug is a reflection of that dynamic. And it’s something more, too,
according to some of **** the women who are waiting in line to embrace
Mr. Biden.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They know that hugs have been fraught territory for him. Last spring,
Mr. Biden faced his first major controversy of the 2020 campaign — even
before entering the race — when former State Assemblywoman [Lucy
Flores](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/us/politics/joe-biden-flores.html)
of Nevada [and other
women](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/us/politics/joe-biden-women-me-too.html)
said that Mr. Biden’s habit of unsolicited touches and embraces made
them uncomfortable.

In a video message, Mr. Biden promised to be “[more mindful and
respectful of people’s personal
space,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/joe-biden-women-video.html)”
though he has also since [made light
of](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/us/politics/joe-biden-controversy.html)
the complaints. Some women remain frustrated that in their view he
didn’t take the feedback to heart.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To them, it’s one of many examples of Mr. Biden, 76, appearing out of
step with the progressive norms shaping today’s Democratic Party.

“The electorate doesn’t have to settle for someone who doesn’t
demonstrate that they see us and are for us, and there are a lot of ways
he’s signaled he’s not there,” said Aimee Allison, the founder of She
the People, a political advocacy group focused on women of color. Ms.
Allison, who has been supportive of Ms. Flores, continued, “It’s nothing
to be proud of, that you have women saying, ‘I’m going to go in for a
hug\!’ That’s not the point. The point is for us all to evolve.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Ms. Flores, the question of evolution is key.

“When someone behaves badly, it’s incumbent on them — not us — it’s
incumbent on them to change their behavior,” Ms. Flores said in an
interview earlier this month. “It doesn’t mean that makes them,
necessarily, bad people. The only thing that makes them bad is if they
continue the behavior. Joe Biden has demonstrated he’s not very
interested in changing his behavior or
attitude.”

Mr. Biden’s supporters are keenly aware of that criticism. And they are
often eager to loudly dismiss it.

These voters volunteer — sometimes earnestly, sometimes combatively —
that they were the ones to request the hugs. They glibly wave off
questions about his tactile campaigning style, chalking it up to
generational differences, or more often, calling it an asset.

“If you like somebody, you hug them,” said Elizabeth Walek-Sowin, 74,
who did just that at a campaign event with Mr. Biden in Henderson,
Nevada. “It doesn’t take a Ph.D. to figure that out.”

She proceeded to hug the reporter who had asked about the exchange.

“We’re in a period of time right now where we need hugs,” said Mary
McWhorter, 72, after sharing an embrace with Mr. Biden at a campaign
stop in Charleston, S.C. “I was thrilled to get to hug Joe Biden. Hell,
I’d be happy — he can put his hands on my shoulder any day of the week.
I might return the favor, with my husband right here.”

A conversation about hugs often leads to a broader defense of Mr.
Biden’s record.

“He has not a racist bone in his body,” insisted Bernadette Brown, a
51-year-old administrative assistant from North Charleston, S.C., soon
after explaining why she had hugged Mr. Biden (“that’s just my nature,
we greet people, hug people”) at a campaign event after the first
debate, where Mr. Biden’s opposition to many [busing
practices](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-busing.html)
had been a focus. “Racism exists but Vice President Biden did not cause
the racism. He is not the problem.”

Mr. Biden is back in South Carolina this week for more campaigning — and
perhaps, more hugs, in a state his allies consider to be his firewall.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some **** Democrats say that there should be room for acknowledging
complexities in the discussion of Mr. Biden’s approach — and recognition
that a style that appeals to women of one generation may translate
differently with women of another generation.

“We can believe Lucy Flores when she says Biden made her feel demeaned
and disrespected, while at the same time believing these women who say
the same sort of behavior is welcome,” said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a
progressive strategist.

“In this new era, it’s important for male politicians to recognize that
not everyone will be comfortable with candidates being in their personal
space,” she added. “When told that your touching is making some women
uncomfortable, your defense can’t be, ‘Well, some women are O.K. with
it.’”

Ms. Flores, 39, who supported Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016 but has not
yet endorsed in the 2020 race, said Mr. Biden’s defenders are missing
important nuances of the \#MeToo era.

“It doesn’t have to rise to the level of sexual assault or illegal
sexual harassment in order for it to be wrong,” she said. “Because it is
at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of bad behavior, and women are
just now starting to speak out about it, people are of course dismissing
it, minimizing the behavior, both women and
men.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Flores said she has not heard from Mr. Biden — “it took him, what,
30 years to call Anita Hill?” she said, referencing [his
call](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html)
to Professor Hill shortly before he announced his campaign for president
to discuss how she was treated during the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings
when he oversaw the Senate Judiciary Committee. “I’m not holding my
breath.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It is incredibly difficult to hold someone accountable for bad behavior
when you really, really like them,” Ms. Flores said. “That is the hard
part about living our values: it is uncomfortable.”

Yet there are also many people who seek a hug from Mr. Biden not to make
a statement but to connect with a man [who can
relate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/joe-biden-beau-biden-death.html)
to their stories of grief or illness. Mr. Biden’s personal tragedies,
which he discussed in a[campaign
ad](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/joe-biden-ad-personal.html)
released Tuesday, are well-known: his first wife and a baby daughter
[were
killed](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/19/archives/bidens-wife-child-killed-in-car-crash.html)
in a car accident in 1972, right after he won his first election to the
Senate. In 2015, one of the sons who survived that car crash, Beau
Biden, died of brain cancer. Voters, aware of that history, are often
open about sharing their own struggles with Mr. Biden, especially about
cancer.

Patty Krysiak, 66, approached Mr. Biden after a campaign event in Nevada
on a recent Saturday, and told him that she was struggling with an
incurable blood cancer.

“He said, ‘they got people working on that kind of thing,’” and offered
to help connect her doctor with others who are focused on the issue, Ms.
Krysiak recalled.

A reporter had earlier observed Mr. Biden hugging Ms. Krysiak and
kissing her hand.

“She said she’s a hugger\!” Mr. Biden insisted when he caught the
reporter watching the exchange.

Ms. Krysiak confirmed that was indeed the case.

“I’m a hugger, not a hand-shaker,” she said. “I know he’s a hugger, too.
When he’s allowed to
be.”
