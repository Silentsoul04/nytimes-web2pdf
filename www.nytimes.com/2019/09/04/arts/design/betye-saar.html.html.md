LOS ANGELES — I ask the artist [Betye Saar](http://www.betyesaar.net/),
who is 93 and set to open concurrent solo shows this fall at two major
museums — the [Museum of Modern
Art](https://www.moma.org/artists/5102?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvY62loKT5AIVUQOGCh06tQ5iEAAYASAAEgJRffD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
in New York and the [Los Angeles County Museum of
Art](https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/betye-saar-call-and-response)
— if she has any theories as to why big-ticket attention is finally
coming her way. She skips mentioning the obvious factors: She’s a woman;
she’s black; she’s lived her whole life on what she calls “the other
side of the planet” (Southern California). “Because it’s about time\!”
she says. “I’ve had to wait till I’m practically 100.”

We’re standing in her home, which is also her studio, in the Laurel
Canyon section of Los Angeles. She has lived and worked here since 1962,
when the neighborhood was becoming a New Agey arts enclave. The house,
stacked vertically up the side of a ravine, is all stairs and
platformlike rooms with a small garden nestled within. The division
between domestic and work space feels indeterminate. Order prevails but
clear surfaces are hard to find.

For half a century, Ms. Saar has been one of the country’s most
inventive and influential makers of intimately scaled assemblage. And
she has brought a distinctive range of content to the medium,
encompassing global culture, popular mysticism, personal history and
American racism, which she coolly refers to as “national racism,” as if
it were a scientific category, or a consumer brand.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over a long career she has, against serious odds, maintained visibility.
After a latish start as an artist — she was in her 30s — she made steady
initial headway in a male-dominated Black Power movement and a
white-dominated feminist movement. And she has held her own in a
mainstream art market that has been, until very recently, unwelcoming to
African-American art. During her time on the scene, political grounds
have shifted and art tastes have changed. But her work has retained
pertinence and complexity.

A glance around her studio reveals some of the complexity. The place is
packed chockablock with clusters of objects grouped by type: alarm
clocks (maybe two dozen), antique books, model clipper ships, African
masks, birdcages, globes, painted wood watermelon slices, the Mexican
healing charms known as milagros and so-called mammy dolls piled on a
chair.

There are also arrangements by color. All-red or mostly red items
include an angel’s head, an hourglass, a Tuxedo Club pomade can, a small
plastic menorah and a nosegay of crimson bird feathers. (“You can’t beat
Nature for color,” Ms. Saar says. “She’s got it down.”) And there are
black-and-brown things: a plastic skull, an Afro pick, a dried starfish
and a paper crow.

Almost all was gathered on salvage campaigns to antiques shops, swap
meets, flea markets and rubbish bins, local and international. “I
consider myself a recycler,” Ms. Saar says. (She’s also called herself a
“junkie.”) “I’ve been that way since I was a kid, going through trash to
see what people left behind. Good stuff.”

Scavenging is how she gets the raw material for her art, notably for the
three-dimensional assemblages for which she’s best known. Thematically,
they are of three basic kinds. Some are curated time capsules preserving
materials that were once owned by, or are reminders of, generations of
women in Ms. Saar’s family.

Others are symbolic self-portraits coded with personal and cosmological
references. In the 1969 [“Black Girl’s
Window”](https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/26/539) which will anchor
the MoMA exhibition, she surrounds a silhouette of her head with
floating moons and stars; an etching (her own) of a lion, her birth
sign; a tintype of a woman who could be her Irish grandmother; and, at
the center, a novelty shop Halloween skeleton alluding to her father’s
death when she was a child, a loss she says she still lives with.

And there’s work that’s forthrightly political. A famous, indeed
career-defining example, “[The Liberation of Aunt
Jemima”](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/liberation-aunt-jemima/) from
1972, was her response to the killing of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. and the [Watts
riots](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/us/50-years-after-watts-riots-a-recovery-is-in-progress.html).
The main image here is a store-bought relief of a Jim Crow-era plastic
mammy meant to hold a kitchen notepad and pencil. Ms. Saar transformed
it, replacing the pad with a Black Power fist and putting a rifle in the
figure’s hand.

The piece was an instant sensation in black and feminist art circles.
([Angela
Davis](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/angela-davis) has
since described it as the spark that fired the black women’s
revolution.) “I was lucky to have an icon,” Ms. Saar says about the work
that put her on the national map. Yet over the years, the celebrity of
the piece has created an unbalanced view of a long career that has taken
many forms and directions.

Ms. Saar was born, the oldest of three children, in the Watts
neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1926. Her middle-class family was of
mixed African-American, Irish and Native American descent. In a poem Ms.
Saar has written:

*My roots are tangled....*

*A blend of black, white and red,*

*I am labeled Creole, mulatto, mixed, colored in every sense.*

*Enslaved by the ‘one-drop-rule’*

*But liberated by the truth*

*That all blood is red.*

A lifelong attraction to spirituality started early. Religion was woven
into her upbringing. “My mother was Episcopalian. My dad was a Methodist
Sunday school teacher. When he died, my mom was pretty distraught, and
we joined the Christian Science church. And being in California, we
knew, of course, about Buddhism.” She also counts her childhood love of
fairy tales as part of the mystical mix. “It was all magic to me.”

When she was 4, her family moved to Pasadena, Ms. Saar says. “In
Pasadena my mother always had a garden. You need nature somehow in your
life to make you feel real. The bottom line in politics is: one planet,
one people. And we are so far from that now.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After her father’s death in 1931, when she was 5, Ms. Saar was nurtured
by a great-aunt, Hattie Parsons Haynes Keyes, a long-lived mentor and
model of self-shaping in a matriarchal line. As a child, Ms. Saar also
returned to Watts for visits. There, watching the Italian immigrant
[](https://tclf.org/pioneer/sabato-simon-rodia) [Simon
Rodia](https://tclf.org/pioneer/sabato-simon-rodia) build his
fantastical towers from scrap materials — mirrors, seashells, broken
titles — embedded in cement, she learned a lasting lesson: “You can make
art out of *anything*.”

In college she studied art, an unpromising option for a black woman at
the time. She ended up doing social work, then moved into the design
field. In 1952, she met and married (and later divorced) the ceramist
Richard Saar. They had three daughters, [Alison and
Lezley,](https://www.amazon.com/Family-Legacies-Betye-Lezley-Alison/dp/029598564X)
both now artists, and Trayce, a writer. Toward the end of the decade,
Ms. Saar went back to school for a degree to teach design. Destiny, in
which she believes, had other plans. “One day I wandered into a
printmaking workshop,” she says, “and forgot about teaching.” She joined
and became an artist.

Her MoMA solo, [“Betye Saar: The Legends of ‘Black Girl’s
Window,’”](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5060) which
will debut with the reopening of the newly expanded museum on Oct. 21,
is a survey of her rare, early works on paper — 42 of which MoMA
recently acquired — supplemented by a selection of her assemblages.

When asked why MoMA had come so late to collecting her work, [Ann
Temkin](https://www.moma.org/about/senior-staff/ann-temkin), the
museum’s chief curator of painting and sculpture, said, “For the most
part (and with notable exceptions) until this past decade we were not
looking in the directions where we would have found Saar’s work. And
speaking personally,” she added, “for that reason now is such an
inspiring and rewarding time to happen to be a curator.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The variety and virtuosity of Ms. Saar’s prints are impressive. Working
at home to be with her young children, she was clearly doing some
adventurous self-teaching. “I was never a pure printmaker,” she says. “I
fooled around with all kinds of techniques.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By the mid-60s, pushing hard against the conventional boundaries of the
medium, she came up with new display formats. She began placing
different prints, sometimes with drawings and photographs, in thick wood
frames made from repurposed window sashes. “Black Girl’s Window” is an
example. It’s as much about sculpture as printmaking. It’s a
self-portrait as an altarpiece.

In 1967, she saw an exhibition of Joseph Cornell’s boxed assemblages and
with that experience she turned the corner. She started making
assemblages of her own.

Her learning continued to expand. A 1970 visit to the Field Museum of
Natural History in Chicago, in the company of a fellow Los Angeles
artist, [David Hammons](https://www.moma.org/artists/2486), introduced
her to the charisma of African and Oceanic art — ritual-intensive,
spiritually empowered. It also delivered a lesson in cultural politics:
Most of this “primitive” art was installed, as if in storage, in the
museum’s basement. Nobody was looking at it.

“Back then,” she says, “even black Americans were sort of ashamed of
African art.” But what others rejected, she embraced: the art’s use of
organic matter — feathers, skins, dirt, hair — and its empowering
function. Her enthusiasm, which infused her art, had an impact.

“One of the things that gave her work importance for African-American
artists, especially in the mid-70s, was the way it embraced the mystical
and ritualistic aspects of African art and culture,” says the painter
[Kerry James
Marshall](https://www.jackshainman.com/artists/kerryjames-marshall/),
who took a collage course with Ms. Saar at [Otis College of Art and
Design](https://www.otis.edu/) in the late 1970s. “Her art really
embodied the longing for a connection to ancestral legacies and
alternative belief systems — specifically African belief systems —
fueling the Black Arts Movement.”

She started traveling — to Bali, Brazil, Haiti, Mexico, Morocco,
Nigeria, Senegal — always foraging for objects and images, and
particularly attracted to those with devotional associations. “Wherever
I went, I’d go to religious stores to see what they had,” she says.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Everywhere she went, she carried small sketchbooks that did double duty
as memory banks and portable studios. Many are repositories for quick,
preliminary ballpoint pen studies for future assemblages. Others are
filled with watercolor paintings that are polished creations in
themselves. The show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, [“Betye
Saar: Call and
Response,”](https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/betye-saar-call-and-response)
which opens on Sept. 22, will reunite several sketchbooks with related
finished works.

Ms. Saar’s responses to American racial and gender politics have grown
increasingly complicated over time. In 1974, she and another artist,
[Samella
Lewis](https://hammer.ucla.edu/now-dig-this/artists/samella-lewis/),
organized a group show of black women artists for Womanspace, a
pioneering cultural center in Los Angeles. (Ms. Saar was on its founding
board.) She was shocked to find the audience split along racial lines.
Blacks came; whites didn’t. “The white women did not support it,” she
told the art historian Ruth Askey in 1981. “It was as if we were
invisible.”

She was later embroiled in a divisive art world conflict around the use
of derogatory racial images. In 1997, she spearheaded a letter-writing
campaign directed at a young African-American colleague, Kara Walker,
who, at 28, had won a MacArthur “genius” grant. [Ms. Walker’s silhouette

Ms. Saar’s lead in mining racial caricatures, but within them created
morally ambiguous narratives in which everyone, black and white, slave
and master, was implicated as corrupt. On the subjects of slavery and
white supremacy, Ms. Saar had little patience with ambiguity. Ms.
Walker’s art, she concluded in a 1999 television interview, had been
made “for the amusement and the investment of the white art
establishment.”

Soon afterward, she herself returned to the subject of racism. Much of
the work in her 2017 solo show, “Betye Saar: Keepin’ it Clean,” at the
Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles (and later at [the New-York
Historical
Society](https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/betye-saar-keepin%E2%80%99-it-clean))
featured gun-toting mammies. “I keep thinking of giving up political
subjects,” she says, “But you can’t. Because racism is still here. Worse
than ever.”

On my visit to her studio, there is an assemblage-in-progress on this
subject. In August, its components included two striking photographs,
one of a slender young African woman, almost nude, playing a musical
instrument; the other, a well-known 1863 archival picture of an
African-American man seen from behind, his bare back scarred from
whippings. Ms. Saar positioned the pictures on either side of a
scuffed-up child-size piano with missing keys, added an 18th-century
diagram of a ship filled with slaves and capped the ensemble with an
antique clock.

“It’s about slavery, before and after,” she says. “I call it ‘Skin
Song.’” She later removed the photograph of the African woman.
Improvisation has always been her modus operandi.

Mr. Marshall remembers that “in her class, we made a collage for the
first critique. We were then told to bring the same collage back the
next week, but with changes, and we kept changing the collage over and
over and over, throughout the semester. From that I got the very useful
idea that you should never let your work become so precious that you
couldn’t change it.”

A second assemblage in her studio is very much in the planning stages.
Its encasing frame is set: a small, light rectangular box painted gray.
But its components still lie unfixed on a worktable: a small metal
heart; a tin healing charm in the shape of eyes; a skeletal antique fan;
an abstract print by Ms. Saar suggesting a cloudy sky (“Of all natural
things, the sky is my favorite,” the artist says). She had just added a
tiny computer board glinting like a filigreed brooch.

The format and contents suggest a reliquary. It’s dedicated to Ms.
Saar’s great-aunt Hattie, her early role model. When Hattie died in
the early 1970s, the artist inherited a trunk filled with personal
effects: letters, family photographs, handkerchiefs, trinkets. Over the
years, she’s been preserving them in her work, inspired by the spiritual
belief, shared by many cultures, that the dead live on in what they’ve
touched and treasured.

“I think the chanciest thing is to put spirituality in art,” Ms. Saar
says as she gently shifts elements of the assemblage around, trying this
combination and that. “Because people don’t understand it. Writers don’t
know what to do with it. They’re scared of it, so they ignore it. But if
there’s going to be any universal consciousness-raising, you have to
deal with it, even though people will ridicule you.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“And you have to deal with personal emotions, because they’re there,”
she added. “I think people are afraid of those too. My younger sister’s
husband died this year. I said to her, you’ve got to start making
something beautiful. Beauty is a form of spirituality. Once you start
making something with your hands, the healing starts. I call this
creative grieving.”

Not that grieving, creative or otherwise, is necessarily uppermost in
Ms. Saar’s mind. She has a scheduling crunch to deal with. There’s work
to finish and send out. Coming up fast is a date to fly to New York to
oversee the installation of the MoMA show. (“For the first time ever” —
at her request — “the museum will have purple walls,” she confides.) And
there are longer-range plans.

As we move from the workroom into the exuberantly planted garden for a
sit-down, she says: “I’m 93, and going for 94. Aunt Harriet lived to 95.
I want to beat her record.”
