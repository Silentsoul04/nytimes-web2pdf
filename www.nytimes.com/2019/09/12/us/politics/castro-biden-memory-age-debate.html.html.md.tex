What You Said Two Minutes

Julián Castro accused the former vice president of contradicting himself
on whether people would need to opt into his Medicare plan, though it
did not appear he had.

An initially substantive exchange over health care policy on Thursday
during the Democratic debate quickly devolved into a contentious back
and forth between Julián Castro and Joseph R. Biden Jr., with Mr. Castro
making what appeared to be a thinly veiled swipe at Mr. Biden's age.

``Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?'' Mr.
Castro said to Mr. Biden, 76, stating that the former vice president had
just contradicted himself on the need for some citizens to buy into his
health care plan.

It did not appear, however, that Mr. Biden had said that people would
need to opt in, as Mr. Castro had claimed. Mr. Biden did say that if
someone lost their job, they could potentially buy in to Medicare.

``If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance company,
from your employer, you automatically can buy into this,'' Mr. Biden
said earlier. ``You don't have --- no pre-existing condition can stop
you from buying in. You get covered. Period.''

The first 35 minutes of the debate focused exclusively on health care,
but it was the exchange between Mr. Biden and Mr. Castro that grew the
most heated. The two former Obama administration officials --- Mr. Biden
served as the vice president, Mr. Castro as the secretary for housing
and urban development --- also jostled over who was the better steward
of Mr. Obama's signature health care law.

``I'm filling the legacy of Barack Obama and you're not,'' Mr. Castro
said to Mr. Biden.

``That will be a surprise to him,'' Mr. Biden replied.

Mr. Castro said after the debate in an interview on ABC that his remark
about Mr. Biden's contradiction had not been meant as ``a shot at his
age.''

\emph{The following is the full exchange:}

\textbf{CASTRO:} Thank you. And I also want to recognize the work that
Bernie has done on this and, of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to
President Barack Obama. Of course, I also worked for President Obama,
Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that
it leaves 10 million people uncovered. Now, on the last debate stage in
Detroit, you said that wasn't true when Senator Harris brought that up.
There was a fact check of that, they said that was true. You know, I
grew up with a grandmother who had Type II diabetes and I watched her
condition get worse and worse.

But that whole time, she had Medicare. I want every single American
family to have a strong Medicare plan available. If they choose to hold
on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be
able to do that. But the differences between what I support and what you
support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I
would not require them to opt in, they would automatically be enrolled.
They wouldn't have to buy in. That's a big difference, because Barack
Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted
every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your
plan would not.

\textbf{BIDEN:} They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.

\textbf{CASTRO:} You just said that, you just said that two minutes ago.
You just said two minutes ago they would have to buy in.

\textbf{BIDEN:} I never said they had to buy in, if they qualify for
Medicare \ldots{}

\textbf{CROSS TALK}

\textbf{CASTRO:} Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are
you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can't
believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now
you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that.

\textbf{BIDEN:} I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money ---

\textbf{CASTRO:} We need a health care system ---

\textbf{BIDEN:} --- you are automatically enrolled.

\textbf{CASTRO:} --- automatically enrolls people regardless if they
choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health
care plan would not automatically enroll you, you would have to opt in.
My health care plan would. That's a big difference. I'm fulfilling the
legacy of Barack Obama and you're not.

\textbf{BIDEN:} That will be a surprise to him.

\textbf{PETE BUTTIGIEG:} This is why presidential debates are becoming
unwatchable. This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about
Washington. Scores points against each other. Poking at each other. And
telling each other that my plan, look, we ---

\textbf{CASTRO:} That's called the Democratic primary election, Pete.
That's called an election. That's an election. You know? This is what
we're here for. It's an election.
