To clarify: The House Judiciary Committee has begun an inquiry to
determine whether to recommend the impeachment of President Trump. The
effort has been underway since March 4, when the committee
[announced](https://judiciary.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-judiciary-committee-unveils-investigation-threats-against-rule-law)
it would look into “the alleged obstruction of justice, public
corruption, and other abuses of power” on the part of the president.
Last Thursday, committee members passed a
[resolution](https://bass.house.gov/sites/karenbass.house.gov/files/Resolution%20for%20Investigative%20Procedures.pdf)
setting the parameters for the investigation “to determine whether to
recommend articles of impeachment.” On Tuesday, the panel began what its
chairman, Representative Jerry Nadler, has said will be an “aggressive
series of hearings” to this end.

This does not mean that the committee will necessarily recommend
impeachment. But Mr. Nadler’s team is working to establish whether that
step makes sense.

Unfortunately, there is tremendous confusion about what the Judiciary
Committee is up to — largely because of conflicting signals from House
Democrats, who have been struggling with their public statements on
impeachment. Mr. Nadler has said repeatedly that his committee is
engaged in [an impeachment
investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/us/politics/trump-impeachment-definition.html)
— or, if you prefer, an impeachment inquiry. He insists the
“[nomenclature](https://nadler.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=394065)”
does not matter. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and her leadership
team clearly disagree. They assiduously avoid the “I” word, painting the
committee’s work as [garden-variety
oversight.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/impeaching-trump-pelosi.html)

As a result, even Democratic lawmakers don’t seem to know whether they
are engaged in an impeachment inquiry. Representative Pramila Jayapal
[has
said](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/10/impeachment-democrats-trump-1488401)
“yes.” Representative Jim Himes has said “no.” Last week, Steny Hoyer,
the House majority leader, said “no” — then
[backtracked](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/12/politics/impeachment-investigation-vote-house-judiciary-committee/index.html),
claimed he’d misheard the question and offered a non-answer instead.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This is more than semantic hairsplitting. It is a reflection of the
Democrats’ divisions over the wisdom of impeaching Mr. Trump. Advocates
of impeachment are eager to play up, and skeptics to play down, the
possibility of the Judiciary Committee’s work leading in that direction.
[Need to Impeach](https://www.needtoimpeach.com), the advocacy group
founded by the Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, called
Thursday’s resolution vote a “[pivotal
moment](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/460793-dems-impeachment-message-leads-to-plenty-of-head-scratching).”
The speaker’s camp characterized it as non-news. At her Thursday news
conference, Ms. Pelosi
[bristled](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-exasperated-repeated-impeachment-questions/story?id=65564443)
when reporters pressed her on whether an impeachment investigation was
underway. The conference was “gathering facts” as it had been doing for
months and would make a decision “when we’re ready,” she said. “That’s
all I have to say about this subject.”

Complicating matters, in attempting to wrest documents and testimony
from [a White House committed to
stonewalling](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/trump-white-house-democrats.html),
Democrats have argued in court filings that they are already engaged in
an impeachment inquiry. (Some [legal
experts](https://beta.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/24/how-trump-is-making-his-own-impeachment-more-likely/)
contend that impeachment proceedings — versus ordinary investigations —
could strengthen Democrats’ hand in such scuffles.) So even as the
leadership and other skeptics insist there’s nothing unusual going on,
Democrats’ court filings cite an existing impeachment inquiry.

Republicans have waded into the mix, arguing that impeachment
investigations of past presidents required an authorization vote by the
full House. Democrats counter that the rules have been changed such that
the committee already possesses the investigatory powers that
authorization once conferred, making a vote unnecessary.

You can see why people might be confused.

But the muddled messages are creating [their own
problems](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/10/impeachment-democrats-trump-1488401)
and threatening to undermine the push for presidential accountability.
The contradictory statements make Democrats look divided and conflicted,
complicating efforts to build public confidence in their oversight
powers. Representative Tom McClintock, a Republican, has
[mocked](https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2019/09/12/lead-manu-raju-live-jake-tapper.cnn)
the Democrats’ strategy as, “You can have your impeachment and deny it,
too.”

More concretely, the Department of Justice is using Democrats’ ambiguity
to argue that the administration need not hand over information sought
by congressional investigators. “Most prominently, the speaker of the
House has been emphatic that the investigation is not a true impeachment
proceeding,” the department contended in a court brief filed Friday.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Democratic leadership should try to find a way forward that, at the
very least, doesn’t leave members contradicting one another and further
embolden Mr. Trump. Consider having members defer on the question to Mr.
Nadler’s committee, which can reply, truthfully, that the panel is
uncovering the facts and will decide how to proceed based on those
facts.

As the Judiciary Committee’s hearings begin, fresh attention will fall
on its investigation. This exercise is about more than politics; it is
about safeguarding the health of our democracy. Democrats need to
clarify to the public — and to themselves — where they are headed.
