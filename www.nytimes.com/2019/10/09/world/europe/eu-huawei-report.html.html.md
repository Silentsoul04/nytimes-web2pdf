# Without Naming Huawei, E.U. Warns Against 5G Firms From ‘Hostile’ Powers

In a security report, the bloc noted the potential for cyberattacks but
stopped short of citing any particular providers.

BRUSSELS — A 5G supplier from a “hostile” country could be forced by its
home government to wreak havoc by causing cyberattacks, a European Union
report warned on Wednesday, but the bloc stopped short of naming the
Chinese giant Huawei, which the United States blacklisted after the
White House labeled it a tool for espionage by Beijing.

The advisory report, drafted with input from all 28 European Union
members, laid out the types of major security failures that 5G networks
could be vulnerable to.

It said that putting all functions of a 5G network — including hardware
and software, operations and maintenance — in the hands of a single
company could leave entire countries at risk.

In May, the United States Commerce Department [put Huawei on a so-called
entity
list](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/technology/huawei-ban-president-trump.html)
of firms that need special permission to buy American components and
technology because they have been deemed security threats.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

President Trump[has called on the European
Union](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/huawei-china-us-5g-technology.html)
to follow his lead [in barring the company from its
market.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html?module=inline)

The European Union report, intended to provide advice to member states,
said a “strong link” between a 5G technology supplier and a government
“where there are no legislative or democratic checks and balances in
place” could prove a major source of vulnerability.

The language appears to point to Huawei. The company has vehemently
denied all allegations of being under the control of the Chinese
government, stressing that it is owned by its employees and that only
about 1 percent of the company is held by its founder.

In a statement that brushed aside any implied criticism, Huawei said it
welcomed the report and would “work with European partners” to develop a
cybersecurity framework “and deliver safe and fast connectivity for
Europe’s future needs.”

The idea behind 5G, a major leap from the 3G and 4G telecommunications
technology used currently, is that it will become ubiquitous, connecting
almost everything, from defense systems to domestic devices like
refrigerators and coffee machines, to an ultrafast wireless network.

Huawei is thought to be ahead of other 5G equipment providers around the
world, including European Union companies such as Ericsson and Nokia, in
being able to install networks. Also, it has traditionally been a
cheaper provider of technology.

Mr. Trump and other critics contend that a 2017 Chinese law could be
used [to force Huawei to hack its
customers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/technology/huawei-lawsuit-us-government.html)
through preinstalled “back doors” into the network’s software, on behalf
of Beijing.

The European report sounded some related concerns. “In particular, as 5G
networks will be largely based on software, major security flaws, such
as those deriving from poor software development processes within
equipment suppliers, could make it easier for actors to maliciously
insert intentional back doors into products and make them also harder to
detect,” it found.

Abraham Liu, Huawei’s vice president for Europe, has said his company
does not and will not use back doors to spy on customers.

“In the past, we have never planted any back door, and we are committed
not to do anything like this, forced by any government, including U.S.
government, Chinese government or any other government. We are committed
to this,” he said in a recent interview.

The report presented on Wednesday could pave the way for the European
Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to recommend that
its member states take additional security measures when procuring 5G
networks.

The commission is expected to publish a “toolbox” of measures that
countries can take to mitigate the risks, but it can’t force them to
comply. Officials hope that by publicizing the risks and proposing ways
to address them, countries that take a lax approach to security will be
pushed into action by their citizens.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But when it comes to Huawei, neither the European Commission nor the
majority of national cybersecurity agencies in member states [have shown
much
interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/us/politics/huawei-ban.html)
in complying with Mr. Trump’s demand that they bar it.

In part, this is down to practical concerns.

No single company, experts say, will be able to handle all the demand
for 5G work once network operators begin making the transition.
Therefore, unless Huawei is barred from the European Union or by
individual countries, it will most likely play some part in the
Continent’s 5G future.

And in Europe, Huawei already has a deep and long presence in countries
like Britain and Germany, which other nations look to for expertise and
guidance.

A Nokia spokesman said that “it is vital that all parties commit to the
highest levels of security and resilience of 5G networks, and realize
that 5G will only deliver on its promise if the networks that underpin
it are and remain secure.”

“There can be no exceptions,” he added.
