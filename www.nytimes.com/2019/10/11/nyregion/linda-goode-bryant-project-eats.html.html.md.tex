Linda Goode Bryant likes to get things done. A self-described
workaholic, the \href{https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1326497/}{filmmaker},
former art gallery owner and president of the nonprofit
\href{https://nyshealthfoundation.org/grantee/active-citizen-project-inc/}{Active
Citizen Project} seems to dive into projects with two feet and not look
back.

Take JAM, or Just Above Midtown, the former art gallery on West 57th
Street (and later, in TriBeCa). She opened the space for
African-American artists in the 1970s because the city's major art
galleries weren't showing their work.
\href{https://frieze.com/fairs/frieze-new-york}{Frieze New York} had a
tribute to the pioneering space this year, while the
\href{https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5078}{Museum of Modern
Art} is preparing an exhibition on the gallery for 2022.

The idea for Ms. Bryant's latest endeavor, an urban farm program called
\href{http://projecteats.org/}{Project EATS}, came to her while she was
filming a documentary about the 2004 presidential election.

``There were several issues that often came up: schools, immigration,
prisons and food,'' said Ms. Bryant, who lives on Manhattan's Upper West
Side. ``Then we saw the world go through a food crisis in 2008 and I
kept wondering why we can't grow our own food even if we're surrounded
by concrete. Did I know anything about growing food before I started
Project EATS? Hell no. But I figured it out.''

\textbf{AGAINST THE FLOW} I typically get up around 5 or 5:30 during the
weekday, or about 6:30 on Sunday. I stretch, then head to Central Park
to do a little fast walking and light jogging. I love the park. I've
been doing this for so long that I know the regulars. I've noticed there
are a lot more people that practice for races, triathlons. To everyone's
annoyance, I go in the opposite direction.

\textbf{LIFE AND ALL THAT COMES WITH IT} I have my weekly call with my
friend, the artist \href{http://sengasenga.com/}{Senga Nengudi}. I met
her when she had a show at JAM. Now she lives in Colorado Springs and
she's having a resurgence and galleries are calling. Lately we talked
about her show in Munich. But we usually talk about life and all that
comes with it. It's nice to know there's someone I like, someone I can
talk to about anything.

\textbf{ART FROM ABOVE} I'm always working. I either head to my office
on West 37th Street, work from home, or schedule a work brunch. Today
I'll go to the Lower East Side to look at our newest farm at the
\href{https://www.essexcrossingnyc.com/}{Essex Crossing} development.
I'll meet Rick Smith, the director of farm operations, and artist
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/t-magazine/arthur-jafa-in-bloom.html}{Arthur
Jafa}. A.J. is in from Los Angeles and showed us some sketches and
animation for a sculpture that he's going to make for the space. It's
art that's meant to be seen from above. It's thrilling.

\textbf{DEER SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM} This is our first roof top farm.
You have such a different perspective when the farm isn't on the ground.
I don't exactly know how the food is going to grow here. I think we'll
have more control over the weeds and less crop loss, but who knows. For
lunch, we have Moroccan food, which was my first time. It was delish.

\textbf{STREET LIFE} Usually I like walking and wandering around town
after I work. If there's a film I'd like to see, I'll head to a theater.
The city's characters are inspiring. Even though this place has changed
so much, you still feel everyone's vibes. It's a marvel to see and I
think it makes me more creative.

\textbf{PARENTING IS HARD} I'll meet my longtime friend
\href{https://www.annedelaney.com/}{Anne Delaney} at the
\href{https://rubinmuseum.org/}{Rubin Museum of Art}. I was supposed to
meet my son Kenneth and my grandson Johnny for dinner but they came in
early and will meet us at the museum. Johnny seems to like the
interactive pieces. The exhibits aren't what I call uptight art and it's
not just geared toward adults. I thought we would all go out to dinner
afterward but Kenneth said Johnny was so good at the museum, he better
take him home. Parenting is hard.

\textbf{RERUNS} Full disclosure: I love watching television on Sunday
nights. I might start with some cable news, but I wander around the
channels. This summer was the best because the
``\href{https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-good-fight/}{The Good Fight}'' was
on. I didn't want to pay to watch the show so I was glad to find the
reruns. I think it is as good as ``The Good Wife.'' I get to bed around
11 or midnight. I don't need much sleep.
