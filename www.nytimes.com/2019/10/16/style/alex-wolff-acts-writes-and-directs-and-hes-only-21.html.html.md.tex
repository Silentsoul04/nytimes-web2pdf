\textbf{Name:} Alex Wolff

\textbf{Age:} 21

\textbf{Hometown:} born in Los Angeles and raised in New York City.

\textbf{Now lives:} in a duplex in the East Village and, on occasion,
his parents' apartment near Washington Square Park.

\textbf{Claim to fame:} Despite his young age, Mr. Wolff is already a
seasoned actor and a first-time director. He appeared opposite Toni
Collette in **** the **** horror film
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/movies/hereditary-review-toni-collette.html}{Hereditary}''
and stars in the upcoming sequel to
\href{https://collider.com/jumanji-3-cast-alex-wolff-madison-iseman/}{``Jumanji.''}
His directorial debut,
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl2MnKEOXok}{The Cat and the
Moon},'' which he also wrote, acted in and composed music for, comes out
on Oct. 25. ``I do my best when I am backed against a wall,'' he said.

\textbf{Big break:} He can thank his mother, Polly Draper (who is
perhaps best known for her role on
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/arts/television/21thirty.html}{Thirtysomething}'')
for his ambition. Ms. Draper was (deep breath) the creator, executive
producer, writer and director of
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/arts/television/25nake.html}{The
Naked Brothers Band},'' a late-aughts musical-comedy movie and series on
Nickelodeon.

She cast her two sons --- Mr. Wolff was 8 at the time, and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/fashion/mens-style/nat-wolff-fault-in-our-stars-paper-towns.html}{Nat}
was 11 --- as the show's tween-idol stars. ``I've said this joke eight
million times, but I've basically been on camera since the sonogram,''
he said.

\textbf{Latest project:} The first draft of the ``The Cat and the
Moon,'' which is loosely inspired by Mr. Wolff's own life in New York
City, was written when he was a freshman at the
\href{https://www.pcs-nyc.org/alumni/distinguished-alumni}{Professional
Children's School} in Manhattan. In a full-circle moment, several scenes
were filmed at his alma mater. ``I still can't believe I was able to
charm my teachers into letting me shoot there,'' he said.

\textbf{Next thing:} In addition to ``Jumanji: The Next Level'' and
``The Cat and the Moon,'' he also stars in ``Castle in the Ground,'' a
film about the opioid crisis. All three films were shown at the Toronto
International Film Festival in September. ``By my sixth press day, I was
like, `Dude, I have to get out of here,''' he said.

The festival did have its starry moments. ``Chris Evans grabbed me by
the shoulders, patted my chest like a proud uncle, and said, ``Dude!
`Hereditary!' I loved you in that,''' Mr. Wolff said. ``Then he gave me
one more Captain America chest pat and disappeared into the fog of the
party. My mom erupted in giggles.''

\textbf{Chaos is a ladder:} Switching from directing to acting proved
dizzying. ``It can give you vertigo, especially when you have an
emotional scene,'' he said. ``But I enjoy the chaos.''
