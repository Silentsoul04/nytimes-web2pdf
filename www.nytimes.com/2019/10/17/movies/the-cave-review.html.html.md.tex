\section{`The Cave' Review: Do No Harm, for as Long as
Possible}\label{the-cave-review-do-no-harm-for-as-long-as-possible}}

Feras Fayyad's new documentary takes viewers into a subterranean Syrian
hospital, as warplanes rumble overhead and bombings rattle the walls.

Entering theaters at a timely moment,
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaZkwBWuN2A}{``The Cave''} is a
frightening immersion in life under siege in Syria that, as difficult as
it often is to watch, can't come close to replicating how harrowing it
must have been to film.

The setting of the documentary, from the Syrian-born director Feras
Fayyad
(\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/movies/last-men-in-aleppo-review.html}{``Last
Men in Aleppo''}), is a subterranean hospital on the outskirts of
Damascus connected to the world outside by tunnels and basement
shelters. (With the site difficult to reach, Fayyad directed remotely
for much of the shoot, relying on three cinematographers.)

The hospital is managed by Dr. Amani Ballour, a pediatrician who, in a
fiercely patriarchal culture, must contend with skepticism from men when
not addressing children's injuries. One of her colleagues is Dr. Salim
Namour, who, in a grim motif, cues up his iPhone with classical music
before operating. Samaher, a nurse who cooks, comments that even making
rice has become dangerous: ``Every time there is a bomb, I run to the
other side. That's part of the cooking.'' (Food is in short supply and
malnutrition is rampant, although there is popcorn for Dr. Ballour's
30th birthday.)

The rumble of warplanes and bombs might make ``The Cave'' sound
overproduced --- if this weren't a documentary. (Additional title cards
might have helped to orient the viewer, though.) As medicine runs short
or the hospital is rushed with the victims of a chemical attack (doctors
must wear masks and discard patients' clothes), the space feels
increasingly claustrophobic. There is no endgame here; the doctors can
only do their best as the situation grows worse.

\textbf{The Cave}

Rated PG-13. In Arabic and English, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour
42 minutes.
