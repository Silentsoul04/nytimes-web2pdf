Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio dropped out of the presidential race on
Thursday, ending a campaign that sought to champion Midwestern
manufacturing workers but failed to gain traction.

Mr. Ryan’s exit leaves 18 Democrats in the 2020 race.

“I wanted to give voice to the forgotten communities that have been left
behind by globalization and automation, and I’m proud of this campaign
because I believe we’ve done that,” Mr. Ryan said in [a
video](https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1187405891856785410)
announcing his withdrawal. “While it didn’t work out quite the way we
planned, this voice will not be stifled.”

He said he would run for re-election to his House seat.

Competing in an overflowing field, Mr. Ryan — previously known mostly
for challenging Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the House Democratic leadership
— never really got a foothold. He qualified for the first two debates in
June and July with a handful of 1 percent polling results, but never
came close to reaching the higher thresholds that followed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When he [entered the race in
April](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/tim-ryan-2020.html),
he argued that he could win back the white, working-class Midwesterners
who had flipped from Barack Obama to Donald Trump. His House district
includes Youngstown and part of Akron, a stretch of northeastern Ohio
long reliant on the auto industry, and his platform focused on the
damage caused by the decline of traditional manufacturing.

[One of his central
proposals](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/tim-ryan-manufacturing-jobs.html)
was a large federal investment in renewable energy industries, including
electric vehicle construction, to create jobs in the places most
affected by that decline.

“I’m in a place to really bridge that economic disorientation,” [he said
in an interview the day he announced his
candidacy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/tim-ryan-2020.html).
“I want a businessperson in Michigan to say, ‘I think Tim Ryan really
understands what we need to do around electric vehicles,’ and I want a
worker in Michigan going, ‘Yeah, we just lost our job, let’s make
electric — that seems like it’s the future.’”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He [also argued that food and agricultural
policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/tim-ryan-farming-agriculture.html)
connected a range of disparate issues, including health care costs and
climate change. He proposed shifting federal funding from large
agribusinesses to local and organic farms, and creating tax credits and
grants for grocers and other businesses that served so-called food
deserts, areas where healthy food is unavailable or unaffordable.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the [mass shooting in August in Dayton,
Ohio](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/dayton-ohio-shooting.html),
Mr. Ryan spoke forcefully in favor of gun control, [telling
CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/05/politics/tim-ryan-donald-trump-gun-reform-immigration-cnntv/index.html)
that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, needed to “get off his
ass and do something.” With the advocacy group Moms Demand Action, he
led a “caravan” from Ohio to Louisville, Ky., where Mr. McConnell lives.

Guns were one of a handful of issues — [abortion was
another](https://www.beaconjournal.com/article/20150128/OPINION/301288829)
— on which Mr. Ryan notably evolved during his House tenure. He once had
an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, but donated the money
he had received from its political action committee to gun control
groups after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017.

But his central message was always about the economy.

Mr. Ryan described the decline of traditional manufacturing not only as
the focus of his campaign, but also as its impetus. He often recounted
his daughter calling him in tears after a friend’s father lost his job
at General Motors and saying, “You have to do something.”

So, he liked to say, he did something: He ran for
president.
