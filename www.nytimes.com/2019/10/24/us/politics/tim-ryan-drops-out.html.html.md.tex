Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio dropped out of the presidential race on
Thursday, ending a campaign that sought to champion Midwestern
manufacturing workers but failed to gain traction.

Mr. Ryan's exit leaves 18 Democrats in the 2020 race.

``I wanted to give voice to the forgotten communities that have been
left behind by globalization and automation, and I'm proud of this
campaign because I believe we've done that,'' Mr. Ryan said in
\href{https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1187405891856785410}{a video}
announcing his withdrawal. ``While it didn't work out quite the way we
planned, this voice will not be stifled.''

\begin{quote}
I'm announcing today that I am withdrawing from the Presidential
campaign.

I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten
people of our country. I look forward to continuing that fight.

Thank you, to everyone who supported this campaign.

He said he would run for re-election to his House seat.

Competing in an overflowing field, Mr. Ryan --- previously known mostly
for challenging Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the House Democratic leadership
--- never really got a foothold. He qualified for the first two debates
in June and July with a handful of 1 percent polling results, but never
came close to reaching the higher thresholds that followed.

When he
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/tim-ryan-2020.html}{entered
the race in April}, he argued that he could win back the white,
working-class Midwesterners who had flipped from Barack Obama to Donald
Trump. His House district includes Youngstown and part of Akron, a
stretch of northeastern Ohio long reliant on the auto industry, and his
platform focused on the damage caused by the decline of traditional
manufacturing.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/tim-ryan-manufacturing-jobs.html}{One
of his central proposals} was a large federal investment in renewable
energy industries, including electric vehicle construction, to create
jobs in the places most affected by that decline.

``I'm in a place to really bridge that economic disorientation,''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/tim-ryan-2020.html}{he
said in an interview the day he announced his candidacy}. ``I want a
businessperson in Michigan to say, `I think Tim Ryan really understands
what we need to do around electric vehicles,' and I want a worker in
Michigan going, `Yeah, we just lost our job, let's make electric ---
that seems like it's the future.'''

He
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/tim-ryan-farming-agriculture.html}{also
argued that food and agricultural policy} connected a range of disparate
issues, including health care costs and climate change. He proposed
shifting federal funding from large agribusinesses to local and organic
farms, and creating tax credits and grants for grocers and other
businesses that served so-called food deserts, areas where healthy food
is unavailable or unaffordable.

After the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/dayton-ohio-shooting.html}{mass
shooting in August in Dayton, Ohio}, Mr. Ryan spoke forcefully in favor
of gun control,
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/05/politics/tim-ryan-donald-trump-gun-reform-immigration-cnntv/index.html}{telling
CNN} that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, needed to ``get
off his ass and do something.'' With the advocacy group Moms Demand
Action, he led a ``caravan'' from Ohio to Louisville, Ky., where Mr.
McConnell lives.

Guns were one of a handful of issues ---
\href{https://www.beaconjournal.com/article/20150128/OPINION/301288829}{abortion
was another} --- on which Mr. Ryan notably evolved during his House
tenure. He once had an ``A'' rating from the National Rifle Association,
but donated the money he had received from its political action
committee to gun control groups after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017.

But his central message was always about the economy.

Mr. Ryan described the decline of traditional manufacturing not only as
the focus of his campaign, but also as its impetus. He often recounted
his daughter calling him in tears after a friend's father lost his job
at General Motors and saying, ``You have to do something.''

So, he liked to say, he did something: He ran for president.
