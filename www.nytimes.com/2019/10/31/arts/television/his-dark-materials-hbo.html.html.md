CARDIFF, Wales — Lin-Manuel Miranda sat patiently in a shabby, capacious
hot-air balloon, as a technician checked the lighting on a stuffed bird
poised overhead. A puppeteer stood nearby, holding a stand-in for his
“daemon” (in this case a hare), the animal that represents an
externalization of each individual’s soul in the fantastical world of
Philip Pullman’s “His Dark Materials.”

“It’s like a buddy movie,” Miranda said with a laugh, nodding at the
puppet.

But this isn’t exactly a buddy movie. The [new HBO and BBC One
series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APduGe1eLVI), based on Pullman’s
best-selling fantasy trilogy, features hot-air balloons, talking
animals, witches, armored polar bears, multiple worlds, a young heroine
on a quest and a world-class villain who happens to be an alluringly
beautiful woman. The details of Pullman’s elaborate, wide-ranging
narrative have been painstakingly recreated in this first season of “His
Dark Materials,” which will have its U.S. premiere on Monday, featuring:
[Ruth Wilson (“The
Affair”)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/style/ruth-wilson-the-affair-little-stranger.html?searchResultPosition=4)
as Mrs. Coulter; James McAvoy (“X-Men”) as Lord Asriel; [Miranda
(“Hamilton”)](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/theater/review-in-hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-forges-democracy-through-rap.html?searchResultPosition=6)
as Lee Scoresby; and Dafne Keen as the 12-year-old Lyra, the protagonist
of the story. (HBO and BBC also committed to a second season, which is
currently being filmed.)

Pullman’s elaborate, thrilling narrative, nominally aimed at young
adults but read far more widely, has sold around 18 million books
worldwide, been translated into 40 languages and turned into
well-received stage and radio plays.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But it has never been successfully adapted for the screen. The lone
attempt, a [2007 film adaptation of “The Golden
Compass](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/movies/07comp.html?searchResultPosition=7)”
(the American title of the first book in the series), did poorly at the
box office. It also aroused the ire of some religious groups, [which
accused
Pullman](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/14/religion.books) of
waging a stealth war against organized religion through his depiction of
the Magisterium, the authoritarian ruling power that controls most of
his heroine’s world. (The name is the word the Roman Catholic church
uses for its official teaching authority.)

None of that dissuaded the British producer Jane Tranter from acquiring,
in late 2015, the rights to the trilogy, which she called “a national
treasure.” Tranter, whose company Bad Wolf is producing the series with
New Line Cinema for the BBC and HBO, believed that the novels’
complexity made them better suited to a TV adaptation, she said.

But that doesn’t mean it was easy. It took two-and-a-half years for the
creative team — including [the writer Jack
Thorne](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/theater/jack-thorne-his-dark-materials.html?searchResultPosition=1),
the director Tom Hooper (who directed the first two episodes) **** and
the special-effects studio Framestore — to figure out how to structure
the series, bring the daemons (pronounced “demons”) to life and create
the different environments that the heroine journeys through.

Making things more tense was the fact that while the BBC signed on
early, HBO didn’t commit until filming was about to begin. “It was a
massive gamble, we had nowhere near the entire budget,” Tranter said.
(No one would give a budget number, but the show is [widely rumored to
be very
expensive](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/20/bbc-takes-gamble-philip-pullmans-dark-materials-expensive-british/)
because of its extensive special effects and variety of locations.)

For HBO, “His Dark Materials” was an opportunity to broaden “what could
be considered an HBO show,” said Casey Bloys, the head of programming.
One thing it is not designed to be, he insisted, was a replacement for
the network’s last big fantasy adaptation, the [recently departed “Game
of
Thrones](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/arts/game-of-thrones.html?module=inline).”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Let’s put this to rest: There is no next ‘Game of Thrones,’” Bloys
said. What HBO liked about “Dark Materials,” he said, was that it was
family friendly but had big, complex themes.

It certainly does. Pullman’s series — consisting of “The Golden
Compass,” “The Subtle Knife” and “The Amber Spyglass” — essentially
reimagines [Milton’s epic poem, “Paradise
Lost](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170419-why-paradise-lost-is-one-of-the-worlds-most-important-poems).”
(The title “His Dark Materials” comes from a line in the poem.) The
story posits a world that is saved rather than ruined by original sin,
represented in the novels by a mysterious substance called Dust. Along
the way it explores questions about good and evil, religion and
morality, the relationship of the soul to the body and the nature of
consciousness itself.

But you don’t have to know any of that to enjoy the cracking pace of the
narrative.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The story centers on Lyra Belacqua, an orphan living at Jordan College
in a parallel-world Oxford, in which zeppelins float and the gargoyles
represent animal daemons. When her closest friend disappears, Lyra
embarks on a quest to find him — one that ultimately involves traveling
to London with the mysterious Mrs. Coulter (Wilson), discovering a
government sanctioned child-abduction program and heading into the
frozen north, where witches and armored bears hold sway.

“She is a wounded child, because she has no parents, and a brave young
girl,” Keen said in a telephone interview. “It is an amazing part to
play.”

Thorne, the prolific writer of the play “[Harry Potter and the Cursed
Child](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/books/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-review.html?searchResultPosition=6),”
among many other recent works for stage and screen, said in a phone
interview that he loved Pullman’s choice of a 12-year-old heroine to
carry the story. (At the London premiere of the series, he likened the
character to the climate campaigner [Greta
Thunberg](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/climate/greta-thunberg-un.html).)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A self-described workaholic, Thorne wrote 46 drafts of the first
episode. “My job was to make sure that the storytelling was at the right
pace,” he said. “When you have all these possibilities of CGI, you have
to be careful. We need complexity as well as bells and whistles.”

There are plenty of those in “His Dark Materials,” most notably in the
creation of the daemons, which had to be added through visual effects
technology in postproduction. (That they are extensions of each person
and cannot be separated without terrible physical and emotional pain is
an essential part of the plotline.) To help the actors when filming
those scenes, the production employed puppeteers.

“There is a nightmare version of this kind of work where you are acting
with a tennis ball held at the right-eye line, but this was amazing,”
Miranda said during a break on set. “It really is another actor in the
scene, and it adds all kinds of fun and subtext.”

Eliot Gibbons, the production’s workshop manager, said that his team of
puppeteers tried to create figures with character and personality, even
if they weren’t fully realized. He picked up and manipulated a
startlingly charismatic wooden cat, which had one arm and was attached
to what looked like a Slinky.

“We worked closely with visual effects to make sure they were happy with
the size and movement,” he said. “You have birds and lizards, hares and
monkeys, and snakes coming in and out of clothes. Each one would have
about seven iterations, from eyes on a stick to more sophisticated
versions.”

And then there were the mammoth polar bears, represented during the
shoot by a person wearing a huge puppetry rig, so that the animal’s
movement had “irregularity and breath,” Gibbons said. The stand-ins
formed the visual foundation for the animation, which technicians would
then painstakingly layer into the scenes.

The animals are expressive and often cute, but their roles go beyond
simply charming younger viewers. Wilson, who worked closely with her
puppeteer, Brian Fisher, said the daemons help illuminate
flesh-and-blood characters like her Mrs. Coulter, a seductive villainess
of complex moral stature and motive.

“The animals represent a side to each character,” she said. “Why does
Mrs. Coulter have a monkey? Why can she separate from her daemon when no
one else can? Why does it have no name? I have my own theories about why
she is capable of doing horrific things and believing it’s the right
thing to do: She is silencing her soul, and there is an abusive
relationship between the two. It has to be about self-harm.”

Mrs. Coulter is a powerful female figure in a male world, Wilson noted,
adding that she modeled the character’s image on the [1930s and 1940s
actress](https://www.biography.com/actor/hedy-lamarr) [Hedy
Lamarr](https://www.biography.com/actor/hedy-lamarr), who was also a
gifted inventor. “Like her, Mrs. Coulter is incredibly intelligent, but
understands how to gain power through image and sexuality,” Wilson said.

Thorne expanded Mrs. Coulter’s role in the show. “Her relationship with
Lyra felt so key to everything,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was one of several changes he made — others included bringing forward
parts of “The Subtle Knife,” the second book, and incorporating a small
amount of material from Pullman’s 2017 prequel novel, [“La Belle
Sauvage.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/books/review-la-belle-sauvage-philip-pullman-book-of-dust.html)
At every step, Thorne said, he consulted Pullman.

“It was a blessing, not a mixed blessing, to be able to work with him,”
he said. “We heard the stories from the gaps between the chapters.”

Miranda, who plays the Texan aeronaut Lee Scoresby, said that he had
loved the books since reading them in the early 2000s.

“If anyone is up to adapting Philip Pullman’s world, it is Jack Thorne,”
he said, adding that he had been thrilled to play Lee. “In a book full
of larger than life characters, with bears and witches and angels, he
stands out. He is the Han Solo of the crew, in it for himself, then
slowly reveals himself as a hero.” Miranda had corresponded with
Pullman, he added, but not yet met him.

“I just live in his dreams,” he said. “It’s a nice place to live.”
