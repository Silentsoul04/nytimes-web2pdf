It will make your skin look dewy and fresh, your bones and nails strong,
and your joints pain-free. These are the claims made by the countless
manufacturers of collagen supplements that come in the form of powders,
pills and creams. For that reason, it’s no surprise that collagen has
become a widely sought-after ingredient in the wellness and beauty
communities. But collagen’s efficacy is still pretty up in the air.
Frustrated? Here’s what we know.

-----

## What is collagen?

Collagen is one of the most[abundant
proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846778/) in the
body. In fact, collagen is “[the main structural
protein](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6667/18c2d1ec539560350877bfe8212ba37ee2ae.pdf?_ga=2.110665990.264799597.1571862250-1979460952.1571862250)that
forms the [connective
tissue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21582/) throughout our
body, from skin to bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments,” said Dr.
[Shari Marchbein,](https://drsharimarchbein.com/) a board-certified
dermatologist based in New York. It’s no wonder that the bottled up
version of this protein (usually made of animal collagen) is in high
demand.

Collagen makes up a whopping 80 percent of our skin, and works with
another protein called elastin that — yes, you guessed it — keeps our
skin elastic. But as we age, our bodies naturally start reducing
collagen
[production](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1606623/). The
board-certified dermatologist Dr. [Whitney
Bowe](https://drwhitneybowe.com/)described our body’s collagen as “ropes
of protein in the skin.” When we’re young, the rope remains tight, but
as we age, the ends begin to fray. Essentially, our bodies are not able
to replace the collagen we are losing as quickly as it is breaking down.
Starting in our 20s, we begin losing about [1
percent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583892/)of our
collagen each year, said Dr. Bowe. This, unfortunately, means drier
skin. [Sun exposure,](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81940824.pdf)
cigarette smoke and pollution can also accelerate collagen breakdown.
“The concept of supplementing our collagen, especially [as we age and
as our body’s natural collagen production
declines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1606623/), is
incredibly appealing from a dermatologic standpoint,” she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Collagen peptides (also referred to as hydrolyzed collagen) which are in
supplements, are different. They’re made of the same amino acids as
collagen but are more easily absorbed by our bodies. That’s because
[they are much shorter chains of amino acids than
collagen](https://www.furtherfood.com/difference-between-collagen-gelatin-collagen-peptides-hydrolyzed-collagen-explained-by-nutritionist/),
making them more easily absorbed into our
[bloodstream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16076145) (i.e. more
digestible). That said, Dr. Marchbein reminds us that, “how much of the
supplement is absorbed and whether those amino acids make it to their
target organs to act as the building blocks to make more collagen is
still up for debate.” Be sure to look at the label as companies often,
or at least *should*, disclose what their product contains.

-----

## Does collagen work?

Some studies show that taking collagen supplements for several months
can improve skin
[elasticity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26840887), (i.e.,
wrinkles and roughness) as well as [signs of
aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26362110). Others have shown
that consuming collagen can increase density in bones weakened with age
and can improve [joint](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26267777),
back and
[knee](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-016-0130-8?utm_campaign=B2B+Website&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8boAuPkblnh0HOMhfQk99V4tjBBfFKPMleWTkA7yq7T8edePwyz0iYKfdhzXSbTKHekqMS0lblBSQD0JK3Q3F_VwOChg&_hsmi=25837964&utm_conten)
pain. But many of these studies are small and funded by companies that
make the product, increasing the opportunity for bias in the results.

It is possible that some of these benefits are attainable, according to
a 2019 literature review in the [Journal of Drugs in
Dermatology](https://jddonline.com/articles/dermatology/S1545961619P0009X/).
The review found some data from double-blind placebo controlled studies
to support that collagen could increase skin elasticity, collagen
density and overall hydration.

But a lot more evidence is needed. Dr. Bowe believes that the studies,
“though small and preliminary,” show promise. She said she has begun
recommending ingestible collagen to her patients and has witnessed
noticeable benefits in terms of skin elasticity, firmness and hydration.
(She often recommends [powder
based](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jocd.12174)
supplements.)

## What’s the best way to absorb collagen?

Absorption can be a tricky game, especially when it comes to a huge
molecule like natural collagen. Smaller peptides can more easily pass
through our intestinal barrier and into our bloodstream. (In theory,
this is what all good supplements should be able to do.) The body can,
in theory, utilize absorbed collagen peptides in areas that need repair
the most.

Like with any fad, beauty and wellness see an opening and many companies
have jumped on the collagen bandwagon fairly quickly. [Pills,
powders](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05679), topical
creams and
[liquids](http://www.jmnn.org/article.asp?issn=2278-1870;year=2015;volume=4;issue=1;spage=47;epage=53;aulast=Borumand)
are all out there, promising to beautify your skin and strengthen your
bones.

Powders are the most popular because they’re easy to add to smoothies,
coffee or even water. In terms of dosage, Dr. Debra Jaliman, another
board-certified dermatologist, recommends always following the
directions on the bottle because no two supplements are made equally.

As for topical creams, Dr. Bowe explained that because collagen is
produced in the deeper level of the skin, called the dermis (which is
lower than the epidermis), it is very hard for topical collagen to
actually make it there.

(Watch out for products marketed as “plant-based collagen.” They don’t
actually contain collagen, and though they say they support collagen
production, the science is not there to back it
up.)

## So, should you try collagen?

Maybe\! But get ready for a very committed relationship. If collagen
does work, and you’re looking for long-lasting effects, you’ll have to
take supplements for the rest of your life. Why? The answer is
collagenase. According to Dr. Jaliman, our bodies are constantly
producing this enzyme and it eats away at our natural collagen. So if
collagen supplements improve your skin, bones and joints, you’ll need to
keep taking them.

One of the biggest downsides of consuming collagen, said [Dr. Robert
Anolik](https://www.charlottesbook.com/bookentries/robert-anolik-md/), a
clinical assistant professor of dermatology at the N.Y.U. School of
Medicine, is that just because you’re taking collagen that doesn’t mean
it’s all going directly to your skin.

## How do I take collagen?

Collagen supplements — like most supplements — are not closely regulated
by the F.D.A. Some supplements carry a
[USP](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/107141/)[Verified
label](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/107141/), which is
better than nothing. But it is very hard to [police what ingredients are
in a
product.](https://www.consumerreports.org/supplements/how-to-choose-supplements-wisely/)

You should also take into consideration the foods you already consume.
Dr. Bowe said when it comes to bovine, marine, or porcine collagen in
food, the bones and skin are the richest sources, but most people aren’t
eating those parts. She recommended bone broth as an easy collagen-rich
option. Dr. Jaliman also pointed out that bone broth is rich in amino
acids, “so it may help with collagen production” but there is very
little research or evidence to support that it has benefits for the
skin.

The good news is: if you’re ingesting the recommended dose, there are no
documented downsides of taking collagen peptides, aside from the
not-so-frugal cost — products range anywhere from
