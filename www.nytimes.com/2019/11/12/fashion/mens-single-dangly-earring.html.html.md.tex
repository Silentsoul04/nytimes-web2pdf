Earring}\label{why-men-are-embracing-the-single-dangly-earring}}

Men with ear jewelry are a thing. Just ask Lil Nas X, Harry Styles and
any K-pop star.

It glistens, it sways, it frames your face. It's the dangly earring, and
it's hanging from men's lobes everywhere.

Lil Nas X, the rapper cowboy, often pairs his fringed western jackets
with a gold cross swinging from his left ear.

Odell Beckham Jr., the heavily tattooed N.F.L. wide receiver, prefers
wearing a gold cross on his right ear, whether he's in his Cleveland
Browns uniform or a Thom Browne tuxedo.

And the K-pop star Kang Daniel, formerly a member of the band Wanna One,
is often photographed with dangly earrings that bounce like his floppy
bangs.

The trend has made its way to mainstream retailers like Urban
Outfitters, which offers single earrings for men shaped like
\href{https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/key-earring}{keys} or
\href{https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/safety-pin-earring}{safety
pins} for \$15.

It has also permeated internet culture, with dangly men's earrings
popping up in TikTok videos and various
\href{https://twitter.com/ar1stotl3/status/1087569934366855168?lang=en}{memes}.
\href{https://twitter.com/zachclayton/status/1161075884301807616}{Zach
Clayton}, a 19-year-old internet celebrity who lives in Los Angeles,
recently observed on Twitter: ``I just went on TikTok for the first time
in so damn long and every dude on there has one dangling earring.''

Fashion designers have been quick to co-opt the trend, perhaps sensing
that men's dangly earrings are well suited for our
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/style/nonbinary.html}{nonbinary
gender moment}.

Dangling earrings were sent down the runway at numerous men's wear shows
earlier this year, including at Celine, Balenciaga and Gucci. (Harry
Styles wore a single Gucci earring to the Met Gala in May, causing a
\href{https://www.wmagazine.com/story/harry-style-met-gala-2019-memes}{social
media frenzy.)}

When paired with traditional men's garments, the single earring can
``give a subversive edge to smarter looks,'' said Nick Paget, the senior
men's wear editor at the fashion forecasting firm WSGN, in an email.

Mr. Paget added that it tracks with a broader evolution in men's
fashion. ``We're definitely charting soft masculinity,'' he said.
``We've been talking for a couple of seasons about a different kind of
masculinity --- soft but not fragile. It's for men who aren't afraid of
experimenting with their look and will probably have enlightened views
on gender roles, or at least be comfortable enough with their own
sexuality.''

It's likely no coincidence, too, that these earrings have proliferated
as social media platforms like Instagram have put focus on the face. The
dangly earring is a fashion flourish that invites social media sharing.

But the single men's earring predates social media, of course, with
early examples going as far back as 17th-century England.

``There's a real historical element to this trend,'' Mr. Paget said,
adding that the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2019/06/12/fashion/runway-mens/givenchy-spring-2020/s/Givenchy-spring-2020-mens-slide-XJBS.html}{pearl
drop earrings at the Givenchy men's wear show last June} had ``a
dandyish appeal that evokes the pioneering spirit of Tudor explorers
such as Sir Francis Drake, reminiscent of portraits of the era.''

More contemporary precedents include George Michael's
\href{https://www.gq.com/story/dangly-earrings-rule}{door knocker of a
crucifix}, which he wore on his left ear for his 1987 album, ``Faith,''
and Rob Lowe's character in ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' who wore a silver
crucifix on his right ear.

Unlike the 1980s, however, the current trend defies neat labels; the
debate on whether there is a so-called gay ear is long over.

As Erin Schwartz
\href{https://www.gq.com/story/dangly-earrings-rule}{wrote in GQ
recently,} dangly earrings are ``the roller skates of ear jewelry'' and
``totally without practical use and extremely fun.'' Likewise
\href{https://www.thecut.com/author/brock-colyar/}{Brock Colyar},
writing for
\href{https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/what-does-a-single-earring-mean-on-a-man.html}{The
Cut,} said, ``the single dangly truly does not discriminate.''

In other words, everyone can join in the fun.

``What it means to be a man isn't as black and white anymore as society
once made it out to be,'' said Christopher Morency, an editor at
\href{https://www.highsnobiety.com/}{Highsnobiety}. ``At the end of the
day, an earring is an earring, and with societal lines around
masculinity changing, no longer is the accessory limited to one
gender.''
