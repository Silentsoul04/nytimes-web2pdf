Mr. Sanford, a former congressman and governor of South Carolina, ended
his presidential campaign just two months after it began.

WASHINGTON --- Former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina said on
Tuesday that he was ending his long-shot primary challenge to President
Trump just
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/us/politics/mark-sanford-president.html}{two
months after announcing it}, arguing that the impeachment inquiry had
made it impossible for his message of fiscal conservatism to break
through.

``You've got to be a realist and what I did not anticipate is an
impeachment,'' Mr. Sanford
\href{https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/former-sc-gov-mark-sanford-has-dropped-out-of-presidential/article_3def9eee-0171-11ea-84ec-8bd313d6fd8a.html}{said
at a news conference in Concord, N.H}., where he announced the end of
his campaign.

Mr. Sanford conceded that his bid had been ``a long shot, but we wanted
to try and interject this issue, how much we're spending, into the
national debate, which comes along once every four years.'' He said he
found no ``appetite for a serious nuanced debate with impeachment in the
air.''

During his short-lived, quixotic campaign, Mr. Sanford made it clear he
did not support the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/politics/impeachment-strategy-republicans.html}{impeachment
inquiry unfolding on Capitol Hill}. And unlike the other two Republican
primary challengers in the race, Mr. Sanford never mounted an argument
based on Mr. Trump's fitness for office, saying instead that he would
support Mr. Trump in a general election if he became the party's
nominee.

``If you're going to run against Trump without being able to criticize
this abuse of power, there doesn't seem to be a clear case for your
candidacy,'' said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist who has been
working to resist Mr. Trump from within the party. ``He always tried to
make it about an issue. A single-issue candidacy around the debt in this
era can't find much oxygen.''

Mr. Sanford was one of three Republican primary challengers attempting
to peel off support from a president whose approval ratings in his own
party rank consistently in the high 80s. He was joined in the
David-vs.-Goliath struggle by Joe Walsh, a former Tea Party-backed
congressman from Illinois, and William F. Weld, a former Massachusetts
governor. Both are still running.

The ``three stooges,'' as Mr. Trump branded them on Twitter, saw
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/us/politics/trump-republicans-challengers.html}{themselves
more as the Three Musketeers}, who together hoped to create a chorus of
Republican voices opposing Mr. Trump from different viewpoints.

A longtime foil for Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanford, who served two separate
stints in the House of Representatives in addition to serving as
governor, was seen in some respects as the most viable of the trio, as
the one who might have had the most success in getting under Mr. Trump's
skin and hectoring him from the right on the issue of the federal debt.

A onetime A-list Republican with a strong conservative anti-spending
message, Mr. Sanford's political career almost ended for good in 2009,
when he acknowledged an extramarital affair with a woman whom he
secretly visited in Argentina while his aides claimed he was hiking the
Appalachian Trail. He was censured but served out the rest of his term
as governor, stepping down in 2011.

Mr. Sanford came back for another political act, however, winning
re-election to the House in 2013. He was elected twice more but lost a
Republican primary in 2018 to a candidate backed by Mr. Trump, Katie
Arrington. Ms. Arrington was ultimately defeated by a Democrat.

Of the three Republican primary challengers, Mr. Sanford in the end had
the hardest time differentiating himself from Mr. Trump after he said he
did not support impeachment.

``I respect Mark,'' said William Kristol, the conservative writer and
former editor of the now defunct magazine The Weekly Standard. ``He at
least tried to step up, when so many other Republicans haven't done
anything.''

Mr. Kristol, who has been a prominent ``Never Trump'' Republican since
Mr. Trump was elected in 2016, has been working hard over the past year
to recruit candidates to run against him.

The Trump campaign dismissed Mr. Sanford's exit from the stage in the
same way it had dismissed him while he was running.

``His candidacy had escaped our attention,'' said Tim Murtaugh, a
spokesman for the Trump campaign.

In reality, however, the campaign had been systematically working to
ensure the trio of challengers had no way to break through. The
Republican Parties in Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina,
meanwhile, canceled
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/us/politics/states-drop-republican-primaries.html?module=inline}{the
2020 presidential primaries in their states}, making it virtually
impossible for Mr. Trump's challengers to build support.

And the campaign has also
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/trump-republicans-delegates-convention.html}{changed
the rules in 37 states and territories} for choosing delegates to the
Republican National Convention, an effort to ensure there are no
dissenting voices at the party gathering in Charlotte next year.
