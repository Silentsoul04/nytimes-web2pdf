Behrouz Boochani, who was held for years as part of Australia’s offshore
immigration detention program, arrived in New Zealand for a literary
festival.

A Kurdish-Iranian refugee and award-winning writer who was held by
Australia for years at a detention center on a remote Pacific island
arrived in New Zealand late Thursday, after becoming a cause célèbre for
rights activists.

The refugee, Behrouz Boochani, 35, who became a prominent voice for the
hundreds of people exiled on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, as part of
[Australia’s controversial detention
program](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/world/australia/australia-refugee-policy-protest.html),
received permission to leave for the first time in years.

The Australian government has paid neighboring countries to detain
hundreds of asylum seekers and other refugees who arrive by sea. This is
the first time Mr. Boochani has been granted permission to leave Papua
New Guinea since his detention began in 2013, after he was given a
visitor visa to enter New Zealand to speak at the WORD Christchurch
literary festival [on
Nov. 29](https://wordchristchurch.co.nz/programme/behrouz-boochani/).

He was held in a detention center on Manus Island until it closed in
2017, and he was then moved to another part of Papua New Guinea. It is
not clear what his status will be after the festival, although he has
[vowed never to return to Papua New
Guinea.](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/behrouz-boochani-free-voice-manus-island-refugees-new-zealand-australia)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“So exciting to get freedom after more than six years,” Mr. Boochani
said on Twitter on his arrival at Auckland Airport late on Thursday
night. “Thank you,” he added, “to all the friends who made this happen.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Boochani, who worked as a journalist with the Kurdish-language
magazine Werya, [fled Iran
in 2013](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/insider/manus-island-refugee-australia.html?module=inline)
after officials raided his office. He traveled to Indonesia and tried to
reach Australia by boat, where he planned to seek asylum. But he was
intercepted by the authorities.

After being moved to a remote detention camp on Manus Island, he
documented rights abuses against the hundreds of asylum seekers held
alongside him on Manus Island, where he has spent the last six years,
and those on the tiny island nation of Nauru. Many of the detainees were
from the Middle East and Africa and were seeking refugee status.

Mr. Boochani’s writings raised awareness of the situation on the island,
which was largely closed off to international journalists and rights
groups. He wrote of daily life on the island, posting updates on social
media about squalid conditions at the camp and the suicides and
self-harm that became commonplace among the detainees. He revealed
inadequate access to heath care, deteriorating facilities and
desperation among the men housed there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He shared details about Manus in 2017 with The New York Times after
President Trump walked back promises made by President Barack Obama to
relocate all detainees who had received refugee status to the United
States. His work was also published by numerous
[local](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/contributor/behrouz-boochani)
and [international
outlets](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/behrouz-boochani).

“We are under such pressure and a hard situation,” he said at the time.
“We cannot go back, and we are still here.”

Working with a translator for five years via messages in Farsi over
WhatsApp, he wrote a book, “No Friend but the Mountains,” for which he
won the [2019 Victorian Prize for
Literature](https://www.wheelercentre.com/news/behrouz-boochani-wins-the-2019-victorian-prize-for-literature).
The prestigious Australian award, selected from a short list of winners
in other categories, [comes with an
award](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/world/australia/behrouz-boochani-victorian-prize-manus-island.html)
of 125,000 Australian dollars, or about $90,000.

He has also won the New South Wales Premier’s Award, the Australian Book
Industry Award for nonfiction and the National Biography Award.

Human rights groups have [long denounced Australia’s
policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/world/australia/australia-manus-suicide.html)
of detaining migrants and asylum seekers in offshore detention centers
like the one on Manus, but the government has maintained that it is
necessary to deter those arriving in the country by illegal means.

Australia [closed the center on Manus
Island](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/world/australia/manus-island-refugees.html?module=inline)
in 2017 and moved some of the asylum seekers. Others who received
official refugee status have been [resettled in the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/world/australia/manus-refugees-trump.html?module=inline),
but hundreds remain in limbo on the island.

The Australian government said last month that[562 refugees and asylum

Meg de Ronde, the executive director of Amnesty New Zealand, which was
involved in obtaining a visitor visa for Mr. Boochani to attend the
literary festival, [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/MegdeRonde/status/1194932484758110208) that
it was a “life & career highlight to be a small part” of his arrival.

In an earlier statement, Ms. de Ronde said, “This is a spark of hope
after he has fled violence and persecution, first in Iran and then from
Australian authorities.”

On Thursday, the organizers of the festival released a statement on Mr.
Boochani’s behalf. In it, he said he would continue to speak out against
the Australian offshore detention system, “which is designed to deter
refugees from seeking asylum and, ultimately, has caused grave harm and
torture.”

He also said he would ask the government of New Zealand to aid those who
remained in Papua New Guinea and Nauru.

Michelle Bachelet, [the United Nations rights
chief](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-09/un-bachelet-criticises-australia-asylum-seeker-policies/11588084?pfmredir=sm),
recently spoke out about Australia’s migration and asylum policies in [a
speech at the Whitlam Institute in
Sydney.](https://www.whitlam.org/publications/2019/10/9/2019-whitlam-oration-un-human-rights-commissioner-michelle-bachelet)

“I have a number of serious concerns about migration and asylum policies
in this country, including the so-called offshore processing regime and
prolonged mandatory detention of refugees and asylum seekers,” she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Bachelet added that she feared the public narrative in Australia
about migration and asylum “has become weaponized by misinformation and
discriminatory and even racist attitudes.”
