As the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, Army
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/vindman-trump-ukraine-impeachment.html}{Lt.
Col. Alexander S. Vindman} became so concerned during a July 25 phone
call in which
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/who-is-alexander-vindman.html?module=inline}{President
Trump} asked Ukraine's president for help with political investigations
that he reported his alarm to a superior.

On Tuesday,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-white-house.html}{Colonel
Vindman} will testify in the public phase of the impeachment
investigation, the first active-duty military officer to do so.

In
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/us/politics/Alexander-Vindman-trump-impeachment.html?rref=collection\%2Fbyline\%2Fdanny-hakim\&action=click\&contentCollection=undefined\&region=stream\&module=stream_unit\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=8\&pgtype=collection}{closed-door
testimony last month} with the House Intelligence Committee, he
described reporting concerns to his superiors on two occasions related
to the Ukraine policy of the president and his inner circle, saying he
acted out of a ``sense of duty.''

He is among the White House officials who have described the fallout as
the president and his personal lawyer,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-investigation.html}{Rudolph
W. Giuliani}, pressured Ukraine to investigate unfounded allegations
about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic rival of
the president, and to help chase an unproven theory that Ukraine, not
Russia, had intervened in the 2016 election. Democrats have accused the
president of abusing his official powers to benefit his re-election
efforts, while House Republicans argue he did nothing wrong.

The colonel first raised concerns on July 10, when he was among a group
of Americans meeting at the White House with Ukrainian officials. The
Ukrainians were hoping to secure a meeting with Mr. Trump for the new
Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.

Another attendee, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to
the European Union and a prominent Republican donor, ``emphasized the
importance that Ukraine deliver the investigation into the 2016
elections'' and also move forward with a Biden-related inquiry, the
colonel testified. He also said that he immediately expressed his
concern to Mr. Sondland.

``I, as the representative of the N.S.C., thought it was inappropriate
and that we were not going to get involved in investigations,'' Colonel
Vindman testified, adding, ``It was kind of an uncomfortable
conversation.''

Later that day, he reported his concerns to the senior lawyer at the
National Security Council.

The second episode came shortly after the colonel and other aides
listened in as the president held a July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky, in
which Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to carry out the
investigations he sought.

``I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government
investigate a U.S. citizen,'' he testified. ``I thought it was troubling
and disturbing.''

Because the colonel was a key point of contact with Ukrainian officials,
they sought his guidance on Mr. Giuliani's efforts to push the
investigations. Reflecting the National Security Council's policy, the
colonel advised Ukrainian officials, including Mr. Zelensky, to steer
clear of American politics.

The colonel is an Iraq war veteran who received a Purple Heart after
being injured by a roadside bomb. He immigrated from Ukraine when he was
3 years old with his family, including his twin brother, Yevgeny, who
serves on the National Security Council as an ethics lawyer. Like other
officials who have been subpoenaed to testify, he has been
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/trump-vindman-twitter.html}{attacked
by the president and his allies}.

While the colonel is not the whistle-blower who sparked the impeachment
inquiry, he said he did feel compelled to report his concerns within his
chain of command. And he matches the description of a possible source
given by the whistle-blower
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/26/us/politics/whistle-blower-complaint.html}{in
his complaint}, in which he refers to White House officials he had
spoken to about the call who ``were deeply disturbed by what had
transpired in the phone call.''

``I am a patriot,'' Colonel Vindman testified. ``It is my sacred duty
and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or
politics.''
