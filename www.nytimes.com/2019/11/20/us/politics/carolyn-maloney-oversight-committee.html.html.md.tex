WASHINGTON --- House Democrats elected Representative Carolyn B. Maloney
of New York on Wednesday to lead the Oversight and Reform Committee,
making her the first woman ever to head the crucial investigative panel
at a time when it is helping conduct the impeachment inquiry into
President Trump.

Ms. Maloney's victory ends a quiet but consequential race among
Democrats to succeed Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the
former chairman and giant of the committee who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/elijah-cummings-death-illness.html}{died
last month}. She will join the triumvirate of lawmakers leading the
investigation into Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to
investigate his political rivals.

``I'm honored by this opportunity to do more for the American people and
will do my best to follow the honorable example that Chairman Cummings
left for us all,'' Ms. Maloney said in a statement. ``There's much work
to be done.''

Democratic leaders sought to avoid a fractious internal battle in the
midst of their impeachment inquiry. Ms. Maloney, 73, is the most senior
lawmaker on the committee and was already acting chairwoman after Mr.
Cummings's death. On Tuesday, a key group of Democratic lawmakers
formally recommended that she lead the panel, effectively edging out two
other lawmakers who vied for the seat, Representative Stephen F. Lynch
of Massachusetts, who then dropped out of the race, and Representative
Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia.

Ms. Maloney ultimately defeated Mr. Connolly, who had positioned himself
as a more fiery Democratic messenger, 133 to 86.

Even though she has not played a central role in the House's most
contentious and consequential investigations, Ms. Maloney's supporters
had argued that a woman should be among the lawmakers leading the
impeachment inquiry. Democrats have also historically rewarded
seniority, and she received both the backing of the Congressional Black
Caucus and Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3
Democrat.

Ms. Maloney, an ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has served in Congress
since 1993, and ran against Mr. Cummings in 2010 to lead Democrats on
the committee. Mr. Cummings beat her for the ranking member position,
though at the time she was senior to him.

As the House Intelligence Committee has held public impeachment
hearings, its chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of
California, has served as the inquiry's public face. Ms. Maloney will
likely have a tertiary role as investigators on her committee continue
to work on the inquiry. But she will use the power of the gavel to
continue other investigations begun by Mr. Cummings, including one into
the administration's failed bid to add a citizenship question to the
2020 census.

A formidable challenge awaits the new chairwoman from the other side of
the panel's dais, in the form of Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the
top Republican on the committee. Widely regarded as Mr. Trump's
strongest defender in the House, Mr. Jordan will go head-to-head against
Ms. Maloney as the panel continues its investigations.
