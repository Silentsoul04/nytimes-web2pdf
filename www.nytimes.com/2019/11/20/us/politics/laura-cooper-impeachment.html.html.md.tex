WASHINGTON --- As the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia,
Ukraine and Eurasia, Laura K. Cooper was one of multiple Pentagon
officials who warned the White House that freezing congressionally
approved aid to Ukraine could violate the law.

Ms. Cooper, as well as other officials,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/laura-cooper-dod-impeachment-testimony.html}{repeatedly
voiced concern} that withholding the aid for a sustained period of time
could run afoul of the Impoundment Control Act, which prevents the
president from unilaterally deciding against spending money allocated by
lawmakers. She also personally fielded two separate phone calls from
alarmed Ukrainian diplomats quietly seeking information about the delay.

The security assistance to Ukraine --- a total of nearly \$400 million
--- and the timing of its delay is at the heart of the impeachment
investigation into whether President Trump abused the power of his
office to enlist a foreign government for help in an election. When she
testifies Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, Ms. Cooper,
a career Defense Department official, is expected to provide some
insight into efforts to persuade the Trump administration to release the
aid.

After a mid-June meeting with Mr. Trump, nearly a month before the aid
was frozen, the administration began asking Ms. Cooper detailed
questions about the money, she told House investigators last month
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/laura-cooper-dod-impeachment-testimony.html}{in
a closed-door interview}. Those questions appeared prompted in part by
an announcement from her office that the Pentagon planned to provide
\$250 million to Ukraine for training and equipment.

In her closed-door testimony, Ms. Cooper offered details into the White
House's reluctance to allow the funds to reach Ukraine. The
administration, she told investigators, wanted to know which government
agencies provided the funding, which American industries were involved
in the aid and which other countries were contributing to Ukraine.

``We got a question from my chain of command forwarded down from the
chief of staff, I believe, from the Department of Defense, asking for
follow-up on a meeting with the president,'' Ms. Cooper said. ``It said,
`Follow-up from POTUS meeting,' so follow-up from a meeting with the
president. So, you know, I'm thinking that the questions were probably
questions from the president.''

Her testimony underscored the divide in the administration between
efforts to ensure the aid reached Ukraine and Mr. Trump's focus on the
conditions of providing that aid. Other witnesses have testified that
the president hoped to use the aid as leverage to ensure that the new
Ukrainian administration opened investigations into his political
rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Ms. Cooper's first appearance before House investigators last month was
derailed for hours after a group of House Republicans
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/republicans-storm-trump-impeachment-hearing.html?searchResultPosition=3}{barged
into the secure room} in the Capitol basement where closed-door
depositions were being held. But ultimately, Ms. Cooper ---~who
testified despite
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/politics/laura-cooper-pentagon-letter.html?searchResultPosition=2}{White
House orders to ignore a subpoena} --- offered a technical, if narrow,
account of the aid's suspension.

Ms. Cooper, a

Louis native} and graduate of Georgetown University, National Defense
University and Northwestern University, first worked as a policy
planning officer in the State Department. She then
\href{https://www.defense.gov/Our-Story/Biographies/Biography/Article/1568391/laura-k-cooper/}{moved}
to the Defense Department in 2001.

Her portfolio

includes} policy related to Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, as well as the
western Balkans.
