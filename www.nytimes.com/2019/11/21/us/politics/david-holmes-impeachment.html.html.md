*\[Catch up on key moments from* [*Fiona Hill’s and David Holmes’s
testimony on
Thursday*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/impeachment-hearing.html)*.\]*

Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee took turns
on Thursday questioning David Holmes, a career diplomat who said he was
told President Trump cared more about investigating his political rivals
than about the welfare of Ukraine.

As a political counselor to the United States Embassy in Ukraine’s
capital, Mr. Holmes was privy to high-level conversations between top
American and Ukrainian officials, and was often expected to take
detailed notes of their conversations.

One of these conversations in particular — a cellphone call between Mr.
Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the
European Union — has been a focal point of the House impeachment
hearings.

During the call, Mr. Sondland assured Mr. Trump that Ukraine’s newly
elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, would be willing to go along with
his demand to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the
younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to
Mr. Holmes.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Mr. Holmes said last Friday in
closed-door testimony [to House impeachment
investigators](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/trump-ambassador-sondland-ukraine-call.html).
“There’s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I
remember it vividly,” he said.

Mr. Holmes’s account [shed new
light](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/trump-ambassador-sondland-ukraine-call.html)
on how Trump administration officials leveraged political power,
including a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in
military assistance, to bend Ukrainian officials to Mr. Trump’s will.

“I think the Ukrainians gradually came to understand that they were
being asked to do something in exchange for the meeting and the security
assistance hold being lifted,” Mr. Holmes testified.

Mr. Holmes, who holds degrees from Pomona College in California, the
University of St. Andrews in Scotland and Princeton University, joined
the State Department under President George W. Bush. Since then, he has
been stationed in Russia, Afghanistan, India, Colombia and Kosovo. He
also served on the National Security Council in Washington.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Throughout his service, Mr. Holmes [developed a
reputation](https://www.afsa.org/sites/default/files/flipping_book/0914/files/assets/basic-html/page60.html)
for outspokenness. In 2014, after stints in Kabul and Delhi, Mr. Holmes
received an award for “[constructive
dissent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-department-official-who-overheard-trump-phone-call-on-ukraine-has-experience-speaking-his-mind/2019/11/14/be49edba-070c-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html)”
for raising concerns about President Barack Obama’s policies toward
South Asia.

He arrived in Kyiv in August 2017 and worked closely with Marie L.
Yovanovitch, [who has since been ousted as ambassador to
Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-facts-bio.html).
As her chief political adviser, he said he developed a “respect for her
dedication, determination and professionalism.”

But in March 2019, Mr. Holmes noted a major shift. Instead of a
diplomatic policy focused on supporting Ukrainian democratic reform and
resistance to Russian aggression, he said in written testimony presented
on Friday, it became “overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted
by Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct
channel to the White House.”

The cellphone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry took place
on July 26, when Mr. Holmes was having lunch at a restaurant in Kyiv
with Mr. Sondland and two other American officials. His account is seen
by Democrats as bolstering their claims of a quid pro quo between
Ukraine’s willingness to investigate the Bidens and military aid and
support from the United States.

Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and political megadonor appointed by
Mr. Trump, called Mr. Trump on his cellphone to tell him that Mr.
Zelensky “loves your ass,” and will do “anything you ask him to.”

Mr. Trump was speaking so loudly that Mr. Sondland held the phone away
from his ear, Mr. Holmes testified on Friday.

Mr. Trump then asked, “So, he’s going to do the investigation?”

Mr. Sondland replied, “He’s going to do it.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the same lunch, Mr. Sondland acknowledged that Mr. Trump cared only
about “big stuff,” like the “Biden investigation” that his lawyer
Rudolph W. Giuliani was pushing for because it affected him personally,
Mr. Holmes testified on Friday.

His testimony has added new details about the call, which was [first
revealed during public
testimony](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/impeachment-hearing-day-1.html)
by Mr. Holmes’s boss, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in
Ukraine.
