# Key Moments From Hill and Holmes’s Testimony in the Impeachment Inquiry

[Fiona
Hill](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/fiona-hill-trump-impeachment.html),
the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, said
President Trump’s demands for Ukraine to announce investigations into
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the 2016 elections
amounted to a “domestic political errand” that diverged from American
foreign policy goals.

Her testimony made it clear that Dr. Hill, a longtime Russia expert, saw
the pressure campaign on Ukraine as a purely political effort that had
nothing to do with confronting corruption in Ukraine, the explanation
that Mr. Trump and Republicans have frequently given for his actions.

Under questioning from the top Republican counsel on the House
Intelligence Committee, Dr. Hill said she confronted Gordon D. Sondland,
the ambassador to the European Union about his failure to coordinate
with other members of the administration and later realized he was
“being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being
involved in national security, foreign policy.”

Dr. Hill said she had told Mr. Sondland at the time that, “this is all
going to blow up. And here we
are.”

Dr. Hill criticized Republicans on Thursday for propagating a “fictional
narrative” embraced by President Trump that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled
in the 2016 elections.

In an implicit rebuke to the president she once served, she argued that
the story was planted by Russia and dangerously played into Moscow’s
hands, by sowing political divisions in the United States that
adversaries are eager to exploit.

“These fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely
domestic political purposes,” said Dr. Hill, [the co-author of
a 500-page
book](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/who-is-fiona-hill.html)
analyzing the psyche of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

“President Putin and the Russian security services operate like a super
PAC,” Dr. Hill explained. “They deploy millions of dollars to weaponize
our own political opposition research and false narratives. When we are
consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as
they seek to divide us against each another, degrade our institutions,
and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy.

[David
Holmes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/david-holmes-impeachment.html),
a top aide in the United States Embassy in Kyiv, told lawmakers on
Thursday that he became convinced by the end of August that Mr. Trump
had frozen security aid for Ukraine because he was seeking to pressure
the country to commit to an investigation into Mr. Biden.

“By this point,” Mr. Holmes said, “my clear impression was that the
security assistance hold was likely intended by the president either as
an expression of dissatisfaction with the Ukrainians who had not yet
agreed to the Burisma/Biden investigation or as an effort to increase
the pressure on them to do so.”

Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden, the
former vice president’s son, on its board.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Both Mr. Holmes and Dr. Hill said it was clear that mentions of Burisma
by Mr. Trump, Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, or others were
clearly references to the investigations that the president wanted
Ukraine to announce.

Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Mr. Sondland
both testified that they believed Burisma was merely a reference to the
need to eliminate corruption in Ukraine, given the history of corruption
at the company.

But both witnesses on Thursday said unequivocally that Burisma was
“code” for the Bidens, and that anyone working on Ukraine issues
would know that. Asked whether “anyone involved in Ukraine matters in
the spring and summer would understand that as well,” Mr. Holmes had a
one-word answer.

“Yes,” he
said.

## Hill described what Bolton called a ‘drug deal’ on Ukraine: ‘Investigations for a meeting.’

Dr. Hill described an awkward White House meeting with Ukrainian
officials on July 10 that ended abruptly after Mr. Sondland discussed
pressing Ukraine to investigate Democrats in exchange for a White House
meeting for the country’s new president.

Dr. Hill testified that after the meeting ended, Mr. Sondland explained
precisely what he was up to: “That he had an agreement with chief of
staff Mulvaney that in return for investigations this meeting would get
scheduled.”

When she told John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, about
that exchange, Dr. Hill testified, he instructed her to tell the
National Security Council’s top lawyer about what Mr. Sondland, Mr.
Giuliani and Mr. Mulvaney were up to, and say that, “I am not part of
whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“I took it to mean investigations for a meeting,” Dr. Hill added, when
asked what Mr. Bolton meant by “drug deal.”

Later, Dr. Hill said that Mr. Bolton told her that “Giuliani’s a hand
grenade who’s going to blow everybody up.” She understood that to refer
to Mr. Giuliani’s “incendiary remarks” on television about Ukraine, and
that he was “pushing views that would come back to haunt us.”

“In fact,” she added, “I think that’s where we are
today.”

Mr. Holmes provided the first public testimony about a now-infamous July
cellphone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland, a conversation that
Democrats believe establishes that the president was preoccupied with
persuading Ukraine to publicly commit to investigations that benefited
him politically.

He told lawmakers that he could hear Mr. Trump, who was speaking loudly,
asking Mr. Sondland whether Mr. Zelensky was “going to do the
investigation.” Mr. Sondland told Mr. Trump that Mr. Zelensky “loves
your ass,” and would conduct the investigation and do “anything you ask
him to,” Mr. Holmes said.

In Mr. Holmes’s account, Mr. Sondland later told him that Mr. Trump
cared only about “big stuff that benefits the president” like the “Biden
investigation.” Mr. Sondland did not dispute that account when he
testified on Wednesday, but said he did not recall specifically
mentioning Mr.
Biden.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Representative Mike Turner of Ohio laced into Dr. Hill, using his time
during Thursday’s hearing to lecture her, rather than question her and
taking issue with her assertion that some Republicans denied that
Russians interfered in the 2016 elections.

In her opening statement, Dr. Hill had said that “based on questions and
statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe
that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against
our country.”

Mr. Turner took issue with that statement, calling it a “little small”
on her part.

“Dr. Hill, you have provided me probably the greatest piece of evidence
that’s before us to illustrate the problem with hearsay,” Mr. Turner
said, pointing her to a Republican report that acknowledged Russian
meddling in the election. “Dr. Hill, no matter how much we believe we
know that what we’ve heard is true, it is still just what we’ve heard.”

Mr. Turner also criticized Mr. Holmes for testifying that Mr. Sondland
told the president that Mr. Zelensky “loves your ass” during a telephone
call in Kyiv. Mr. Turner said that Mr. Holmes should not have used that
phrase in his testimony about the call.

“It was anecdotal, it was extraneous,” Mr. Turner said. “Your interests
in protecting Ukraine are very dubious when you embarrass President
Zelensky by making those statements you didn’t have to make. Who cares
that Ambassador Sondland said that?”

Mr. Turner did not ask a question for either Dr. Hill or Mr. Holmes to
answer, nor did two others Republicans who used their five minutes to
issue critical statements.

A few minutes later, under questioning from a Democratic lawmaker, Dr.
Hill got the chance to respond to the speechifying. She described
herself as a nonpartisan Russia expert who was appearing before the
committee without an agenda.

decision here,” Dr. Hill said. “We are not the people who make that
decision.”

## President Trump lashed out on Twitter, casting doubt on Holmes’s call.

Mr. Trump followed the day’s testimony, repeatedly retweeting Republican
members of the committee who complained about the impeachment process
and insisting that the president had done nothing wrong.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump took aim at Mr. Holmes’s credibility even
as he began testifying, suggesting there was no way he could have heard
what he claimed to have picked up the cellphone conversation between Mr.
Trump and Mr. Sondland.

The call is an important piece of evidence because it demonstrates that
Mr. Trump was directing members of his administration to push the
Ukrainians for the investigations, but the president on Thursday sought
to cast doubt on its authenticity.
