# Kamala Harris Says She’s Still ‘in This Fight,’ but Out of the 2020 Race

The California senator broke barriers but ran out of money as she
struggled in polls. Her abrupt announcement is perhaps the most

Senator [Kamala
Harris](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/kamala-harris.html)
of California dropped out of the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday
after months of low poll numbers and a series of missteps that crippled
her campaign, [a deflating
comedown](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html)
for a barrier-breaking candidate who was seeking to become the first
black woman to win a major party’s presidential nomination.

The decision came after weeks of upheaval among Ms. Harris’s staff,
including layoffs in New Hampshire and at her headquarters in Baltimore,
and disarray among her allies. She told supporters in an email on
Tuesday that she lacked the money needed to fully finance a competitive
campaign.

“My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources
we need to continue,” Ms. Harris wrote. “But I want to be clear with
you: I am still very much in this fight.”

The announcement is perhaps the most surprising development to date in a
fluid Democratic presidential campaign where Ms. Harris began in the top
tier. Her departure removes a prominent woman of color from a field that
started as the most racially diverse ever in a Democratic primary, and
raises the prospect that this month’s debate in Los Angeles will feature
no candidates who aren’t white.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Harris [opened her
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-rally-2020.html)
on Martin Luther King’s Birthday with a rousing speech in her hometown,
Oakland, Calif., before an audience of 20,000 people, drawing
comparisons to history-making black politicians like Barack Obama and
Shirley Chisholm.

The speech was a signal of the careful balance her campaign tried to
strike throughout the year: leaning on her personal story as a daughter
of Indian and Jamaican immigrants while offering policy preferences that
toggled between the party’s moderate and progressive ideological wings.
Ms. Harris sought to focus on incremental and deliverable change rather
than the type of systemic upheaval popularized by rivals like Senators
[Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html)
of Massachusetts and [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html)
of Vermont.

But almost immediately after her campaign began, she faced questions
about her policy core that resulted in damaging news cycles. She
reversed her position on single-payer health care, removing herself from
the “Medicare for all” bill sponsored by Mr. Sanders. She struggled with
how to frame her record as a prosecutor, oscillating between defending
it against progressive criticism and embracing it in a play for more
moderate votes.

On a conference call with donors Tuesday, Ms. Harris said she arrived at
the decision after conferring with her family over the Thanksgiving
holiday. She stayed up meeting with advisers until 2 a.m. Tuesday,
before concluding she had “no path” forward in the race, a person on the
call said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Harris said she would have needed to raise $5 million in two weeks,
a goal she described as impossible. “I just don’t want to bullshit you,”
she said.

Over the weekend, after a New York Times article detailed problems
within her campaign, Ms. Harris did a financial audit of her operation,
according to a senior aide. One of Ms. Harris’s aides, who spoke with
her about her decision to drop out, said that her instinct was to keep
fighting but that she was told her campaign would have to go into debt
in order to
continue.

In her announcement Tuesday, Ms. Harris reaffirmed her commitment to her
campaign’s unifying ideals. She is likely to immediately become a
top-tier option for the party’s vice-presidential nomination.

“Although I’m no longer running for president,” she said, “I will do
everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump and fight for the future
of our country and the best of who we are.”

Ms. Harris’s withdrawal will set off an arms race between the remaining
presidential campaigns, as they try to lap up her top-tier roster of
endorsements and staff members. Some of her donors have already begun to
field calls from her rivals.

But it is unclear how much Ms. Harris’s exit will aid any one candidate
in polling, considering how her standing had declined in recent months.
She and Ms. Warren were competing for many of the same voters earlier in
the year, but moderates like former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
and Mayor [Pete
Buttigieg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/pete-buttigieg.html)
of South Bend, Ind., may seek a boost from her supporters in Iowa and
New Hampshire.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Throughout her candidacy, Ms. Harris faced concerns about her political
strategy and her campaign’s organizational structure. She relied on a
stable of California political strategists, led by the longtime
political operative Averell Smith, who did not heed warnings from
grass-roots organizers to invest more heavily in early voting states
like Iowa and New Hampshire. Instead, the campaign focused on later
primaries in states with more nonwhite voters, including South Carolina
and California.

Her campaign miscalculated. Mr. Biden remained popular with black
voters, preventing her campaign from making significant headway in South
Carolina. In California, Ms. Harris was increasingly boxed out, as
candidates like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren excited the state’s liberal
wing and Mr. Biden persisted among
moderates.

## Who’s Running for President in 2020?

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, Ms. Harris had already qualified for the [next presidential
debate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/democratic-debate-lineup.html),
scheduled for Dec. 19, the only nonwhite candidate to do so thus far.
Without her, Democrats may have an all-white debate stage, though
candidates like Representative [Tulsi
Gabbard](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/tulsi-gabbard.html)
of Hawaii and the businessman [Andrew
Yang](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/andrew-yang.html)
may still qualify in the coming days.

“No matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the
most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate
stage in December is catastrophic,” wrote Leah Greenberg, a co-executive
director of Indivisible, a national progressive group, [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/Leahgreenb/status/1201934660789510144).

It was on an earlier debate stage in June when Ms. Harris [generated one
of the most electric
moments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-busing-joe-biden.html)
of the race so far, challenging Mr. Biden over his record on race and
busing. “I do not believe you are a racist,” she began. Mr. Biden was so
taken aback, he cut his own answer short.

Money poured into her campaign and she spiked in the polls. But those
numbers declined steadily in the months that followed, beginning when
she had difficulty articulating her own position on mandated busing —
undercutting her star turn.

“She really showed the importance of having different perspectives on
the debate stage,” said Amanda Hunter, research and communications
director at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which supports women in
politics and studies double standards. “Her personal story about being
bused to school was something that a historically typical older white
man would not bring to the conversation.”

But “there is still a very entrenched stereotype of what a presidential
candidate looks like in this country,” Ms. Hunter said. “Simply by
running, Senator Harris challenged that and broke down stereotypes.”

Ms. Harris’s online fund-raising slowed in recent months, and large
donors increasingly turned toward other candidates. In the third quarter
of the year, she [spent more than $1.41 for every dollar she
raised](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/16/us/elections/democratic-q3-fundraising.html),
burning through millions. She stopped buying ads, both online and on
television, slashed her staff in New Hampshire and retrenched to Iowa,
where she spent the Thanksgiving holiday with her family.

In the days leading up to her withdrawal, as her campaign grew
increasingly desperate, she surprised one donor who is not a major
Democratic bundler by telephoning him to see if he could reach out to
his associates who had yet to give. Another donor recommended to her
that she leave the race.

Even as she struggled, Ms. Harris had assembled a coveted list of more
than 130 bundlers who had raised at least $25,000 for her campaign, more
than half of whom were from her home state, California, one of the
deepest wells of Democratic cash. Ms. Harris canceled a scheduled
fund-raiser with some of her top bundlers in New York on Tuesday just
hours before the event. On Wednesday, she had been scheduled to attend
an event in Los Angeles at the home of Sean Parker, the billionaire tech
entrepreneur.

A pair of California-based Democratic strategists, Dan Newman and Brian
Brokaw, had just secured the money and the implicit signoff from Ms.
Harris’s campaign to begin a “super PAC” in support of her candidacy.
The group, named People Standing Strong, was to begin [a million-dollar
ad buy in
Iowa](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8YPgUVrEFsU&feature=youtu.be) on
Wednesday.

But it was not enough, as her campaign determined that she did not have
the financial resources to continue. The group quickly began canceling
its reservations.

In addition to the financial troubles, some of Ms. Harris’s supporters
worried that a poor showing once voting began, particularly in the
California primary, would leave Ms. Harris vulnerable to a Senate
primary challenge in 2022.

Presidential candidates have dropped out after running out of money for
decades, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and former Representative
Beto O’Rourke earlier this year. In 2015, Scott Walker, then the
governor of Wisconsin, famously flamed out of the Republican contest
months before balloting began because he was short on cash.

President Trump tweeted a farewell to Ms. Harris, saying, “We will miss
you Kamala,” to which she replied: “Don’t worry, Mr. President. I’ll see
