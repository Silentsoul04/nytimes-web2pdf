# A Design Dealer Who Lives Among His Wares

Rhett Baruch has transformed his compact Los Angeles apartment into a
showroom for the colorful, unconventional items that he sells.

A humdrum exterior belies the artfully wacky world behind the doors of
[Rhett Baruch](http://rhettbaruch.com/)’s home in Los Angeles. While the
building — a stuccoed two-story structure set on the border of Koreatown
and Westlake — is fairly unremarkable, Baruch has transformed his
1,200-square-foot second-floor apartment into an ever-evolving series of
colorful vignettes; a burl-wood console in the style of the Dutch de
Stijl designer Gerrit Rietveld might be paired with a lumpy ceramic
étagère by the Los Angeles-based artist [Emilie
Carroll](https://www.emiliecarroll.com/), or the sensual curves of a
Flemming Lassen chair could be offset by an amoeba-like neon sculpture
(called “Blooops”) from [Alina Hayes](https://www.alinahayes.com/). A
collector and dealer of contemporary art and design, Baruch uses the
space as a de facto showroom, a place to display beguiling curios and
whimsical home décor for the benefit of clients, though of course he
also takes personal pleasure in living among eccentric and beautiful
things.

Baruch’s aesthetic is a bold rejoinder to the more neutral, reserved
interiors that have prevailed in recent years (think fiddle-leaf figs in
ceramic pots nestled next to muted Eames chairs), perhaps because he is
something of an outsider. Originally from Arizona, where he held odd
jobs like working in call centers, Baruch, 34, has no formal training in
design. Soon after moving to Los Angeles three years ago, he received
word from the Miami-based vintage collector [Gillian
Bryce](https://www.instagram.com/gillianbryce/), who’d seen posts of
some of the décor pieces Baruch had collected on Instagram. The two
became fast friends — Bryce assumed the role of Baruch’s mentor, really,
though they’ll meet in person for the first time at this week’s Art
Basel fair in Miami Beach. She nudged him toward turning his
off-the-cuff posts of quirky found objects into a proper design
business.

Baruch did just that last year, when he styled [Not So
General](https://notsogeneral.la/), the Los Angeles-based gallery,
showroom and design studio that belongs to Paul Davidge. Davidge’s
endorsement not only helped legitimize Baruch’s commercial endeavors, it
introduced him to a wider swath of the local design community; he now
counts among his clients interior designers such as Louisa Pierce and
Emily Ward of [Pierce & Ward](https://pierceandward.com/), Kelly
Wearstler and the artist [Jihan
Zencirli](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/arts/design/geronimo-pier-17-south-street-seaport.html).

Baruch describes his business as a “constant evolution,” as works come
and go, and so his home, too, is always in flux. This setup has its
benefits: It saves him the cost of renting a showroom and helps him
avoid any logistical issues, since Baruch recently did the unthinkable
for an Angeleno — he gave up his car (discovering the city on foot has
been one of his recent joys and sources of inspiration, he says).
There’s also something charming about coming to his personal space —
and prospective buyers can imagine how they, too, could style some of
the more outré pieces — and about the slight chaos that accompanies
Baruch, thanks to his pinging phone and the stream of delivery men
picking up or dropping off packages. To Baruch, it’s all an extension of
the mercantilist tradition that’s been around since the marketplaces of
Rome. “What I do is the most traditional form of commerce,” he says.
“It’s taking a thing that’s been made by a person in this world —
finding it or having it made — and moving it to the next home and taking
money. That’s it.”

On some days, “I wake up and I don’t necessarily know what’s going to
come to me,” Baruch notes. “Suddenly a Knoll table pops up that’s a
great deal, so I’ll rearrange some things.” Some of his most vibrant
items **** have unconventional provenances to match — take, for example,
the six-foot-tall burned-orange leather coat tree in the shape of a
cactus, a castoff prop from the fashion brand Coach.

While contemporary design makes up the majority of Baruch’s business,
lately he’s introduced older works into the mix, like a green bowl by
the Italian designer Carlo Scarpa for Venini that dates back to 1936. He
pays particular attention to texture, evidenced by pieces like a drippy
black-and-white Amazonian vessel by the Italian designer Gaetano Pesce
that appears to be hard clay but is in fact a lightweight, rubbery
resin, or a vase by the Californian designer [Taylor
Kibby](http://taylorkibby.com/) made of patinated ceramic chain-link
that folds in on itself and can be reshaped at will. Baruch sources
directly from local Los Angeles makers — like Kibby and the artist [Zach
Storm](http://www.zachstorm.com/) — in part to help **** foster a sense
of community, trying to find locals with whom he feels an affinity.
“It’s not worth it to buy things that don’t matter, that aren’t made
by someone, that aren’t rare or unique,” he says.

Although he is surrounded all the time by the pieces he sells, much of
Baruch’s business happens online, through furniture marketplaces like
[Chairish](https://www.chairish.com/shop/rhett), and his days are often
spent staging scenes to photograph and post on Instagram (he hopes to
expand his services to include styling, decorating and consulting). And
while it may be easy for him to fall in love with a stocky Faye Toogood
chair or a knobbly Jackie Rines side table or even with a particularly
delightful room arrangement, he’s found it’s best not to: Everything
might be different within a day or so, if not sooner. He likes to think
of himself as a fast-moving matchmaker trying to pair good things with
their fated owners. “Like a medium,” Baruch says. “I’m the catalyst for
people to own beautiful things.”
