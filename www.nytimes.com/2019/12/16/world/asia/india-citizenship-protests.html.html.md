# As Protests Rage on Citizenship Bill, Is India Becoming a Hindu Nation?

Several people have been killed as unrest spreads to new corners of the
country. Many see the passage of a new law as anti-Muslim.

NEW DELHI — Prime Minister [Narendra
Modi’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/world/asia/india-protests-citizenship-muslims.html)
government has rounded up thousands of Muslims in Kashmir, revoked the
area’s autonomy and enforced a citizenship test in northeastern
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/world/asia/india-protests-citizenship-muslims.html)
that left nearly two million people potentially stateless, many of them
Muslim.

But it was Mr. Modi’s gamble to pass a [sweeping new citizenship
law](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/world/asia/india-muslims-citizenship-narendra-modi.html)
that favors every South Asian faith other than Islam that has set off
days of widespread protests.

The law, which easily passed both houses of Parliament last week, is the
most overt sign, opponents say, that [Mr.
Modi](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/world/asia/india-protests-citizenship-muslims.html)
intends to turn
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/world/asia/india-protests-citizenship-muslims.html)
into a Hindu-centric state that would leave the country’s 200 million
Muslims at a calculated disadvantage.

Indian Muslims, who have watched anxiously as Mr. Modi’s government has
pursued a

days, protests have broken in cities across the country.

Mumbai. Chennai. Varanasi. Guwahati. Hyderabad. Bhopal. Patna.

spreading](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/world/asia/india-citizenship-protests.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage),
and on Monday they tied up several areas of the capital, New Delhi.

*\[Update:* [*Violence continues in New Delhi, and the police are
criticized*](http://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/india-violence-hindu-muslim.html)*.\]*

Mr. Modi’s government has responded by calling out troops, shutting down
the internet and imposing curfews, just as it did when it [clamped down
on
Kashmir](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/world/asia/kashmir-india-pakistan.html).
In New Delhi, police officers beat unarmed students with wooden poles,
dragging them away and sending scores to the hospital. In Assam, they
shot and killed several young men.

[India’s
Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/world/asia/india-internet-modi-protests.html)
had stayed relatively quiet during the other recent setbacks, keenly
aware of the electoral logic that has pushed them to the margins.
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/world/asia/india-internet-modi-protests.html)
is about 80 percent Hindu, and 14 percent Muslim, and Mr. Modi and his
party won a crushing election victory in May and handily control the
Parliament.

But [Indian
Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/world/asia/india-internet-modi-protests.html)
are feeling increasingly desperate, and so are progressives, many
Indians of other faiths, and those who see a secular government as
fundamental to India’s identity and its future.

The world is now weighing in, too. United Nations officials, American
representatives, international advocacy groups and religious
organizations have issued scathing statements saying that the
citizenship law is blatantly discriminatory. Some are even calling
for[sanctions](https://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/press-releases-statements/uscirf-raises-serious-concerns-and-eyes-sanctions).

Critics are deeply worried that Mr. Modi is trying to wrench India away
from its secular, democratic roots and turn this nation of 1.3 billion
people into a religious state, a homeland for Hindus.

“They want a theocratic state,’’ said B.N. Srikrishna, a former judge on
India’s Supreme Court. “This is pushing the country to the brink, to the
brink of chaos.”

“This is how waves of communal violence start in the country,” he
added.

Mr. Modi is no stranger to communal violence. The worst bloodshed that
India has seen in recent years exploded on his watch, in 2002, in
Gujarat, when he was the top official in the state and [clashes between
Hindus and
Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/06/world/asia/modi-gujarat-riots-timeline.html#/#time287_8514)
killed more than 1,000 people — most of them Muslims.

Mr. Modi was widely blamed for not doing enough to stop it. Courts have
cleared him, but many people believe he was at least partly responsible
for the brutality that unfolded.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

His grip on power is still firm, even with a weakening economy. The
political opposition, including the once-dominant Indian National
Congress party, has been disorganized and shaky compared with the
juggernaut he and his right-hand man, Amit Shah, the home minister, have
built in their Bharatiya Janata Party.

But this contentious citizenship law, which paves a special path for
non-Muslim migrants in India to become citizens, has galvanized the
opposition. Rival opposition leaders who usually can’t agree on anything
are planning protests together. Students from across the country are
rallying to each other’s defense. Each episode of harsh police action
captured by mobile phone and beamed around cyberspace catalyzes more
sympathy, more protests — and more prospects for
violence.

On Monday, Mr. Modi called for calm, [saying on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/narendramodi) that the law “does not affect
any citizen of India of any religion” and “the need of the hour is for
all of us to work together.’’

This citizenship law was a much touted campaign promise and a special
wish of his Hindu base. His supporters see a future India as a place
that emphasizes its Hindu heritage as much as possible and eliminates
the special legal protections that exist for Muslims and other
minorities.

Some analysts are quick to point out that the course Mr. Modi’s party is
charting could lead to an India dominated by one faith and one
viewpoint, where existential tensions hold back the economy and
hamstring politics — as embodied by Pakistan, India’s struggling,
Islamic archenemy next door.  
  
"We’re chasing a failed dream,’' said Yogendra Yadav, a political
commentator.

The new citizenship legislation, called the Citizenship Amendment Act,
expedites Indian citizenship for migrants from some of India’s
neighboring countries if they are Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Sikh,
Parsee or Jain. Only one major religion in South Asia was left off:
Islam.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Indian officials have denied any anti-Muslim bias and said the measure
was intended purely to help persecuted minorities migrating from India’s
predominantly Muslim neighbors — Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

The legislation follows hand in hand with a divisive citizenship test
conducted this summer in one state in northern India and possibly soon
to be expanded
nationwide.

All residents of Assam, along the Bangladesh border, had to produce
documentary proof that they or their ancestors lived in India since
1971. Around two million of Assam’s population of 33 million — a mix of
Hindus and Muslims — [failed to pass the
test](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/world/asia/india-muslim-citizen-list.html)
and now risk being rendered stateless. Huge new prisons are being built
to house anyone determined to be an illegal immigrant.

A widespread belief is that the Indian government will use both these
measures — the citizenship tests and the new citizenship law — to strip
away rights from Muslims who have been living in India for generations.
The way this will happen, many Muslim Indians fear, is that they will be
asked to produce old birth certificates or property deeds necessary to
prove citizenship and they will be unable to do so. And while Hindu
residents in the same situation will be given a pass, it seems, Muslim
residents will not have the same legal protections.

The protests started last week in Assam, led by Hindus and joined by
Assamese Muslims and Christians. [Many Hindus in Assam don’t like the
new
law](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/world/asia/india-protests-citizenship-bill.html)
either: They fear it could open the floodgates to poor migrants who will
settle in Assam and take their land. And so, despite the legislation’s
potential to drive a sectarian wedge across India, in Assam it
backfired, unifying protesters across religious lines.

Witnesses said that security forces fired live ammunition into a crowd,
killing a 17-year-old Christian student as he walked home. Outraged
demonstrators then burned down train stations and attacked the police.

On Sunday, the protests spread to Delhi. Students of Jamia Millia
Islamia University, a predominantly Muslim institution, gathered
peacefully, witnesses said. But chaos broke out after a separate group
of violent protesters joined the fray and began clashing with the
police, witnesses said.

The police response was swift and indiscriminate, according to
witnesses, and videos widely circulated on social media showed officers
beating students. In one
[video](https://twitter.com/Free_soul_ali/status/1206281963725885440), a
group of female students tries to rescue a young man from the grasp of
the police. A squad of officers in riot gear tears him away and knocks
him down with heavy blows. Even after the women form a protective circle
around him, officers can be seen jabbing the young man with their wooden
poles.

Observers said that while police brutality was common in poorer, more
rural areas of India, it was extremely unusual to see it explode on such
a scale in the capital.

Waqar Azam, a 26-year-old student, was studying in the university
library when students burst in and yelled that the police were coming.
The students locked the doors. Moments later, tear gas canisters crashed
through the windows, filling the library with choking smoke.

“What is happening to Indian Muslims today did not happen overnight,”
Mr. Azam said. “If we don’t protest against it now, we will end up
living like slaves.”

Mr. Modi’s supporters have dismissed the protesters as being exclusively
Muslim, or from a die-hard political opposition group. But in Assam,
many protesters said they had voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party and
now regretted it.

On Monday morning, some 5,000 protesters, of many faiths, gathered in
central Guwahati, Assam’s capital.  
  
One chant echoed across town: “Down with
Modi\!”
