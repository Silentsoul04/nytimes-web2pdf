# Trump Impeached for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress

Voting nearly along party lines, the House approved two articles of
impeachment against President Trump, making him the third president in
history to face removal by the Senate.

WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives on Wednesday [impeached
President
Trum](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html)p
for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, making him the third
president in history to be charged with committing high crimes and
misdemeanors and face removal by the Senate.

On a day of constitutional consequence and raging partisan tension, the
votes on the two articles of
[impeachment](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-01-16)
fell largely along party lines, after a bitter debate that stretched
into the evening and reflected the deep polarization gripping American
politics in the Trump era.

Only two Democrats opposed the article on abuse of power, which accused
[Mr. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-01-15)
of corruptly using the levers of government to solicit election
assistance from Ukraine in the form of investigations to discredit his
Democratic political rivals. Republicans were united in opposition. It
passed 230 to 197, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi gaveling the vote to a
close from the House rostrum.

On the second charge, obstruction of Congress, a third Democrat joined
Republicans in opposition. The vote was 229 to 198.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The

votes set the stage for a [historic trial beginning early next
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/senate-impeachment-trial.html)
in the Senate, which will have final say — 10 months before Mr. Trump
faces re-election — on whether to acquit the 45th president or convict
and remove him from office. The timing was uncertain, after Ms. Pelosi
suggested late Wednesday that [she might wait to send the articles to
the
Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/impeachment-trial.html),
holding them out as leverage in a negotiation on the terms of a
trial.

## Impeachment Results: How Democrats and Republicans Voted

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Acquittal in the Republican-controlled chamber may be likely, but the
proceeding is certain to further aggravate the political and cultural
fault lines in the country that Mr. Trump’s presidency has brought into
dramatic relief. Regardless of the outcome, the impeachment votes in the
House put an indelible stain on Mr. Trump’s presidency that cannot be
wiped from the public consciousness with a barrage of tweets or an angry
tirade in front of thousands of his cheering supporters at a campaign
rally.

On Wednesday, [Democrats characterized his impeachment as an urgent
action](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/impeachment-democrats-votes.html)
to stop a corrupt president whose misdeeds had unfolded in plain view
from damaging the United States any further.

“Over the course of the last three months, we have found
incontrovertible evidence that President Trump abused his power by
pressuring the newly elected president of Ukraine to announce an
investigation into President Trump’s political rival,” said
Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the
Intelligence Committee chairman, who led the impeachment inquiry.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The president and his men plot on,” Mr. Schiff said. “The danger
persists. The risk is real. Our democracy is at peril.”

Far from showing contrition or contemplating resignation, as his
predecessors have done in the face of impeachment, Mr. Trump instead
offered an indignant defense as the House weighed his fate, raging on
Twitter from the White House.

the constitutional confrontation as a “hoax” based on unfounded charges,
even as he conceded that it would be a permanent blot on his
presidency.

## Listen to ‘The Daily’: The Impeachment of President Donald J. Trump

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Lisa Chow, Austin Mitchell, Adizah Eghan, Annie Brown and Theo Balcomb, with help from Alexandra Leigh Young; and edited by Lisa Tobin and M.J. Davis Lin

#### In a divided House, moderate Democrats are bearing the burden of answering for the impeachment vote.

</div>

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
    
    Today: The United States House of Representatives has impeached
    President Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. My
    colleague Lisa Chow and I on the story of how a fractious Democratic
    Party, which started the year divided on impeachment, ultimately
    united around it.
    
    It’s Thursday, December 19.

  - lisa chow  
    And how far away from Holly?

  - speaker  
    35 miles from the home.

  - lisa chow  
    O.K. So yeah, we will get there in time. You want to describe what
    you’re seeing outside the window?

  - michael barbaro  
    So we’re driving by a strip mall about 45 minutes outside Detroit.
    There’s a Best Buy, a Michaels, a PetSmart, a Lowes, Chipotle and a
    DSW. This is a solid, solid, solid strip mall.

  - lisa chow  
    So Michael, why are we driving through the strip malls of Detroit?

  - michael barbaro  
    So we are headed to the home of Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin.

  - archived recording  
    Elissa Slotkin has a lead of more than 2,000 votes against
    Republican incumbent Mike Bishop.

  - michael barbaro  
    She is a moderate Democrat who won her seat —

  - archived recording (elissa slotkin)  
    I won in a district that was a Republican district. So the only way
    —

  - michael barbaro  
    She flipped a red district and turned it blue in 2018. And in doing
    so, she helped the Democrats win back the House.

  - archived recording  
    The blue wave. The blue wave that swept Democrats into power in the
    House.

  - michael barbaro  
    But the moment she gets into office —

  - archived recording (rashida tlaib)  
    Because we’re going to go in there, we’re going to impeach the
    motherfucker. \[CHEERS\]

  - michael barbaro  
    — people like Rashida Tlaib, the congresswoman who represents a
    district just to the south here that we just drove through, they’re
    saying that the findings of the Russia inquiry merit impeachment.
    And Slotkin is not having any of it.

  - archived recording  
    Important quote. This is from Congresswoman Slotkin of Michigan.
    Impeachment is not what people are coming up to me in the grocery
    store and talking to me about. They want to know —

  - michael barbaro  
    She is skeptical of that, she’s opposed to it. It’s not part of her
    political brand to want to impeach the president. And then all of a
    sudden, the whistle-blower report comes out, and she reads it, and
    she’s very troubled. And she and a handful of her moderate
    swing-district Democratic House colleagues write an op-ed in The
    Washington Post calling for an impeachment inquiry.

  - archived recording  
    They write, we have devoted our lives to the service and security of
    our country. Now we join as a unified group to uphold —

  - michael barbaro  
    And their voice carries a tremendous amount of weight, because they
    are moderates, because they helped win back the House for Democrats.
    And shortly afterwards, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opens an
    impeachment inquiry.

  - archived recording (nancy pelosi)  
    I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with
    an official impeachment inquiry. The president must be held
    accountable. No one is above the law.

  - michael barbaro  
    And right away, it’s clear that there are political consequences for
    Slotkin.

  - elissa slotkin  
    I am going to wait for the facts. I’m going to look at them
    judiciously. I’m going to do what I was trained to do, which is to
    look at the —

  - michael barbaro  
    We went to three town halls in her district and just listened as
    constituents pelted her with questions about why she was doing this.

  - crowd  
    \[JEERING\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Two months go by. The impeachment inquiry unfolds. Hearings happen,
    a report is filed. And now she has to make a decision — is she going
    to vote to impeach the president, or is she going to vote not to the
    impeach the president?

  - lisa chow  
    Whoa, we’re going into her driveway.

  - michael barbaro  
    We’re doing it. I think it’s O.K. I mean, we’re a little early.
    What’re you gonna do? We are arriving at Slotkin’s house in the
    middle of these final hours of deliberation for her on impeachment.
    She has told her constituents that she’s going to announce her
    decision on Monday morning. We are talking to her on Sunday night.

  - lisa chow  
    How do you feel?

  - michael barbaro  
    I feel good. I mean, I feel dehydrated. Did you actually eat your
    granola bar?

  - lisa chow  
    I did not eat my granola bar. Hard to eat and hold a microphone.

  - michael barbaro  
    You’re going to regret it when you’re in the middle of this
    interview and you’re starving.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Hi, guys. Come on in.

  - michael barbaro  
    Hi.

  - elissa slotkin  
    I’m Elissa.

  - michael barbaro  
    Congresswoman, so nice to see you.

  - elissa slotkin  
    So nice to meet you. Hi.

  - michael barbaro  
    Thank you for letting us — Lisa.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Come on in, come on in.

  - michael barbaro  
    This is a truly a farmhouse.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Oh yeah, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I think of you guys as audio, and so
    I’m not doing a very nice job, but this is 1895 farmhouse. My family
    bought it in the ‘50s. We held off lighting a fire because we didn’t
    know if the noise would be annoying, but we can definitely light a
    fire.
    
    And this — I should just say, this desk, for whatever it’s worth, is
    sort of one of the big heirlooms in my family. This was my
    great-grandfather’s desk. And if you see on the plate here —

  - michael barbaro  
    It is kind of a resolute desk.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Yes. So it was used by Lindley Garrison, secretary of war, 1913 to
    1916.

  - michael barbaro  
    During the presidency of Woodrow Wilson.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Yeah.

  - michael barbaro  
    Geez.

  - elissa slotkin  
    So that was a gift to my great-grandfather, Sam Slotkin. And it’s
    been passed down.

  - michael barbaro  
    Is this where you go to make big decisions?

  - elissa slotkin  
    This is where I make my big decisions.

  - michael barbaro  
    Is this that — this three-ring binder looks like it’s the House
    Intelligence report?

  - elissa slotkin  
    Yes. This is — well, it’s a lot, I guess, more than it. It is —
    let’s see. My team has diligently tabbed it out for me. So this is
    the impeachment documents that came down, I guess, what now, three
    weeks ago —

  - michael barbaro  
    From the Judiciary Committee.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Yes, from the Judiciary Committee. This is the HPSCI report, the
    House Intelligence report.

  - michael barbaro  
    May I see this?

  - elissa slotkin  
    You’re welcome to.

  - michael barbaro  
    Clinton articles of impeachment. Nixon articles of impeachment. And
    I see you’ve done a bunch of underlining.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Yeah. For me, this is, frankly, a very standard way that I look at
    things, which just comes from my training as a C.I.A. officer, which
    is sequester yourself away, get all the original base documents. And
    then you do some historical research and then make an objective
    decision not based on what you see in the news or what someone’s
    telling you.

  - michael barbaro  
    Thanks for letting us interrupt it.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Where would you guys like to set up? Would you like to be —

  - michael barbaro  
    Where would you like us to set up?

  - elissa slotkin  
    Take the dining room.

  - michael barbaro  
    All right, we’ll go set ourselves up.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Sure.

  - lisa chow  
    O.K., check, check, check, check.

  - michael barbaro  
    How am I sounding? O.K. So, Congresswoman, thank you for letting us
    into your home —

  - elissa slotkin  
    Of course.

  - michael barbaro  
    — during a really important moment for you.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Yeah.

  - michael barbaro  
    The last time we talked to you, you had just made a decision to
    support an impeachment inquiry, which ended up being a very
    consequential decision.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Yeah.

  - michael barbaro  
    Tell me what the last couple of months have been like for you as
    that inquiry has unfolded. What’s that experience been like?

  - elissa slotkin  
    Well, I would say it’s probably been some of the most intense months
    I’ve had as a working professional, that’s for sure. The principal
    reason why I decided to come out back in September in support of an
    inquiry, after many, many months of not supporting impeachment or an
    inquiry, was this very basic idea that the president of the United
    States reached out to a foreign party and solicited help in
    influencing an American election. And confirming or denying that
    very basic idea was pretty important to me in this process.

  - michael barbaro  
    That fact pattern.

  - elissa slotkin  
    That fact pattern. And you know, I was in national security for a
    long time. We are in the business of pressuring governments to do
    things that we want, right? That happens all the time. And anyone
    who gets to a senior-enough level has been in that position. The
    difference here was that the president was doing it for his own
    personal political gain, not for the national security interests of
    the United States. So for me, the central idea was whether the
    president asked for foreigners to get involved in the American
    political process.

  - michael barbaro  
    So did the inquiry and did the hearings establish that?

  - elissa slotkin  
    Well, that’s what I’ve been trying to parse through. What became
    clearer and clearer through what I read and what the reporting
    produced was that you have a lot of people who were aware that, for
    instance, security assistance was held up in exchange for something.
    And we have Ambassador Sondland saying very directly that it was
    held up because they were waiting for the Ukrainians to live up to
    their end of the bargain.

  - michael barbaro  
    To conduct these investigations on —

  - elissa slotkin  
    Yes, to announce investigations. That’s the hardest thing for me
    about my peers who may decide not to vote on these articles, is that
    do they accept that it’s O.K. to invite foreign help into the
    American political process?

  - michael barbaro  
    I think I just watched Lindsey Graham say that he’s O.K. with it in
    an interview.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Well, I’m sorry, and I think that history will show them to be
    misguided. And maybe it’s because I was a C.I.A. officer, but I am
    comfortable making hard decisions that aren’t popular, because I
    know that they’re the right thing for the security of the country. I
    was asked to do that over and over and over again in my prior life.
    And that’s the same approach I take to these decisions.

  - michael barbaro  
    I hear you hinting that a hard decision that you’re capable of
    making may be heading in one direction.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Well, listen, I mean, no offense, but I’m not going to tell The New
    York Times before I tell my own constituents. It’s why we’re having
    a big town hall tomorrow. My hope and my responsibility is to be
    transparent with the constituents of the Eighth District, to be
    available to listen to their current concerns and answer them, and
    to be honest with them.

  - michael barbaro  
    So understanding that you’re not going to be disclosing your
    intentions just now at this table in your house, I want to talk
    about your constituents for just a moment.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Sure.

  - michael barbaro  
    Based on my understanding of your district, which voted for Trump by
    a healthy margin, and according to you, does not seem to support
    impeachment as a whole, you could find yourself very much at odds
    with your own constituents.

  - elissa slotkin  
    I mean —

  - michael barbaro  
    Are you comfortable with that?

  - elissa slotkin  
    This is what it means to be an elected leader. You have to make
    tough calls. And in a district like this, I’m never going to make
    everyone happy. If I lose my seat because I stood up for my
    principles, that’s O.K. I, of course, want to be re-elected, and I
    want to maintain the House majority. I think it’s an important check
    and balance. But I’m not going to compromise my principles just to
    keep that job. I’m just not. And I hope that people want that kind
    of an elected representative.

  - michael barbaro  
    I do have to ask you the kind of political version of this question,
    which is mathematically, your vote isn’t required to impeach the
    president. And so there’re kind of two ways to look at this. On the
    one hand, if you vote yes, that would be very politically risky. The
    other way to look at this is that if you vote no, that’s its own set
    of risks, because as a moderate, you would be sending a message that
    the people in the middle who started all this, who said there should
    be an inquiry, don’t think there’s enough there to actually impeach.
    And that would be a very complicated message to send in 2020 when
    the president’s running for re-election. It’s essentially that
    impeachment was a project of the far left. And so there’s basically
    a ton of risk no matter what you do, and I wonder how you weigh
    those risks.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Well, I mean, listen, voting on articles of impeachment is right up
    there with Congress’s role in declaring war. I mean, it’s got to be
    one of the top two things that a member of Congress will ever vote
    on in their career — most important things. So when you have a vote
    like that, it’s beyond that political calculus. I think it should
    be. It certainly is for me. And I’ve certainly had people propose to
    me, you know, just vote no, save your seat.

  - michael barbaro  
    Your vote isn’t needed, anyway.

  - elissa slotkin  
    I’ve had people say that to me.

  - michael barbaro  
    And what do you say?

  - elissa slotkin  
    I have to look at myself in the mirror. Like, I have to come away
    from this experience with a sense that I haven’t done what so many
    people here in Michigan think of elected officials. I cannot just
    become that cynical political person who just orients their major
    decisions around what would save their seat. I just —

  - michael barbaro  
    Or even their party.

  - elissa slotkin  
    You know, we have the president admitting that he reached out to a
    foreigner to ask for help in an American political election. If you
    think about that outside the normal insanity that we have right now
    on TV and all the events that are happening, if you think about
    that, which I’ve been trying to do today here quietly at my farm,
    that is — that is wrong. And I think that sending a signal in the
    most clear terms we can is important enough even to risk the
    majority.

  - michael barbaro  
    So it’s 7:30 on Sunday night and you’re planning to make an
    announcement tomorrow morning in front of your constituents. How are
    you doing inside? How are you feeling?

  - elissa slotkin  
    I actually feel pretty clear. I’ve done the work. I’ve kept an open
    mind, and I’ve sat with the documents, I’ve sat with the
    transcripts, and I’ve made my best assessment. So I’m going to try
    and be as present and available as I can. I trust my voters, I do.
    And I think —

  - michael barbaro  
    Trust them to do what?

  - elissa slotkin  
    I trust them as Michiganders to give me a chance to explain. And for
    them to give me the benefit of the doubt.

\[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    I wish you the best of luck tomorrow.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Thank you. Thanks very much.

  - michael barbaro  
    Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back

  - crowd  
    Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elissa Slotkin has got to go\! Hey hey, ho ho —
    got to go\! Hey hey, ho ho.

michael barbaro

So Lisa, I headed back to New York to host the show. You stayed in
Michigan. So what happens the next day, after we had talked to Elissa
Slotkin?

lisa chow

So the next day, I arrive very early, and already there are people
there.

  - crowd  
    Ho ho, Elissa Slotkin has got to go\!

lisa chow

And they’re upset, they’re pissed. And that’s because Slotkin had
already announced her decision in the local paper that morning.

michael barbaro

Of course, we had both understood from the interview where this was
going.

lisa chow

Yes, but she hadn’t yet told her constituents. And so in this op-ed, she
says very clearly that she is voting yes on both articles of
impeachment.

  - speaker 1  
    She must go now\!

  - speaker 2  
    Country over party\! Impeach and remove Trump\!

lisa chow

So people are lining up to get inside the auditorium where the town hall
meeting will be held. And outside, there was a bunch of protesters with
big signs saying, “Impeach Slotkin, keep Trump,” in bright red letters.
And some of them are carrying much smaller signs that say, “We have your
back.”

michael barbaro

Which is a message to Slotkin.

lisa chow

Exactly.

  - speaker 1  
    Do you understand that?

  - speaker 2  
    You’re yelling.

  - speaker 1  
    Do you like Russians?

lisa chow

I mean, very quickly, people start yelling at each other.

  - speaker 1  
    Because I have to talk over your people. Do you like Russia? Do you
    like Russia? Because I’m a veteran, and I do not support Russia\!

  - speaker 2  
    Have a discussion.

  - speaker 1  
    The fact is you walked up to me and you asked me about Ukraine,
    which is a Russian —

lisa chow

The one exchange that I found particularly memorable was this veteran —

  - speaker 1  
    You’re standing here as an American, as an American, talking —

lisa chow

The pro-Slotkin person who got very emotional. And she basically said,
you’re spouting Russian talking points to me, to say that Ukraine
interfered in our election.

  - speaker 1  
    Our flag is red, white and blue, not red and blue. It is red, white,
    and blue. Put your country first for once, O.K.?

  - speaker 2  
    I am. Would you like to discuss? See?

lisa chow

And so people are really challenging each other’s patriotism.

  - speaker 1  
    What, what? Ukraine did what? What did Ukraine do? Tell me what
    Ukraine did.

  - speaker 2  
    Are you gonna listen? Biden bragged about — about bribing Ukraine
    with a billion dollars. Do you want to hear it?

lisa chow

They’re just looking at the facts in a totally different way.

  - speaker 2  
    What crime? Name one. Name one crime. You jumped in, I’m listening.
    Name one crime.

  - speaker 3  
    Abuse of power.

  - speaker 2  
    That’s not — O.K., that — name what exactly did he do to abuse — to
    abuse power?
    
    Say one.

  - speaker 4  
    Having a foreign country meddle in the election. That’s one.

  - speaker 2  
    He didn’t\! The Democrats did\!

  - speaker 4  
    You really are insane, aren’t you? Open your eyes.

  - lisa chow  
    O.K. So.

lisa chow

Finally, we head into the auditorium, and it’s a large room.

  - lisa chow  
    People are registering, and then walking into the auditorium.

lisa chow

The room is packed.

  - lisa chow  
    How many chairs are here?

  - speaker  
    418\. So we set up for about 400 people.

  - lisa chow  
    O.K. It’s filling up.

lisa chow

There are tons of media, national and local press covering this event.

  - lisa chow  
    Can you tell me where you’re from?

  - speaker 1  
    The Flint Journal and mlive.com.

  - speaker 2  
    MIRS news.

  - speaker 3  
    I’m here for NPR today.

  - speaker 4  
    Simone from Roll Call.

  - speaker 5  
    The Detroit Free Press.

  - speaker 6  
    The Oakland Press.

  - speaker 7  
    Detroit News.

  - speaker 8  
    The New York Times.

  - speaker 9  
    Huffington Post.

  - speaker 10  
    Washington Post.

  - speaker 11  
    Associated Press.

  - speaker 12  
    The Michigan Advance.

  - speaker 13  
    CNN.

lisa chow

And it’s clear that this is the story, which is moderate Democrats and
their vulnerability in this vote that they’re taking.

  - speaker  
    Let’s please welcome to the stage Congresswoman Slotkin.

michael barbaro

So what happens next?

lisa chow

She’s introduced by one of her staffers, and she takes the stage.

  - crowd  
    \[CHEERING AND JEERING\]

lisa chow

Immediately, the crowd erupts in both cheers and boos.

  - elissa slotkin  
    O.K., guys. O.K.

  - speaker  
    All right, everybody. Thank you.

  - elissa slotkin  
    O.K., well, I’m thrilled to see such a great turnout today.

  - speaker  
    Let’s please — please let her speak.

  - crowd  
    \[YELLING\]

lisa chow

And she basically can’t get a word in.

  - speaker  
    Let’s please respect the people around you who are here to listen.

lisa chow

There is a very loud group in the corner of the room that is making it
almost impossible for her to be heard by the rest of the room.

  - elissa slotkin  
    So in an attempt to be transparent, I’m going to walk you through my
    logic. And I know it’s clear that we don’t all agree. I thought we
    needed to let the election of 2020 decide what was going to happen
    in our country. But those changed — that changed for me on the very
    basic facts that the president of the United States came out — and
    his lawyer came out and said, very specifically —

lisa chow

And they’re screaming all sorts of things, like —

  - speaker  
    Liar\! Liar\!

lisa chow

Liar, shame on you.

  - elissa slotkin  
    And that is very different than how presidents typically build their
    power, right? To be honest with you, I worked at the National
    Security Council under George Bush. I worked under the National
    Security Council under Barack Obama. And presidents regularly wield
    their power.

michael barbaro

So the Michiganders don’t quite give her the chance to explain herself
that she told us she’d been hoping for.

lisa chow

Not really.

  - elissa slotkin  
    They regularly leverage their position to influence other countries.
    That’s a normal part of what a president does. But what was
    fundamentally different for me is that the president —

lisa chow

And there’s one guy in particular in the back —

  - speaker  
    The Democrats are run by “the squad“\!

lisa chow

— who screams —

  - speaker  
    The Democrats are run by the squad\!

lisa chow

— you’re part of the squad.

  - speaker  
    Democrats are the party of the squad\!

lisa chow

The squad runs the Democrats.

michael barbaro

Right, the four best-known House freshmen liberals.

lisa chow

Exactly. And at one point, he even gets up and yells —

  - speaker  
    You belong to Rashida\!

lisa chow

You belong to Rashida. And what’s so fascinating about this moment is
that when we started reporting at the beginning of this year on the
freshman class of Democrats, it was exactly that conflation that people
like Elissa Slotkin were trying to avoid.

michael barbaro

Right.

lisa chow

Because they knew the Republicans would try to lump all the Democrats
together as Trump-hating left-wing progressives.

michael barbaro

Right. They would try to make a Slotkin and a Tlaib indistinguishable,
even though they’re very different.

\[music\]

lisa chow

Exactly. And Slotkin has been so cautious in this process. She’s been
thorough. She has had careful reasoning. But none of that matters in
this moment. She is Rashida Tlaib, according to those protesters.

  - speaker 1  
    Do you stand for your party or do you stand for your Constitution?

  - speaker 2  
    Let her say that. Let her say that. That she is not a part of the
    squad\!

  - speaker 1  
    She did\!

  - speaker 2  
    No, she should did not\! She has to say\! Let her say that\! Let her
    say that\!

lisa chow

I think that’s exactly what gets under Slotkin’s skin — this feeling of
not being understood in the way that she understands herself. That no
matter what she says, no matter what she believes, a significant number
of her constituents are just going to see her as this kind of caricature
of a Democrat. And they’re never going to agree with her, and she’s not
going to be able to get through to them. You could tell from her voice
that maybe, you know, she expected this. Maybe this scene didn’t
surprise her. But it’s still hard.

  - speaker  
    All right, everyone. Thank you very much for coming out today.
    Please leave safely.

  - elissa slotkin  
    Thank you. Thank you for listening. Appreciate it. Thank you for
    being good citizens.

  - lisa chow  
    So the auditorium is cleared out. Now that’s over. And I guess next,
    we’re headed to Washington to cover the actual vote.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

  - michael barbaro  
    Did you bring water? Or did I just, like — idiotically, I left my
    water on the other side of the Capitol. It’s O.K. It’s OK. It’s OK.

  - lisa chow  
    O.K. So Michael, where are we right now?

  - michael barbaro  
    So we’re in the U.S. Capitol, standing just outside the House
    chamber. You can kind of see it through these double doors. And
    inside that chamber —

  - archived recording  
    House will be in order.

  - michael barbaro  
    There’s about six more hours of debate happening. A lot of it very
    predictable. Democrats are saying —

  - archived recording  
    No one is above the law.

  - michael barbaro  
    That after great care and lots of prayer —

  - archived recording  
    Today, sadly, we are voting to impeach President Donald John Trump.

  - michael barbaro  
    They’re taking a principled vote to impeach the president.
    Republicans are saying —

  - archived recording  
    They hate this president.

michael barbaro

— Democrats have made something out of absolutely nothing, and that this
is a sham.

  - archived recording  
    They think Hillary Clinton should be president, and they want to fix
    that.

michael barbaro

And I’m kind of imagining Elissa Slotkin in there preparing for a
monumental vote that a lot of people in her district have just said they
don’t want her to take. But there’s actually somebody else and I have
been thinking about.

  - michael barbaro  
    Congresswoman.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Hi, Michael. How’s it going?

  - michael barbaro  
    And that’s Rashida Tlaib. Because she has been talking about
    impeachment from the beginning.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Hi.

  - michael barbaro  
    Hi.

  - rashida tlaib  
    How are you?

  - michael barbaro  
    I’m good.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Good.

  - michael barbaro  
    You look well.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Yeah. Today is something that I’ve been talking to my 14-year-old
    about, Adam. He’s so funny. Before he went to school, I had a
    conversation with him.

  - michael barbaro  
    What did you say?

  - rashida tlaib  
    Oh, just, you know, told you mommy is going to follow through on
    making sure the bully is not going to remain using the most powerful
    position in the world to his personal gain and personal profit. I
    want him to still believe that people have the power, and that the
    truth always prevails. And so I feel like this gets us closer to
    that.

  - michael barbaro  
    So a lot of the focus in this impeachment vote has been on the
    moderates who are putting themselves at political risk in taking
    this vote. I’m mindful that it was in January of this year that you
    came into office and pretty much immediately generated a little bit
    of news by calling for the impeachment of the president, long before
    Speaker Pelosi and many of the moderate Democrats were ready to take
    that action. I think I was actually here with you in the Capitol
    when that happened. And we had talked at that point about the fear
    that you and other progressive freshmen in the House might push the
    party to left in a way that could jeopardize those moderate
    colleagues. And now here we are, right? So I wonder what you make of
    that journey of the whole House Democratic delegation?

  - rashida tlaib  
    You know, I don’t like it when people say we’re moving folks to the
    left or moving folks to the right. We’re moving folks towards the
    truth. To me, that’s nonpartisan. The fact of the matter is
    something was wrong here. Children were being caged at the border.
    He was profiting off of being a sitting C.E.O. in the White House.
    There was a number of impeachable offenses before I even got here,
    and these are things that I was hearing from my residents all the
    time.

  - michael barbaro  
    But that’s not what today is about.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Oh, of course not. You know, one of the things I said after this
    happened, after, you know, the Ukraine call happened, is that that’s
    what got us to 218. I mean, look, I am not a person that pushed this
    opinion of what was happening from the White House onto my
    colleagues. That was not my intention. My intention was to serve the
    residents of the Thirteenth District. They elected me out of a
    number of candidates, saying that this is also about electing the
    jury that will hold this president accountable. And that’s exactly
    what I did from day one. For many of my colleagues, they didn’t run
    on this issue, right? But, I mean, the time has found us, as Speaker
    Pelosi kept saying. And it’s very true, I think many were very
    hesitant, but the Ukraine call took them over the edge, for many of
    these folks.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, let me talk about one of these districts, because earlier this
    week, Lisa and I went to Michigan, your state. We drove through your
    district on the way to the district of one of your colleagues,
    Elissa Slotkin, who flipped her seat from Republican to Democrat.
    And the threat to her seat and the anger of constituents who now
    know she’s going to be voting for impeachment, it was really
    apparent right away. There was a lot of fury directed at her.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Yeah, I mean, I think, Michael, it’s really important for folks to
    know Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin’s district is so different from
    mine.

  - michael barbaro  
    Right.

  - rashida tlaib  
    And she has to represent her district. I think for my residents and
    I, there’s a sense of liberation. They’ve been calling with
    excitement of finally some sense of accountability. I think when we
    see injustices, we see things that just don’t make any sense, we
    feel like it’s hurting the country, hurting people, that people are
    actually in true, real emotional pain from things around the racist
    abuse of power to even threats to our national security. It creates
    so much anxiety around the country. And for folks, they just want to
    feel like somebody is fighting for them. That somebody here has
    their back.

  - michael barbaro  
    This feels like a moment of that for them?

  - rashida tlaib  
    Yes. I think they want people to speak up. It’s like, why aren’t
    they saying anything? Why aren’t people doing anything about it?
    Isn’t that illegal? Shouldn’t those folks be in jail? You know,
    these are the kinds of things I hear from my residents all the time.
    So for today, it is very much an incredible moment that they finally
    feel a sense that they are believed. And so yeah, that’s the one
    thing. I respect that she has a different district than mine. I
    don’t impose my opinion onto her district, and I think she doesn’t
    do the same to mine.

  - michael barbaro  
    Let me create a picture for you and I want to know what you think of
    it. The House flips, Democrats lose it, the president is impeached,
    but just in the House, not in the Senate. Is it worth it? Is it
    worth it?

  - rashida tlaib  
    Yes\! Why isn’t it worth it? It is protecting our future. Do you
    know — if we always decided to function from political strategy, we
    wouldn’t get things done. Would the Affordable Care Act pass? It
    wasn’t perfect, but you know what? We actually saved lives. And some
    people couldn’t come back because they voted for that. But if we
    were to go back, do we want to do it all over again? Yeah, we would.
    We would, to save people’s lives. And for us, this is about saving
    our democracy. And sometimes that means putting our neck out. And
    yes, they’re going to use this against us and try to vilify what we
    tried to do, which is put our country first.

  - michael barbaro  
    Isn’t that easier to say when you’re from a —

  - rashida tlaib  
    Absolutely it is.

  - michael barbaro  
    — blue district?

  - rashida tlaib  
    But don’t think my life hasn’t been threatened. Don’t think that the
    first actual coffee hour I had, I didn’t have the same protesters
    that Elissa Slotkin had that said, impeach Rashida Tlaib. I have
    three people now getting prosecuted for threatening my life. You
    know, I feel like, in many ways, my life has completely been
    transformed because I will not stand down. I will not allow this
    corrupt president to abuse his power, nor put people in the pain
    that they are going through right now, because he decided to
    obstruct Congress. That he decided that he doesn’t really care about
    the process, and the rules, and the laws. You don’t take over the
    United States of America. You get elected, and you serve it. And so
    we’re going to served the United States of America today by holding
    this president accountable and setting a very clear message that we
    won’t allow this danger precedent in our history to continue.
    Because it could be a Democrat or a Republican down the line that
    would do the same and get away with it. And that, to me, is what is
    at stake more than being in the majority or winning an election.

  - michael barbaro  
    I know you have to go. I want to thank you for spending the last
    year with us.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Yes, of course. Thank you so much. It’s been an incredible journey.

  - michael barbaro  
    And letting us tell your story.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Thank you. Thank you, Michael. I’m speaking on the floor, so —

  - michael barbaro  
    Good luck with your speech.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Thank you.

  - michael barbaro  
    Bye.

  - rashida tlaib  
    Appreciate it.

  - archived recording (jerry nadler)  
    Madame Speaker, I now yield one minute to the gentlelady from
    Michigan, Miss Tlaib.

  - archived recording (diana degette)  
    The gentlelady is recognized for one minute.

  - archived recording (rashida tlaib)  
    Thank you. I rise today in support of impeachment.
    
    I learned so much every single day from my residents at home. Their
    common sense and understanding of what is right and wrong is
    centered on why they oppose any person using the most powerful
    position in the world for personal gain. Doing nothing here, Madame
    Speaker, is not an option. Looking away from these crimes against
    our country is not an option. This is about protecting the future of
    our nation and our democracy from corruption, abuse of power,
    criminal cover-ups and bribery. And this, Madame Speaker, this vote
    is also for my sons and the future of so many generations. So I urge
    my colleagues to please vote yes on these articles of impeachment.
    With that, Madame Speaker, I yield.

  - archived recording (diana degette)  
    Gentleman from Georgia.

  - archived recording (doug collins)  
    Thank you, Madame Speaker.

Shortly after 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday night, the House voted on the first
article of impeachment against President Trump — abuse of power.

  - archived recording (nancy pelosi)  
    On this vote, the yeas are 230, the nays are 197. Present is one.
    Article 1 is adopted.

Soon after, a vote was held on the second article of impeachment,
obstruction of Congress.

    On this vote, the yeas are 229, the nays are 198. Present is one.
    Article 2 is adopted.

With that, Donald J. Trump became the third president in American
history to be impeached by the House of Representatives.

    With today’s illegal, unconstitutional and partisan impeachment —

During a rally in Michigan as the House voted, President Trump described
the impeachment vote as an attack on his supporters and predicted that
it would backfire on Democrats at the polls.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    This lawless, partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for
    the Democrat party. Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks?

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Despite years of speculation, Mr. Trump’s impeachment did not, in the
end, grow out of the two-year investigation into Russian election
meddling by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, or the seemingly
endless series of other accusations of corruption and misconduct that
have plagued this White House: tax evasion, profiting from the
presidency, payoffs to a pornographic film actress and fraudulent
activities by his charitable foundation.

Instead, the existential threat to Mr. Trump’s presidency centered
around a half-hour phone call in July. On it, he [pressured Ukraine’s
president](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/trump-ukraine-whistleblower.html)
to announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden
Jr. and other Democrats at the same time he was withholding nearly $400
million in vital military assistance for the country and a White House
meeting.

Congress learned about the call after an anonymous C.I.A. official
lodged a whistle-blower complaint in August — pulling a string that
helped unravel an effort by the president and his allies to pressure a
foreign government for help in smearing a political rival. Over a period
of weeks this fall, [a parade of diplomats and other administration
officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/politics/trump-impeachment-hearing-testimony.html)
confirmed and expanded on those revelations.

When Congress sought to investigate, the president ordered his
administration to defy its every request, leading to what the House said
Wednesday was a violation of the separation of powers and a de facto
assertion by Mr. Trump that he was above the law.

United in their opposition, Republicans accused the Democrats, who
fought their way back from political oblivion in 2016 to win the House
in 2018, of misusing the power voters had invested in them to harangue a
president they never viewed as legitimate by manufacturing a case
against him. Though they conceded few of them, they insisted the facts
against Mr. Trump nonetheless fell woefully short of
impeachment.

“When all is said and done, when the history of this impeachment is
written, it will be said that my Washington Democrat friends couldn’t
bring themselves to work with Donald Trump, so they consoled themselves
instead by silencing the will of those who did, the American people,”
said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Throughout the inquiry, even as Republicans raged against the process
and sought to offer benign explanations for Mr. Trump’s conduct, none
disputed the central facts that served as its basis: that he asked
Ukraine’s president to “do us a favor” and investigate Mr. Biden, a
prospective rival in the 2020 campaign, and other Democrats.

Mr. Trump’s impeachment had the potential to change the trajectory of
his presidency and redefine an already volatile political landscape.
Democrats, including the most vulnerable moderates, embraced the
articles of impeachment with the full knowledge that doing so could
damage them politically, potentially even costing them control of the
House.

The only [Democratic
dissenters](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/how-democrats-voted-on-impeaching-trump.html)
from the abuse of power charge on Wednesday were Representatives Collin
C. Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, a freshman who
has announced that he will switch parties and become a Republican.
Representative Jared Golden of Maine, another centrist freshman, joined
them in opposition to the obstruction of Congress charge.

And Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a Democratic presidential
contender who has built her reputation as a maverick in her party,
[voted “present” on both
articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/elections/tulsi-gabbard-impeachment-vote.html).

Republicans tethered themselves to Mr. Trump, as they have since he took
office, yoking their political brands and fortunes to his.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The debate proceeded in historic terms in the well of the House, even as
an odd sense of inevitability hung over Washington about Mr. Trump’s
fate.

“Today, as speaker of the House, I solemnly and sadly open the debate on
the impeachment of the president of the United States,” [Ms.
Pelosi](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/nancy-pelosi.html),
dressed in all black, said as debate opened on the articles around noon.
“If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It is tragic
that the president’s reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He
gave us no choice.”

After the votes, Ms. Pelosi would not say when she would transmit the
articles to the Senate, indicating she might wait to do so until she got
certain assurances about the fairness of a trial. With Mr. Trump and his
allies interested in a speedy acquittal, Ms. Pelosi believes slowing the
process could force Senate Republicans to set procedures the Democrats
like, people close to her said.

Her comments at least raised the prospect that the House could leave for
the holidays with the matter unresolved and the timing of the trial in
limbo.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the Senate, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority
leader, has already made clear he [views the House’s case as “weak” and
would prefer a swift trial in
January](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/us/politics/mcconnell-white-house-impeachment-trial.html)
that does not call any additional fact witnesses. That would increase
the likelihood that Congress will simply never hear from several senior
government officials with knowledge of the Ukraine matter who avoided
House testimony.

Impeachment traces its origins to monarchical England, but the framers
of the Constitution confined its use on presidents to rare occasions,
when their actions corrupted the public interest for personal ones. Only
twice previously has the House impeached a president, Andrew Johnson in
1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. President Richard M. Nixon resigned in
1974 rather than face such a consequence.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Johnson remained in office by a single vote in 1868. Mr. Clinton more
soundly beat the charges, with no more than half of the Senate voting
for conviction after more than a month of deliberations. The trial of
Mr. Trump is likely to reach a similar outcome, but it could do so much
more quickly, with some Senate Republicans discussing the possibility
that the case could be resolved in little more than a
week.

As he did in the face of past accusations, Mr. Trump, 73, railed against
impeachment as a “witch hunt” and a “hoax,” attacking his adversaries
with a viciousness rarely heard from previous presidents.

“More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch
Trials,” the president seethed in an angry [impeachment eve letter to
Ms.
Pelosi](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/17/us/politics/trump-pelosi-letter.html).

In Mr. Trump’s reality, reinforced by the conservative cable news
programs that swirl around him throughout the day, his three years in
the White House have been more successful than any other. Wednesday’s
impeachment intrudes on that, forcing the president and those around him
to confront a different narrative, one in which he has — in the words of
the articles of impeachment — “betrayed the nation” and acted “in a
manner grossly incompatible with self governance and the rule of law.”

“Whether Donald Trump leaves in one month, one year or five years, this
impeachment is permanent,” said Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of
California. “It will follow him around for the rest of his life, and
history books will record it.”

The absolutist defense by many members of the Republican Party and the
partisan nature of Wednesday’s votes underscored the remarkable hold
that Mr. Trump, who has never commanded the support of a majority of the
nation, has come to have over the party, remaking it in his image.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One Republican, Representative Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, compared Mr.
Trump on Wednesday with Jesus Christ, saying that the son of God had
been “afforded more rights” by Pontius Pilate than Democrats had given
the president.

Democrats’ most fervent supporters have fantasized since Inauguration
Day 2017 about impeaching Mr. Trump, an extreme remedy for the ultimate
insurgent they believed was shredding American institutions in his
self-interest. The debate reached a new pitch this year when they
reclaimed control of the House after nearly a decade and awaited the
results of a two-year Justice Department investigation into whether Mr.
Trump’s campaign had conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016
election.

But as the left pushed harder for Mr. Trump’s ouster, Democratic leaders
resisted. “He’s just not worth it,” Ms. Pelosi said in March. The Russia
investigation fizzled when the [special counsel declined to recommend
charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/politics/mueller-special-counsel.html),
even though his report detailed at least 10 instances of possible
obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump when he tried to thwart the inquiry.
By the time lawmakers returned to Washington this fall after a summer
break, impeachment appeared all but dead.

Ms. Pelosi’s calculations — and public opinion — shifted abruptly in
September, when the C.IA. whistle-blower arrived on the House’s
doorstep.

The inquiry it prompted moved with alacrity, even as Democrats did not
have an independent counsel or special prosecutor on whose work they
could build. Instead, the House Intelligence Committee called senior
American diplomats and White House officials for questioning and
requested reams of documents.

In private and then in publicly televised hearings — and all in defiance
of White House orders — they outlined a wide-ranging attempt by Mr.
Trump and his allies to bend American policy on Ukraine toward carrying
out what one former White House official called “a domestic political
errand” on the president’s behalf.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Fueling the obstruction of Congress charge, a dozen more witnesses, some
with direct knowledge of Mr. Trump’s actions, were blocked from speaking
to investigators, and the Trump administration refused to produce a
single document under subpoena.

As the facts tumbled into the open, there were moments when Republicans
in the House and in the Senate flirted with casting their lot against
the president. After [the acting White House chief of staff said in
October that Mr. Trump had withheld military
aid](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html)
in part to extract at least one politically beneficial investigation
from Ukraine, Representative Francis Rooney of Florida said he was open
to impeachment. But on Wednesday, he joined every Republican in voting
no.

[Testimony in November by Gordon D.
Sondland](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/sondland-says-he-followed-trumps-orders-to-pressure-ukraine.html),
Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, that there had been a quid
pro quo around a White House meeting and maybe around the foreign aid
money prompted momentary fears of a mass defection. It did not
materialize.

If anything, the process underscored the extent to which the nation was
splitting in two, with each side claiming its own news sources and fact
sets that make meaningful debate between Democrats and Republicans over
the significance of president’s conduct almost impossible. Public
opinion polls show the nation is as closely divided over Mr. Trump’s
impeachment and removal as it was on Election Day 2016.

On Wednesday, neither lawmakers nor aides to Mr. Trump foresaw a
resolution to the broader fight.

“We know how this partisan process will end this evening,” said
Representative Will Hurd of Texas, one of a handful of Republicans
willing to criticize the president’s conduct and who is retiring from
Congress. “But what happens
tomorrow?”
