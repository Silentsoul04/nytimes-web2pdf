Congress}\label{trump-impeached-for-abuse-of-power-and-obstruction-of-congress}}

Voting nearly along party lines, the House approved two articles of
impeachment against President Trump, making him the third president in
history to face removal by the Senate.

WASHINGTON --- The House of Representatives on Wednesday
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html}{impeached
President Trum}p for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, making
him the third president in history to be charged with committing high
crimes and misdemeanors and face removal by the Senate.

On a day of constitutional consequence and raging partisan tension, the
votes on the two articles of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-01-16}{impeachment}
fell largely along party lines, after a bitter debate that stretched
into the evening and reflected the deep polarization gripping American
politics in the Trump era.

Only two Democrats opposed the article on abuse of power, which accused
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-01-15}{Mr.
Trump} of corruptly using the levers of government to solicit election
assistance from Ukraine in the form of investigations to discredit his
Democratic political rivals. Republicans were united in opposition. It
passed 230 to 197, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi gaveling the vote to a
close from the House rostrum.

On the second charge, obstruction of Congress, a third Democrat joined
Republicans in opposition. The vote was 229 to 198.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-01-16}{impeachment}
votes set the stage for a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/senate-impeachment-trial.html}{historic
trial beginning early next year} in the Senate, which will have final
say --- 10 months before Mr. Trump faces re-election --- on whether to
acquit the 45th president or convict and remove him from office. The
timing was uncertain, after Ms. Pelosi suggested late Wednesday that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/impeachment-trial.html}{she
might wait to send the articles to the Senate}, holding them out as
leverage in a negotiation on the terms of a trial.

\subsection{Impeachment Results: How Democrats and Republicans
Voted}\label{impeachment-results-how-democrats-and-republicans-voted}}

See how each House member voted on the articles of impeachment against
President Trump.

Acquittal in the Republican-controlled chamber may be likely, but the
proceeding is certain to further aggravate the political and cultural
fault lines in the country that Mr. Trump's presidency has brought into
dramatic relief. Regardless of the outcome, the impeachment votes in the
House put an indelible stain on Mr. Trump's presidency that cannot be
wiped from the public consciousness with a barrage of tweets or an angry
tirade in front of thousands of his cheering supporters at a campaign
rally.

On Wednesday,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/impeachment-democrats-votes.html}{Democrats
characterized his impeachment as an urgent action} to stop a corrupt
president whose misdeeds had unfolded in plain view from damaging the
United States any further.

``Over the course of the last three months, we have found
incontrovertible evidence that President Trump abused his power by
pressuring the newly elected president of Ukraine to announce an
investigation into President Trump's political rival,'' said
Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the
Intelligence Committee chairman, who led the impeachment inquiry.

``The president and his men plot on,'' Mr. Schiff said. ``The danger
persists. The risk is real. Our democracy is at peril.''

Far from showing contrition or contemplating resignation, as his
predecessors have done in the face of impeachment, Mr. Trump instead
offered an indignant defense as the House weighed his fate, raging on
Twitter from the White House.

``SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS,''
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1207355923573989376}{the
president wrote} as the debate took place on the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue. ``THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!''

Later, as members cast their votes to impeach him in Washington,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/Debbie-Dingell-husband.html}{Mr.
Trump took the stage to roars of adulation from his supporters} at an
arena-style campaign rally in Battle Creek, Mich. He brushed aside the
constitutional confrontation as a ``hoax'' based on unfounded charges,
even as he conceded that it would be a permanent blot on his presidency.

``I'm not worried,'' Mr. Trump said. ``You don't do anything wrong and
you get impeached. That may be a record that will last forever.''

``But you know what they have done?'' he said of Democrats. ``They have
cheapened the impeachment process.''

Senators, he added, ``are going to do the right thing.''

  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''

  Today: The United States House of Representatives has impeached
  President Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. My
  colleague Lisa Chow and I on the story of how a fractious Democratic
  Party, which started the year divided on impeachment, ultimately
  united around it.

  It's Thursday, December 19.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  And how far away from Holly?
\item
  speaker\\
  35 miles from the home.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  O.K. So yeah, we will get there in time. You want to describe what
  you're seeing outside the window?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So we're driving by a strip mall about 45 minutes outside Detroit.
  There's a Best Buy, a Michaels, a PetSmart, a Lowes, Chipotle and a
  DSW. This is a solid, solid, solid strip mall.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  So Michael, why are we driving through the strip malls of Detroit?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So we are headed to the home of Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin.
\item
  archived recording\\
  Elissa Slotkin has a lead of more than 2,000 votes against Republican
  incumbent Mike Bishop.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  She is a moderate Democrat who won her seat ---
\item
  archived recording (elissa slotkin)\\
  I won in a district that was a Republican district. So the only way
  ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  She flipped a red district and turned it blue in 2018. And in doing
  so, she helped the Democrats win back the House.
\item
  archived recording\\
  The blue wave. The blue wave that swept Democrats into power in the
  House.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  But the moment she gets into office ---
\item
  archived recording (rashida tlaib)\\
  Because we're going to go in there, we're going to impeach the
  motherfucker. {[}CHEERS{]}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  --- people like Rashida Tlaib, the congresswoman who represents a
  district just to the south here that we just drove through, they're
  saying that the findings of the Russia inquiry merit impeachment. And
  Slotkin is not having any of it.
\item
  archived recording\\
  Important quote. This is from Congresswoman Slotkin of Michigan.
  Impeachment is not what people are coming up to me in the grocery
  store and talking to me about. They want to know ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  She is skeptical of that, she's opposed to it. It's not part of her
  political brand to want to impeach the president. And then all of a
  sudden, the whistle-blower report comes out, and she reads it, and
  she's very troubled. And she and a handful of her moderate
  swing-district Democratic House colleagues write an op-ed in The
  Washington Post calling for an impeachment inquiry.
\item
  archived recording\\
  They write, we have devoted our lives to the service and security of
  our country. Now we join as a unified group to uphold ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  And their voice carries a tremendous amount of weight, because they
  are moderates, because they helped win back the House for Democrats.
  And shortly afterwards, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opens an
  impeachment inquiry.
\item
  archived recording (nancy pelosi)\\
  I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an
  official impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable.
  No one is above the law.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  And right away, it's clear that there are political consequences for
  Slotkin.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  I am going to wait for the facts. I'm going to look at them
  judiciously. I'm going to do what I was trained to do, which is to
  look at the ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  We went to three town halls in her district and just listened as
  constituents pelted her with questions about why she was doing this.
\item
  crowd\\
  {[}JEERING{]}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Two months go by. The impeachment inquiry unfolds. Hearings happen, a
  report is filed. And now she has to make a decision --- is she going
  to vote to impeach the president, or is she going to vote not to the
  impeach the president?
\item
  lisa chow\\
  Whoa, we're going into her driveway.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  We're doing it. I think it's O.K. I mean, we're a little early.
  What're you gonna do? We are arriving at Slotkin's house in the middle
  of these final hours of deliberation for her on impeachment. She has
  told her constituents that she's going to announce her decision on
  Monday morning. We are talking to her on Sunday night.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  How do you feel?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I feel good. I mean, I feel dehydrated. Did you actually eat your
  granola bar?
\item
  lisa chow\\
  I did not eat my granola bar. Hard to eat and hold a microphone.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  You're going to regret it when you're in the middle of this interview
  and you're starving.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Hi, guys. Come on in.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Hi.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  I'm Elissa.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Congresswoman, so nice to see you.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  So nice to meet you. Hi.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Thank you for letting us --- Lisa.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Come on in, come on in.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  This is a truly a farmhouse.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I think of you guys as audio, and so
  I'm not doing a very nice job, but this is 1895 farmhouse. My family
  bought it in the `50s. We held off lighting a fire because we didn't
  know if the noise would be annoying, but we can definitely light a
  fire.

  And this --- I should just say, this desk, for whatever it's worth, is
  sort of one of the big heirlooms in my family. This was my
  great-grandfather's desk. And if you see on the plate here ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  It is kind of a resolute desk.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Yes. So it was used by Lindley Garrison, secretary of war, 1913 to
  1916.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  During the presidency of Woodrow Wilson.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Yeah.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Geez.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  So that was a gift to my great-grandfather, Sam Slotkin. And it's been
  passed down.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Is this where you go to make big decisions?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  This is where I make my big decisions.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Is this that --- this three-ring binder looks like it's the House
  Intelligence report?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Yes. This is --- well, it's a lot, I guess, more than it. It is ---
  let's see. My team has diligently tabbed it out for me. So this is the
  impeachment documents that came down, I guess, what now, three weeks
  ago ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  From the Judiciary Committee.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Yes, from the Judiciary Committee. This is the HPSCI report, the House
  Intelligence report.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  May I see this?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  You're welcome to.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Clinton articles of impeachment. Nixon articles of impeachment. And I
  see you've done a bunch of underlining.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Yeah. For me, this is, frankly, a very standard way that I look at
  things, which just comes from my training as a C.I.A. officer, which
  is sequester yourself away, get all the original base documents. And
  then you do some historical research and then make an objective
  decision not based on what you see in the news or what someone's
  telling you.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Thanks for letting us interrupt it.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Where would you guys like to set up? Would you like to be ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Where would you like us to set up?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Take the dining room.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  All right, we'll go set ourselves up.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Sure.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  O.K., check, check, check, check.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  How am I sounding? O.K. So, Congresswoman, thank you for letting us
  into your home ---
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Of course.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  --- during a really important moment for you.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Yeah.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  The last time we talked to you, you had just made a decision to
  support an impeachment inquiry, which ended up being a very
  consequential decision.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Yeah.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Tell me what the last couple of months have been like for you as that
  inquiry has unfolded. What's that experience been like?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Well, I would say it's probably been some of the most intense months
  I've had as a working professional, that's for sure. The principal
  reason why I decided to come out back in September in support of an
  inquiry, after many, many months of not supporting impeachment or an
  inquiry, was this very basic idea that the president of the United
  States reached out to a foreign party and solicited help in
  influencing an American election. And confirming or denying that very
  basic idea was pretty important to me in this process.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  That fact pattern.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  That fact pattern. And you know, I was in national security for a long
  time. We are in the business of pressuring governments to do things
  that we want, right? That happens all the time. And anyone who gets to
  a senior-enough level has been in that position. The difference here
  was that the president was doing it for his own personal political
  gain, not for the national security interests of the United States. So
  for me, the central idea was whether the president asked for
  foreigners to get involved in the American political process.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So did the inquiry and did the hearings establish that?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Well, that's what I've been trying to parse through. What became
  clearer and clearer through what I read and what the reporting
  produced was that you have a lot of people who were aware that, for
  instance, security assistance was held up in exchange for something.
  And we have Ambassador Sondland saying very directly that it was held
  up because they were waiting for the Ukrainians to live up to their
  end of the bargain.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  To conduct these investigations on ---
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Yes, to announce investigations. That's the hardest thing for me about
  my peers who may decide not to vote on these articles, is that do they
  accept that it's O.K. to invite foreign help into the American
  political process?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I think I just watched Lindsey Graham say that he's O.K. with it in an
  interview.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Well, I'm sorry, and I think that history will show them to be
  misguided. And maybe it's because I was a C.I.A. officer, but I am
  comfortable making hard decisions that aren't popular, because I know
  that they're the right thing for the security of the country. I was
  asked to do that over and over and over again in my prior life. And
  that's the same approach I take to these decisions.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I hear you hinting that a hard decision that you're capable of making
  may be heading in one direction.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Well, listen, I mean, no offense, but I'm not going to tell The New
  York Times before I tell my own constituents. It's why we're having a
  big town hall tomorrow. My hope and my responsibility is to be
  transparent with the constituents of the Eighth District, to be
  available to listen to their current concerns and answer them, and to
  be honest with them.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So understanding that you're not going to be disclosing your
  intentions just now at this table in your house, I want to talk about
  your constituents for just a moment.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Sure.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Based on my understanding of your district, which voted for Trump by a
  healthy margin, and according to you, does not seem to support
  impeachment as a whole, you could find yourself very much at odds with
  your own constituents.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  I mean ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Are you comfortable with that?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  This is what it means to be an elected leader. You have to make tough
  calls. And in a district like this, I'm never going to make everyone
  happy. If I lose my seat because I stood up for my principles, that's
  O.K. I, of course, want to be re-elected, and I want to maintain the
  House majority. I think it's an important check and balance. But I'm
  not going to compromise my principles just to keep that job. I'm just
  not. And I hope that people want that kind of an elected
  representative.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I do have to ask you the kind of political version of this question,
  which is mathematically, your vote isn't required to impeach the
  president. And so there're kind of two ways to look at this. On the
  one hand, if you vote yes, that would be very politically risky. The
  other way to look at this is that if you vote no, that's its own set
  of risks, because as a moderate, you would be sending a message that
  the people in the middle who started all this, who said there should
  be an inquiry, don't think there's enough there to actually impeach.
  And that would be a very complicated message to send in 2020 when the
  president's running for re-election. It's essentially that impeachment
  was a project of the far left. And so there's basically a ton of risk
  no matter what you do, and I wonder how you weigh those risks.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Well, I mean, listen, voting on articles of impeachment is right up
  there with Congress's role in declaring war. I mean, it's got to be
  one of the top two things that a member of Congress will ever vote on
  in their career --- most important things. So when you have a vote
  like that, it's beyond that political calculus. I think it should be.
  It certainly is for me. And I've certainly had people propose to me,
  you know, just vote no, save your seat.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Your vote isn't needed, anyway.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  I've had people say that to me.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  And what do you say?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  I have to look at myself in the mirror. Like, I have to come away from
  this experience with a sense that I haven't done what so many people
  here in Michigan think of elected officials. I cannot just become that
  cynical political person who just orients their major decisions around
  what would save their seat. I just ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Or even their party.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  You know, we have the president admitting that he reached out to a
  foreigner to ask for help in an American political election. If you
  think about that outside the normal insanity that we have right now on
  TV and all the events that are happening, if you think about that,
  which I've been trying to do today here quietly at my farm, that is
  --- that is wrong. And I think that sending a signal in the most clear
  terms we can is important enough even to risk the majority.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So it's 7:30 on Sunday night and you're planning to make an
  announcement tomorrow morning in front of your constituents. How are
  you doing inside? How are you feeling?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  I actually feel pretty clear. I've done the work. I've kept an open
  mind, and I've sat with the documents, I've sat with the transcripts,
  and I've made my best assessment. So I'm going to try and be as
  present and available as I can. I trust my voters, I do. And I think
  ---
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Trust them to do what?
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  I trust them as Michiganders to give me a chance to explain. And for
  them to give me the benefit of the doubt.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I wish you the best of luck tomorrow.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Thank you. Thanks very much.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Thank you.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

We'll be right back

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  crowd\\
  Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elissa Slotkin has got to go! Hey hey, ho ho --- got
  to go! Hey hey, ho ho.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So Lisa, I headed back to New York to host the show. You stayed in
Michigan. So what happens the next day, after we had talked to Elissa
Slotkin?

lisa chow

So the next day, I arrive very early, and already there are people
there.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  crowd\\
  Ho ho, Elissa Slotkin has got to go!
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

And they're upset, they're pissed. And that's because Slotkin had
already announced her decision in the local paper that morning.

michael barbaro

Of course, we had both understood from the interview where this was
going.

lisa chow

Yes, but she hadn't yet told her constituents. And so in this op-ed, she
says very clearly that she is voting yes on both articles of
impeachment.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 1\\
  She must go now!
\item
  speaker 2\\
  Country over party! Impeach and remove Trump!
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

So people are lining up to get inside the auditorium where the town hall
meeting will be held. And outside, there was a bunch of protesters with
big signs saying, ``Impeach Slotkin, keep Trump,'' in bright red
letters. And some of them are carrying much smaller signs that say, ``We
have your back.''

michael barbaro

Which is a message to Slotkin.

lisa chow

Exactly.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 1\\
  Do you understand that?
\item
  speaker 2\\
  You're yelling.
\item
  speaker 1\\
  Do you like Russians?
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

I mean, very quickly, people start yelling at each other.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 1\\
  Because I have to talk over your people. Do you like Russia? Do you
  like Russia? Because I'm a veteran, and I do not support Russia!
\item
  speaker 2\\
  Have a discussion.
\item
  speaker 1\\
  The fact is you walked up to me and you asked me about Ukraine, which
  is a Russian ---
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

The one exchange that I found particularly memorable was this veteran
---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker 1\\
  You're standing here as an American, as an American, talking ---
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

The pro-Slotkin person who got very emotional. And she basically said,
you're spouting Russian talking points to me, to say that Ukraine
interfered in our election.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 1\\
  Our flag is red, white and blue, not red and blue. It is red, white,
  and blue. Put your country first for once, O.K.?
\item
  speaker 2\\
  I am. Would you like to discuss? See?
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

And so people are really challenging each other's patriotism.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 1\\
  What, what? Ukraine did what? What did Ukraine do? Tell me what
  Ukraine did.
\item
  speaker 2\\
  Are you gonna listen? Biden bragged about --- about bribing Ukraine
  with a billion dollars. Do you want to hear it?
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

They're just looking at the facts in a totally different way.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 2\\
  What crime? Name one. Name one crime. You jumped in, I'm listening.
  Name one crime.
\item
  speaker 3\\
  Abuse of power.
\item
  speaker 2\\
  That's not --- O.K., that --- name what exactly did he do to abuse ---
  to abuse power?

  Say one.
\item
  speaker 4\\
  Having a foreign country meddle in the election. That's one.
\item
  speaker 2\\
  He didn't! The Democrats did!
\item
  speaker 4\\
  You really are insane, aren't you? Open your eyes.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  O.K. So.
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

Finally, we head into the auditorium, and it's a large room.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  lisa chow\\
  People are registering, and then walking into the auditorium.
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

The room is packed.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  lisa chow\\
  How many chairs are here?
\item
  speaker\\
  418. So we set up for about 400 people.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  O.K. It's filling up.
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

There are tons of media, national and local press covering this event.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  lisa chow\\
  Can you tell me where you're from?
\item
  speaker 1\\
  The Flint Journal and mlive.com.
\item
  speaker 2\\
  MIRS news.
\item
  speaker 3\\
  I'm here for NPR today.
\item
  speaker 4\\
  Simone from Roll Call.
\item
  speaker 5\\
  The Detroit Free Press.
\item
  speaker 6\\
  The Oakland Press.
\item
  speaker 7\\
  Detroit News.
\item
  speaker 8\\
  The New York Times.
\item

\item
  speaker 11\\
  Associated Press.
\item
  speaker 12\\
  The Michigan Advance.
\item
  speaker 13\\
  CNN.
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

And it's clear that this is the story, which is moderate Democrats and
their vulnerability in this vote that they're taking.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  Let's please welcome to the stage Congresswoman Slotkin.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So what happens next?

lisa chow

She's introduced by one of her staffers, and she takes the stage.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  crowd\\
  {[}CHEERING AND JEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

Immediately, the crowd erupts in both cheers and boos.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  O.K., guys. O.K.
\item
  speaker\\
  All right, everybody. Thank you.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  O.K., well, I'm thrilled to see such a great turnout today.
\item
  speaker\\
  Let's please --- please let her speak.
\item
  crowd\\
  {[}YELLING{]}
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

And she basically can't get a word in.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  Let's please respect the people around you who are here to listen.
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

There is a very loud group in the corner of the room that is making it
almost impossible for her to be heard by the rest of the room.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  So in an attempt to be transparent, I'm going to walk you through my
  logic. And I know it's clear that we don't all agree. I thought we
  needed to let the election of 2020 decide what was going to happen in
  our country. But those changed --- that changed for me on the very
  basic facts that the president of the United States came out --- and
  his lawyer came out and said, very specifically ---
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

And they're screaming all sorts of things, like ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  Liar! Liar!
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

Liar, shame on you.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  And that is very different than how presidents typically build their
  power, right? To be honest with you, I worked at the National Security
  Council under George Bush. I worked under the National Security
  Council under Barack Obama. And presidents regularly wield their
  power.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So the Michiganders don't quite give her the chance to explain herself
that she told us she'd been hoping for.

lisa chow

Not really.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  They regularly leverage their position to influence other countries.
  That's a normal part of what a president does. But what was
  fundamentally different for me is that the president ---
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

And there's one guy in particular in the back ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  The Democrats are run by ``the squad``!
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

--- who screams ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  The Democrats are run by the squad!
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

--- you're part of the squad.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  Democrats are the party of the squad!
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

The squad runs the Democrats.

michael barbaro

Right, the four best-known House freshmen liberals.

lisa chow

Exactly. And at one point, he even gets up and yells ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  You belong to Rashida!
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

You belong to Rashida. And what's so fascinating about this moment is
that when we started reporting at the beginning of this year on the
freshman class of Democrats, it was exactly that conflation that people
like Elissa Slotkin were trying to avoid.

michael barbaro

Right.

lisa chow

Because they knew the Republicans would try to lump all the Democrats
together as Trump-hating left-wing progressives.

michael barbaro

Right. They would try to make a Slotkin and a Tlaib indistinguishable,
even though they're very different.

{[}music{]}

lisa chow

Exactly. And Slotkin has been so cautious in this process. She's been
thorough. She has had careful reasoning. But none of that matters in
this moment. She is Rashida Tlaib, according to those protesters.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker 1\\
  Do you stand for your party or do you stand for your Constitution?
\item
  speaker 2\\
  Let her say that. Let her say that. That she is not a part of the
  squad!
\item
  speaker 1\\
  She did!
\item
  speaker 2\\
  No, she should did not! She has to say! Let her say that! Let her say
  that!
\end{itemize}

lisa chow

I think that's exactly what gets under Slotkin's skin --- this feeling
of not being understood in the way that she understands herself. That no
matter what she says, no matter what she believes, a significant number
of her constituents are just going to see her as this kind of caricature
of a Democrat. And they're never going to agree with her, and she's not
going to be able to get through to them. You could tell from her voice
that maybe, you know, she expected this. Maybe this scene didn't
surprise her. But it's still hard.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  speaker\\
  All right, everyone. Thank you very much for coming out today. Please
  leave safely.
\item
  elissa slotkin\\
  Thank you. Thank you for listening. Appreciate it. Thank you for being
  good citizens.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  So the auditorium is cleared out. Now that's over. And I guess next,
  we're headed to Washington to cover the actual vote.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Did you bring water? Or did I just, like --- idiotically, I left my
  water on the other side of the Capitol. It's O.K. It's OK. It's OK.
\item
  lisa chow\\
  O.K. So Michael, where are we right now?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So we're in the U.S. Capitol, standing just outside the House chamber.
  You can kind of see it through these double doors. And inside that
  chamber ---
\item
  archived recording\\
  House will be in order.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  There's about six more hours of debate happening. A lot of it very
  predictable. Democrats are saying ---
\item
  archived recording\\
  No one is above the law.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  That after great care and lots of prayer ---
\item
  archived recording\\
  Today, sadly, we are voting to impeach President Donald John Trump.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  They're taking a principled vote to impeach the president. Republicans
  are saying ---
\item
  archived recording\\
  They hate this president.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- Democrats have made something out of absolutely nothing, and that
this is a sham.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  They think Hillary Clinton should be president, and they want to fix
  that.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And I'm kind of imagining Elissa Slotkin in there preparing for a
monumental vote that a lot of people in her district have just said they
don't want her to take. But there's actually somebody else and I have
been thinking about.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Congresswoman.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Hi, Michael. How's it going?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  And that's Rashida Tlaib. Because she has been talking about
  impeachment from the beginning.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Hi.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Hi.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  How are you?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I'm good.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Good.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  You look well.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Yeah. Today is something that I've been talking to my 14-year-old
  about, Adam. He's so funny. Before he went to school, I had a
  conversation with him.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  What did you say?
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Oh, just, you know, told you mommy is going to follow through on
  making sure the bully is not going to remain using the most powerful
  position in the world to his personal gain and personal profit. I want
  him to still believe that people have the power, and that the truth
  always prevails. And so I feel like this gets us closer to that.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So a lot of the focus in this impeachment vote has been on the
  moderates who are putting themselves at political risk in taking this
  vote. I'm mindful that it was in January of this year that you came
  into office and pretty much immediately generated a little bit of news
  by calling for the impeachment of the president, long before Speaker
  Pelosi and many of the moderate Democrats were ready to take that
  action. I think I was actually here with you in the Capitol when that
  happened. And we had talked at that point about the fear that you and
  other progressive freshmen in the House might push the party to left
  in a way that could jeopardize those moderate colleagues. And now here
  we are, right? So I wonder what you make of that journey of the whole
  House Democratic delegation?
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  You know, I don't like it when people say we're moving folks to the
  left or moving folks to the right. We're moving folks towards the
  truth. To me, that's nonpartisan. The fact of the matter is something
  was wrong here. Children were being caged at the border. He was
  profiting off of being a sitting C.E.O. in the White House. There was
  a number of impeachable offenses before I even got here, and these are
  things that I was hearing from my residents all the time.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  But that's not what today is about.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Oh, of course not. You know, one of the things I said after this
  happened, after, you know, the Ukraine call happened, is that that's
  what got us to 218. I mean, look, I am not a person that pushed this
  opinion of what was happening from the White House onto my colleagues.
  That was not my intention. My intention was to serve the residents of
  the Thirteenth District. They elected me out of a number of
  candidates, saying that this is also about electing the jury that will
  hold this president accountable. And that's exactly what I did from
  day one. For many of my colleagues, they didn't run on this issue,
  right? But, I mean, the time has found us, as Speaker Pelosi kept
  saying. And it's very true, I think many were very hesitant, but the
  Ukraine call took them over the edge, for many of these folks.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Well, let me talk about one of these districts, because earlier this
  week, Lisa and I went to Michigan, your state. We drove through your
  district on the way to the district of one of your colleagues, Elissa
  Slotkin, who flipped her seat from Republican to Democrat. And the
  threat to her seat and the anger of constituents who now know she's
  going to be voting for impeachment, it was really apparent right away.
  There was a lot of fury directed at her.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Yeah, I mean, I think, Michael, it's really important for folks to
  know Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin's district is so different from
  mine.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Right.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  And she has to represent her district. I think for my residents and I,
  there's a sense of liberation. They've been calling with excitement of
  finally some sense of accountability. I think when we see injustices,
  we see things that just don't make any sense, we feel like it's
  hurting the country, hurting people, that people are actually in true,
  real emotional pain from things around the racist abuse of power to
  even threats to our national security. It creates so much anxiety
  around the country. And for folks, they just want to feel like
  somebody is fighting for them. That somebody here has their back.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  This feels like a moment of that for them?
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Yes. I think they want people to speak up. It's like, why aren't they
  saying anything? Why aren't people doing anything about it? Isn't that
  illegal? Shouldn't those folks be in jail? You know, these are the
  kinds of things I hear from my residents all the time. So for today,
  it is very much an incredible moment that they finally feel a sense
  that they are believed. And so yeah, that's the one thing. I respect
  that she has a different district than mine. I don't impose my opinion
  onto her district, and I think she doesn't do the same to mine.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Let me create a picture for you and I want to know what you think of
  it. The House flips, Democrats lose it, the president is impeached,
  but just in the House, not in the Senate. Is it worth it? Is it worth
  it?
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Yes! Why isn't it worth it? It is protecting our future. Do you know
  --- if we always decided to function from political strategy, we
  wouldn't get things done. Would the Affordable Care Act pass? It
  wasn't perfect, but you know what? We actually saved lives. And some
  people couldn't come back because they voted for that. But if we were
  to go back, do we want to do it all over again? Yeah, we would. We
  would, to save people's lives. And for us, this is about saving our
  democracy. And sometimes that means putting our neck out. And yes,
  they're going to use this against us and try to vilify what we tried
  to do, which is put our country first.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Isn't that easier to say when you're from a ---
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Absolutely it is.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  --- blue district?
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  But don't think my life hasn't been threatened. Don't think that the
  first actual coffee hour I had, I didn't have the same protesters that
  Elissa Slotkin had that said, impeach Rashida Tlaib. I have three
  people now getting prosecuted for threatening my life. You know, I
  feel like, in many ways, my life has completely been transformed
  because I will not stand down. I will not allow this corrupt president
  to abuse his power, nor put people in the pain that they are going
  through right now, because he decided to obstruct Congress. That he
  decided that he doesn't really care about the process, and the rules,
  and the laws. You don't take over the United States of America. You
  get elected, and you serve it. And so we're going to served the United
  States of America today by holding this president accountable and
  setting a very clear message that we won't allow this danger precedent
  in our history to continue. Because it could be a Democrat or a
  Republican down the line that would do the same and get away with it.
  And that, to me, is what is at stake more than being in the majority
  or winning an election.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  I know you have to go. I want to thank you for spending the last year
  with us.
\item
  rashida tlaib\\
  Yes, of course. Thank you so much. It's been an incredible journey.

  Thank you. I rise today in support of impeachment.

  I learned so much every single day from my residents at home. Their
  common sense and understanding of what is right and wrong is centered
  on why they oppose any person using the most powerful position in the
  world for personal gain. Doing nothing here, Madame Speaker, is not an
  option. Looking away from these crimes against our country is not an
  option. This is about protecting the future of our nation and our
  democracy from corruption, abuse of power, criminal cover-ups and
  bribery. And this, Madame Speaker, this vote is also for my sons and
  the future of so many generations. So I urge my colleagues to please
  vote yes on these articles of impeachment. With that, Madame Speaker,
  I yield.

the impeachment vote as an attack on his supporters and predicted that
it would backfire on Democrats at the polls.

That's it for ``The Daily.'' I'm Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

Despite years of speculation, Mr. Trump's impeachment did not, in the
end, grow out of the two-year investigation into Russian election
meddling by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, or the seemingly
endless series of other accusations of corruption and misconduct that
have plagued this White House: tax evasion, profiting from the
presidency, payoffs to a pornographic film actress and fraudulent
activities by his charitable foundation.

Instead, the existential threat to Mr. Trump's presidency centered
around a half-hour phone call in July. On it, he
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/trump-ukraine-whistleblower.html}{pressured
Ukraine's president} to announce investigations into former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats at the same time he
was withholding nearly \$400 million in vital military assistance for
the country and a White House meeting.

Congress learned about the call after an anonymous C.I.A. official
lodged a whistle-blower complaint in August --- pulling a string that
helped unravel an effort by the president and his allies to pressure a
foreign government for help in smearing a political rival. Over a period
of weeks this fall,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/politics/trump-impeachment-hearing-testimony.html}{a
parade of diplomats and other administration officials} confirmed and
expanded on those revelations.

When Congress sought to investigate, the president ordered his
administration to defy its every request, leading to what the House said
Wednesday was a violation of the separation of powers and a de facto
assertion by Mr. Trump that he was above the law.

United in their opposition, Republicans accused the Democrats, who
fought their way back from political oblivion in 2016 to win the House
in 2018, of misusing the power voters had invested in them to harangue a
president they never viewed as legitimate by manufacturing a case
against him. Though they conceded few of them, they insisted the facts
against Mr. Trump nonetheless fell woefully short of impeachment.

``When all is said and done, when the history of this impeachment is
written, it will be said that my Washington Democrat friends couldn't
bring themselves to work with Donald Trump, so they consoled themselves
instead by silencing the will of those who did, the American people,''
said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina.

Throughout the inquiry, even as Republicans raged against the process
and sought to offer benign explanations for Mr. Trump's conduct, none
disputed the central facts that served as its basis: that he asked
Ukraine's president to ``do us a favor'' and investigate Mr. Biden, a
prospective rival in the 2020 campaign, and other Democrats.

Mr. Trump's impeachment had the potential to change the trajectory of
his presidency and redefine an already volatile political landscape.
Democrats, including the most vulnerable moderates, embraced the
articles of impeachment with the full knowledge that doing so could
damage them politically, potentially even costing them control of the
House.

The only
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/how-democrats-voted-on-impeaching-trump.html}{Democratic
dissenters} from the abuse of power charge on Wednesday were
Representatives Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New
Jersey, a freshman who has announced that he will switch parties and
become a Republican. Representative Jared Golden of Maine, another
centrist freshman, joined them in opposition to the obstruction of
Congress charge.

And Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a Democratic presidential
contender who has built her reputation as a maverick in her party,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/elections/tulsi-gabbard-impeachment-vote.html}{voted
``present'' on both articles}.

Republicans tethered themselves to Mr. Trump, as they have since he took
office, yoking their political brands and fortunes to his.

The debate proceeded in historic terms in the well of the House, even as
an odd sense of inevitability hung over Washington about Mr. Trump's
fate.

``Today, as speaker of the House, I solemnly and sadly open the debate
on the impeachment of the president of the United States,''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/nancy-pelosi.html}{Ms.
Pelosi}, dressed in all black, said as debate opened on the articles
around noon. ``If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty.
It is tragic that the president's reckless actions make impeachment
necessary. He gave us no choice.''

After the votes, Ms. Pelosi would not say when she would transmit the
articles to the Senate, indicating she might wait to do so until she got
certain assurances about the fairness of a trial. With Mr. Trump and his
allies interested in a speedy acquittal, Ms. Pelosi believes slowing the
process could force Senate Republicans to set procedures the Democrats
like, people close to her said.

Her comments at least raised the prospect that the House could leave for
the holidays with the matter unresolved and the timing of the trial in
limbo.

In the Senate, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority
leader, has already made clear he
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/us/politics/mcconnell-white-house-impeachment-trial.html}{views
the House's case as ``weak'' and would prefer a swift trial in January}
that does not call any additional fact witnesses. That would increase
the likelihood that Congress will simply never hear from several senior
government officials with knowledge of the Ukraine matter who avoided
House testimony.

Impeachment traces its origins to monarchical England, but the framers
of the Constitution confined its use on presidents to rare occasions,
when their actions corrupted the public interest for personal ones. Only
twice previously has the House impeached a president, Andrew Johnson in
1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. President Richard M. Nixon resigned in
1974 rather than face such a consequence.

Johnson remained in office by a single vote in 1868. Mr. Clinton more
soundly beat the charges, with no more than half of the Senate voting
for conviction after more than a month of deliberations. The trial of
Mr. Trump is likely to reach a similar outcome, but it could do so much
more quickly, with some Senate Republicans discussing the possibility
that the case could be resolved in little more than a week.

As he did in the face of past accusations, Mr. Trump, 73, railed against
impeachment as a ``witch hunt'' and a ``hoax,'' attacking his
adversaries with a viciousness rarely heard from previous presidents.

``More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch
Trials,'' the president seethed in an angry
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/17/us/politics/trump-pelosi-letter.html}{impeachment
eve letter to Ms. Pelosi}.

In Mr. Trump's reality, reinforced by the conservative cable news
programs that swirl around him throughout the day, his three years in
the White House have been more successful than any other. Wednesday's
impeachment intrudes on that, forcing the president and those around him
to confront a different narrative, one in which he has --- in the words
of the articles of impeachment --- ``betrayed the nation'' and acted
``in a manner grossly incompatible with self governance and the rule of
law.''

``Whether Donald Trump leaves in one month, one year or five years, this
impeachment is permanent,'' said Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of
California. ``It will follow him around for the rest of his life, and
history books will record it.''

The absolutist defense by many members of the Republican Party and the
partisan nature of Wednesday's votes underscored the remarkable hold
that Mr. Trump, who has never commanded the support of a majority of the
nation, has come to have over the party, remaking it in his image.

One Republican, Representative Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, compared Mr.
Trump on Wednesday with Jesus Christ, saying that the son of God had
been ``afforded more rights'' by Pontius Pilate than Democrats had given
the president.

Democrats' most fervent supporters have fantasized since Inauguration
Day 2017 about impeaching Mr. Trump, an extreme remedy for the ultimate
insurgent they believed was shredding American institutions in his
self-interest. The debate reached a new pitch this year when they
reclaimed control of the House after nearly a decade and awaited the
results of a two-year Justice Department investigation into whether Mr.
Trump's campaign had conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016
election.

But as the left pushed harder for Mr. Trump's ouster, Democratic leaders
resisted. ``He's just not worth it,'' Ms. Pelosi said in March. The
Russia investigation fizzled when the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/politics/mueller-special-counsel.html}{special
counsel declined to recommend charges}, even though his report detailed
at least 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump
when he tried to thwart the inquiry. By the time lawmakers returned to
Washington this fall after a summer break, impeachment appeared all but
dead.

Ms. Pelosi's calculations --- and public opinion --- shifted abruptly in
September, when the C.IA. whistle-blower arrived on the House's
doorstep.

The inquiry it prompted moved with alacrity, even as Democrats did not
have an independent counsel or special prosecutor on whose work they
could build. Instead, the House Intelligence Committee called senior
American diplomats and White House officials for questioning and
requested reams of documents.

In private and then in publicly televised hearings --- and all in
defiance of White House orders --- they outlined a wide-ranging attempt
by Mr. Trump and his allies to bend American policy on Ukraine toward
carrying out what one former White House official called ``a domestic
political errand'' on the president's behalf.

Fueling the obstruction of Congress charge, a dozen more witnesses, some
with direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's actions, were blocked from speaking
to investigators, and the Trump administration refused to produce a
single document under subpoena.

As the facts tumbled into the open, there were moments when Republicans
in the House and in the Senate flirted with casting their lot against
the president. After
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html}{the
acting White House chief of staff said in October that Mr. Trump had
withheld military aid} in part to extract at least one politically
beneficial investigation from Ukraine, Representative Francis Rooney of
Florida said he was open to impeachment. But on Wednesday, he joined
every Republican in voting no.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/sondland-says-he-followed-trumps-orders-to-pressure-ukraine.html}{Testimony
in November by Gordon D. Sondland}, Mr. Trump's ambassador to the
European Union, that there had been a quid pro quo around a White House
meeting and maybe around the foreign aid money prompted momentary fears
of a mass defection. It did not materialize.

If anything, the process underscored the extent to which the nation was
splitting in two, with each side claiming its own news sources and fact
sets that make meaningful debate between Democrats and Republicans over
the significance of president's conduct almost impossible. Public
opinion polls show the nation is as closely divided over Mr. Trump's
impeachment and removal as it was on Election Day 2016.

On Wednesday, neither lawmakers nor aides to Mr. Trump foresaw a
resolution to the broader fight.

``We know how this partisan process will end this evening,'' said
Representative Will Hurd of Texas, one of a handful of Republicans
willing to criticize the president's conduct and who is retiring from
Congress. ``But what happens tomorrow?''
