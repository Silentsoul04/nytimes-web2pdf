Last week in the studio where he tapes the “[Albasheer
Show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjxrFnMg_scE7fkw_Ip0_yA),” Ahmed
Albasheer put on a dark presidential hat and a jacket covered in an
absurd amount of medals and gold braid, and sat at his desk in an office
adorned with the seal of the president of the Republic of Albasheer.

The republic is his invention of course, but Iraqis know what he is
mocking. Mr. Albasheer, a 35-year-old journalist, fights for his country
with his sense of humor. He has a repertoire of slightly deranged
expressions and inspired comic timing, in Arabic (I’m told) and, more
surprisingly, in English — a language he didn’t really speak until
recently.

Since it began airing in 2014, Mr. Albasheer’s weekly show has become
one of the most popular shows in Iraq, airing on YouTube and satellite
television. In the past few weeks, the show has taken on new importance.
Thousands of young Iraqis are demonstrating, in ways the country has
never seen before. The “Albasheer Show” is deeply intertwined with the
protests. Mr. Albasheer exposes the workings of power in Iraq, covers
the protests and the government’s brutal response, exhorts the
protesters to stay peaceful, amplifies their voices and boosts their
morale. Some in Iraq believe the protests wouldn’t be happening without
him.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since Oct. 1, young people have been protesting in Baghdad and other
cities in southern Iraq, with thousands camped in Baghdad’s Tahrir
Square since Oct. 25.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Previous protests in Iraq were party-led and focused on electricity and
jobs. These are different — truly grass roots, leaderless, party-less,
uniting rich and poor, Sunni and Shiite, men and women. A protester and
blogger who goes by the name Hayder Hamzoz — he’s also organizer of the
Iraqi Network for Social Media, an association of bloggers and citizen
journalists — said that about a quarter of protesters during the day are
female.

The protests aim at the heart of Iraqi power, a system largely designed
by the American occupiers of Iraq in 2003. The system divides spoils and
patronage among various religious sects and political parties.

The protesters’ argument — also Mr. Albasheer’s argument — is that the
government creates these divisions to keep itself in power. So far, the
protests [have
toppled](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/world/middleeast/iraq-prime-minister-mahdi-resign.html)
the prime minister and led to the
[passage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/world/middleeast/iraq-election-law.html)
of a new election law. But there is no new prime minister, and it’s not
clear how the election law would actually work. Protesters also want a
new government and a new election under United Nations supervision. They
want Iran, the main foreign backer of the system, out. Their slogan is
“We want a country.”

So far, the Iraqi government has responded with extreme brutality and
acted with impunity. Security forces and masked gunmen have [killed more
than 500
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/world/middleeast/Iraq-protests-Iran.html),
wounded thousands more and kidnapped many others. Suha Oda, an Iraqi
journalist and activist on women’s issues, said that the government
targets women, “specifically kidnapping and killing female protesters,
to pressure families to prevent women from participating.” Ms. Oda said
— and everyone I talked to concurred — that among protesters there has
not been a single report of a sexual assault. “You are girls and boys in
the same place with cooperation, and no harassment,” Mr. Albasheer has
said on his show. “I am very proud. I am in love with that.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“All of our revolutions before were party-oriented,” said Zainab Salbi,
an Iraqi-American campaigner for women’s rights and peace. “This is the
first time it’s the people. They’re saying, ‘We’re Muslims, and we’re
done with the divisions.’ We are all shocked this has happened. My
father is 77, and he calls me crying, saying, ‘In all my life I’ve never
seen such a thing.’”

“You are strong because you have no leader,” Mr. Albasheer often says on
the show, speaking to the protesters. “This is the people’s voice. No
one can stop this at any moment. No one can claim he is the reason
people are out on the street.”

Tahrir Square has become its own city. The protesters have organized
security, cleaning, electrical repair, food, showers, toilets, a small
hospital, a radio station, a newspaper, civics classes, a library and
medical care, including psychotherapy. Protesters play music, shoot
videos and paint
[murals](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2019/nov/26/murals-of-baghdad-the-protest-art-in-pictures).
A big screen shows football games and YouTube videos — including, of
course, the “Albasheer Show.”

The show is an hour of Mr. Albasheer at his desk, mixed with video clips
and [original
songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXgT-hvf_1o&feature=youtu.be). He
mocks the Godlike deference accorded Iraq’s presidents, the country’s
corruption, the use of religion for political gain. When he did a show
in a [cleric’s
costume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ54rlGp4WM&feature=youtu.be)
(split into white on one side and black on the other to indicate
different religious affiliations), he gravely announced that since he
was now a cleric, he had to form his own militia.

The show begins with video of young Iraqis greeting the show and often
ends with Mr. Albasheer talking directly to the protesters. “He’ll say,
‘Wave if you can see me,’” Mr. Hamzoz said. “He can’t see us, of
course, but we’ll wave at him.”

In the protests’ first, most violent week, when [more than 100 people
were
killed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/iraq-abdul-mahdi-orders-probe-protester-deaths-191012152657389.html),
Mr. Albasheer told no jokes. “The first ones were a huge
responsibility,” he said. “I would show video of young men getting
killed by a sniper and start to cry.”

Now he is funny again. “We need to humiliate the politicians,” he said.
“You are killing us? We will make you a joke.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Albasheer is now shooting the show in New Haven, Conn., where he has
been on a fellowship at Yale. His crew of about 25 people work from a
country he asked me not to name. Half of them work uncredited because of
the danger.

Iraqis watch the show on satellite TV on Germany’s Deutsche Welle Arabic
channel. It repeats about once a day at different times to try to escape
government jamming. The show also has 3.8 million followers on YouTube.
It is, of course, in Arabic, but Mr. Albasheer also taped two short
programs in English (one [pretty
funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-KVPWXWlNk), one
[sober](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc0EOr_Rq_w)) to tell the world
about the protests. (He said that his income comes from the program and
from a company he owns that does other TV production.)

Mr. Albasheer’s model was Jon Stewart (he calls George Carlin his idol),
and the two have been compared. The comparison goes only so far. Mr.
Stewart’s programs were not jammed. Unlike Mr. Albasheer, Mr. Stewart
did not get daily death threats; has not had to flee his country; has
not seen his father, brother, best friend and countless other family
members and friends murdered; and has not been the victim of a suicide
bomber.

Mr. Albasheer was once an ordinary correspondent, anchor and talk-show
host at several of Iraq’s highly controlled TV news stations. Then, at a
poetry celebration for the Prophet Muhammad in 2011, a man burst in
wearing a suicide vest. “I looked him in the eye trying to explode
himself,” he said. “Those two seconds were very long seconds. I had time
to think: If I am dead now, who am I?”

He ran and found shelter behind a wall. But his best friend and several
other friends were killed.

He didn’t leave his house for the next six months. “I’m just sitting at
home getting fatter,” he said. “I was afraid of everything. I was
waiting for I don’t know what. Just to die, maybe.”

But he remembered his long two seconds thinking: Who am I? He made a
decision: He was someone who would say whatever he wanted.

He moved his family to Jordan, and while working as a journalist, he
tried comedy news. In 2014 he began the “Albasheer Show.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The show has fueled the protests by engaging young people with the core
structures of power in Iraq. Mr. Albasheer is not the only one to talk
about them, but because he’s funny, he’s the one whom people watch —
especially young people.

His decision to speak his mind earned him trust. “He became important
when he started to be very clear with his messages,” Mr. Hamzoz said.
“Before, he’d say, ‘There’s a militia group behind that,’ and make fun
of them. But he didn’t name it, or its leader.”

That changed three years ago, with the cleric episode. He began to name
people, even militia leaders. “It’s very difficult to say that — 100
percent to be killed or kidnapped,” Mr. Hamzoz said. “His show broke the
fear.”

The show also gives the protests more staying power. For people risking
bullets daily, it matters to know that the government cannot hide its
brutality. Just as important, protests last only as long as people feel
heroic and proud, and feel as if they’re making a difference — feelings
the show reinforces every week.

“Iraq is not going to change only with new ministers,” Mr. Albasheer
tells them. “The whole system must change. You will change Iraq.”
