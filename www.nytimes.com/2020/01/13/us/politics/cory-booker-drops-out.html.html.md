# Cory Booker’s Exit From 2020 Race Ends a Once-Promising Political Chapter

The New Jersey senator, who built his campaign around a message of
unity, was unable to catch on with substantial numbers of voters and
ended his quest before voting began.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For almost two decades, Senator [Cory
Booker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/cory-booker.html)
of New Jersey has been viewed as a future leader in the Democratic
Party, a former Rhodes scholar and Stanford football player who achieved
national prominence as mayor of
Newark.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

With a vibrant social media following and a Rolodex of influential
donors on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, he swept to election to the
Senate and gained a spot on the powerful Judiciary Committee. In 2016,
Hillary Clinton considered Mr. Booker as a potential running mate, and
last winter he took the step many Democrats had predicted, [announcing a
presidential
bid](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/cory-booker-2020.html)
built around a message of national unity.

But on Monday, that promise remained unfulfilled, as Mr. Booker ended
his campaign for the White House after nearly a year of grinding work on
the campaign trail that yielded only low-digit polling, lackluster
fund-raising and a surprising inability to electrify the broader
electorate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I got in this race to win, and I’ve always said I wouldn’t continue if
there was no longer a path to victory,” Mr. Booker said in a statement
to supporters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The departure of Mr. Booker, 50, from a crowded Democratic field,
heralded at the outset as the most diverse in history, leaves just one
African-American candidate, [Deval
Patrick](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/deval-patrick.html),
vying for the nomination, in a party where black voters are an essential
bloc of the Democratic base.

Mr. Booker often made his case for the presidency through his biography:
as a black man whose family had to overcome racist housing
discrimination in New Jersey, and as a mayor of a predominantly black
city who saw the harm caused by hard-line criminal justice laws.

Throughout his campaign, Mr. Booker cast a spotlight on his adopted home
city. He spoke of witnessing shootings on the same street corner where
he currently lived, and of lives of young men in Newark ruined over
low-level drug crimes like marijuana possession. He frequently said on
the debate stage and on the stump that he was the “only candidate who
lives in a low-income, black and brown community.”

Reforms he made in Newark, from schools to policing, framed the backbone
of his policies, though he was also criticized for lapses by the police
department and a controversial charter schools effort that did not lead
to immediate improvements.

He began his campaign last Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month,
with a clarion call for unity in a deeply polarized time. He was
unrelenting in his optimism and his push for love and healing,
a<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>message he stubbornly pushed
throughout the primary even as it consistently fell flat with voters
energized by a fervent dislike of President
Trump.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

And despite introducing notable policies on gun control, criminal
justice reform and the racial wealth gap, his candidacy lacked a
defining issue or position on the ideological spectrum in a contest
defined more by the divide between the progressive and moderate wings of
the Democratic Party.

But his campaign also suffered from factors beyond its control. In a
historically diverse field, Mr. Booker struggled for attention amid the
excitement of new candidates like Senator Kamala Harris of California,
who allowed voters to imagine a black woman as president, or Mayor [Pete
Buttigieg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/pete-buttigieg.html)
of South Bend, Ind., whose campaign as an openly gay man is also
historic.

Aspects of Mr. Booker’s political life that were advantages for decades
suddenly became less so. His broad fund-raising base of Wall Street
bankers, pharmaceutical executives and Silicon Valley billionaires had
become pariahs to many Democrats, who viewed the influence of big donors
as corrosive. Rivals like Senators [Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html)
and [Bernie
Sanders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html)
moved exclusively to small dollar fund-raising and sought to make that a
litmus test for the Democratic field.

The decision to drop out of the race came over the weekend, aides said,
with Mr. Booker huddling with top staff members as he wrestled with the
decision. On Sunday, he told his wider staff.

The decision to drop out largely came down to finances. Despite years of
relationships in the finance world of New York and the high-tech
corridors of California, Mr. Booker struggled to raise money throughout
2019. All told, he collected about $22.1 million — less than Mr.
Sanders, former vice president [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
or [Mr.
Buttigieg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/pete-buttigieg.html)
raised just in the fourth quarter.

Money was so tight that Mr. Booker had scheduled fund-raisers in the
final two-week sprint of his campaign in California and New Jersey — far
from the crucial battlegrounds of Iowa and New Hampshire.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Booker had not invested heavily in a digital donor program in
advance of his run, and he never successfully turned on the spigot of
small, grass-roots contributions as some of his rivals did. Entering
October, he had raised only $4.3 million from donations of less than
$200, less than the total haul, for instance, of Mr. Sanders in his
first 24 hours as a candidate.

Still, Mr. Booker had an enviable stable of more than 100 bundlers who
are now up for grabs, including the billionaire Donald Sussman, one of
the Democratic Party’s most generous donors.

In a final push to inch up in Iowa polling and make the January debate
stage, Mr. Booker’s campaign ran roughly $300,000 in television [ads in
Iowa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBybCrdTv_U) in the past two
weeks, a modest sum in a race dominated by the millions spent on the
airwaves by Mr. Steyer and former Mayor [Michael R.
Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/michael-bloomberg.html)
of New York. The ads pushed Mr. Booker’s advertising budget, and
campaign budget, to their limit.

After Mr. Booker [fell short of qualifying for a second consecutive
debate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/democratic-debate-lineup.html),
denying him the fund-raising boost that often accompanies the national
broadcast, his campaign was in a difficult position of trying to raise
money from traditional, in-person fund-raisers while also juggling his
Senate duties, including a looming impeachment trial. And without a
large war chest of campaign funds, Mr. Booker would not be able to air
television ads while he was stuck in Washington during impeachment,
putting him at a significant disadvantage compared with his well-funded
opponents.

“Our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up
and continue building a campaign that can win — money we don’t have, and
money that is harder to raise because I won’t be on the next debate
stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be
keeping me in Washington,” Mr. Booker told supporters on Monday.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So Mr. Booker will return to run for re-election in New Jersey, where he
still [enjoys favorable
ratings](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_nj_091919/).
The state leans decidedly Democratic and has not elected a Republican
senator in nearly 50 years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though the core of his presidential campaign was built on emotional
ideals, Mr. Booker focused heavily on policies that deeply affected
cities like Newark, where he was mayor for seven years. He pledged to
offer [sweeping clemency to thousands of nonviolent drug
offenders](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/booker-drugs-clemency.html),
and he pushed some of the other Democratic candidates to embrace more
aggressive stances on gun control, becoming the first candidate in the
field to propose a [national gun licensing
program](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/cory-booker-gun-control.html).

And he focused constantly on addressing the racial wealth gap, including
an economic proposal [known as baby
bonds](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/us/politics/cory-booker-2020-baby-bonds.html)
that would create a government-run savings account for every child born
in the United States.

Though his departure from the race is unlikely to have much of an effect
on other candidates’ polling, the Booker campaign was a leader in
endorsements in Iowa and New Hampshire and had a particularly notable
staff of Iowa organizers, setting up a likely scramble by the remaining
candidates to secure both endorsers and staff members in the early
nominating states.

Nearly all of the remaining Democratic candidates praised the campaign
Mr. Booker ran, and on Monday many shared photographs of Mr. Booker
offering them a hug or posing for a selfie with a voter. [Mr. Biden said
Mr. Booker](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1216758302421352451) had
“campaigned with joy and heart.” [Andrew
Yang](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/andrew-yang.html),
who formed a friendship with Mr. Booker on the campaign trail and
regularly exchanges text messages with the senator, said he would miss
seeing Mr. Booker (and his girlfriend, the actress and activist [Rosario
Dawson](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/us/politics/rosario-dawson-cory-booker-iowa.html))
on the trail.

“You’ve always been a powerful voice for justice and equality, and
you’ve made this primary stronger,”
[said](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1216760444951678977) Senator
[Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html)
of Massachusetts.

[In a video released
Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP6mNrhIBs8&feature=emb_logo),
which was backed by a gospel-like piano track and drumbeat and featured
a greatest-hits rundown of his message on the campaign trail, Mr. Booker
was upbeat until the end.

“So now I recommit myself to the work,” Mr. Booker said. “I can’t wait
to get back on the campaign trail and campaign as hard as I can for
whoever is the eventual nominee and for candidates up and down the
ballot.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Booker also showed a touch of humor on Monday. When a celebrity
gossip website published an article noting that Mr. Booker’s exit had
supporters mourning the loss of the possibility that Ms. Dawson would
become first lady, Mr. Booker responded on Twitter, his favorite medium.

“Have you been talking to my mom?” [he
said](https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/1216776260371828736).
