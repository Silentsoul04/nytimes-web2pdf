<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — Among the corporate titans recognized last week by
President Trump during a White House signing ceremony for his China
trade deal was Sanjay Mehrotra, the chief executive of Micron
Technology, whose Idaho semiconductor company is at the heart of Mr.
Trump’s trade war.

Micron, which makes memory chips for computers and smartphones, is
precisely the kind of advanced technology company that the Trump
administration views as crucial to maintaining a competitive edge over
China. After Micron rebuffed [a 2015 takeover attempt by a Chinese
state-owned
company](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/business/international/micron-technology-is-said-to-be-takeover-target-of-chinese-company.html),
it watched with disbelief as its innovations were [stolen and copied by
a Chinese
competitor](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html)
and its business was blocked from China.

China’s treatment of American companies like Micron fed Mr. Trump’s
decision to unleash a punishing trade war with the world’s
second-largest economy, a fight he said would halt Beijing’s use of
unfair practices to undermine the United States. But that two-year
conflagration may wind up being more damaging to American technology
companies.

The initial trade deal announced last week should make operating in
China easier for companies like Micron. The deal contains provisions
meant to protect American technology and trade secrets and allow
companies to challenge China on accusations of theft, including older
cases like Micron’s that precede the agreement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade approach has also accelerated a
technology arms race between the two countries, putting American
companies like Micron at risk as the two nations try to [decouple their
economies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/us-china-tariffs.html).
In an effort to reduce its reliance on American components, China has
expedited efforts to produce its own semiconductors, driverless cars,
artificial intelligence and other technologies. Those efforts, along
with the Trump administration’s [desire to restrict the sales of
American tech
products](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/business/trump-technology-china-trade.html)
to China, could hurt the very companies Mr. Trump set out to protect.

“Let’s be clear, the trade war has been very bad for the semiconductor
industry in several ways,” said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the
Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank funded by
the tech industry. “It’s like China woke up and said, ‘We’ve relied too
much on the United States.’”

The trade deal does nothing to curtail China’s use of subsidies,
industrial plans and state-owned companies, which have helped it build
formidable industries in steel, wind turbines and solar panels. Those
state-directed efforts, which put many American manufacturers out of
business, are now being harnessed for high-tech industries.

The Trump administration is constructing its own walls around American
technology, reducing access to the lucrative Chinese market out of
security concerns. It is restricting exports of sensitive technologies,
[barring sales to certain Chinese
companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/politics/us-to-blacklist-28-chinese-entities-over-abuses-in-xinjiang.html)
and [blocking Chinese entities from
investing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/21/us/politics/china-investment-trade-war.html)
in the United States.

The administration is considering further restricting sales to Huawei,
the Chinese telecom company that relies on components from Micron and
other American suppliers. And the China trade deal [leaves tariffs on
more than $360
billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/business/economy/us-china-trade-deal.html)
in Chinese goods in place as Mr. Trump tries to push American companies
to bring manufacturing back home.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Semiconductor sales to China, which represent more than half the global
chip demand, have fallen, and semiconductor stocks have been [whipsawed
by the trade
war](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/business/dealbook/semiconductor-stocks-trade-war.html).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump and his supporters say that conflict is no longer avoidable,
and that the president’s unconventional approach is necessary to take on
a growing threat from China. Officials across the administration look
with suspicion on Chinese industrial plans, including Made in China
2025, which [called for $300 billion in financing and other
support](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/business/china-trade-manufacturing-europe.html)
for 10 advanced industries, including semiconductors.

American officials worry that gaining an advantage in semiconductors
would give China both a commercial and military edge.

Chips, which serve as the tiny sensors, brains and memories of all
high-tech devices, are crucial to next-generation telecom networks,
supercomputers, artificial intelligence and driverless cars, as well as
military ships, satellites and aircraft. They are also one of the United
States’ largest exports, along with airplanes, oil and cars.

While China’s ability to make chips is still far behind the United
States’, the Chinese government, its state-owned enterprises, and
provincial and private equity funds have been pumping billions of
dollars into the industry, particularly the kind of memory chips that
Micron makes. In areas where Chinese companies cannot develop or buy
technology, companies say, some will simply steal their intellectual
property.

For the Trump administration, which was looking for a fight with China,
Micron’s story proved a formative one. As officials prepared an
[investigation](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/section-301-china/investigation)
into Chinese intellectual property theft that would ultimately spiral
into the trade war, Micron provided a “camera ready” case that fit
everything the administration was looking for, one industry executive
said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2015, Micron was the target of [a $23 billion takeover
attempt](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/business/international/micron-technology-is-said-to-be-takeover-target-of-chinese-company.html)
by a Chinese state-owned company, but the overture was withdrawn over
United States national security concerns. In 2016, another Chinese
state-owned company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit,[allegedly worked
in
concert](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html)
with a Taiwanese company to steal the American company’s designs and
market them as their own.

According to Taiwanese authorities, Fujian Jinhua used Micron’s
proprietary designs to build an enormous $5.7 billion microchip factory
in China. In 2018, the Department of Justice [charged the Chinese
company and
others](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-china-espionage/u-s-indicts-chinese-taiwan-firms-for-targeting-micron-trade-secrets-idUSKCN1N65R2)
with stealing trade secrets from Micron, and the Commerce Department
[blacklisted
it](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/us/politics/fujian-jinhua-china-sales.html)
for national security concerns.

The same year, a Chinese court [temporarily
blocked](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-micron-tech-stocks/china-court-bans-micron-chip-sales-in-patent-case-taiwans-umc-idUSKBN1JT2DL)
Micron from selling some products in China, after Fujian Jinhua and
another company accused Micron of patent
infringement.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Through 2017 and 2018, Micron employees met repeatedly with
administration officials, sometimes with the National Security Council
and National Economic Council. The company’s case was discussed in
internal planning meetings attended by Robert Lighthizer, the United
States trade representative, and Peter Navarro, a top Trump trade
adviser.

In July of last year, Mr. Trump met at the White House with Mr. Mehrotra
of Micron, as well as the chiefs of Intel, Google and Broadcom, to
discuss the trade clash with China and the administration’s policies
toward Huawei.

Two months later, in an address to the United Nations, Mr. Trump
described the Micron theft as a rationale for the trade war.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“To advance the Chinese government’s five-year economic plan, a company
owned by the Chinese state allegedly stole Micron’s designs, valued at
up to $8.7 billion,” the president said. “Soon, the Chinese company
obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned
from selling its own goods in China. But we are seeking justice.”

“For years, these abuses were tolerated, ignored or even encouraged,”
Mr. Trump added. “But as far as America is concerned, those days are
over.”

Chip makers initially supported the Trump administration’s willingness
to take on China. Companies had long grumbled about intellectual
property theft and unfair treatment in the Chinese market, but they had
little recourse: Going public about their troubles could spook investors
and invite Chinese retaliation.

Then, in April 2018, the administration [announced $50 billion in
tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/politics/white-house-chinese-imports-tariffs.html)
that would directly hit semiconductor companies by raising prices for
imported equipment and materials. A chip finished in China would be
subject to a 25 percent tariff, even if its components had been made in
America.

The tariffs caught the industry by surprise. The Semiconductor Industry
Association, a trade group, pushed back, [telling the United States
trade representative in
July 2018](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Final-_SIA_Submission_on_301_Tariffs.pdf)
that the tariffs would “undermine U.S. technological leadership, cost
jobs, and adversely impact U.S. consumers of semiconductor products and
the U.S. semiconductor producers.”

Some industry executives grew more nervous as Mr. Trump escalated his
trade fight and the prospect of an economic rupture between the United
States and China became more real. Chinese customers shifted their
purchases to suppliers in South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere.

Mr. Trump’s trade pact did ink some victories — it includes greater
protections for companies like Micron, including preliminary injunctions
and expanded legal recourse for theft of trade secrets. It also contains
new promises from China to refrain from pressuring American businesses
to transfer their technology to Chinese companies, and it allows
American companies to sue individuals, including former employees and
hackers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Semiconductor companies said they would press the administration to make
more gains in the next phase of negotiations, including subsidies, which
Mr. Trump said he plans to address. Just getting China to acknowledge
and agree to forgo unfair practices was progress, they said.

In a statement, Micron said it applauded the deal. “We look forward to
additional discussions between the countries on significant issues that
are important to Micron and the semiconductor industry, such as
intellectual property protection and subsidies,” said Jon Hoganson,
Micron’s managing director of global government affairs.

But the fight has spilled over into more damaging areas. Last May, the
Commerce Department placed Huawei, which makes handsets and telecom
equipment, [on a national security
blacklist](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/technology/huawei-ban-president-trump.html)
that bans it from buying some American products. Other Chinese
technology companies [were added to the
list](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/politics/us-to-blacklist-28-chinese-entities-over-abuses-in-xinjiang.html),
and the government began planning which types of advanced technologies
[it would no longer allow companies to export
overseas](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/business/trump-technology-china-trade.html).

Micron had so far experienced limited effect from Mr. Trump’s tariffs
since it does not ship the products it makes in China to the United
States. But Huawei’s blacklisting was potentially devastating — 13
percent of Micron’s chip sales are to the Chinese company.

In its fourth-quarter earnings call with investors last September,
Micron warned that the clash could damage its bottom line.

“We see ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade negotiations.
If the Entity List restrictions against Huawei continue and we are
unable to get licenses, we could see a worsening decline in our sales to
Huawei over the coming quarters,” Mr. Mehrotra said. Micron’s stock sank
11 percent after his remarks.

Micron, Intel and other companies with global operations initially
[found a way to keep
selling](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/technology/huawei-trump-ban-technology.html)
to Huawei since the rule did not restrict products containing less than
25 percent of certain types of American content. But the Commerce
Department is considering lowering that threshold and expanding the
number of goods subject to the ban, according to five people with
knowledge of the plan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like other Chinese companies, Huawei has worked to curtail its
dependence on America. By substituting parts from Japan and other
countries, the company has recently produced handsets and telecom
equipment that do not contain any American components.

Its internal semiconductor unit, HiSilicon, has also developed
replacements for advanced chips that Huawei once bought from American
companies. Huawei said its 2019 sales topped $120 billion, representing
18 percent growth over the year before — less than its initial target,
but not by
much.

American companies say they are sympathetic to the administration’s
complaints about China. But they must compete globally, and they are not
willing to forgo access to China, the hub of the global electronics
supply chain and probably one of the world’s fastest growing markets for
decades to come.

Jim McGregor, the chairman of Greater China for APCO Worldwide, said the
trade war and other restrictions were already shaping investment
decisions by American technology companies. When deciding where to put
their money next, many companies have quietly been looking to invest
outside the United States to secure access to China.

“You’ve got to be there, no matter what the president says,” he said.
