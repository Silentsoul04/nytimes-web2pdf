**Name:** Evan Mock

**Age:** 22

**Hometown:** Haleiwa, on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii.

**Now Lives:** In Oahu with his family and in New York City, in a
two-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side that he shares with a
friend.

**Claim to Fame:** First known as a surfer and skater with a daredevil
streak, Mr. Mock became a catwalk regular last year when he modeled in
shows for Louis Vuitton and Alyx. He has since graduated to
[influencer](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/vidcon-social-media-influencers.html)
status, as evidenced by his sizable
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/evanmock) following and paid
invitations to attend buzzy happenings. **** This season he was front
row at Prada, Off-White, Dior, Loewe and Lanvin, and attended parties
for a new Ugg shoe and GQ magazine. ‚ÄúI never in my life had the
opportunity to go to events and get paid for it,‚Äù Mr. Mock said. ‚ÄúHow
ridiculous is that? It‚Äôs such a funny thing, like, you want me there
that bad?‚Äù

**Big Break:** About a year ago, Mr. Mock went skating in Oahu with the
artist Tom Sachs, whom he met through mutual surfing friends. Mr. Sachs
took a shine to Mr. Mock‚Äôs new neon-pink buzz cut and asked if he could
shoot a quick video for his friend Frank, who had a similar hairstyle.
Turns out, he was referring to Frank Ocean. The next morning, Mr. Ocean
[posted the video on his
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsNW-ZSFrbK/) with a üëã emoji
followed by ‚Äú@evanmock.‚Äù The video has been viewed more than 2.3 million
times, and Mr. Mock‚Äôs social media following took off.

**Latest Project:** Mr. Mock‚Äôs nascent modeling career may pay the bills
(he recently appeared in ad campaigns for Aldo and [Paco
Rabanne](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzeRAzPD8bD/) fragrances), but he‚Äôs
not limiting himself to being just another pretty face. Last year, he
started a direct-to-consumer streetwear label called [Sorry in
Advance](https://sorryinadvance.co/). And he was hired by Saint Laurent
to cast, photograph and direct an advertisement for the [brand‚Äôs
skate-inspired Venice
sneaker](https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/saint-laurent-venice-sneaker-lookbook-uk).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Next Thing:** He is collaborating with [Drew
House](https://thehouseofdrew.com/), Justin Bieber‚Äôs smiley-face
streetwear line, on a collection timed for Coachella. He is also looking
to organize his photography into a book. ‚ÄúI just want to put something
out there, for people to see, because there‚Äôs so much that‚Äôs been going
on in my life,‚Äù Mr. Mock said. ‚ÄúLike a photo journal.‚Äù

**Clothes Horse:** Mr. Mock has an eye for fashion, long before he
became a model. ‚ÄúI used to think skinny jeans were sick, so I was buying
women‚Äôs jeans from Ross because I couldn‚Äôt find any men‚Äôs jeans that
were tight enough,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow I like them baggy.‚Äù He‚Äôs also fine
with going shirtless. ‚ÄúIn my most natural form, I‚Äôd be wearing, like,
board shorts, house slippers and no shirt, walking around at the
supermarket.‚Äù
