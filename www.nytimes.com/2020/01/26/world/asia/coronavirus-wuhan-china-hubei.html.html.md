# As Coronavirus Fears Intensify, Effectiveness of Quarantines Is Questioned

</div>

Amid news the coronavirus is spreading at an accelerating rate, concern
is growing that China’s lockdown of cities may not only have come too
late but could even make the situation worse.

WUHAN, China — A top Chinese health official warned on Sunday that the
[spread of the dangerous new
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html),
already extraordinarily rapid, is accelerating further, deepening global
fears about an illness that has sickened more than 2,700 people
worldwide and killed at least 80 people in China.

The grim diagnosis came amid concerns that China’s efforts to contain
the spread of the disease, despite a [lockdown of unprecedented
scope](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html)
affecting 56 million people, may not only have come too late but could
even make the situation worse, including by exacerbating shortages of
medical supplies.

Adding to the [growing global
alarm](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html),
people who are carrying the virus but not showing symptoms may still be
able to infect others, according to the Chinese official, Ma Xiaowei,
the director of China’s National Health Commission. Such asymptomatic
transmissions would make the disease much more difficult to control, as
seemingly healthy people travel and interact with others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The epidemic is now entering a more serious and complex period,” Mr. Ma
said during a Sunday news conference in Beijing. “It looks like it will
continue for some time, and the number of cases may increase.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China’s attempts to curb the disease’s spread — essentially cordoning
off the major cities in the province of
[Hubei](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/world/asia/china-floods-rain.html),
including its capital, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people — are a
“public health experiment, the scale of which has not been done
before,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at
Vanderbilt University. “Logistically, it’s stunning, and it was done so
quickly.”

Whether the lockdowns will succeed in stemming the spread of the virus
is a matter of debate by experts in public health and epidemiology. Some
said the lockdowns would help, at least in theory.

“Anything that is done that increases social distancing can help
decrease the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “If you do
it right, it’s not impossible it will have positive impact.”

But doing it right at this scale has never been tried before anywhere in
the world.

“To put a ring around cities of this size and population is
unprecedented,” said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of the history of
medicine at the University of Michigan and author of the book
“Quarantine.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Maintaining the lockdown will pose tremendous challenges, starting with
the provision of food, fuel and medical care to millions of people.
“It’s enormously difficult to do effectively, and also difficult to
assess the effectiveness,” said Dr. Schaffner.

Other experts were skeptical that the travel restrictions would prove at
all effective because they had probably come too late and the barriers
would prove too permeable. Five million people had left Wuhan before
travel out of the city was restricted, said the city’s mayor, Zhou
Xianwang. It was a stunning disclosure that intensified questions about
the government’s delayed response.

“You can’t board up a germ. A novel infection will spread,” said
Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and
director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on
National and Global Health Law. “It will get out; it always
does.”

In China, it was a weekend of grim new warnings about the
little-understood virus and a rising tally of infections and deaths. The
official number of confirmed infections across China jumped
significantly within a span of 24 hours, building to 2,744 by Monday
from around 1,975 the day
before.

## Wuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak

The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number
of other countries.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Among the most recent announced fatalities from the coronavirus was an
88-year-old man in Shanghai — the first death to be reported in the
commercial hub, and one likely to fuel anxieties about the disease’s
spread.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New cases cropped up in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Orange County, Calif.,
bringing to five the number of confirmed cases in the United States. The
virus had already been found in Thailand, France, Japan, South Korea,
Australia and beyond.

[Epidemiologists at Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)estimated
that each case infected an average of between 1.5 and 3.5 other people
in the early stages of the crisis. For seasonal flu, it’s about 1.3.

That number could drop as the authorities take more stringent measures
to halt the spread. But if it holds up, the number of infected could
rise sharply.

In Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, the streets were
eerily quiet as the authorities had ordered people not to drive, forcing
some to walk to hospitals. Mr. Zhou, the mayor, said that health
officials were likely to confirm an additional 1,000 cases of the
illness in the city. He said that the estimate was based on the
assumption that around half of the city’s nearly 3,000 suspected cases
of the coronavirus would eventually test positive.

China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has promised drastic measures to contain
the virus.

In a signal of the gravity of the crisis, and its likely disruption to
China’s short-term growth, the [government announced on
Monday](https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2020-01-27/doc-iihnzahk6491235.shtml)
that the annual weeklong Lunar New Year Holiday would be extended. For
now, at least, many workers will get another three days off, and go back
to work on Feb. 3.

Even before that notice, Suzhou, a big manufacturing hub in eastern
China, declared that factories there should not start back at work any
earlier than Feb. 8.

The national government on Sunday also banned the wildlife trade until
the epidemic passes. The outbreak had drawn fresh attention [to China’s
animal
markets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html),
where the sale of exotic creatures has been linked to epidemiological
risks.

In Hong Kong — which was badly hit by the SARS coronavirus in 2003, with
nearly 300 deaths, more than any city in the world — worries about the
spread of infectious diseases run deep. On Sunday, the government said
it would bar residents of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan, and
people who had been to the province in the past 14 days from entering
Hong Kong until further
notice.

Six cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in the city,
already hobbled by months of antigovernment protests.

Health officials in the United States, in what could turn out to be a
positive development in stemming the disease, said there was no “clear
evidence” that asymptomatic transmissions of the disease were happening.

“We at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t have any
clear evidence of patients’ being infectious before symptom onset,” Dr.
Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory
Diseases said at a news briefing on Sunday. “We are actively
investigating that possibility.”

Some global health experts said China’s focus, and resources, going
forward should not be devoted to closing off cities.

Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease
Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, thought China’s
approach to the crisis could easily “backfire,” comparing it to the
so-called cordons sanitaires that were imposed to seal off swaths of
West Africa during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. Those cordons left
people starving and spurred violent uprisings. Others routinely found
ways to sneak around or through the boundaries.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It was a disaster,” Dr. Osterholm said.

Dr. Tom Inglesby, an infectious diseases specialist and director of the
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also expressed
concern.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“If you continue to quarantine more and more places in China, you’re
going to start to really break normal societal interaction, normal
movement of goods and people and medical supplies and food and
medicine,” Dr. Inglesby said. “At a macro level, it seems to me that
it’s more likely to be harmful than helpful in controlling the
epidemic.”

Instead, Dr. Inglesby, Dr. Osterholm and other health experts suggested
China should concentrate on traditional public health measures that have
stopped other outbreaks, like identifying and monitoring contacts and
making sure medical care is available to everyone.

Even as the highest echelons of China’s government mobilize to fight the
illness, much of the task of preventing contagion still falls on local
officials, who can be unsure of how to respond to crises and uneven
about following through on policies.

On Sunday in Wuhan, for example, police officers were flummoxed by new
restrictions on driving within the city limits.

First, the city authorities said that most cars [should stay off the
roads](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?src=11&timestamp=1580035588&ver=2120&signature=SxuKbIMYjrZ4tw2dH2Sf-41vvxx9SlwFgJfynxcr6wjvcfvE4FyGoNh50zGorYJ7JeaFWmsNZELIGwOekOTIi98jPNkDdjwEKebM*JE3TAIdS17Ax5-oi0gQ14Fa6mYW&new=1),
and that a fleet of 6,000 taxis [would be on
call](http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2020/01-26/9069778.shtml) to deliver
food and medicine. Then, the authorities said drivers would be [notified
by text
message](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1656737257191494058&wfr=spider&for=pc)
if they had to stay off the roads. Nobody seemed to receive the text
messages on Sunday.

“My understanding,” one police officer said, “is that you can drive in
your district if you don’t get a text message telling you that you
can’t. But you should check that with the transport authorities.”

In the end, most drivers stayed off the streets. But as the day went on,
more ventured out, and the police did not seem to do much about it.

For some residents, it was another exasperating fumble by Wuhan
officials, who many believe have mishandled the
epidemic.

Health experts said the government’s ability to keep the trust of the
public was a key element in any successful quarantine, and never easy to
do.

Dr. Inglesby said that previous, much smaller scale lockdown efforts —
including closing off the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong
during the SARS outbreak 17 years ago — show that residents may become
fearful and lose confidence in the government.

“You need people to willingly present themselves for diagnosis,” he
said. “If they don’t understand what the government’s doing or they feel
in some way their bond with the government has been broken, that’s
another key process that’s being interrupted by the quarantine.”

For now, in Wuhan, the restrictions seem to be mostly accepted with the
same stoic fortitude that many residents showed over the past several
days as the city imposed bans on outbound travel for all but a select
few.

That mood could shift, however, if, for example, food prices rise.

“Now is not the time for recriminations,” said Li Xiandu, a retired
business manager. “The local government wasn’t forthcoming with
information and didn’t take vigorous enough measures. But we need to get
through this first, and then we can assign blame.”

While the government has pledged to build at least two new hospitals
with thousands of beds in Wuhan — and to do so in[just a few
days](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
— the city’s existing hospitals remain intensely crowded, a condition
that does not bode well for stopping the disease.

“If you wanted to create the perfect mixing vessel for a coronavirus,”
Dr. Osterholm said, “you’d create the emergency rooms in Wuhan right
now.”
