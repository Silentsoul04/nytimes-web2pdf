The number of known cases of the new virus rose by nearly a third
overnight. A shortage of test kits has led experts to warn that the real
number may be higher.

## Death toll climbs above 130, and the number of infections jumps as well.

As the outbreak of the mysterious new
[coronavirus](http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/world/coronavirus-news.html)
rapidly spreads, the Chinese authorities said on Wednesday that the
official count of known cases jumped again overnight, with the death
toll now exceeding 130.

◆
[China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/world/asia/coronavirus-indonesia-bali.html)
said on Wednesday that 132 people had died from the
[virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/world/asia/coronavirus-indonesia-bali.html),
which is believed to have originated in the [central city of Wuhan and
is spreading across the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps.html).
The previous count, on Tuesday, was 106.

◆ The number of confirmed cases increased to 5,974 on Wednesday, up from
4,515 on Tuesday, according to the National Health Commission.

◆ Most of the confirmed cases have been in the central Chinese province
of Hubei, where several cities, including Wuhan, the epicenter of the
outbreak, have been placed under what amounts to a lockdown.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

◆ Thailand has reported 14 cases of infection; Hong Kong has eight; the
United States, Taiwan, Australia and Macau have five each; Singapore,
South Korea and Malaysia each have reported four; Japan has seven;
France has four; Canada has three; Vietnam has two; and Nepal, Cambodia
and Germany each have one. There have been no deaths outside
China.

“Right now, there is no spread of this virus in our communities at

## Scientists race to make a coronavirus vaccine.

Scientists in the United States, Australia and at least three companies
are working on v[accine candidates to stop the spread of the
coronavirus.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html)

Government scientists as well as those working at Johnson & Johnson,
Moderna Therapeutics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals are all working quickly
to develop a vaccine.

The hunt began Jan. 10, when Chinese scientists posted the genetic
makeup of the virus on [a public
database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947). The next
morning, researchers at the National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine
Research Center in Maryland went to work. Within hours, they had
pinpointed the letters of the genetic code that could be used to make a
vaccine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Historically, vaccines have been one of the greatest public health tools
to prevent disease. But even as technology, genomics and global
coordination have improved, allowing researchers to move at top speed,
vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.

## How the coronavirus is affecting earnings season.

The number of infections and deaths related to the outbreak of a
mysterious virus in China keeps rising, but economic analysts have
counseled caution, saying it’s too soon to ring alarms about the impact
on the global economy.

Even so, individually, some American companies with a sizable presence
in China are feeling the strain.
[Starbucks](https://s22.q4cdn.com/869488222/files/doc_financials/2020/Q1/Q1-FY20-Earnings-Release.pdf),
for example, announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily shuttering
half of its locations there.

“The magnitude of the impact will depend on the duration of store
closures as we work with local authorities to manage the situation and
protect our partners and customers,” Pat Grismer, chief financial
officer, said during an earnings call.

Other companies that closed stores there included McDonald’s and Yum
China, the country’s largest restaurant company, which operates the KFC,
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China and also controls its own
brands.

Travel restrictions in China and screening at airports in other
countries have also disrupted plans. United Airlines announced today
that it was suspending some flights. American Airlines stock fell more
than 5 percent on Tuesday.

Hotels and resorts with properties in the affected areas, which include
Macau, a special administrative region and gambling mecca, like Wynn
Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts International also saw the
value of their shares sink. Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton which have
several properties in China also saw their stock prices slide.

## Japan has evacuated some of its citizens.

A charter plane hired by the Japanese government to evacuate citizens
from Wuhan landed at a Tokyo airport Wednesday morning.

Outside, tour buses — with drivers in sanitary masks — and some
ambulances waited to accept the 206 passengers. Japanese news media
reported that one of the passengers had a fever and one was coughing.

In a news conference late Tuesday, Japanese authorities said that people
who showed symptoms would be transferred directly to a hospital, while
those who appeared healthy would be tested for the virus and then asked
to quarantine themselves for two weeks.

The flight left Tokyo Tuesday night carrying medical supplies requested
by the Chinese government to help fight the viral outbreak that has put
Wuhan and other cities on lockdown.

At another news conference, two of the passengers expressed relief at
being back in Japan.

Authorities plan to send a second plane Wednesday night to Wuhan, where
around 450 Japanese citizens still await
evacuation.

## United Airlines suspends some flights from the United States to China.

United Airlines said on Tuesday that it will reduce flights between the
United States and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai because of a
“significant decline in demand.”

United said in a statement that it would cut flights starting Feb. 1,
through Feb. 8. The suspension will affect 24 flights.

“We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will
adjust our schedule as needed,” United said.

Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have not yet cut flights to China,
but have said they are closely monitoring the situation there as the
coronavirus
spreads.

France’s health minister, said on Tuesday that about 500 to 1,000 French
citizens could qualify.

Those who return without any symptoms will be quarantined for 14 days,

Other European countries have also asked France to help bring back some

Health officials on Tuesday reported what appear to be the first known
cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Europe —
specifically, in Germany — and in Japan. Another case was recently
reported in Vietnam.

The cases show that countries across the world are now faced with the
task of limiting the spread of the disease on their own soil, not just
seeking to identify and quarantine ailing patients who had traveled from
China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said the first Japanese
national — and the sixth person in Japan overall — to be diagnosed with
the coronavirus was a man in his 60s. He had never been to Wuhan, but he
had worked as a bus driver earlier this month for two different group
tours from that city, officials said.

The man began experiencing symptoms on Jan. 14, was hospitalized on
Saturday and was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Tuesday.

The infected German, whose case was also confirmed on Tuesday, is a
33-year-old man from Bavaria who had been in contact with a Chinese
woman in Germany, officials said. The woman was diagnosed with the virus
after flying home to China. The man was in good condition, German
officials said.

“It was to be expected that the virus would come to Germany,” Jens
Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said in a statement on Tuesday. “But
the Bavarian case shows us that we are well prepared.”

The World Health Organization said on Friday that there appeared to have
been [a case of human-to-human transmission in
Vietnam](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200124-sitrep-4-2019-ncov.pdf),
where a person who had never been to China, but who had a relative who
had visited Wuhan, was confirmed to have the
virus.

Hong Kong on Tuesday put in place a broad series of restrictions aimed
at controlling the spread of the coronavirus by limiting the number of
mainland Chinese travelers entering the territory, one of Asia’s busiest
travel and financial hubs.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The restrictions — which included the suspension of high-speed and other
train services between Hong Kong and the mainland, a 50 percent
reduction in the number of flights — and a ban on tourism visas for many
travelers — were announced by Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive.

The regulations, which apply to some plane, rail, bus and ferry
arrivals, will begin on Thursday. They follow days of rising pressure
from health care workers, epidemiologists and even pro-Beijing
politicians who have traditionally supported Mrs. Lam’s government.

Hong Kong has so far recorded eight confirmed cases of the virus.

Tibet, the only region in China that has yet to report any cases, has
temporarily closed all tourist sites, state news media reported. Major
Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Beijing, have suspended
long-distance bus services.

The medical faculty of the Chinese University of Hong Kong called for
more restrictions on border checkpoints as the virus spreads across
China.

Workers from Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority have planned a strike for
next week to demand a law requiring the wearing of masks in public and
banning all visitors from entering the city through the
mainland.

## Ethiopia and Ivory Coast test suspected cases.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

On Tuesday, Kenya Airways announced that the health authorities had
quarantined a passenger who traveled from Guangzhou.

Because of the Chinese New Year celebration, “a good number of African
students living in Wuhan or Hubei traveled home before the extent of the
virus became clear,” said Hannah Ryder, chief executive of the
Beijing-headquartered consultancy Development Reimagined.

“It’s unclear how exposed they may have been and if governments have the
resources to check on them,” she
said.

The World Health Organization revised its global risk assessment for the
coronavirus outbreak from “moderate” to “high,” but concealed the change
in a footnote buried in a report published on Monday.

The change to the report, which coincided with a visit to China by the
organization’s director-general, risked confusing the public about the
severity of the outbreak, which has killed more than 100 people in China
and been found in at least 14
countries.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

In a statement, the organization said the director-general, Tedros
Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Chinese officials “discussed measures to
protect the health of Chinese and foreigners in outbreak areas,
including possible alternatives to evacuation of foreigners if there are
ways to accommodate them and protect their health.”

Chinese state-run media reported that Dr. Tedros met with President Xi
Jinping of China and spoke highly of Chinese efforts. Mr. Xi urged the
health organization to assess the epidemic in an “objective, fair, calm
and rational manner.”

In Hubei, medical workers have complained about a desperate need for
resources to treat thousands of patients who have at times overwhelmed
hospitals.

The group, which is a United Nations body, was criticized when it
refused twice in recent days to declare the outbreak a global emergency,
despite its
spread.

A shortage of medical kits in China needed to quickly diagnose the
coronavirus has slowed the country’s ability to respond to the outbreak
and fueled concerns that the number of cases has been
underreported.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

China’s Medical Products Administration said on Sunday that it had
approved four new virus detection kits, including one that sequences the
genetic makeup of the disease.

But China’s three leading medical device manufacturers said they did not
have the capacity to quickly produce the products, according to state
news media reports.

Residents in Wuhan who arrived at hospitals to seek testing were told
that medical workers did not have the kits needed to confirm a
diagnosis.

“For any new emerging virus, most local hospitals or public health
laboratories will not able to make a diagnosis” said Yuen Kwok-yung, the
chairman of the infectious diseases department at Hong Kong
University.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“Thus many cases
will not be investigated at all if they are mild.”

A woman in Wuhan told The South China Morning Post that her uncle
learned he had viral pneumonia after a CT scan, but that the doctor
could not confirm it was the new virus because no testing kits were
available.

China may have to rely on outside technical support as front line
responders battle to contain the virus’s spread, experts said. The Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation said Sunday that it would commit $5 million
to help China respond to the crisis, including “efforts to identify and
confirm
cases.”

As the outbreak continues to spread, global companies have begun to
limit their workers’ travel to mainland China, and China’s biggest
companies have urged employees to work from home.

On Monday, health officials in the United States urged travelers to
[avoid any nonessential travel to
China](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china),
and many companies cited that as justification for internal travel bans.
The [new
guidance](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china),
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that
transportation in and out of Hubei Province, the center of the outbreak,
is restricted, and that there is “limited access to adequate medical
care in affected areas.”

Companies with large operations or interest in China, like General
Motors, Honeywell, Bloomberg and Facebook, have all warned employees not
to travel within mainland China in a flurry of emails in recent days.

Honeywell, which has offices and operations across China, said it had
restricted travel to certain regions, without specifying them. A
spokesperson for General Motors said the company had issued a global ban
on travel to China, under which only “business-critical” travel would be
allowed.

Bloomberg told its employees in Hong Kong and mainland China to work
remotely until further notice, and it barred other employees from
traveling to either place for the next 30 days, according to an email
seen by The New York Times. Facebook said it asked all employees to
suspend nonessential travel and asked those who had recently been in
China to work from home for a period of time.

The authorities in China have extended the Lunar New Year holiday to
Feb. 3, and some of China’s biggest cities have gone further, telling
businesses not to open until the next week. The country’s biggest
technology companies, including Alibaba, Tencent, Bytedance, Sina,
Maimai, Netease and Didi, told employees to work from home from Feb. 3
to Feb. 10.

After sharp losses around the world on Monday, investors on Tuesday
continued to assess the [long-term economic
effects](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/coronavirus-china-economic-impact.html)
of the coronavirus epidemic.

The verdict was mixed. Investors abandoned stocks in Asia, while markets
in Europe steadied. In the United States, the S\&P 500 was up more than
1 percent on Tuesday.

Many of Asia’s stock markets were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday,
but those that were open — Japan’s and South Korea’s — fell as futures
trading in China slumped. Money poured into safe-haven assets like gold
and pushed up the value of the United States dollar.

before direct flights from Wuhan were canceled have [quarantined
themselves at

Scott Liu, 56, who leads an association for immigrants from Hubei, said
he confined himself to his house in Queens. He said he and his fellow
passengers on the Wuhan flight learned of the lockdown in that city
mid-flight.

He said he has not felt sick, but is taking precautions because he knows
symptoms take time to appear. His friends have dropped off on his
doorstep traditional Lunar New Year dishes like lotus root and pork rib
soup, salted fish and dumplings. Last year, they were host to a big New
Year celebration at a banquet hall in Flushing.

This year, Mr. Liu said, “all the events here are canceled.”

“Everybody is in a state of panic,” he added.
