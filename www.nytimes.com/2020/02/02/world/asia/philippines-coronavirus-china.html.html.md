HONG KONG — A 44-year-old man in the Philippines has died of the
coronavirus, the first known fatality outside China, health officials
said on Sunday, as the number of deaths jumped to more than 360 and
other countries expanded [travel
restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus-us-australia.html)
in an effort to slow [the spread of the
outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html).

The man, whose name was not released, was a resident of Wuhan, China,
the center of the outbreak. He died on Saturday after developing what
officials called “severe pneumonia.”

“This is the first known death of someone with 2019-nCoV outside of
China,” the World Health Organization’s office in the Philippines [said
in a
statement](https://www.facebook.com/whophilippines/photos/a.514585071988103/2664930260286896/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARANVVlwrEFTML5lekIxBZNMqIbfrFgdiCrfveU-KkAfadCSrp4IBIqFDS02YQzuLERpt-CdtaoSjeg71-s8JN5syTzk8bnheLsSOOS0h5V3GR86fa3688BBhxMwuyaGe-IwatUH1sYDoUo-4BALQjKnvQDnewFAioKiQ3megPQRw7f-BcCbW1mChINqsYlEaUjMlMQYIVsHmdoCh-zZhGr5JfIXqmffJTWMtS66jfl-CoSoVu_pfaoBxBhAUenU1TCHQ5RXl6eqHI67HS_tT0S_DaW-TuMaO8ds0RKn7FBHgqn4EqkbQxJ_v0a-15TntvvUQV1UFa692Oqpkesg75PWmQ&__tn__=-R),

Hours before the announcement, the Philippines said it was temporarily
barring non-Filipino travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong
and Macau.

In Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, a new union
representing health care workers vowed to strike on Monday to force the
city’s government to ban travel from mainland China. Fears in the city
escalated after another case was confirmed and officials could not rule
out the possibility that the patient, an 80-year-old man, had been
infected within Hong Kong.

By Sunday, with infections standing at more than 14,000 worldwide,
nations continued to expand travel restrictions and bar visitors from
China.

New Zealand said on Sunday that it would deny entry to visitors
departing from or traveling through mainland China for two weeks
starting on Monday. Citizens and residents of New Zealand will be
allowed entry from China but will be required to quarantine themselves
for 14 days, [Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern
said](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/new-zealand-restrict-travellers-china-coronavirus-spreads-worldwide).

“Ultimately, this is a public health decision,” she said, adding that
the restrictions were precautionary measures to keep New Zealand
virus-free and to contain the worldwide outbreak.

In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting of
ministers in Jerusalem on Sunday to make national preparations “because
we estimate that the virus will arrive,” his office said in a statement.
Along with preparations “to isolate those who have been infected and
treat them” for two weeks at home, the country had temporarily closed
“land crossings, seaports and airports to arrivals from China.”

Israeli citizens who visited China will be allowed to return, [the
statement
said.](https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1223971839099187200)

In addition, about 1,700 Chinese construction workers whose work permits
had expired and who were supposed to return to China this weekend would
be granted extended stays in Israel. They are being allowed to keep
working rather than being replaced by newly recruited laborers who could
potentially arrive with the virus, according to Israeli news reports.

The United States and Australia have also expanded travel restrictions,
temporarily barring noncitizens who recently traveled to
China.

South Korea said on Sunday that it would deny entry to any ****
foreigners who have traveled in the past 14 days to Wuhan and
surrounding Hubei Province, the area at the center of the outbreak. In a
move to help stop the spread of the virus in Wuhan, the Chinese
authorities have fulfilled a promise to build a new 1,000-bed specialty
hospital in the city within 10 days. About 1,400 military medics are to
begin working there on Monday.

South Korea’s travel restrictions will take effect on Tuesday, Prime
Minister Chung Sye-kyun said, as the number of people testing positive
for the coronavirus in South Korea increased to 15.

Any South Korean returning home who has been in Hubei Province within
the past two weeks will be subject to 14 days of self-quarantine and
monitoring, the government said. It also said it would bar South Koreans
from visiting China as tourists.

Japan will bar noncitizens who traveled recently to Hubei. Taiwan is
denying entry to Chinese nationals from Guangdong, a southern coastal
province that has been battered by the virus, and travelers who recently
visited the area.

Vietnam recently barred almost all flights to and from mainland China,
Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan until May 1, according to the United States
Federal Aviation Administration. But Vietnam then eased its ban,
allowing flights from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan to continue while
keeping the prohibitions in place for mainland China, the aviation
authorities
said.

Italy included Taiwan in a ban on flights from China, a move that it

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many

      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in

        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Taiwan has 10 confirmed cases, versus more than 17,000 in mainland
China, said the foreign minister, Joseph Wu.

“The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Taiwan is not higher
than in most countries affected,” he said. “Other than China, no other
country, no other country has had its flight banned by Italy.”

China has long sought to limit Taiwan’s diplomatic relations and
recognition at international bodies such as the W.H.O. Taiwan previously
participated as an observer at the World Health Assembly, the group’s
governing body. But it has since been excluded as Beijing has increased
pressure on Taiwan under President Tsai Ing-wen, who is skeptical about
closer ties with Beijing.

“It is not fair to the 23 million people in Taiwan, and it is not fair
to other people who might otherwise obtain support from Taiwan if we
were not excluded,” Mr. Wu said.

In Hong Kong, some residents are pushing for tougher restrictions on
arrivals from mainland China. As many as 9,000 medical workers have
pledged to strike beginning on Monday, a threat that alarms the
territory’s officials as they are struggling to contain the
outbreak.

The workers are demanding that Hong Kong close all checkpoints to
visitors from mainland China, saying they represent a threat to health
care workers. The workers plan to paralyze nonemergency and emergency
services at hospitals, said the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, a
union formed during the city’s antigovernment protest movement.

“We believe such actions are our last resort,” the alliance wrote in a
[statement](https://telegra.ph/Healthcare-Workers-Together-We-Stand-Strike-to-Protect-Hong-Kong-02-01)
on Saturday night.

Under the plan, nonessential hospital staff members who belong to the
union would not go to work on Monday. If the government did not close
the border and heed their other demands by 9 p.m. local time, union
members handling emergency services would also strike, the union said.

Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong’s No. 2 official, appealed to medical workers
to reconsider, comparing them to guardians of the public.

“At this critical moment, I believe the general public would count on
medical personnel to fight against the epidemic together, in the spirit
of professionalism,” he wrote in [a blog
post](https://www.cso.gov.hk/eng/blog/blog20200202.htm) on
Sunday.

Government officials in Hong Kong say that the number of visitors from
the mainland and other countries had decreased significantly after they
closed several border points and rail stations and cut flight arrivals
by half.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

But several border locations remain open, and many medical workers fear
being overwhelmed by a flood of visitors seeking treatment in Hong
Kong’s well-regarded health care system.

They have also voiced frustrations about patients from mainland China
hiding their travel and medical history, potentially endangering other
patients.

Stevenson and Sui-Lee Wee from Hong Kong; Choe Sang-Hun from South
Korea; Jason Gutierrez from Manila; and David Halbfinger and Isabel
