# Even Without Symptoms, Wuhan Coronavirus May Spread, Experts Fear

A report purporting to describe asymptomatic transmission in Germany has
come under fire. But many experts still believe it’s happening.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Can individuals infected with the Wuhan coronavirus spread it to others
even if they aren’t showing symptoms?

It’s one of the most important questions confronting scientists. If even
asymptomatic people can spread the
[virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-clusters.html),
then it will be much, much harder to slow its spread.

Doctors in
[China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-clusters.html)
claimed asymptomatic transmission was possible, and [a letter published
Jan. 30 in the New England Journal of
Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468) appeared
to back them up.

In the letter, scientists described a cluster of infections in Germany
that had started with a traveler from Shanghai. The traveler had seemed
healthy during her four-day visit to Bavaria, the researchers reported,
and started feeling ill only after she boarded a return flight to China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That report heightened anxiety among scientists worldwide, who said the
finding suggested that containment of the Wuhan coronavirus would be
nearly impossible.

But now health officials in Germany have raised doubts about the
accuracy of that report. The visitor to Germany had “mild unspecific
symptoms” while she was still in Germany, said Marieke Degen, a
spokeswoman with the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s public health
institute, headquartered in Berlin.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The woman’s symptoms, including back pain, had been vague, and she had
taken antipyretic medication, according to Bavarian health authorities
and scientists at the institute. Antipyretic drugs are used not only to
relieve fever, but also as painkillers and for their anti-inflammatory
properties.

Health officials reported their findings last week to the Early Warning
and Response System of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control, Ms. Degen said; their criticism was first reported by Science
magazine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Whatever the inaccuracies in the journal report, many experts remain
concerned about the potential for coronavirus to be spread by
asymptomatic individuals, in large part because of anecdotal information
received from their colleagues in
China.

“This paper may or may not be flawed — it needs further investigation,”
said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases. “But I don’t think it negates the concept.”

“We had been getting reports from highly reliable people in China —
scientists, investigators and public health people who we’ve known over
the years — and they’ve been telling us, ‘There’s asymptomatic disease,
for sure, and we are seeing asymptomatic transmission,’” Dr. Fauci said.

Asymptomatic transmission is unlikely to be driving the epidemic within
China, he added, but “it complicates our job.”

If the early symptoms include such common complaints as back pain, then
infected individuals and their doctors are unlikely to consider the
possibility that the patient is infected with a coronavirus, said Marc
Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health in Boston.

“From a practical perspective, that is almost the same as if she had no
symptoms at all,” Dr. Lipsitch said. “Headaches are very common, and the
coronavirus is not the principal cause thereof, and they’re not
observable by a third party.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If the first symptom is common and vague, he added, “then the public
health challenge of figuring out who’s infectious is about as great as
if it was truly asymptomatic.”

Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of emerging diseases at the World
Health Organization, said Tuesday that the organization had been aware
of reports of individuals who might have transmitted the Wuhan
coronavirus before their symptoms appeared or very soon after being
infected.

But experience with other diseases indicated that many people who were
believed to have been asymptomatic actually did experience symptoms.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“It is possible that there may be individuals who are asymptomatic that
shed virus, but we need more detailed studies around this to determine
how often that is happening, and if this is leading to secondary
transmission,” Dr. Van Kerkhove said.

Whatever the answers to those questions, however, most viral respiratory
infections are spread through the coughs and sneezes of symptomatic
patients, experts
say.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The letter at the center of the controversy describes a healthy
33-year-old businessman in Germany who had developed a sore throat,
chills and muscle aches on Jan. 24, with a fever spiking to 102.4
degrees Fahrenheit the next day, along with a cough.

Before he became ill, he had met in Munich on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21 with a
Chinese business partner. A resident of Shanghai, she had been in
Germany from Jan. 19 to Jan. 22. The report said that she was healthy
during her stay but got sick during her flight back to China. She tested
positive for infection with the Wuhan coronavirus on Jan. 26.

was tested and found positive for the infection. On Jan. 28, three
additional employees of the German company tested positive for the
coronavirus. Two of them had not had any contact with the woman from
Shanghai.

All of the infected were admitted to the hospital, where they were
isolated and monitored. None developed severe disease.

The authors of the report, researchers in Munich and Berlin, said it was
“notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the
incubation period” of the virus. The woman suffered only a brief, mild
illness and recovered.

Dr. Michael Hoelscher, one of the authors, told Science magazine that he
and his colleagues had not interviewed the Chinese woman who had been
ill, and relied on the accounts given by her German colleagues, who said
she did not appear to have had any symptoms. Dr. Hoelscher could not be
reached for comment.

Researchers from the Robert Koch Institute and the Health and Food
Safety Authority of Bavaria did interview the woman on the phone, Ms.
Degen said, which is how they learned that she might have had symptoms.

Julia Morin, a spokeswoman for the New England Journal of Medicine,
said, “All we can say right now is that we are looking into the matter.”
