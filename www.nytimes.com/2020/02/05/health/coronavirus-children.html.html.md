# Why the New Coronavirus (Mostly) Spares Children

So far, very few young children seem to be falling ill. The pattern was
seen in outbreaks of SARS and MERS, too.

The new coronavirus has infected nearly 90,000 people, and more than
3,000 have died. But relatively few
[children](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-children-icu.html)
appear to have developed severe symptoms so far, according to available
data.

“Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild,” with those
under 19 years making up only 2.4 percent of the total cases, according
to a
[report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)
published Feb. 28 by the World Health Organization.

So why aren’t more children getting sick?

“My strong, educated guess is that younger people are getting infected,
but they get the relatively milder disease,” Dr. Malik Peiris, chief of
virology at the University of Hong Kong, said last month. Dr. Peiris has
developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus.

The numbers so far support that theory: According to the W.H.O., only
2.5 percent of those under 19 have developed severe disease and only 0.2
percent had critical disease. There have been no deaths recorded in
children under 9.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scientists may not be seeing more infected children because “we don’t
have data on the milder cases,” Dr. Peiris said.

Without more information, it is also unclear whether
[children](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-children-icu.html)
can transmit the disease to others. The W.H.O. report said that its team
sent to China, the epicenter of the outbreak, “could not recall episodes
in which transmission occurred from a child to an adult.”

Still, children who are detected as infected must be shedding some virus
or they wouldn’t be detected, noted Dr. Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist
at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But whether their
infectiousness is high is as yet unknown. “It’s a very high priority to
do studies to find it out,” he
said.

One way to find out, he said, is to look at outbreaks such as the one at
the church in South Korea. “If there were children among those people,”
he said, “that would be a goldmine of data.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The other approach is to conduct household studies, where multiple
members of a family might be infected.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In one such published case study of a family, a 10-year-old traveled to
Wuhan, China, with his family. Upon returning to Shenzhen, the other
infected family members, ranging in age from 36 to 66, [developed fever,
sore throat, diarrhea and
pneumonia](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30154-9/fulltext).

The child, too, had signs of viral pneumonia in the lungs, doctors found
— but no outward symptoms. Some scientists suspect that this is typical
of coronavirus infection in children.

“It’s certainly true that children can be either asymptomatically
infected or have very mild infection,” Dr. Raina MacIntyre said last
month. Dr. MacIntyre is an epidemiologist at the University of New South
Wales in Sydney, Australia, who has been studying the spread of the new
coronavirus.

In many ways, this pattern parallels that seen during outbreaks of SARS
and MERS, also coronaviruses. The MERS epidemics in Saudi Arabia in 2012
and in South Korea in 2015 together claimed more than 800 lives. Most
children who were infected never developed symptoms.

No children died during the SARS epidemic in 2003, and the majority of
the 800 deaths in the outbreak were in people over age 45, with men more
at risk.

Among the more than 8,000 cases of SARS, researchers at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention were able to identify 135 infected
children in published reports.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Children under age 12 were much less likely to be admitted to a hospital
or to need oxygen or other treatment, the researchers found. Children
over age 12 had symptoms much like those of adults.

“We don’t fully understand the reason for this age-related increase of
severity,” Dr. Peiris said. “But we see that now — and with SARS, you
could see that much more clearly.”

It’s not unusual for viruses to trigger only mild infections in children
and much more severe illnesses in adults. Chickenpox, for example, can
be largely inconsequential in children, yet catastrophic in
adults.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Influenza is unusual in that it has evolved with humans over thousands
of years and infects millions worldwide each year. Still, even though
thousands of young children end up in the hospital each year with
influenza, just a small percentage of them die, said Dr. Krys Johnson,
an epidemiologist at Temple University in Philadelphia.

This trend is generally true of respiratory illnesses because children
tend to eat well, and to get plenty of exercise and rest — none of which
may be true of adults. “The younger, most healthy segment of the
population are able to fight it off,” she said. Adults may also be more
susceptible because they are more likely to have other diseases, such as
diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease, that weaken their
ability to stave off infections.

The body’s innate immunity, which is critical for fighting viruses, also
deteriorates with age, and particularly after middle age.

“Something happens at age 50,” Dr. MacIntyre said. “It declines, and it
declines exponentially, which is why for most infections we see the
highest incidence in the elderly.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A key question about the new coronavirus is whether children who are
infected and asymptomatic are able to pass the virus to others.

“We know that young people in general — not just kids, but young adults
and teenagers — have the most intense contact in society,” Dr. MacIntyre
said. Young people who don’t realize they are sick may contribute to the
epidemic’s momentum, she said.

To understand the epidemic fully, she and other scientists said they
need detailed data: when people were first exposed to the virus, when
they first began to show symptoms, how many and which people have mild
symptoms versus more severe disease.

With detailed data, some observations, such as the higher risk in men,
may change. Still, Dr. Mark Denison, a pediatric infectious diseases
specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said last month that
he does not expect to see a sudden uptick in infected children.

“It’s hard for me to imagine that there’s such a degree of
underreporting of clinical illness in children that we’re only hearing
about two or three cases,” he said.

“I think it means that there are many, many less children” who are
infected in China, he said, “and that they’re not as much at risk.”
