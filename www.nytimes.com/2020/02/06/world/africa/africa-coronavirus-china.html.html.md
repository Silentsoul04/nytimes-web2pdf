# Africa, Intertwined With China, Fears Coronavirus Outbreak

</div>

There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Africa yet, but with
steady traffic to and from China, experts worry that the epidemic could
overrun already-strained health systems.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — As the 9 a.m. flight from Dubai arrived at the
international airport in Ethiopia’s capital on Wednesday, four
government health specialists in face masks and protective glasses
worked their way to the line of incoming passengers to check their
passports.

The health specialists found what they were looking for — two passengers
who had just returned from China — and pulled them aside to check their
temperatures to see if they might have been infected by the coronavirus.

The two passengers had normal temperatures, so were allowed to continue
on their way, a government policy that does not account for an
incubation period that is up to 14 days.

As the coronavirus wreaks havoc in China and has spread to countries
around the world, experts are increasingly concerned that Africa is
particularly vulnerable.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The continent’s health system is already fragile. It has few facilities
even to test for the virus. Its doctors are already straining to contain
deadly outbreaks of other diseases, like malaria, measles and Ebola.

And on top of that, Africa has large numbers of Chinese workers, many
now returning to the continent after visits to China for the Lunar New
Year. Meanwhile, some of the 81,000 African students who have been
studying in China are now heading home. But while more and more
countries tighten their controls over travel with China, Ethiopia has
kept the door open and the planes flying.

If the coronavirus hits Africa, said Dr. John Nkengasong, director of
Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa, “it
will be massive.”

There have been 32 suspected cases of coronavirus in Africa, but none
tested positive for the virus, according to the Africa C.D.C. But until
this week, only two countries on the continent — South Africa and
Senegal — had laboratories capable of testing for the coronavirus.

Most hospitals on the continent, other than large ones in capitals or

“If this happens in Africa it will be a huge struggle because the health
services are quite overstretched dealing with ongoing diseases like
malaria and measles and the current Ebola outbreak,” said Michel Yao,
the World Health Organization’s Emergency Operations Program Manager for
Africa.

Africa was largely spared in 2002 and 2003 when the SARS virus, which
also originated in China, spread around the world, killing nearly 800
people and infecting more than 8,000, mostly in China and Hong Kong.
Africa reported only one case, in South Africa.

But the risk is far greater now, experts say. China and Africa have
become intertwined in the last two decades as China has expanded its
political, economic, and military ties to Africa, [funding large
infrastructure
projects](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/world/africa/china-loans-africa-usa.html)
and pledging tens of billions of dollars in investments and loans.

Chinese citizens have flocked to Africa, working in industries ranging
from manufacturing and technology to health care and construction.
Estimates of how many Chinese are now living in Africa range [from
about 200,000](http://www.sais-cari.org/data-chinese-workers-in-africa)
to as many [as two
million](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/african-countries-relax-short-term-visa-policies-chinese).

Air travel between China and Africa has [increased
exponentially](https://qz.com/africa/1675287/china-to-africa-flights-jumped-630-in-the-past-nine-years/)
in the last decade alone, from one flight a day to an average of eight
direct
flights.

Ethiopian Airlines, Africa’s biggest and most profitable carrier, is the
main gateway between China and Africa, shuttling up to 1,500 passengers
each day between Addis Ababa and China on [dozens of weekly
flights](https://twitter.com/flyethiopian/status/1068381553192050691).
The airline [has a
center](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-11/28/c_137637633.htm) in
the Addis Ababa airport to help Chinese travelers easily process their
visas to dozens of African states. The Ethiopian airport itself was
[built in part with funding from
China](https://qz.com/africa/1535255/ethiopias-addis-ababa-bole-expanded-airport-triples-size/).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Ethiopian carrier has continued operating its China routes while
many other international airlines — including African carriers like
[Kenya
Airways](https://twitter.com/KenyaAirways/status/1223119066937692162),
[Egypt Air](https://twitter.com/EGYPTAIR/status/1222876029875838977),
and [Morocco’s Royal
Air](https://twitter.com/RAM_Maroc/status/1222991000605536270) — have
suspended flights to China.

The Ethiopian airline and government have now come under criticism in
the midst of the coronavirus outbreak over speculation that China
pressured the Ethiopian government not to halt the flights.

The office of the prime minister and Ethiopian Airlines both declined to
comment, referring questions to the Ethiopian Public Health Institute,
which is dealing with Ethiopia’s response to the coronavirus.

Lia Tadesse, Ethiopia’s state minister of health, said the decision to
continue flights to China came not from her ministry but from “a higher
government level.” But she denied there was any pressure from China.

Yet travelers between China and Africa can also arrive through hubs in
other continents, providing further pathways for the virus.

So African countries and global health organizations are now scrambling
to ramp up the capacity to cope with the epidemic.

Ethiopia has built isolation units at the airport in Addis Ababa, and
designated specific intensive care units in hospitals, said Ms. Tadesse,
Ethiopia’s health minister.

The W.H.O. said this week that four more countries — Ghana, Madagascar,
Nigeria and Sierra Leone — can now conduct the tests. Ethiopia says it
will have testing capabilities by the end of the week. But many other
African countries will still have to send test kits elsewhere, delaying
any
response.

“Unfortunately, many disease surveillance systems throughout African

capability,” said Dr. Ngozi Erondu, associate fellow in the Global
Health Program at Chatham House, an international affairs research group
in London. “Identifying most cases and controlling the outbreak could be

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The World Health Organization [is stepping up
aid](https://www.afro.who.int/news/who-ramps-preparedness-novel-coronavirus-african-region)
to 13 African countries that have direct links or a high volume of
travel to China, working to improve early detection of cases and speed
samples to labs that can do the tests. The agency has said it will need
$675 million through April, primarily to assist poor countries in Africa
and Asia with weak public health systems. The Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation on Wednesday committed $100 million to fight the virus,
partly for at-risk populations in Africa.

With no cases yet confirmed in Africa itself, many Africans have focused
their concern on the students who are living in China and may have been
exposed.

About 4,600 African students and citizens live in the epidemic’s center,
Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is where the coronavirus first
emerged, according to Development Reimagined, a consulting organization
with headquarters in Beijing.

In all, more than 81,000 Africans **** [were studying in mainland
China](http://en.moe.gov.cn/news/press_releases/201904/t20190418_378586.html)
**** in 2018, lured by generous scholarships, affordable tuition and the
[hope of becoming a bridge connecting their nations and an ascendant
China](https://qz.com/africa/1119447/china-is-training-africas-next-generation-of-leaders/).

The first African to be diagnosed with coronavirus is a 21-year-old
Cameroonian student studying at Yangtze University in Hubei province.

The lockdown in Wuhan is taking a toll on students like Abdikadir
Mohamed, a 23-year-old from Somalia who has been studying petroleum
engineering at the China University of Geosciences in
Wuhan.

Mr. Mohamed, who the Somali government said is one of 50 Somalis living
in Wuhan, said that for nearly 20 hours a day, he doesn’t leave his
one-bedroom apartment.

The experience is like being “stuck in a bad dream,” he said in a
telephone call on Tuesday.

While other African countries, including Morocco, Mauritius and Egypt,
have evacuated their citizens from China, Mr. Mohamed said that the
Somali students’ pleas to their government to evacuate them have been
futile.

“Our families are worried,” Mr. Mohamed said. “They are calling us every
minute. If you don’t pick the phone at once, they panic.”

Simon Marks reported from Addis Ababa, and Abdi Latif Dahir from
Nairobi, Kenya. Lynsey Chutel contributed reporting from Johannesburg,
Ruth Maclean from Dakar, and Donald G. McNeil Jr. from New York.
