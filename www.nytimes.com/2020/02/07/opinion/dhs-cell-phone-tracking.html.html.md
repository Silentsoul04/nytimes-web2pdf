“When the government tracks the location of a cellphone it achieves near
perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the
phone’s user,” wrote John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme
Court, in a [2018
ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf)
that prevented the government from obtaining location data from
[cellphone towers without a
warrant](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/us/politics/supreme-court-warrants-cell-phone-privacy.html).

“We decline to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless
carrier’s database of physical location information,” Chief Justice
Roberts
[wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/us/politics/supreme-court-warrants-cell-phone-privacy.html)
in the decision, Carpenter v. United States.

With that judicial intent in mind, it is alarming to read [a new
report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-agencies-use-cellphone-location-data-for-immigration-enforcement-11581078600?mod=hp_lead_pos5)
in The Wall Street Journal that found the Trump administration “has
bought access to a commercial database that maps the movements of
millions of cellphones in America and is using it for immigration and
border enforcement.”

The data used by the government comes not from the phone companies but
from a [location data
company](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html),
one of many that are quietly and relentlessly collecting the precise
movements of all smartphone-owning Americans through their phone apps.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many apps — weather apps or coupon apps, for instance — gather and
record location data without users’ understanding what the code is up
to. That data can then be sold to third party buyers including,
apparently, the
government.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since that data is available for sale, it seems the government believes
that no court oversight is necessary. “The federal government has
essentially found a workaround by purchasing location data used by
marketing firms rather than going to court on a case-by-case basis,” The
Journal reported. “Because location data is available through numerous
commercial ad exchanges, government lawyers have approved the programs
and concluded that the Carpenter ruling doesn’t apply.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokesman from Customs and Border Protection defended the practice in
a statement to The Times: “While C.B.P. is being provided access to
location information, it is important to note that such information does
not include cellular phone tower data, is not ingested in bulk and does
not include the individual user’s identity.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Use of this type of location-tracking data by the government has not
been tested in court. And in the private sector, location data — and the
multibillion dollar advertising ecosystem that has eagerly embraced it —
are both opaque and largely unregulated.

Last year, a [Times Opinion
investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html)
found that claims about the anonymity of location data are untrue since
comprehensive records of time and place easily identify real people.
Consider a commute: Even without a name, how many phones travel between
a specific home and specific office every day?

This week’s revelations dredge up many questions about C.B.P.’s
workflow: What precisely does the agency mean when it claims that the
data is not ingested in bulk? Who in the agency gets to look at the data
and for what purposes? Where is it stored? How long is it stored for? If
the government plans to outsource the surveillance state to commercial
entities to bypass Supreme Court rulings, both parties ought to be
questioned under oath about the specifics of their practices.

The use of location data to aid in deportations also demonstrates how
out of date the notion of informed consent has become. When users accept
the terms and conditions for various digital products, not only are they
uninformed about how their data is gathered, they are also consenting to
future uses that they could never predict.

Without oversight, it is inconceivable that tactics turned against
undocumented immigrants won’t eventually be turned to the enforcement of
other laws. As the world has seen in the streets of Hong Kong, where
protesters wear masks to avoid a network of government
facial-recognition cameras, once a surveillance technology is widely
deployed in a society it is almost impossible to uproot.

Chief Justice Roberts
[outlined](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf)
those stakes in his Carpenter ruling. “The retrospective quality of the
data here gives police access to a category of information otherwise
unknowable. In the past, attempts to reconstruct a person’s movements
were limited by a dearth of records and the frailties of recollection.
With access to \[cellphone location data\], the Government can now
travel back in time to retrace a person’s whereabouts, subject only to
the retention polices of the wireless carriers, which currently maintain
records for up to five years. Critically, because location information
is continually logged for all of the 400 million devices in the United
States — not just those belonging to persons who might happen to come
under investigation — this newfound tracking capacity runs against
everyone.”

The courts are a ponderous and imperfect venue for protecting Fourth
Amendment rights in an age of rapid technological advancement. Exhibit A
is the notion that the Carpenter ruling applies only to location data
captured by cellphone towers and not to location data streamed from
smartphone apps, which can produce nearly identical troves of
information.

For far, far too long, lawmakers have neglected their critical role in
overseeing how these technologies are used. After all, concern about
location tracking is bipartisan, as Republican and Democratic lawmakers
[told Times
Opinion](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html)
last year.

“I am deeply concerned by reports that the Trump administration has been
secretly collecting cellphone data — without warrants — to track the
location of millions of people across the United States to target
individuals for deportation,” Representative Carolyn Maloney, who leads
the Oversight and Reform Committee, told The Times. “Such Orwellian
government surveillance threatens the privacy of every American. The
federal government should not have the unfettered ability to track us in
our homes, at work, at the doctor or at church. The Oversight Committee
plans to fully investigate this issue to ensure that Americans’ privacy
is protected.”

Surely, Congress has time to hold hearings about a matter of urgent
concern to everyone who owns a smartphone or cares about the government
using the most invasive corporate surveillance system ever devised
against its own people.
