Iowa}\label{joe-walsh-ends-challenge-to-trump-after-getting-1-in-iowa}}

Mr. Walsh, a conservative radio show host and former Republican lawmaker
from Illinois, was running a long-shot bid for the party's presidential
nomination.

WASHINGTON --- Joe Walsh, the conservative radio show host and former
Tea Party congressman from Illinois who was running a presidential
campaign challenging President Trump's fitness for office, announced on
Friday that he was ending his bid for the Republican nomination.

That leaves Mr. Trump with only one Republican challenger, former Gov.
William F. Weld of Massachusetts.

``I am ending my candidacy for president of the United States,'' Mr.
Walsh said in an interview on CNN Friday morning. ``I got into this
because I thought it was really important that there was a Republican
--- a Republican --- out there every day calling out this president for
how unfit he is.''

Those calls, however, seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Mr. Walsh, who supported Mr. Trump in 2016 and ran as a former disciple
who had seen the light, became a regular presence on cable news
channels, calling Mr. Trump an ``unfit con man'' and a danger to the
country. His hope was that he would create a permission structure for
other former supporters to follow suit and change their minds about Mr.
Trump.

But after spending the majority of his time campaigning in Iowa, Mr.
Walsh
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/03/us/elections/results-iowa-caucus-republicans.html}{received
just 1.1 percent of the vote} in the caucuses there on Monday, failing
to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support among Republican voters. (He
finished behind Mr. Weld, who got 1.3 percent.)

The experience, he said, left him cynical about the future of the party.

``I spoke in front of 3,000 Iowa Republicans last night,'' Mr. Walsh
wrote on Twitter last week. ``It was like a MAGA rally. I told them we
needed a president who doesn't lie all the time. The crowd booed me. I
told them we needed a president who wasn't indecent \& cruel. The crowd
booed me.''

He said the experience made him realize ``again that my Republican Party
isn't a Party, it's a cult.''

2020?}\label{whos-running-for-president-in-2020}}

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

Mr. Walsh, who entered the race last August, was once
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/us/politics/trump-republicans-challengers.html}{part
of a trio of Republican challengers to Mr. Trump}, who together were
involved in a quixotic attempt to peel away support from a president
with an iron grip on his party.

But Mr. Trump's campaign operatives had worked for over a year to lock
up support at the state level and make it impossible for any primary
challenger to find sunlight. The state Republican parties in Arizona,
Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina canceled
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/us/politics/states-drop-republican-primaries.html}{their
2020 presidential primaries}.

Even in Iowa, the state party chairman, Jeff Kaufmann, framed his caucus
more as a test run for what he expects to be a competitive 2024
Republican field.

The tactics worked.

Last November, former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/politics/mark-sanford-2020.html}{dropped
out of the Republican primary}, just two months after announcing his
run.

Speaking from the White House on Thursday
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html}{as
he celebrated his acquittal} in the Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Trump
dismissed his remaining challengers as ``non-people,'' a rare
acknowledgment that he had any competitors at all.

``We have two people running, you know, and I guess they consider them
non-people, but they are running,'' Mr. Trump told Republican lawmakers
who celebrated him in the East Room. ``I mean, one was a governor. One
was a congressman. They're running. We got 98 percent of the vote.''

Mr. Weld's campaign aides said they planned to soldier on alone.

``It's hard to challenge a tyrant,'' said R.J. Lyman, chairman of Mr.
Weld's campaign. ``Joe Walsh is a very different person than Bill Weld,
but is a good person and he made a good effort to explain how a Tea
Party Republican could stand up to Trump. People weren't willing to
follow.''

Mr. Lyman said that Mr. Weld would stay in the race regardless of how he
fares in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. ``There's no doubt that
the independence and individuality of New Hampshire are traits we hope
will pierce through the cultish obsession of the Trumpists,'' he said.
