# White House Official Says Huawei Has Secret Back Door to Extract Data

</div>

The allegation that Huawei maintains access to the data that flows
through its network is the latest step in a campaign to thwart the
Chinese telecom giant’s rise.

WASHINGTON — Huawei has the ability to secretly retrieve sensitive
information in next-generation wireless networks and other systems it
maintains around the world, a top White House official said Tuesday.

The comment from Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser, is
one of the sharpest public denunciations of the Chinese company by the
Trump administration, and comes as the United States is reeling from the
decision by Britain to allow Huawei to build part of their
fifth-generation, or 5G, network.

American intelligence officials have long said privately that Huawei has
so-called back doors that could allow the company to obtain data that
flows on the networks they build and maintain. But publicly, officials
have spoken mostly about the potential that Huawei could provide Chinese
officials with access to all kinds of data, without offering concrete
proof.

Mr. O’Brien said Tuesday that the United States had evidence that Huawei
could “access sensitive and personal information” in the systems it
maintains around the world.

“This is alarming because Chinese companies, by law, must comply with
directives of the Chinese Communist Party,” Mr. O’Brien said.
“Strategically, we see a company that can use its position in the
market to advance the aims of the Chinese Communist Party.”

Huawei has [insisted that it does not answer to the Chinese
government](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/technology/huawei-ren-zhengfei.html)
and that it would not spy on its customers.

The Trump administration has spent the past year [trying to
pressure](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/huawei-china-us-5g-technology.html)
its allies, [with limited
success](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/us/politics/huawei-ban.html),
to prevent Huawei from building their next-generation wireless networks.
The effort has included warning other countries that Huawei poses a risk
and threatening them with a loss of access to American intelligence if
they allowed the Chinese telecommunication company into their networks.

Until recently, American officials have been unwilling to share
technical details with allies. But that stance has changed in recent
weeks, as American officials have sought to persuade German and British
officials of the danger of Huawei. In the case of Britain, the strategy
has failed, as officials there announced last month that they [would
allow some Huawei
equipment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/britain-huawei-5G.html)
into their networks.

On Tuesday, lawmakers said that allies should reconsider their decisions
to allow the Chinese company into their new networks.

“The freedom-loving world can’t sit back and let surveillance state
communists infect our infrastructure,” Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of
Nebraska, said Tuesday.

The United States decision to share more information about Huawei’s back
door with allies was [first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-officials-say-huawei-can-covertly-access-telecom-networks-11581452256).
Carriers in most countries have ways to give law enforcement officials
access to parts of the network. But Huawei maintains access to those
back doors, and can get data from them even without the permission of
carriers, The Journal reported.

Advocacy groups said the back-door access was why they had been pushing
for the United States government and companies to do more to develop a
strong competitor to Huawei.

“We simply cannot risk allowing Huawei — and by extension the Chinese
government — having back-door access to our telecommunications
networks,” said Ian Prior, a spokesman for 5G Action Now, an interest
group. “It is a danger to our national security, economic security and
personal privacy.”

The effort to understand security vulnerabilities in Huawei’s equipment
goes back years, well before the development of the current 5G systems.

The National Security Agency infiltrated Huawei’s systems years ago in a
classified operation [code-named
Shotgiant](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/world/asia/nsa-breached-chinese-servers-seen-as-spy-peril.html).
The effort was intended to determine if the People’s Liberation Army was
the true owner of the company, but it also involved delving into the
technology of the company’s switching systems including any back doors
that the company maintained. The [effort by the National Security Agency
was revealed
in 2014](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/world/asia/nsa-breached-chinese-servers-seen-as-spy-peril.html),
as part of the documents leaked by the former contractor Edward J.
Snowden.

The Trump administration has taken steps to try to block Huawei from
America’s next-generation mobile networks, and has also tried to stop
companies from selling parts to the Chinese company. But an effort [to
close loopholes in those
rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/business/economy/huawei-restrictions.html),
for now, has been stalled.
