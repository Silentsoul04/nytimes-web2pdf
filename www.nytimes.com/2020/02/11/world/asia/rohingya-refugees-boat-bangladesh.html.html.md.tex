At least 15 people drowned, reports said. One official said the
50-person boat was carrying 130 away from refugee camps.

At least 15 Rohingya refugees, including four children, drowned when the
overcrowded boat they were in capsized off the coast of Bangladesh on
Tuesday, according to the Bangladesh Coast Guard.

A Bangladesh Coast Guard official, Hamidul Islam,
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-accident/at-least-15-rohingya-refugees-die-in-boat-capsize-idUSKBN2050G2}{told
Reuters} that the boat was filled with people trying to leave camps near
Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/world/asia/rohingya-myanmar-repatriation.html}{where
hundreds of thousands of refugees have been living} since a
scorched-earth ethnic cleansing campaign by Myanmar's military in 2017.

``It was inhumane,'' he said. ``The boat was carrying roughly 130
people, while it had a capacity of 50.''

Coast Guard officials said that at least 40 people were still listed as
missing.

More than 730,000 Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, have
fled Myanmar to Bangladesh since a campaign of killing, rape and arson
began against them in 2017. Though both governments have promised the
refugees would imminently return to Myanmar, the promise has not been
kept.

Instead, the Rohingya
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/world/asia/rohingya-refugees-myanmar-bangladesh.html}{live
in miserable conditions} near the Myanmar border at the world's largest
refugee camp. Human trafficking runs rampant, with women sold into sex
slavery and men sent away for indentured servitude.

In January, the International Court of Justice at The Hague ruled that
Myanmar
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-genocide.html}{must
take action to protect the Rohingya}, the first time an international
court has ruled against the country over its treatment of the minority
population. But the court has no enforcement power, and Myanmar rejected
the ruling.
