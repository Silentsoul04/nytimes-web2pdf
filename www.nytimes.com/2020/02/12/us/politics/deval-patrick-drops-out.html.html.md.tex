\section{Deval Patrick, Latecomer to the 2020 Race, Drops
Out}\label{deval-patrick-latecomer-to-the-2020-race-drops-out}}

The former Massachusetts governor had a compelling life story and an
extensive résumé, but his 11th-hour entry into the Democratic primary
hurt him.

Former Gov.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/deval-patrick.html}{Deval
Patrick} of Massachusetts dropped out of the Democratic presidential
race on Wednesday, just three months after entering it, ending a
last-minute campaign that seemed to fizzle out almost as soon as it had
begun.

Mr. Patrick had hoped to capture delegates in his neighboring state of
New Hampshire and to carve away former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}'s support among black voters in South Carolina. But while
Mr. Biden has lost support, Mr. Patrick did not gain any. In the New
Hampshire primary on Tuesday,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/11/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-primary-election.html}{he
received less than 0.5 percent of the vote}.

``I believed and still believe we had a strong case to make for being
able to deliver better outcomes,'' he said in a message to supporters.
``But the vote in New Hampshire last night was not enough for us to
create the practical wind at the campaign's back to go on to the next
round of voting.''

Mr. Patrick was the third candidate to end his campaign after the New
Hampshire primary, following the entrepreneur
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/andrew-yang-drops-out.html}{Andrew
Yang} and Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/michael-bennet-drops-out.html}{Michael
Bennet} of Colorado, both of whom dropped out late Tuesday night.

In South Carolina, local Democratic officials said that while Mr.
Patrick had generated enthusiasm among some older black Democrats, who
remembered him as the second black elected governor in history, he had
little name recognition among younger voters.

And in a significant setback, he failed to secure a spot on the ballot
in Michigan, which will hold its primary on March 10 and will be a key
battleground if the race is undecided after Super Tuesday, one week
earlier. The Michigan Bureau of Elections concluded that Mr. Patrick had
entered the race too late to be automatically included on the ballot,
and that efforts by his supporters to collect enough signatures had
\href{https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/122719_Patrick_Staff_Report_Final_Draft_674771_7.pdf}{fallen
short}.

The departure of Mr. Patrick, who once served as assistant attorney
general for civil rights, leaves just one person of color,
Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, running in a Democratic primary
that began as the most diverse in history.

\subsection{Who's Running for President in
2020?}\label{whos-running-for-president-in-2020}}

The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically
large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive
Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump.

Mr. Patrick
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020-president.html}{began
his campaign} on Nov. 14, reversing his decision a year earlier not to
run. By the time he entered, other candidates had a huge head start.
Four debates had already passed.

He cast himself as the candidate best suited to unite moderates and
progressives amid worries that none of the contenders already in the
field would be able to build a coalition capable of defeating President
Trump. His stump speeches drew from his compelling life story --- he
grew up in poverty on Chicago's South Side before ascending to the upper
echelons of business and politics.

But Mr. Patrick also came to the campaign with some potential baggage,
given a growing progressive movement in the Democratic Party that is
deeply suspicious of big business. His career included positions as
corporate counsel at Texaco and, more recently, as a managing director
at Bain Capital, a private equity firm.

And, unlike
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/michael-bloomberg.html}{Michael
R. Bloomberg}, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who was
also a latecomer to the race, Mr. Patrick did not have enough of a
personal fortune to finance his own campaign. There was also little
evidence that he had a donor base large enough to make up for months of
lost fund-raising.

In his message to supporters on Wednesday, Mr. Patrick expressed
irritation at the focus on the timing of his campaign.

``Many in the media have noted that I entered the race `late,''' he
said. ``As a direct and limiting consequence, I've met many people on
the campaign trail who lament how they wished I had entered the race
sooner. As I hope you know, I entered this race when I could, and not a
moment before I should have. More importantly, I entered the race months
before anyone had cast a vote.''
