FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. — Jalaiah Harmon is coming up in a dance world
completely reshaped by the internet.

She trains in all the traditional ways, taking classes in hip-hop,
ballet, lyrical, jazz, tumbling and tap after school at a dance studio
near her home in the Atlanta suburbs. She is also building a career
online, studying viral dances, collaborating with peers and posting
original choreography.

Recently, a sequence of hers turned into one of the most viral dances
online: [the Renegade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2046dlkjQQ).

There’s basically nothing bigger right now. Teenagers are doing the

Lizzo, Kourtney Kardashian, David Dobrik and members of the K-pop band
[Stray

nearly 26 million followers on the platform, has been affectionately
deemed the dance’s “C.E.O.” for popularizing it.

But the one person who hasn’t been able to capitalize on the attention
is Jalaiah, the Renegade’s 14-year-old creator.

“I was happy when I saw my dance all over,” she said. “But I wanted
credit for it.”

## The Viral Dance-iearchy

TikTok, one of the biggest video apps in the world, has become
synonymous with dance culture. Yet many of its most popular dances,
including the Renegade, Holy Moly Donut Shop, the Mmmxneil and Cookie
Shop have come from young black creators on myriad smaller apps.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most of these dancers identify as Dubsmashers. This means, in essence,
that they use the Dubsmash app and other short-form social video apps,
like Funimate, ‎Likee and Triller, to document choreography to songs
they love. They then post (or cross-post) the videos to Instagram, where
they can reach a wider audience. If it’s popular there, it’s only a
matter of time before the dance is co-opted by the TikTok masses.

“TikTok is like a mainstream Dubsmash,” said Kayla Nicole Jones, 18, a
YouTube star and music artist. “They take from Dubsmash and they run off
with the sauce.”

Polow da Don, a producer, songwriter and rapper who has worked with
Usher and Missy Elliott, said: “Dubsmash catches things at the roots
when they’re culturally relevant. TikTok is the suburban kids that take
things on when it’s already the style and bring it to their community.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though Jalaiah is very much a suburban kid herself — she lives in a
picturesque home on a quiet street outside of Atlanta — she is part of
the young, cutting-edge dance community online that more mainstream
influencers co-opt.

The Renegade dance followed this exact path. On Sept. 25, 2019, Jalaiah
came home from school and asked a friend she had met through Instagram,
[Kaliyah Davis](https://www.instagram.com/chillingwk/), 12, if she
wanted to create a post together. Jalaiah listened to the beats in the
song “Lottery” by the Atlanta rapper K-Camp and then choreographed a
difficult sequence to its chorus, incorporating other viral moves like
the [wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CPtOe3GVwk) and the
[whoa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPNfN63WgXw).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She filmed herself [and posted
it](https://www.instagram.com/p/B22za3xD1Fh/), first to Funimate (where
she has more than 1,700 followers) and then to her more than 20,000
followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_.xoxlaii/) (with a
side-by-side shot of Kaliyah and her performing it together).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I posted on Instagram and it got about 13,000 views, and people started
doing it over and over again,” Jalaiah said. In October, a user named
[@global.jones](https://www.tiktok.com/@global.jones) brought it to
TikTok, changing up some of the moves at the end, and the dance spread
like wildfire. Before long, Charli D’Amelio had posted a video of
herself doing it, as did many other TikTok influencers. None gave
Jalaiah credit.

After long days in the ninth grade and between dance classes, Jalaiah
tried to get the word out. She hopped in the comments of several videos,
asking influencers to tag her. For the most part she was ridiculed or
ignored.

She even set up her own [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@_.xoxlaii)
account and [created a video of
herself](https://www.tiktok.com/@_.xoxlaii/video/6785619884479876358) in
front of a green screen, Googling the question “who created the Renegade
dance?” in an attempt to set the record straight. “I was upset,” she
said. “It wasn’t
fair.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To be robbed of credit on TikTok is to be robbed of real opportunities.
In 2020, virality means income: Creators of popular dances, like the
[Backpack
Kid](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-19/floss-dance-creator-backpack-kids-sues-fortnite/10633962)
or
[Shiggy](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/shiggy-feelings-challenge-changed-life/story?id=59782945),
often amass large online followings and become influencers themselves.
That, in turn, opens the door to brand deals, media opportunities and,
most important for Jalaiah, introductions to those in the professional
dance and choreography community.

Obtaining credit isn’t easy, though. As the writer Rebecca Jennings
[noted in
Vox](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/4/21112444/renegade-tiktok-song-dance)
in an article about the online dance world’s thorny ethics: “Dances are
virtually impossible to legally claim as one’s own.”

But credit and attention are valuable even without legal ownership. “I
think I could have gotten money for it, promos for it, I could have
gotten famous off it, get noticed,” Jalaiah said. “I don’t think any of
that stuff has happened for me because no one knows I made the
dance.”

Cross-platform sharing — of dances, of memes, of information — is how
things are made on the internet. Popular tweets go viral on Instagram,
videos made on Instagram make their way onto YouTube. But in recent
years, several large Instagram meme accounts have faced backlash for
sharing jokes that went viral without crediting the creator.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TikTok was introduced in the United States only a year and a half ago.
Norms, particularly around credit, are still being established. But for
Dubsmashers and those in the Instagram dance community, it’s common
courtesy to tag the handles of dance creators and musicians, and use
hashtags to track the evolution of a dance.

It has set up a culture clash between the two influencer communities.
“On TikTok they don’t give people credit,” said Raemoni Johnson, a
15-year-old Dubsmasher. “They just do the video and they don’t tag us.”
(This acrimony is exacerbated by the fact that TikTok does not make it
easy to find the creator of a dance.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Jan. 17, tensions boiled over after Barrie Segal, the head of content
at Dubsmash, posted a series of videos asking Charli D’Amelio to give a
dance credit to [D1 Nayah](https://www.instagram.com/thereald1.nayah/),
a popular Dubsmash dancer with more than one million followers on
Instagram, for her Donut Shop dance. [TikTok
Room](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7fThb4nSrH/), a gossip account on
Instagram, picked up the controversy, and spurred a sea of comments.

“Why is it so hard to give black creators their credit,” said [one
Instagram commenter](https://www.instagram.com/chickenlegbiz/),
referring to the mostly white TikTokers who have taken dances from
Dubsmashers and posted them without credit. “Instead of using dubsmash,
use tiktok and then ppl would credit you maybe,” a TikToker fan
[said](https://www.instagram.com/annielebob/).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I’m not an argumentative person on social media — I don’t want beef or
anything like that,” said Jhacari Blunt, an 18-year-old Dubsmasher who
has had some of his dances co-opted by TikTokers. “But it’s like, we all
know where that dance came
from.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At this point, if a TikToker doesn’t initially know who did a dance,
commenters will usually tag the original creator’s handle. Charli
D’Amelio and other stars have started giving dance credits and tagging
creators in their captions.

And the creators who are flooding into TikTok from Instagram and
Dubsmash are leading the way by example. “We have 1.7 million followers
and we always give credit whether the person has zero followers or not,”
said Yoni Wicker, 14, one half of the
[TheWickerTwinz](https://www.instagram.com/thewickertwinz/?hl=en). “We
know how important it is. That person who made that dance, they might be
a fan of ours. Us tagging them makes their day.”

## Onward and Upward

Stefanie Harmon, Jalaiah’s mother, learned the true extent of Jalaiah’s
online success only recently. “She told me, ‘Mommy, I made a dance and
it went viral,’” Ms. Harmon said.

“She wasn’t kicking and screaming about the fact that she wasn’t getting
credit,” she added, “but I could tell it had affected her. I said, ‘Why
do you care whether you’re not getting credit? Just make another one.’”

Jalaiah continues to post a steady stream of dance videos to Funimate,
Dubsmash, and Instagram. She said she doesn’t harbor any hard feelings
against Charli D’Amelio for popularizing the Renegade without naming
her. Instead, she hopes she can collaborate with her one day.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Charli D’Amelio, through a publicist, said that she was “so glad to
know” who created the dance. “I know it’s so associated with me,” she
said, “but I’m so happy to give Jalaiah credit and I’d love to
collaborate with her.”

“We’re all inspired by other people,” Jalaiah said. “We make up a dance
and it grows.”

Off the internet, she continues to compete in dance competitions with
her studio and hopes to one day take classes at
[Dance 411](https://www.dance411.com/), a prestigious dance school in
Atlanta. Ultimately, it’s the art form that she loves. “It makes me
happy to dance,” she said.
