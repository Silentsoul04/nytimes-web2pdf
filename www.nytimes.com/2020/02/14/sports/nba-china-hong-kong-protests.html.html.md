# The N.B.A. and China Are Showing Signs of Reconciliation

</div>

They have been at odds since October, but the tension related to
protests in Hong Kong is showing faint signs of easing as the N.B.A.
honors its All-Stars.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The day after Kobe Bryant died, the Chinese ambassador to the United
States, Cui Tiankai, [posted a statement on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmbCuiTiankai/status/1221869773828567040?s=20):
“Saddened by the tragic loss of \#KobeBryant. An inspiration for many
and a legend of his generation, he will always be remembered for his
contribution to the world of sport and to \#ChinaUS people-to-people
exchanges.”

Though Bryant was a huge star in the country — [even the most popular
sports figure, for
awhile](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/sports/basketball/kobe-NBA-global.html)
— the ambassador’s message was notable. China and the N.B.A. have been
on the outs [since
October](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/06/sports/daryl-morey-rockets-china.html),
when Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, shared an
image on Twitter that showed support for the pro-democracy protesters in
Hong Kong. This roiled the Chinese government and instantly derailed
decades of league efforts to court the country’s sizable basketball
audience, initiating a conflict at the rare intersection of sports,
domestic politics, corporate profits and international relations.

Four months later, China is grappling with the coronavirus that has
sickened thousands of its people and disrupted the economy, and as the
N.B.A. embarks on its signature All-Star weekend, in Chicago, there are
signs that tension between the two sides has begun to dissipate, even
beyond the tweet from Cui.

“Right now, our focus is on working with global health organizations to
provide whatever assistance we can to the people of China in response to
the coronavirus outbreak,” N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told The New
York Times on Thursday in an emailed statement. “Many of our Chinese
partners were unable to attend our N.B.A. All-Star events because of
travel restrictions, but all of the weekend’s events will be carried in
China on Tencent.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This, too, is notable. Tencent, the Chinese streaming network, after
initially stopping its coverage, has been showing up to three games a
night. China’s state-run television network, China Central Television,
canceled its broadcasts of the preseason games between the Los Angeles
Lakers and the Nets and several other related league events in the
aftermath of Morey’s tweet. Silver, at a live event soon after, said the
Chinese government had demanded that Morey be fired — [but he
immediately said
no](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/sports/basketball/nba-china-adam-silver.html).
The N.B.A. has not been back on CCTV since.

There are those around the league who believe there is a chance that
CCTV airs the N.B.A. All-Star Game — and more games after that. Joe
Tsai, the co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba and
owner of the Nets, [recently told
Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-01-22/nets-owner-joe-tsai-on-brooklyn-beijing-the-hong-kong-protests),
“Once you’re on the air, everything will come back.” (Tsai declined to
comment.)

At the time of the initial controversy, Yao Ming, the former Rockets
great and chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, was described
as “extremely hot” [by Silver over the
situation](https://apnews.com/aba5856440624249962f0606602e5098). But he
[traveled to the United States last
month](https://www.nba.com/article/2020/01/21/david-stern-memorial-service-story)
to attend a memorial service for David Stern, the former commissioner of
the N.B.A. Silver and Yao spoke at the memorial, according to a source
familiar with the discussion who was not authorized to disclose it
publicly. Last week, Huang Ping, the Chinese consul general, [thanked
the league at a media
briefing](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3049014/coronavirus-chinese-consul-general-new-york-thanks-nba-its)
in New York for donating $1.4 million to the Hubei Province, the center
of the coronavirus, to help fight its spread. Several N.B.A. teams
[marked the Chinese New
Year](https://www.nba.com/nets/news/2020/01/28/brooklyn-nets-host-chinese-culture-night-wednesday-jan-29-barclays-center)
with promotions at their arenas, as they have in other years.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the protests in Hong Kong remain a hot button topic in China, as
the reaction to Morey showed, Kristen Looney, an assistant professor of
Asian studies and government at Georgetown University, said China could
choose to move on as if nothing happened.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They do that occasionally. It’s big business for them too, having the
N.B.A. in China,” Looney said. “Hundreds of millions of people watch
basketball in China — and I know they’re unhappy with lack of access.
But I doubt anything happens during this N.B.A. season, unless the
government decides that bringing the game back would be a welcome
distraction from the public health crisis.”

The stakes are high for the league. Since 2004, the N.B.A. has played 28
games in China. Star players travel every year for promotional tours.
Shoe sales are a major source of revenue for manufacturers. There are
more basketball fans in China, a country with 1.4 billion residents,
than in the U.S., which has a population of 330
million.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>The league maintains
its business in China with about 200 employees in offices in Shanghai,
Beijing, and Hong Kong. It also has an office in Taiwan, the democratic
island claimed by Beijing that has asserted its independence from China.

“I see it as something that’s going to take time,” said Todd Ramasar, an
N.B.A. agent with overseas clients who has also negotiated deals in
China. “I don’t think it’s something as simple as saying this is
centered around the N.B.A. This is much bigger than that.”

The timing of the All-Star game, on Sunday, may be a stroke of good luck
for the N.B.A. because of the larger domestic politics involved. On
Friday, the first phase of the trade deal [struck last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html)
between China and the U.S. [will take
effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal-text.html),
signaling the warmest point in the relationship between the two
countries since President Trump took office.

Earlier this month, at his [State of the
Union](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/politics/state-of-union-transcript.html)
speech, Trump said, “We have perhaps the best relationship we’ve ever
had with China, including with President Xi,” referring to China’s
leader, Xi Jinping. On Feb. 7, Trump [praised Xi for the Chinese
government’s](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1225728755248828416)
response to the coronavirus.

But there is also mixed messaging — an indication of the often fraught
relationship between the two countries. At the end of January, Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo [called the ruling
party](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/europe/pompeo-uk-china-huawei.html)
in China the “the central threat of our times.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is unclear what the business impact of the China fallout has been for
the N.B.A. One indicator is the league’s salary cap, the amount that
each team can spend on player contracts each season. It is determined by
the amount of basketball related income the N.B.A. takes in. Next
season, it is projected to be $116 million, an increase from $109.1
million this season, [according to
ESPN](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1222991117869887490?s=20) — an
indication that the league is in a healthy place. However, projections
can change. And China is one of several external revenue
streams.

There are also critics in America who believe that the league should
limit its dealings with an authoritarian government.

At home, the N.B.A. faced blowback from politicians all over the
spectrum following Morey’s Twitter post, which read “Fight for Freedom.
Stand with Hong Kong.” The critics, including many Democratic
presidential candidates and their ideological foes, like Senator Ted
Cruz of Texas, accused the N.B.A. of capitulating to a repressive regime
to increase its bottom line. The league said at the time that the anger
from the Chinese mainland was “regrettable” and Morey had “deeply
offended many of our friends and fans in China.” The Chinese version of
the statement read differently and said that the league was “extremely
disappointed in the inappropriate comment” by Morey. Morey has not
spoken about the issue publicly since a follow-up [statement in
which](https://twitter.com/dmorey/status/1181000808399114240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1181000808399114240&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2019%2F10%2F06%2Fsports%2Fdaryl-morey-rockets-china.html)
he said he did not mean to “cause any offense.” He declined to comment
for this article.

In the months since, the United States has had to confront the fact that
many businesses have interests in China. Bob Iger, the chief executive
officer of Disney, said at a conference in October [that he would not
criticize](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/disney-s-iger-says-he-won-t-take-position-on-hong-kong-protests)
China’s handling of the Hong Kong protesters because “to take a position
that could harm our company in some form would be a big mistake. I just
don’t believe it’s something we should engage in a public manner.” The
comments went unmentioned by many of the same politicians who blasted
the N.B.A.

Silver has also made clear that he would like the league to make amends
with China, regardless of the optics of doing business with an
oppressive regime. Mike Bass, an N.B.A. spokesman, said the league has
“no plans to stop distributing our games in China.”

“We continue to believe in the unique power of sports to bring people
together across cultures,” Bass said.
