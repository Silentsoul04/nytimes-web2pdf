The sentencing played out amid extraordinary upheaval at the Justice

WASHINGTON — [Roger J. Stone
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/politics/roger-stone-mo-kelly-slur.html),
a longtime friend and adviser of President Trump, was sentenced Thursday
to more than three years in prison in a politically fraught case that
put the president at odds with his attorney general, stirred widespread
consternation in the Justice Department and provoked the judge in the
case to denounce pressure on the justice system.

In announcing the 40-month sentence, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United
States District Court in Washington suggested that attacks on federal
judges, prosecutors and juries should be a wake-up call about the
threats now endangering an independent justice system. While she never
mentioned Mr. Trump by name, her remarks seemed directed at him.

“The dismay and the disgust at the attempts by others to defend his
actions as just business as usual in our polarized climate should
transcend party,” the judge said of Mr. Stone. “The dismay and disgust
at any attempt to interfere with the efforts of prosecutors and members
of the judiciary to fulfill their duty should transcend party.”

The case [was thrown into
disarray](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/roger-stone-sentencing.html)
last week when Attorney General William P. Barr overruled [a sentencing
recommendation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/us/roger-stone-prison-sentence.html)
by four career prosecutors, who then quit the case in protest. Mr. Barr
said he decided on his own that the prosecutors’ request for a prison
term of seven to nine years was too harsh. But his move coincided with
[Mr. Trump’s public
complaints](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/us/politics/trump-william-barr.html)
about the prosecutors’ recommendation and [elicited widespread
criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/us/politics/justice-department-roger-stone-sentencing.html)
that he had bent to the president’s will.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The attorney general, facing a backlash within the department, [asked
Mr. Trump in a nationally televised
interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/us/politics/william-barr-trump.html)
to cease his running commentary about the department’s criminal cases.

Yet less than three hours after Mr. Stone was sentenced, the president
declared he should be “exonerated,” echoing the defense team’s arguments
in detail. Speaking in Las Vegas, he said Mr. Stone was the victim of “a
bad jury” led by an anti-Trump activist And he suggested that he would
use his clemency power to spare Mr. Stone if Judge Jackson did not agree
to a new trial sought by defense lawyers.

A jury in November [convicted Mr. Stone of seven felony
charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/roger-stone-trial-guilty.html),
including lying under oath to a congressional committee and threatening
a witness whose testimony would have exposed those lies. In biting
tones, Judge Jackson dismissed any notion that the case lacked merit.

She said that Mr. Stone hindered a congressional inquiry of national
importance because the truth would have embarrassed the president and
his 2016 campaign. The documentary evidence alone, she said, proved that
Mr. Stone deceived the House Intelligence Committee about his efforts to
obtain information from WikiLeaks about Democratic emails that had been
stolen by Russian operatives who sought to influence the 2016
presidential election.

“He was not prosecuted, as some have complained, for standing up for the
president. He was prosecuted for covering up for the president,” the
judge said. In government inquiries, she added, “the truth still exists.
The truth still matters.” Otherwise, she said, “everyone loses.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Judge Jackson took special umbrage at the defense team’s argument that
Mr. Stone’s deception was of no real consequence. “Sure, defense is free
to say, ‘Who cares?’” she said. “But I will say this: Congress cared.”
So, too, she said, did the Justice Department and U.S. attorney’s
office, which brought the case, and the jurors who heard the
evidence.

“The American people cared. And I care,” she declared.

In his remarks in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump made clear he was not satisfied
with the outcome of the case.

“I’m not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed on a
president of the United States,” he said. “I want the process to play
out. I think that’s the best thing to do because I’d love to see Roger
exonerated — and I’d love to see it happen — because personally I think
he was treated unfairly. ”

He said he would wait to see how the case was ultimately resolved.

“We will watch the process and watch it very closely,” the president
added. “And at some point, I will make a determination. But Roger Stone
and everybody has to be treated fairly. And this has not been a fair
process, OK?”

Judge Jackson, who spent six years in the U.S. attorney’s office in
Washington that handled the case, interrogated the prosecutor who
replaced the four who quit over the change in sentencing recommendation
ordered by Mr. Barr. In a second sentencing recommendation, prosecutors
said “far less” of a prison term than seven to nine years was warranted,
but left the length of incarceration up to the judge.

Why, she asked, had the prosecutors scrapped Justice Department policy —
as well as the usual practice of the office — and sought a more lenient
punishment than advisory sentencing guidelines suggested?

“As I understand it, you are representing the United States of America,”
she told John Crabb Jr., an assistant United States attorney, with a
trace of sarcasm. “I fear you know less about the case, saw less of the
testimony and exhibits than just about every other person in this
courtroom.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Is there anything you would like to say about why you are the one
standing here?” she asked.

Clearly uncomfortable, Mr. Crabb apologized to the judge for “the
confusion the government has caused.” He went out of his way to
compliment her, saying the Justice Department trusted her to decide
because of her expertise in such cases and “this court’s record of
thoughtful analysis and fair sentences.”

Mr. Crabb defended the prosecution as a “righteous” effort to hold Mr.
Stone to account for “serious” crimes. And he said the prosecutors who
resigned from the case were not to blame for the confusion, instead
blaming “a miscommunication” between Mr. Barr and Timothy Shea, the
newly appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia.

“The Department of Justice and the United States attorney’s office is
committed to enforcing the law without fear, favor or political
influence,” he said.

But Mr. Crabb raised yet more questions by simultaneously defending the
argument for a stiff sentence laid out in the office’s first sentencing
memo without disavowing the second sentencing memo that argued for a
lighter punishment.

“I’m not at liberty to discuss internal deliberations,” he said when the
judge pressed him for details. “I apologize.”

Judge Jackson said she agreed with the Justice Department’s second memo
that the sentencing guidelines were too harsh. But she said she wondered
if the government would adopt that same stance in future cases or
whether it was reserved only for Mr. Stone.

The Stone case was one of the last prosecutions arising from the
investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into
Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. Despite the
controversy surrounding it, Judge Jackson said repeatedly on Thursday
that she was treating the case like any ordinary prosecution.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She said she took into account that Mr. Stone is 67 and had no criminal
record. Working against Mr. Stone, she said, was his “belligerence” and
“incendiary” conduct after he was indicted. On social media, Mr. Stone
[posted a photograph of the
judge](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/roger-stone-instagram-judge.html)
with the image of a cross hairs near her head.

In response, Judge Jackson imposed a strict gag order on Mr. Stone, but
she said he violated it even during trial when he appeared to ask the
president, through a proxy, for a pardon. Flouting court orders and
threatening the security of court personnel “is intolerable to the
administration of justice,” she declared.

Much of the debate over Mr. Stone’s sentence revolved around whether he
merely tried to influence a witness not to cooperate or issued a threat
of violence, which under the sentencing guidelines would prompt a far
more substantial penalty.

Initially, the prosecutors asserted that Mr. Stone’s threat of bodily
harm justified a stiffer sentence. So, too, did the fact that he
prevented congressional investigators from discovering the truth and
carried out an extensive scheme over many months to frustrate them, they
said.

Then they appeared to back off, noting that the witness, a New York
radio host named Randy Credico, had written a letter to the judge saying
he never feared that Mr. Stone himself would actually harm him.

Seth Ginsberg, Mr. Stone’s defense lawyer, said that Mr. Stone was
simply engaging in his usual banter. “Mr. Stone is know for using rough,
hyperbolic language,” he said. “There was no threat at all.”

Judge Jackson said Mr. Credico was an “extremely nervous” witness whose
accounts had varied over time. She noted that he had testified to a
grand jury that he had left his home and was wearing a disguise because
he feared he would be in danger if Mr. Stone identified him as “a rat.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

During the trial, Mr. Credico said that he feared Mr. Stone, a
well-known political commentator, would create havoc in his life and
that of a close friend’s if he testified before the House committee. He
ultimately took the Fifth Amendment.

The judge said she could not simply overlook Mr. Stone’s texts to Mr.
Credico, including one that read, “Prepare to die.”

While Mr. Stone clearly enjoyed “adolescent mind games,” she said,
“nothing about this case was a joke. It wasn’t a stunt and it wasn’t a
prank.”
