# Gilead to Expand Coronavirus Drug Trials to Other Countries

</div>

The drug maker said that in March it would begin two more clinical
trials of remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug, in more nations
outside China.

The
[drug](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html)
maker
[Gilead](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html)
Sciences is expanding its clinical trials of the antiviral drug
remdesivir as a possible
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html)
treatment into several countries outside China, the company announced on
Wednesday.

Two new clinical trials of remdesivir are to begin in March, involving
“approximately 1,000 patients at medical centers primarily across
Asian countries, as well as other countries globally with high numbers
of diagnosed cases,” Gilead said in a statement. It did not specify the
countries where the trials will take place.

Remdesivir is [already being tested in Wuhan,
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/health/coronavirus-treatments.html),
the center of the epidemic, and the United States National Institutes of
Health announced on Tuesday that the drug would also be studied in some
of the patients who contracted the illness overseas and were now being
treated in Nebraska.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Results from the trials in Wuhan are expected in April, the company
said.

The drug is still experimental, not yet approved to treat any disease.
There are no approved treatments for illnesses caused by coronaviruses,
including the new one, known as Covid-19. Studies of infected mice and
monkeys have suggested that remdesivir can fight coronaviruses, and it
appeared to cause few side effects when it was tested in patients with
Ebola, although it did not work well against that virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The experimental drug also stirred interest after doctors administered
it to the first coronavirus patient in the United States. The man was
hospitalized in Washington State, and his symptoms seemed to improve.
But the experience of one patient cannot be used to determine whether
any drug works.

Several companies are also working to develop a vaccine for the virus,
which has spread around the globe. The number of cases now exceeds
80,980, and deaths total nearly
3,000.

One of the companies, Moderna, said Monday it had delivered its
experimental vaccine to the N.I.H. for early testing in humans, a
record-setting pace. The nation’s top health officials have cautioned
that development of a vaccine to treat large populations might take a
year or more.

Researchers are trying to determine which patients remdesivir might help
most, by giving the drug to people who are severely ill and also some
who are not as sick. They also hope to find out how long a course of
treatment is needed.

“Because it’s an outbreak and we try to target people who stand to have
a clear benefit, first we target people who are symptomatic, so they are
hospitalized,” Dr. Diana Brainard, Gilead’s senior vice president for
H.I.V. and emerging viruses, said in an interview. “There is a precedent
in respiratory viral infections, that the earlier you treat, the better,
and there may be a threshold beyond which it doesn’t make sense to
treat.”

On the other hand, she said, if the drug does help severely ill
patients, that could be its greatest impact.

Another goal of the new trial is to find out if a shorter course of
treatment will work. If a shorter duration does work, she said, “that
automatically doubles the drug supply.” Faster treatment would also get
patients out of the hospital faster, lessen their exposure to
hospital-based infections and make room for more patients, she added.

“We are looking for ways we can help the world prepare as well as
possible for what appears to be a pandemic at this point,” Dr. Brainard
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

One of the new trials will include 400 severely ill patients, who will
be picked at random to receive either five days or 10 days of treatment
with the drug, which must be given intravenously.

The other trial will involve 600 moderately ill patients. Along with
standard care — oxygen if needed, fluids, medicines for pain and fever —
a third will receive the drug for five days, and a third for 10 days.
The last third will receive standard care alone.

In the last month, Gilead’s stock has risen 17 percent, to $74.70 at the
close of markets Wednesday from $68.80 in late January.
