The drug maker said that in March it would begin two more clinical
trials of remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug, in more nations
outside China.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html}{Gilead}
Sciences is expanding its clinical trials of the antiviral drug
remdesivir as a possible
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/health/coronavirus-antiviral-drugs.html}{coronavirus}
treatment into several countries outside China, the company announced on
Wednesday.

Two new clinical trials of remdesivir are to begin in March, involving
``approximately 1,000 patients at medical centers primarily across Asian
countries, as well as other countries globally with high numbers of
diagnosed cases,'' Gilead said in a statement. It did not specify the
countries where the trials will take place.

Remdesivir is
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/health/coronavirus-treatments.html}{already
being tested in Wuhan, China}, the center of the epidemic, and the
United States National Institutes of Health announced on Tuesday that
the drug would also be studied in some of the patients who contracted
the illness overseas and were now being treated in Nebraska.

Results from the trials in Wuhan are expected in April, the company
said.

The drug is still experimental, not yet approved to treat any disease.
There are no approved treatments for illnesses caused by coronaviruses,
including the new one, known as Covid-19. Studies of infected mice and
monkeys have suggested that remdesivir can fight coronaviruses, and it
appeared to cause few side effects when it was tested in patients with
Ebola, although it did not work well against that virus.

The experimental drug also stirred interest after doctors administered
it to the first coronavirus patient in the United States. The man was
hospitalized in Washington State, and his symptoms seemed to improve.
But the experience of one patient cannot be used to determine whether
any drug works.

Several companies are also working to develop a vaccine for the virus,
which has spread around the globe. The number of cases now exceeds
80,980, and deaths total nearly 3,000.

One of the companies, Moderna, said Monday it had delivered its
experimental vaccine to the N.I.H. for early testing in humans, a
record-setting pace. The nation's top health officials have cautioned
that development of a vaccine to treat large populations might take a
year or more.

Researchers are trying to determine which patients remdesivir might help
most, by giving the drug to people who are severely ill and also some
who are not as sick. They also hope to find out how long a course of
treatment is needed.

``Because it's an outbreak and we try to target people who stand to have
a clear benefit, first we target people who are symptomatic, so they are
hospitalized,'' Dr. Diana Brainard, Gilead's senior vice president for
H.I.V. and emerging viruses, said in an interview. ``There is a
precedent in respiratory viral infections, that the earlier you treat,
the better, and there may be a threshold beyond which it doesn't make
sense to treat.''

On the other hand, she said, if the drug does help severely ill
patients, that could be its greatest impact.

Another goal of the new trial is to find out if a shorter course of
treatment will work. If a shorter duration does work, she said, ``that
automatically doubles the drug supply.'' Faster treatment would also get
patients out of the hospital faster, lessen their exposure to
hospital-based infections and make room for more patients, she added.

``We are looking for ways we can help the world prepare as well as
possible for what appears to be a pandemic at this point,'' Dr. Brainard
said.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

One of the new trials will include 400 severely ill patients, who will
be picked at random to receive either five days or 10 days of treatment
with the drug, which must be given intravenously.

The other trial will involve 600 moderately ill patients. Along with
standard care --- oxygen if needed, fluids, medicines for pain and fever
--- a third will receive the drug for five days, and a third for 10
days. The last third will receive standard care alone.

In the last month, Gilead's stock has risen 17 percent, to \$74.70 at
the close of markets Wednesday from \$68.80 in late January.
