NEW DELHI — To many in the eastern Delhi neighborhood where a convulsion
of religious violence erupted this week, it all began with one man.

Kapil Mishra, a local politician with India’s leading Hindu nationalist
party, had just lost an election. Acquaintances in the area, which now
feels like a war zone, said he had been looking for a way to bounce
back.

Mr. Mishra, 39, is known for his outspoken views and flexible politics.
As an upper-caste Hindu from a political family, he had worked for
Amnesty International and Greenpeace, and risen in the ranks of one of
India’s most progressive political organizations. But several years ago
he shifted allegiance across the political spectrum to the Bharatiya
Janata Party, India’s current governing party, which has deep roots in
Hindu supremacist ideology.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Sunday, he appeared at a rally against a group of protesters (most of
them women) who were objecting to [a new citizenship
law](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/world/asia/india-citizenship-protests.html)
widely seen as discriminatory toward Muslims. There he vented his anger
in a fiery speech in which he issued an ultimatum to the police: either
clear out the demonstrators, who were blocking a main road, or he and
his followers would do it
themselves.

Within hours, the worst Hindu-Muslim violence in India in years was
exploding. Gangs of Hindus and Muslims fought each other with swords and
bats, shops burst into flames, chunks of bricks sailed through the air,
and mobs rained blows on cornered men.

*\[Update:* [*Violence continues in New Delhi, and the police are
criticized*](http://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/india-violence-hindu-muslim.html)*.\]*

Many Indians, including Hindus, **** believe that Mr. Mishra and his
Hindu nationalist supporters have weaponized a very dangerous mood. In a
Hindu majority nation, with a Hindu nationalist government that has
allowed the [killers of Muslims to go
unpunished,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/asia/india-cow-religious-attacks.html)
fear has been growing that violent Hindu extremism could spin out of
control.

“Kapil Mishra should be in jail,” said Rupesh Bathla, a businessman who
says he has known Mr. Mishra since they were teenagers. “He started
communal riots. He planted hatred in other people’s hearts.”

By Wednesday, at least 25 people had died, hospital officials said, most
from gunshot wounds. Several witnesses said that the live fire came from
the direction of the police officers, and the dead included Hindus as
well as Muslims.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though property belonging to Hindus was burned, the destruction was much
heavier on the Muslim side. In Muslim areas, shop after shop was
destroyed and entire markets were burned down. Dozens of Muslim
residents have accused police officers of standing passively by while
the destruction was underway.

On Wednesday, the few people out on the streets walked quietly past the
blackened car hulks and smashed homes. The whiff of charred materials
still hung in the air, in what some scholars said was an eerie echo of
previous religious bloodletting in India.

“On the whole, the Delhi riots of this week are now beginning to look
like a pogrom, à la Gujarat 2002 and Delhi 1984,” said Ashutosh
Varshney, the director of the Center for Contemporary South Asia at
Brown University.

While the death toll is nowhere near that of those earlier bouts, the
episodes shared a disturbing similarity, Mr. Varshney said, with “mobs
unleashing savage violence while the cops look away, or join the mob,
instead of neutrally intervening to crush the riot.”

With the violence cooling down for the moment, Prime Minister Narendra
Modi, who hosted President Trump as the fighting raged, broke his
silence on Wednesday after Mr. Trump had departed, urging people[in a
Twitter
post](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1232581653916155912) to
“maintain peace and brotherhood at all times.” He added, “Peace and
harmony are central to our ethos.”

As night fell on Wednesday, a few sporadic attacks were reported, but no
large-scale mayhem. The police, armed now with assault rifles, had been
reinforced with paramilitary troops.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the area that suffered the worst in the fighting, many residents laid
blame on Mr. Mishra, who declined a request for an interview. But [in a
Twitter
post](https://twitter.com/KapilMishra_IND/status/1232292773581217794?s=20),
he said, “It’s not a crime to ask for blocked roads to be opened. It’s
not a crime to tell the truth. I don’t fear this massive hate campaign
against me.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Mishra had said in his speech that he did not want to create trouble
before Mr. Trump left the country on Tuesday night. But as Sunday
evening approached, gangs of Hindu and Muslim men began throwing rocks
at one another, and that quickly spawned far greater violence.

At a court hearing on the riots on Wednesday, a judge pressed police
officials about why they had not watched videos of Mr. Mishra’s
incendiary speech — an indication, the judge implied, that they had not
seriously investigated the sources of the violence.

“This is really concerning,” said the judge, S. Muralidhar, according to
[LiveLaw](https://twitter.com/LiveLawIndia/status/1232617825820381184),
a legal news website. “There are so many TVs in your office, how can a
police officer say that he hasn’t watched the videos? I’m really
appalled by the state of affairs of the Delhi Police.”

Mr. Mishra’s supporters said the majority of people in the community had
backed his effort to evict the protesters. “How could our kids get to
school with those protesters blocking the road?” said Alok Kumar Gupta,
a retired military officer who lives near the protest area. “Kapil
Mishra was only trying to
help.”

But others wonder if Mr. Mishra was trying to make a name for himself in
Hindu nationalist circles. He had been elected to the local assembly in
Delhi in 2015 from the progressive Aam Aadmi Party, but eventually fell
out with his colleagues and defected to Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata
Party, or B.J.P.

He then started espousing Hindu nationalist views and vilifying Muslims,
more out of political expediency than true belief, argued Mr. Bathla,
who claims to have known Mr. Mishra for 30 years.

“When he was younger he wasn’t like that,” he said. “He was chill.”

Just a few weeks before the Feb. 8 local assembly elections, Mr. Mishra
posted what was widely viewed as an incendiary Twitter message, framing
the contest as [“India vs
Pakistan.”](https://twitter.com/KapilMishra_IND/status/1220213605359992833)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After he lost the race, several people said he took the hard line
against the mostly Muslim protesters as a way to improve his standing in
the B.J.P.

“He wasn’t getting much attention from the higher-ups,” said Hasrat Ali,
a legal officer who lives the same area where Mr. Mishra’s family lived
for many years. “This was all a plan to get a firmer position.”

At least one other politician in Mr. Modi’s party is now distancing
himself from Mr. Mishra. “Whoever has done this, strict action must be
taken,” said the politician, Gautam Gambhir, a member of Parliament from
the area. “Kapil Mishra’s speech is not acceptable.”

Indian citizens, have flared intermittently since December. There has
been a subtext of religious differences, with most of India’s Muslims
objecting to the law and many Hindus supporting it. But this past week
was the first time the protests turned large numbers of Hindus and
Muslims violently against one
another.

Most of India’s Muslims distrust the B.J.P. and point to the [sectarian
killing
frenzy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/06/world/asia/modi-gujarat-riots-timeline.html#/#time287_8514)
that claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people, almost 800 of them
Muslims, in Gujarat State in 2002 when Mr. Modi was its chief minister.

Mr. Modi and his state government were accused of quietly ordering the
police to stand by as the violence raged. He has denied those
accusations, and in 2012, an investigative panel for the Supreme Court
[found no evidence to support
them.](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/SIT-report-clears-Modi--61-others/935226)

But until he became prime minister in 2014, Mr. Modi was banned from
entering the United States. And since he came to power, violence against
Muslims, including [mob
lynchings](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/asia/india-cow-religious-attacks.html),
has increased sharply.

Muslim families in northeast Delhi are now abandoning their homes.
Several said in interviews that they no longer felt safe.

Asgar Ali, whose grocery shop was burned to the ground on Tuesday, said
there was no difference between police officers and Hindu mobs. He said
he was fleeing his home, where he had lived for 20 years, knowing that
he might never return.
