# The Political Pundits of TikTok

Teenagers are campaigning, debating, running fact checks and forming

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As Twitter and Facebook continue to dominate conversations about social
media and the 2020 presidential election, TikTok is quietly becoming a
political force.

Teenagers in America — many of them too young to vote — are forming
political coalitions on TikTok to campaign for their chosen candidates,
post news updates and fact check opponents. They are sharing real-time
commentary for an audience that is far more likely to watch YouTube
videos than turn on a cable news channel.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a sense, these TikTok users are building short-form TV networks, each
with a cast of talking heads. On TikTok they’re called hype houses,
named after the high-powered [influencer collab house in Los
Angeles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html).
These political houses are not physical homes, but virtual, ideological
ones represented by group accounts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are conservative-leaning houses
([@conservativehypehouse](https://www.tiktok.com/@conservativehypehouse),
[@theconservativehypehouse](https://www.tiktok.com/@theconservativehypehouse),
[@TikTokrepublicans](https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktokrepublicans) and
[@therepublicanhypehouse](https://www.tiktok.com/@therepublicanhypehouse),
which amassed more than 217,000 followers in under a month) and liberal
ones ([@liberalhypehouse](https://www.tiktok.com/@liberalhypehouse),
[@leftist.hype.house](https://www.tiktok.com/@leftist.hype.house)).
There are also [bipartisan](https://www.tiktok.com/@camdean699) houses,
for users who love discourse, and undecided houses, for those who aren’t
sure what or whom they love.

“I do feel like TikTok is cable news for young people,” said Sterling
Cade Lewis, 19, who has nearly 100,000 followers. “CNN and Fox and
big-name news media, those are all geared toward people who have
honestly grown up with a longer attention span.”

TikToks, on the other hand, run a maximum of 60 seconds; most videos are
as short as 15. “Being able to make shorter videos and educational
clips, it’s easier to connect with a younger generation who’s just
swiping through their phones 24/7,” Mr. Lewis said.

In recent months, content on TikTok has been [getting more
political](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/22/21069469/tiktok-memes-funny-ww3-politics-impeachment-fires).
Before the general election in Britain in December, TikTok users there
[voiced their opinions on
Brexit](https://www.dazeddigital.com/politics/article/47105/1/general-election-tiktok-memes-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-tory-labour)
through popular formats, including lip syncs, skits and “checks”
(self-assessments, essentially). In the United States, political videos
have revolved around the Trump administration, the Democratic
presidential primary and the general presidential election in
November.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The nickname “[Mayo
Pete](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/mayo-pete-memes-buttigieg-tiktok-teens),”
for example, was popularized on TikTok, as was [a popular
meme](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/camp-pence-tiktok-memes-lgbtq-conversion-therapy)
about Mike Pence, suggesting that he is in favor of gay conversion
therapy. (Vice President Pence is opposed to same-sex marriage, but [he
has never voiced support for conversion
therapy](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/us/politics/mike-pence-and-conversion-therapy-a-history.html).).
Political hype houses were born out of this enthusiasm for
election-related content.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Political TikToks often rely on popular trends and dances. In one video,
Kyndal, 14 and a member of @liberalhypehouse, does a dance as she points
to statistics about President Trump’s history of racist
comments.

For the most part, these videos revolve around two candidates: Bernie
Sanders and Mr. Trump. “The Republican hype houses all root for Trump,
and the liberal hype houses all root for Bernie,” said Javon Fonville,
19, the founder of [the progressive hype
house](https://www.tiktok.com/@votebernie2020) (handle:
@votebernie2020).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many users are campaigning hard, especially because they may not be of
voting age in time for Nov. 3. “I feel like I am making an impact on the
election even though I can’t vote,” Izzy, 17, said of her pro-Sanders
TikToks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many of these creators look up to YouTube’s political commentators and
have sought to replicate their success on TikTok, where growth can
happen rapidly. [Benjamin
Williams](https://www.tiktok.com/@beanjaminpolitics), 19, said the
platform is ideal for the kind of videos he wants to make and the
audience he hopes to reach. “A lot of political stuff is on Facebook and
Twitter, but Gen Z isn’t really into that stuff,” he said. “With TikTok
you can put politics into comedy and have someone their age talking like
they’re a friend.”

Mr. Williams said he is inspired by YouTubers like Steven Crowder, Tim
Pool and Paul Joseph Watson, a prominent far-right personality and
Infowars contributor who is known for spreading conspiracy theories.

Speaking of which: TikTok has struggled to prevent conspiracy theories
from spreading across the app. Media Matters, a nonprofit, [recently
issued a
report](https://www.mediamatters.org/fake-news/tiktok-hosting-videos-spreading-misinformation-about-coronavirus-despite-platforms-new)
on the platform’s role in spreading false information on the
coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/style/politics-tiktok-5/politics-tiktok-5-superJumbo.jpg)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It worries me a lot that some of these videos have one million views,”
Kyndal, of @liberalhypehouse, said, referring to the misinformation on
the platform. “Knowing that one million impressionable teens have seen
this video and chosen to believe or not believe it.”

A TikTok spokeswoman wrote in an email: “We encourage our users to have
respectful conversations about the subjects that matter to them.
However, our Community Guidelines do not permit misinformation that
could cause harm to our community or the larger public.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For many members of political hype houses, tamping down on
misinformation is a top concern. When various accounts began citing the
claim that Mr. Sanders intended to tax Americans making more than
$29,000 a year at a rate higher than 50 percent, Jordan Tirona, 19,
responded with a video debunking it.

Though they disagree on major issues, members of different political
groups frequently engage with each other. Their videos often go viral
when they “duet” on major issues. (Duetting is a feature on TikTok that
allows users to respond to videos with videos of their own and post them
side by
side.)

</div>

</div>

![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/style/politics-tiktok3/politics-tiktok3-superJumbo.jpg)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The @republicanhypehouse and @liberalhypehouse accounts frequently duet
over [health care reform and corporate tax
rates](https://vm.tiktok.com/bq32C5/). TikTokers across the partisan
divide also take part in live-streamed debates on TikTok.

Cam Higby, 20, the founder of the bipartisan hype house who also posts
under @[republicanism](https://www.tiktok.com/@republicanism), said that
ultimately he wants to build a platform on TikTok where anyone can
promote their opinions, whether they’re on the right or left. He
live-streams himself for hours, debating people on TikTok and Discord.

Many members of Gen Z will be voting for the first time in the 2020
presidential election. Those who can’t have been taking political action
in other ways, especially on social media.

“I think it’s cool when you have people who are like 14 trying to get
involved in politics and educate themselves,” Mr. Higby said. “Those are
the people — they’re not voting this year, but they’ll be voting within
the next
term.”
