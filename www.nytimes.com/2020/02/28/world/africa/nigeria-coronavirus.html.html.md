# Nigeria Responds to First Coronavirus Case in Sub-Saharan Africa

</div>

The illness was diagnosed in an Italian who landed in Lagos, the
country’s largest city and one of the continent’s biggest
metropolises. Nigeria acted quickly, but there are fears that the virus
could sweep the region.

DAKAR, Senegal — An Italian contractor who flew into
[Nigeria](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/africa/aid-workers-executed-nigeria.html)
from Milan became sub-Saharan Africa’s first confirmed coronavirus
patient on Friday, stoking concern that an outbreak on the continent
could overwhelm already strained health care systems.

The patient, a young man, had no symptoms when he landed this week in
Lagos, traveled 60 miles north to the cement factory where he works and
developed a fever there, a Nigerian health commissioner said to
reporters.

The appearance of the first case in Lagos — a city of 20 million people
and the economic capital of Africa’s most populous nation — set off
fear, rumors and panicked buying of hand sanitizer and face masks. It
also posed a test for the Nigerian medical system, which like others in
Africa, has been preparing for the virus to arrive for weeks.

“I feel scared,” said Karo Otitifore, an elementary schoolteacher
waiting at a bus stop in Yaba, the Lagos suburb where the Italian
patient was being treated. “I try to sit tight, squeeze my whole body so
that I won’t have to have too much body contact with people.”

Public health officials have been warning that [the coronavirus could be
devastating in
Africa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/africa/africa-coronavirus-china.html),
a continent with relatively weak health care and disease surveillance
systems. So the Nigerian health system — which had gained a reputation
for efficiently containing cases during the Ebola epidemic in 2014 —
responded quickly to the appearance of a suspected case of coronavirus.

The young Italian was sent back to Lagos, where he is being treated in a
hospital facility that had been set aside to handle coronavirus, while a
team of epidemiologists traces his contacts.

Dr. Ngozi Erondu, an associate fellow in the Global Health Program at
Chatham House, an international research group in London, said Nigeria’s
confirmation of the coronavirus case in just two days was “a very
positive reflection of the disease surveillance and laboratory capacity
in
Nigeria.”

But it will be key, she said, for all African countries to enhance
scrutiny of travelers, especially those coming from countries with
documented outbreaks.

The coronavirus, which emerged in central China late last year, has
spread to almost 50 countries, sickening about 84,000 people and killing
nearly 3,000 — mostly in mainland China. But in recent weeks, the virus
has spread across the globe with outbreaks in Iran, Japan, South Korea
and Italy, especially in Milan.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To date, 26 African countries [have reported suspected coronavirus
cases](http://www.africacdc.org/press-centre/news/123-outbreak-update-on-the-ongoing-novel-coronavirus-global-epidemic-issue-6-25-feb-2020),
according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only
three countries on the continent — Algeria and Egypt in North Africa —
and now Nigeria in the sub-Saharan region, have announced confirmed
cases. The case in Algeria was an Italian [who arrived in the
country](https://www.afro.who.int/news/second-covid-19-case-confirmed-africa)
on Feb. 17, according to the World Health Organization.

Global health experts had anticipated that the virus would most likely
spread to Africa from China, which has increased its ties with Africa
enormously over the past two decades.

To combat the potential spread of the deadly outbreak, airlines
including Egypt Air, Kenya Airways and South African Airways have
suspended their flights to China.

Ethiopian Airlines, which operates the largest number of flights between
China and Africa, has refused to follow suit despite widespread
criticism from political and business leaders across the continent.

The Kenyan government [faced
criticism](https://twitter.com/dailynation/status/1233224185444552704)
this week for allowing China Southern Airlines to [resume
flights](https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1232735617446010881) from
Guangzhou Province in China to Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. The
government said that all 239 passengers on the first plane after the
service restarted had been screened onboard, cleared and advised to
self-quarantine for 14 days. But on social media, many expressed outrage
about the flights, calling officials negligent.

On Friday, after numerous lawsuits were filed against the government,
Kenya’s high court temporarily suspended flights from China for ten
days.

The [Ebola
outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/the-ebola-outbreak-in-west-africa)
that ravaged Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea five years ago is still
fresh in the minds of West Africans. Many are fearful that their
governments are not much better prepared to detect, respond to and
contain outbreaks than they were then.

A continentwide Center for Disease Control has since been established
and has been coordinating efforts across the continent. The Africa
C.D.C., in collaboration with the W.H.O., has worked with countries to
improve their surveillance and testing
processes.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Currently, 26 laboratories [are able to
test](https://www.afro.who.int/news/who-pledges-support-african-countries-joint-coronavirus-disease-preparedness-and-response)
for the coronavirus on the continent, up from just two in early
February, according to the W.H.O. The Africa C.D.C. has shipped one
thousand test kits to Nigeria.

Nigerians expressed some confidence in their government’s ability to
contain coronavirus on Friday, stemming from their experience with the
Ebola epidemic, which experts say appears to be far more deadly than the
coronavirus.

A Liberian-American who brought Ebola to Lagos in 2014 was prevented
from leaving a clinic, his contacts were traced and 900 people were
monitored. He and a doctor and six other people died — a number many
epidemiologists considered mercifully low given that more than 11,000
people died in the West African outbreak, which lasted from 2014 to
2016.

However, Lagos is a city that contains both extreme wealth and poverty,
and if the virus gets into its poorest areas, the lack of adequate
housing and sanitation among people living in cramped conditions could
cause it to spread at breakneck speed, a public health expert said.

In Lagos on Friday, people across the city were hurriedly buying hand
sanitizer, face masks and in the shaky hope it would make a difference,
vitamin C supplements.

“Somebody came in and just bought all our vitamin C. People have been
constantly asking for it,” said Eniola Okunnuga, a pharmacist at one of
the biggest pharmacies in Lagos.

Unfounded rumors spread rapidly that bathing in water laced with ginger
and garlic would protect against the virus, particularly on the
messaging service WhatsApp. But sound advice also circulated, about
washing hands and keeping away from people with coughs.

Mr. Otitifore, the schoolteacher, scoffed at old wives’ tales about
ginger and garlic, but also repeated some rumors he had given credence
to. Drinking a lot of water would wash the virus down so that stomach
acid could attack it, he said.

He waited at a crowded bus stop for a bus crammed with passengers. A
recent ban — unrelated to coronavirus — on the city’s fleet of
motorcycle taxis and auto-rickshaws meant that many Lagosians are in
even closer contact than usual, raising the risk of exposure should the
virus spread.

Oluwatosin Adeshokan contributed reporting from Lagos, Nigeria, and
Simon Marks from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
