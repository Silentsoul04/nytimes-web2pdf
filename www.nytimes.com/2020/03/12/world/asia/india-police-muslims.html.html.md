# How Delhi’s Police Turned Against Muslims

More evidence has emerged that the Indian police took part in violence
against Muslims or stood aside during fighting in the capital last
month.

NEW DELHI — Kaushar Ali, a house painter, was trying to get home when he
ran into a battle.

Hindu and Muslim mobs were hurling rocks at each other, blocking a
street he needed to cross to get to his children. Mr. Ali, who is
Muslim, said that he turned to some police officers for help. That was
his mistake.

The officers threw him onto the ground, he said, and cracked him on the
head. They started beating him and several other Muslims. As the men lay
bleeding, begging for mercy — one of them died two days later from
internal injuries — the officers laughed, jabbed them with their sticks
and made them sing the national anthem. That abuse, on Feb. 24, was
[captured on
video](https://www.altnews.in/video-verification-delhi-cops-beating-injured-men-forcing-them-to-sing-national-anthem/).

“The police were toying with us,” Mr. Ali said. He recalled them saying,
“Even if we kill you, nothing will happen to us.”

So far, they have been right.

India has suffered its worst sectarian bloodshed in years, in what many
here see as the inevitable result of [Hindu
extremism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/world/asia/india-modi-hindus.html)
that has flourished under the government of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi. His party has embraced a militant brand of Hindu nationalism and
its leaders have openly vilified Indian Muslims. In recent months Mr.
Modi has presided over a raft of policies widely seen as anti-Muslim,
such as erasing the statehood of what had been India’s only
Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, more evidence is emerging that the Delhi police, who are under the
direct command of Mr. Modi’s government and have very few Muslim
officers, concertedly moved against Muslims and at times actively helped
the Hindu mobs that rampaged in New Delhi in late February, burning down
Muslim homes and targeting Muslim families.

  - [Several videos showed police officers beating and throwing rocks at
    Muslim
    protesters](https://scroll.in/video/955020/the-police-told-us-to-throw-stones-bbc-meets-delhi-residents-who-took-part-in-communal-violence)
    and waving on Hindu mobs to join them.

<!-- end list -->

  - A police commander said that as the violence erupted — at that point
    mostly by Hindu mobs — officers in the affected areas were ordered
    to deposit their guns at the station houses. Several officers during
    the violence were later overheard by New York Times journalists
    yelling to one another that they had only sticks and that they
    needed guns to confront the growing mobs. Some researchers accuse
    the police force of deliberately putting too few officers on the
    streets, with inadequate firepower, as the violence morphed from
    clashes between rival protesters into targeted killings of Muslims.

<!-- end list -->

  - Two thirds of the more than 50 people who were killed and have been
    identified were Muslim. Human rights activists are calling it an
    organized massacre.

  - Though India’s population is 14 percent Muslim and New Delhi’s is 13
    percent, the total Muslim representation on the Delhi police force
    is less than 2 percent.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

India’s policing culture has long been brutal, biased, anti-minority and
almost colonial in character, a holdover from the days of British rule
when the police had no illusions of serving the public but were used to
suppress a restive population.

But what seems to be different now, observers contend, is how profoundly
India’s law enforcement machinery has been politicized by the Bharatiya
Janata Party, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist governing
bloc.

Police officials, especially in states controlled by Mr. Modi’s party,
have been highly selective in their targets, like [a Muslim school
principal in Karnataka who was jailed for more than two weeks on
sedition
charges](https://scroll.in/article/951915/karnatakas-sedition-case-against-parent-and-teacher-for-a-school-play-is-absurd-and-illegal)
after her students performed a play about a new immigration law that
police officials said was critical of Mr. Modi.

Some judges have also seemed to be caught up — or pushed out — by a
Hindu-nationalist wave.

A [Delhi judge who expressed
disbelief](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/world/asia/india-hindu-muslim-violence-modi.html)
that the police had yet to investigate members of Mr. Modi’s party who
have been [widely accused of
instigating](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/world/asia/delhi-riots-kapil-mishra.html)
the recent violence in Delhi was taken off the case and transferred to
another state. And at the same time that the Supreme Court has made a
string of rulings in the government’s favor, one of the judges, Arun
Mishra, publicly praised [Mr. Modi as a “visionary
genius.”](https://in.video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=yhs-trp-001&hsimp=yhs-001&hspart=trp&p=video+of+justice+arun+mishra+parising+narendra+modi#id=51&vid=86959a2615bb2d949c65c611e8811221&action=click)

All of this is emboldening Hindu extremists on the street.

The religiously mixed and extremely crowded neighborhoods in
northeastern Delhi that were on fire in late February have cooled. But
some Hindu politicians continue to lead so-called peace marches,
trotting out casualties of the violence with their heads wrapped in
white medical tape, trying to upend the narrative and make Hindus seem
like the victims, which is stoking more anti-Muslim hatred.

Some Muslims are leaving their neighborhoods, having lost all faith in
the police. More than 1,000 have piled into a camp for internally
displaced people that is rising on Delhi’s
outskirts.

Muslim leaders see the violence as a state-sanctioned campaign to teach
them a lesson. After years of staying quiet as [Hindu lynch mobs killed
Muslims with
impunity](https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/02/18/violent-cow-protection-india/vigilante-groups-attack-minorities)
and Mr. Modi’s government chipped away at their political power, India’s
Muslim population awoke in December and poured into the streets, [along
with many other
Indians](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/world/asia/india-protests-aishe-ghosh.html),
to protest the new immigration law, which favors migrants belonging to
every major religion in South Asia — [except for
Muslims.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/world/asia/india-muslims-citizenship-narendra-modi.html)

Mr. Modi’s government, Muslim leaders say, is now trying to drive the
whole community back into silence.

“There’s a method to this madness,” said Umar Khalid, a Muslim activist.
“The government wants to bring the entire Muslim community to their
knees, to beg for their lives and beg for their livelihoods.”

“You can read it in their books," he said, referring to foundational
texts by Hindu nationalists. “They believe India’s Muslims should live
in perpetual fear.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Modi has said little since the bloodshed erupted, except for a [few
anodyne
tweets](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1232581653916155912?lang=en)
urging peace. Delhi police officials deny an anti-Muslim bias and said
they “acted swiftly to control law and order,” which both Muslims and
Hindus in those neighborhoods have said was not true. The police
responded “without favoring any person on religious lines or otherwise,”
according to a written reply to questions, provided by M.S. Randhawa, a
police spokesman.

Police officials said that Mr. Ali and the other Muslim men were hurt by
protesters and rescued by the police — though videos clearly show them
being hit by police officers. Police officials also pointed out that one
officer was killed and more than 80 injured; [videos show a huge crowd
of Muslim protesters attacking outnumbered
officers](https://www.facebook.com/520830984697574/posts/2861380863975896/?vh=e&d=n).

The violence in New Delhi fits a pattern, experts say, of chaos being
allowed to rage for a few days — with minorities being killed — before
the government brings it under
control.

In 1984, under the Congress party, which often bills itself as
representing the interests of minorities, the police in New Delhi stood
back for several days as mobs massacred 3,000 Sikhs.

In 1993, again under a Congress government, riots swept Mumbai and
hundreds of Muslims were killed.

In 2002 in Gujarat, when Mr. Modi was the state’s chief minister, [Hindu
mobs massacred hundreds of
Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/27/world/religious-riots-loom-over-indian-politics.html).
Mr. Modi was accused of complicity, though he was cleared by a court.

Several retired Indian police commanders said that the rule in quelling
communal violence was to deploy maximum force and make many arrests,
neither of which happened in Delhi.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ajai Raj Sharma, a former commissioner, called the performance
“unexplainable.” “It can’t be forgiven,” he said.

When the violence started on Feb. 23 — as Hindu men gathered to forcibly
eject a peaceful Muslim protest near their neighborhood — much of it
became two-sided. By day’s end, both Muslims and Hindus had been
attacked, and dozens had been shot, apparently with small-bore homemade
guns.

But by Feb. 25 the direction had changed. Hindu mobs fanned out and
targeted Muslim families. Violence crackled in the air.

Police officers watched as mobs of Hindus, their foreheads marked by
saffron stripes, prowled the streets with baseball bats and rusty bars,
looking for Muslims to kill. The sky was filled with smoke. Muslim
homes, shops and mosques were burned down.

When a reporter for The New York Times tried to speak to residents
standing near police officers that day, a mob of men with darting eyes
surrounded him and ripped the notebook out of his hands. When the
reporter asked police officers for help, one said: “I can’t. These young
men are very volatile.”

The home ministry, which controls Delhi’s police force and is led by
Amit Shah, one of the most combative Hindu nationalists in the B.J.P.,
has come under heavy criticism for the policing failures. Delhi police
officials denied being instructed by the central government to go easy
on the troublemakers. The home ministry did not respond to repeated
requests for comment.

On Thursday, [during a debate in
parliament](https://twitter.com/bjp4india/status/1238089841469874178?s=21),
Mr. Shah vowed to bring the culprits to justice, “regardless of their
caste, religion or political affiliations.’’ He has defended the police
and called the violence a conspiracy, saying investigators found links
to the Islamic State. Many observers question how much, if at all, the
Islamic State had anything to do with what unfolded.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And then there’s the composition of the police. The Delhi force,
numbering around 80,000, has fewer than 2,000 Muslim officers and just a
handful of Muslim commanders, according to an [analysis done
in 2017](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/muslims-in-delhi-police-jobs-delhi-police-recruitment-crime-in-delhi-national-crime-records-bureau-4936111/lite/)
by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. Delhi police officials did
not deny this, and Muslim leaders said that police behavior was biased
across India.

“Indian police are extremely colonial and caste-ist,” said Shahid
Siddiqui, a former member of Parliament. Police behavior, he said, is
always “more violent and aggressive toward the weak.”

India’s population is about 80 percent Hindu, and gangs of Hindus
threatened Muslims in several Delhi neighborhoods to leave before the
Hindu holiday Holi that was celebrated this week.

One Muslim woman, who goes by the name Baby, opened her door a few days
ago to find 50 men outside with a notebook in their hands, listing the
addresses of Muslims. She packed up. She may be leaving soon.

“O, Allah, why didn’t you make me a Hindu?” she said, her voice
quavering. “Is it my fault that I was born a
Muslim?”
