MADRID --- King Felipe VI of Spain said on Sunday that he was renouncing
his personal inheritance from his father,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/europe/juan-carlos-leaves-spain.html}{Juan
Carlos}, who has been implicated in a Swiss offshore account
investigation.

King Felipe is also stripping his father of his stipend, in an apparent
bid to sever any financial linkage between the Spanish royal household
and the former monarch.

The announcement came as
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/19/world/europe/political-tensions-certain-to-test-crown-prince-felipe-spains-new-king.html}{King
Felipe} has himself risked getting entangled in the financial scandals
centering on his father.

Felipe took over as king in 2014, when his father
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/world/europe/spanish-lawmakers-clear-way-for-kings-abdication.html}{abdicated}amid
personal scandals and health problems. Upon ascending the throne, he
pledged in a speech to ``preserve the prestige'' of the Spanish monarchy
and maintain integrity, honesty and transparency.

In
a\href{https://www.casareal.es/ES/AreaPrensa/Paginas/area_prensa_comunicados_interior.aspx?data=112}{statement}
on Sunday, Spain's royal household said that King Felipe would renounce
his father's inheritance, including ``any asset, investment or financial
structure whose origin, characteristics or purpose may not be in
accordance with the legality or with the criteria of rectitude and
integrity that shape his institutional and private activity.''

Juan Carlos, 82, has benefited from legal
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/world/europe/plan-to-give-former-king-immunity-splits-spain.html}{immunity}
in Spain. But he could face trial overseas, as prosecutors investigate
his possible ties to two separate foundations that both held Swiss bank
accounts.

Last year, Juan Carlos announced that he would withdraw from public life
and no longer represent Spain in any institutional event, but his
financial dealings have continued to cast a long shadow over the
monarchy.

On Sunday, the royal household said King Felipe knew nothing about being
named as a beneficiary of Zagatka, a foundation that is registered in
Liechtenstein.

Zagatka was set up by Álvaro de Orleans, a cousin of Juan Carlos, who
recently
\href{https://elpais.com/espana/2020-03-01/pague-muchos-vuelos-privados-del-rey-emerito-pero-no-soy-su-testaferro.html}{acknowledged}in
an interview with the newspaper El País that he had funded several
private flights for Juan Carlos, both before and after his abdication.
Zagatka's owner denied that Juan Carlos had access to the foundation's
money.

But the royal household said that King Felipe heard a year ago that he
had been named as a beneficiary of another foundation, called Lucum and
based in Panama, and that he had since gone to a notary to cut any
possible linkage to Lucum and its money.

A Swiss prosecutor is investigating a Swiss bank account held by Lucum.
The Saudi royal family is said to have put \$100 million in 2008 into
Lucum, which was set up by Juan Carlos, according to The Daily
Telegraph, the British newspaper. The royal household also said on
Sunday that Juan Carlos had retained a Spanish lawyer.
