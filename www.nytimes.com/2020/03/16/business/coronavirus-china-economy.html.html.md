SHANGHAI — China’s growth streak has lasted for decades, surviving the
crackdown at Tiananmen Square, the global financial crisis and the trade
war with the United States. But it might not endure the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html)
epidemic, making it nearly impossible for the rest of the world to
escape a slowdown.

The damage was widespread in the official numbers on Monday, the first
significant batch of government data since China’s vast containment
efforts brought the country to a standstill. Industrial production,
retail sales and investment all posted record double-digit drops for the
first two months of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.

The weakness raises the possibility that the entire [Chinese
economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html)
may have shrunk in the first quarter of this year. It would be the first
contraction since 1976, when China was hit by the devastating Tangshan
earthquake as well as the tumult from the death of Mao, whose Cultural
Revolution threw the economy into disarray for a decade.

The knock-on effects for the world are significant. [China’s
factories](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html)
rely on oil and other commodities from countries like Angola, Sierra
Leone and Chile. Its shoppers love Apple iPhones, Chevrolet cars and
Starbucks coffees. Its construction of new buildings, roads and rail
lines depends on steel often made from iron ore mined in Brazil or
Australia.

If people can’t be convinced to start spending money again, “the demand
shock may spread to East Asia and then to Europe and the U.S. — and the
world may face a disaster,” said Cao Heping, a Peking University
economist.

Halting the world’s second-largest economy has [proved easier than
restarting
it](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html),
raising worries that the economy may continue to stumble for a while. It
could be months, if not longer, before the country is fully up and
running again.

According to official statistics, most factories in China have reopened,
after being closed since the lunar new year holiday in January. But they
are operating at two-thirds of their capacity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s a two-part problem — a lack of workers and buyers.

Tens of millions of migrants who work in the factories are still stuck
in quarantines or in their hometowns. Chinese state media announced
triumphantly on Monday that four busloads of workers had been allowed to
leave Hubei province, where the outbreak first emanated.

Chinese consumers aren’t buying either. Car dealerships have emptied. In
Shanghai, the number of shoppers is still far below normal, from the
cheap eateries and budget shops of blue-collar neighborhoods on the
city’s southside to the luxury stores of Nanjing Road, the most famous
shopping avenue in
China.

“The supply problem is fixable, it’s bringing people back” to work from
the countryside, said Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Shanghai. “The demand problem is harder.”

As China’s powerful economic engine sputters, the rest of the world’s
expansion is under threat.

The stock market of Australia, which sells [vast quantities of iron
ore](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/business/international/australia-china-mining-port-hedland.html)
to China, has been among the world’s worst performers in recent days.
Germany’s automakers depend heavily on the Chinese market and have seen
sales wither. Mideast energy producers have struggled, as China has
turned away shipments of liquefied natural gas and cut way back on oil
consumption.

Global economists had been wondering whether China would admit that its
economy shrank in the first quarter, given the country’s tendency to
report predictable and steady growth no matter what happens. But the
government data on Monday suggests that China may break with that
dubious tradition next month in reporting economic output for the first
quarter of this year, allowing for a more accurate look at the troubled
economy.

“Most of us are expecting a negative percentage, 2 or 3 percent below
zero, or maybe lower,” said Zhu Chaoping, a global markets strategist in
the Shanghai office of J.P. Morgan.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Government officials tried at a news briefing on Monday in Beijing to
play down the severity of the problem. “The impact of the epidemic is
short-term, external and controllable,” said Mao Shengyong, the director
general of the department of comprehensive statistics at the National
Bureau of Statistics, which released the
data.

Mr. Mao said that it was too soon to estimate whether the economy had
shrunk in the first quarter. The economy typically slows somewhat in
January and February after the Lunar Year holidays. So March typically
represents a disproportionate share of the quarter’s output, as much as
40 percent, he said.

Economic statistics for the first two months were expected to be weak.
But the data released on Monday was more dismal than many economists had
anticipated.

Retail sales tumbled 20.5 percent from a year ago as many stores stayed
closed well beyond the usual end of the lunar new year holiday. Even
when shops did reopen in February, they had almost no customers until
early March as many people continued to stay home to avoid infection.

Industrial production fell 13.5 percent last month compared with
February of last year. Many factories did not reopen until late February
if at all.

Fixed-asset investment, which includes construction of buildings, roads
and railways, slipped 24.5 percent last month. It is expected to revive
quickly as provinces pour money into infrastructure projects this spring
to restart economic growth.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The epidemic now appears to be prompting the government to adjust its
economic goals. China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has called for
eliminating extreme poverty by the end of the year, as well as doubling
economic output between 2010 and
2020.

On Monday, the government seemed to give itself some wiggle room. Just
15 minutes before the data was released, the state-run newspaper, China
Daily, published a report saying that while extreme poverty would be
eradicated this year, the other goal is now to double economic output
“by around 2021.”

Economists are uncertain how much growth would be needed for China to
achieve the target this year — the usual estimates are somewhere between
5 and 6 percent.

On Monday Fitch Solutions revised down its forecast for China’s economic
growth this year to 5.2 percent. Commonwealth Bank of Australia also
pushed down its forecast on Monday, to just 4.2 percent.
