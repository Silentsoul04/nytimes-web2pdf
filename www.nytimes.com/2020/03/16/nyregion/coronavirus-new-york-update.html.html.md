## New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ban gatherings of 50 or more.

The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced broad
restrictions on public life on Monday, with gatherings of more than 50
people banned in all three states and many nonessential businesses
ordered closed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

All schools in New York State were also closed for at least two weeks,
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced. The move came after [New York City’s
public school
system](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/nyregion/nyc-schools-closed-coronavirus.html),
the nation’s largest, shut down for at least five weeks.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Casinos, gyms and movie theaters in the three states must close by 8
p.m. Monday, Mr. Cuomo of New York said on a joint call with Govs.
Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey and Ned Lamont of Connecticut.

Bars and restaurants will be limited to takeout and delivery, Mr. Cuomo
said. Groceries, gas stations, pharmacies and some other businesses can
stay open. Mr. Cuomo said he was also encouraging other businesses to
close at 8 p.m.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some of the region’s most famous landmarks, including the Statue of
Liberty, Ellis Island and the Empire State Building, also shut down.

Mr. Lamont said on Monday night that the Danbury Hospital near the New
York border was at capacity and that 200 nurses there could not report
to work because they might have had contact with patients infected with
the coronavirus.

The governor said there were not enough tests to determine whether the
nurses had the virus.

“If I could test those nurses, I could potentially get them back into
the game,” he said on MSNBC.

Earlier on Monday, Mr. Murphy had asked New Jersey residents to stay at
home from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. every day for now, a day after suggesting
that he was considering a mandatory curfew.

“We are strongly asking, pleading with folks, to stay home,” Mr. Murphy
said on Monday night. Asked how long the recommendation would be in
effect, he said: “It certainly is at least weeks, and it may be many
months.”

## Unemployment claims are ‘comparable to post 9/11,’ state says.

The sudden flood of laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits
swamped New York’s Labor Department on Monday.

After Mr. Cuomo waived the usual seven-day waiting period to apply,
workers who had been let go over the weekend immediately tried to
replace some of their lost income.

Within hours, frustrated applicants were complaining on social media
about not being able to apply online. Some said that the state’s system
was crashing throughout the day.

Madeleine Witenberg tried to help her partner, Irene Leon, who had just
been laid off from her full-time job as a bartender and server at a
restaurant in Brooklyn’s Dumbo neighborhood. Using two different
computers, the women tried unsuccessfully three times to navigate the
state’s system, Ms. Leon said.

“It just cut me off as soon as I was making progress,” she said.

Late in the day, the department acknowledged the problem.

“Today we experienced a massive increase in the volume of unemployment
insurance claims which slowed down the server,” it said in a statement.
“It is currently being addressed.”

A department spokeswoman, Deanna Cohen, said the agency had received
8,758 calls by noon, more than triple what it got last Monday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are seeing a spike in volume that is comparable to post 9/11 but
make no mistake, anyone entitled to these benefits is going to receive
them in a timely manner,” Ms. Cohen
said.

## New York City is adding 8,200 hospital beds.

Mr. de Blasio announced on Monday that New York City was rushing to add
more hospital beds in the next few weeks.

By canceling elective surgeries and<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>dismissing patients from hospitals more quickly, the city can
free up about 7,000 patient beds in existing hospitals, the mayor said.
Another 1,200 to 1,300 beds could be added by taking over unused space
in existing hospitals and converting a newly built nursing home in
Brooklyn that is not yet occupied.

The mayor appealed for federal assistance in helping to staff the new
beds. He said he would like to bring health care workers from other
states that have not been hit as hard by the pandemic and to use
military doctors and nurses.

“These are battlefield-level conditions,” he said.

With help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the city also
announced plans to open five drive-through testing sites. Details on
their locations were not released. (New Jersey officials said the state
would open drive-though test centers<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>at Bergen County Community College and the PNC Bank Arts Center.)

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

## Cases continue to climb across the region.

As of Monday, New York State had 950 confirmed coronavirus cases,
officials said, up from 729 on Sunday. Nine people have died from the
virus, including seven in New York City; 158 people have been
hospitalized. In a bright note, the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson,
said 16 people who had been hospitalized had been discharged.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Cases in New Jersey nearly doubled in a day, to 178 on Monday, up from
98 on Sunday. Three people in the state died after testing positive for
the virus. Connecticut reported 41 confirmed cases on Monday, up from 26
on Sunday. No coronavirus death had been reported in the state.

The largest concentration of cases in New York State is in New York
City, where 463 people had tested positive. There were 220 confirmed
cases in Westchester County. On Long Island, there were 109 confirmed
cases in Nassau County and 63 in Suffolk
County.

## New York City schools are closed. Online lessons start next week.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 17, 2020

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Nicole, 11, would normally be at her middle school while her mother
worked as a waitress at a Colombian restaurant. But [the closing of New
York City’s public school
system](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/nyregion/nyc-schools-closed.html)
had forced them to overhaul their routine.

“I’m worried about the bills, the car, the rent,” said Ms. Martinez, 42,
who will be out of work and unpaid for an indefinite period as
[restaurants and bars shift to delivery
only](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-shutdown.html).

Families across New York City were scrambling for resources and child
care as the threat of the coronavirus prompted a school shutdown
[that](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/nyregion/nyc-schools-closed-coronavirus.html)put
a heavy strain on parents. (About 14,000 New York City students picked
up free meals at their schools on Monday, schools chancellor Richard A.
Carranza said, a tiny fraction of the roughly 750,000 children who
qualify for free or reduced price meals. Mr. Carranza said he expected
that number to grow.)

The challenge facing Ms. Martinez showed not just the impact of the
schools being closed, but also the affect of [the virus’s spread on New
York City’s restaurant
industry.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/nyregion/nyc-closing-bars-restaurants-coronavirus.html)

“We’re completely lost,” said Odalys Rivera, pouring coffee at a new
taqueria, Cena, that opened in Brooklyn’s Windsor Terrace last year, the
dream of her brother and her cousin, the owners.

The shutdown promised to hurt everyone from owners and celebrity chefs
to waiters, waitresses, bar-backs and busboys.

New York City faces [the prospect of sweeping job losses and business
failures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/nyregion/Coronavirus-nyc-economy-.html),
with theaters,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>bars,
restaurants and tourism all closing down or heavily restricted.

James Parrott, director of economic and fiscal policies at the Center
for New York City Affairs at the New School, said the city could lose up
to 500,000 tourism jobs, with lost wages amounting to $1 billion a
month.

Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, estimated that the
latest restrictions “could conservatively cost the city $3.2 billion in
lost tax revenues over the next six months.”

“We’re facing the possibility of a prolonged recession,” he
said.

## Jail visits and court cases are postponed, and the city won’t enforce restrictions on e-bikes.

The mayor said on Monday that the Police Department would not enforce a
law barring the use of electric bikes during the coronavirus crisis. The
move would help those who use such bike to make food deliveries. He also
said his administration was considering suspending alternate-side
parking regulations.

In addition, New York’s courts postponed many criminal cases
indefinitely and will stop performing all but their most essential
functions. Eviction proceedings have also been suspended.

People charged with felonies who are out on bail will have their cases
adjourned “until further notice,” the state’s chief administrative
judge, Lawrence K. Marks, wrote.

Visits to city jails will be suspended starting on Wednesday. The city
said it would increase access to phones and postal service to help
detainees stay in contact, and officials said they might also establish
a “televisit” system.

One agency whose operations did not appear to have been affected by the
outbreak was the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, whose
agents have continued to arrest immigrants around New York City over the
past 10 days.

The arrests have come in places with growing numbers of coronavirus
cases like New Rochelle and Suffolk County, alarming advocates and
lawyers who believe they could endanger vulnerable people who are
already in custody.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, which provides legal
representation to poor people facing deportation, said it had filed
requests seeking the release of more than two dozen older and medically
vulnerable clients.
