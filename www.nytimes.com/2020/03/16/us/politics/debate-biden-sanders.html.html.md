It’s a good thing that last night’s debate wasn’t taking place in
California, because both candidates would have been forced to violate
new state guidelines to attend.

On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Gavin Newsom [called for all residents 65
years and
older](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/coronavirus-newsom-california-seniors-restaurants-bars.html)
to isolate themselves at home. Both Joe Biden, 77, and Bernie Sanders,
78, would have fallen into that category.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I mention that new rule as a way of underscoring how quickly and
profoundly American life changed over the weekend, as [the country
grapples with the
spread](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-usa) of the
coronavirus.

Crises have a way of clarifying distinctions. In last night’s debate, we
got a much sharper glimpse into how Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders view the
problems facing the country.

Both of the Democratic primary candidates dismissed President Trump’s
approach as insufficient, embracing a much further-reaching government
strategy to try to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the
virus.

But the scope of their responses differed significantly. Mr. Biden
focused on immediate solutions, saying he would call upon the military
to help handle the situation and work to enact a
“multi-multi-billion-dollar program.”

The virus, as he sees it, is a short-term problem that requires an
American reckoning, but then life would return largely to normal.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Regardless of whether my plan was in place or his, this is a crisis,”
Mr. Biden said. “This is like we are being attacked from abroad. This is
something that is of great consequence. This is like a war. And in a
war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people.”

Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, sees the virus as a symptom of systemic problems
in American society like income inequality, the power of big
corporations and the demise of the working class. He offered a more
structural critique, rooted in the virus.

“As a result of the virus here, the coronavirus,” he said, “what we have
got to do also is understand the fragility of the economy and how unjust
and unfair it is that so few have so much and so many have so little.”

Mr. Biden shot back: “People are looking for results, not a revolution.
They want to deal with the results they need right now.”

The two-man, audience-free debate certainly led to a more substantive
discussion. There was no playing to the crowd or moderators dwelling on
candidates without a clear shot at the nomination (ahem, Michael
Bloomberg). Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders debated bankruptcy law, campaign
finance, climate change, immigration, Social Security, the Iran deal,
the Iraq war, abortion rights and foreign policy.

Mr. Sanders delivered a forceful performance, turning policy critiques
into questions about Mr. Biden’s leadership and trustworthiness. Mr.
Biden’s team appeared to expect a less aggressive approach from Mr.
Sanders. Anita Dunn, a top Biden aide, later described her candidate’s
debate performance as “graciously dealing with the kind of protester who
often shows up at campaign events, on live television.”

But none of the disagreements were particularly new. Voters paying
enough attention to understand the details of those policy-heavy spats
had most likely already settled on a candidate and which side of the
party’s ideological divide they favor.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In that way, this debate seemed unlikely to inspire the kind of
fundamental shift that would be required for Mr. Sanders to win the
nomination. (Of course, at a time when our daily lives feel so
scrambled, it’s not out of the question that something surprising could
happen with our politics.)

Whether or not Mr. Sanders defies the odds and captures the nomination,
his worldview — and the energized wing of the Democratic Party that it
represents — isn’t going away. And if Mr. Biden wants to win the general
election, he needs to find a way to see Mr. Sanders less as a pesky
protester and more as a key partner in his political coalition.

A few other moments worth noting:

  - Paging Senators Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and
    other would-be vice-presidential picks. The news out of this debate
    is that Mr. Biden [committed
    outright](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-female-vice-president.html)
    to picking a female running mate. [The push for a woman on the
    ticket](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/us/politics/democrats-women-vice-president.html)
    escalated after Ms. Warren dropped out of the race. For all you
    veepstakes lovers, this declaration isn’t that surprising but it
    does narrow Mr. Biden’s list of possibilities.

  - Beyond the shrunken field of candidates, [debating in the time of
    coronavirus looks awfully
    different](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/cnn-democratic-debate-coronavirus.html).
    The podiums were placed six feet apart, in line with recommendations
    from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for keeping a
    safe distance from others. Only a dozen people were physically
    present in the Washington television studio where the debate took
    place. Hand sanitizer was widely available, and the candidates
    greeted each other with a careful elbow bump.

  - Even if the logistics were different, it’s nice to see a campaign
    event happening, as so many primary elections are getting postponed.
    [Georgia and Louisiana have delayed their presidential
    primaries](https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html),
    and Wyoming has suspended its in-person Democratic caucus voting.
    Yesterday, we reported that [New York officials are considering
    plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/ny-voting-coronavirus.html)
    to postpone the state’s presidential primary election from April 28
    to June 23.

  - In an interview after the debate, Mr. Sanders suggested that holding
    primaries may not “make a lot of sense” right now. “I would hope
    governors listen to the public health experts,” he said. “I’m
    thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks,
    registering people, all that stuff. It does not make a lot of
    sense.”

    matters beyond the virus, the two men clashed [over their divergent
    policy agendas and records in
    office](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/biden-sanders-debate-recap.html).

  - The coronavirus crisis brought Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders together
    for an unusual debate, and the debate highlighted their distance,
    [our news analysis
    says](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/biden-sanders-cnn-debate.html).

  - We also have articles on Mr. Biden’s pledge [to select a woman as
    his running
    mate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-female-vice-president.html),
    the candidates’ [clash over Social
    Security](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-social-security.html),

  - So, [how well did Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders
    perform](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/who-won-democratic-debate.html)
    in the debate? Campaign experts weighed in on the candidates’ first
    one-on-one clash, and we rounded up their reactions.

  - We [fact-checked the candidates’
    claims](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/democratic-debate-fact-check.html)
    on topics including the coronavirus response, their health care
    plans, super PACs, the Green New Deal, immigration and the auto
    bailout.
