\section{Six Takeaways From the March Democratic
Debate}\label{six-takeaways-from-the-march-democratic-debate}}

On a night largely overshadowed by the global pandemic, Bernie Sanders
pressed Joe Biden on his past Senate voting record as Mr. Biden sought
to woo the left.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/podcasts/the-daily/democratic-primary-coronavirus.html}{coronavirus},
``Medicare for all,'' old Senate votes, the Iraq War, Social Security,
gun control, immigration, visions of leadership: They were all on the
table Sunday night in the first one-on-one debate between Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} and former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}, a matchup that comes two days before four delegate-rich
states hold primaries.

Here are six takeaways from the only March debate of the primary race:

\hypertarget{sanders-had-his-best-debate-yet-and}{%
\subsection{Sanders had his best debate yet.
And?}\label{sanders-had-his-best-debate-yet-and}}

Mr. Sanders had been waiting months --- years, really --- for a
one-on-one shot to compare his record and platform with Mr. Biden's. He
did not waste the opportunity.

Mr. Sanders delivered a clinical evisceration of Mr. Biden's record from
a progressive perspective, picking apart past Biden votes and statements
on economic issues, the Iraq war, immigration and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. By
drawing Mr. Biden into a debate about his record stretching back
decades, Mr. Sanders won a victory on substance, delivering his best
debate in the 11th forum sponsored by the Democratic National Committee.

It's almost certainly too late to matter.

Mr. Sanders has won just seven of the 26 primaries and caucuses so far
(he's also leading in California). He trails Mr. Biden in the delegate
count by a significant amount --- so much that Mr. Sanders would have to
start winning states by about
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/upshot/sanders-biden-delegate-analysis.html}{eight
percentage points} to catch up. And polling suggests Mr. Biden is likely
to win the four states with primaries on Tuesday --- Arizona, Florida,
Illinois and Ohio.

The senator's attacks on Mr. Biden on Sunday night didn't go as far as
some Sanders aides had hoped. Yet his criticism also disappointed
members of the Democratic establishment who had hoped Mr. Sanders would
use the debate as a stage to effectively bow out of the race with grace.

Only Mr. Sanders knows how long he's willing to fight for a Democratic
presidential nomination he's increasingly unlikely to win. Four years
ago he took Hillary Clinton all the way to the end of the party's
calendar to see if he could win California's mega-primary. But now, in
the midst of a global pandemic and with the overriding imperative in the
party to remove President Trump, Mr. Sanders could find himself coming
to a different conclusion soon.

And yet: After the debate, in an interview on CNN, Mr. Sanders sounded
skeptical about even holding the upcoming primaries on Tuesday,
questioning if it made sense for senior citizens to be congregating at
polling sites during the coronavirus outbreak.

\hypertarget{the-debate-was-discordant-with-the-urgency-of-a-global-pandemic}{%
\subsection{The debate was discordant with the urgency of a global
pandemic.}\label{the-debate-was-discordant-with-the-urgency-of-a-global-pandemic}}

It began with an elbow bump, unfolded with Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders
standing six feet apart and ended without a handshake.

The debate was held during the extraordinary moment of a global pandemic
threatening to upend America's political, social and economic order. Yet
for long stretches of the night, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders were consumed
with trading shots and sniping about old Senate votes and debates from
decades past.

If the policy issues were significant, the focus felt discordant in a
moment when millions of Americans are preparing to bunker down to slow
the spread of an infectious virus, facing disruptive school closures and
the possibility of future quarantines.

``I don't want to get into a back and forth about our politics here,''
Mr. Biden said at one point, as Mr. Sanders pressed him on health care.

Eventually they did get into just such a back-and-forth, and spent much
of the debate engaged not on real-and-present-dangers but on distant
pasts and potential futures.

  michael barbaro\\
  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''
\item
  {[}music{]}\\
  Today: Two weeks ago, the biggest story in the country was the
  Democratic presidential primary. Now, with the coronavirus, it's been
  largely forgotten. Alex Burns on what happened when those two stories
  collided. It's Monday, March 23.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Hello?
\item
  alex burns\\
  Hello, Michael.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Hey. It's always nice to be heralded by a bing, you know?
\item
  alex burns\\
  Is that not your usual entrance into halls and rooms?
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Usually it's trumpets. {[}LAUGHS{]} I feel like every day pretty much
  for two weeks, we would talk on the show. And then poof, we have this
  unplanned hiatus, and you go away. And so I kind of miss you a little
  bit.
\item
  alex burns\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} It's a particularly painful kind of social isolation, for
  me at least.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So, bring us up to speed on the Democratic primary. How would you
  describe the current state of the race?
\item
  alex burns\\
  Well, it's pretty close to over at this point. Joe Biden has emerged
  as the overwhelming favorite to be the Democratic nominee. He clearly
  has a support from the majority of the party, wide lead in the
  delegate count. And Bernie Sanders has not conceded the race, but he's
  acknowledged that he is sort of reassessing his campaign. And that's
  often the first stage in the process of winding things down.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  So in effect, it feels like what you just described is more or less
  where we were a couple of weeks ago. But with the benefit of some
  hindsight and some reporting on your part, I wonder if you could tell
  us how exactly that happened, because I don't think we've properly
  accounted for the whiplash and the speed with which the Sanders
  campaign came kind of crashing down.
\item
  alex burns\\
  No, I don't think we have. And I think really, you have to rewind the
  tape almost exactly a month ago to what was the high point.
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  And now, I'm delighted to bring you some pretty good news.
  {[}CHEERING{]} I think all of you know, we won the popular vote in
  Iowa. {[}CHEERING{]} We won the New Hampshire primary. {[}CHEERING{]}
  And according to three networks in the A.P., we have now won the
  Nevada caucus! {[}CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

alex burns

He wins the Nevada caucuses. And he wins them by just an enormous
margin.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (crowd)\\
  Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!
\end{itemize}

alex burns

He crushes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (crowd)\\
  Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!
\end{itemize}

alex burns

He wins young voters. He wins older voters. He wins folks who have
participated in caucuses in the past and people who are participating
for the first time. It's in Nevada, where we see him go from winning
about a quarter of the vote to winning nearly half the vote.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  And no campaign has a grass-roots movement like we do, which is
  another reason why we're going to win this election. {[}CROWD
  CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

alex burns

And that sends a really powerful signal across the Democratic Party.

michael barbaro

And what does that signal?

alex burns

I think what most of us thought at the time was that it was sending a
signal that Bernie Sanders was broadening his appeal, and that he was
building a more diverse and more muscular political coalition than he
had been able to demonstrate so far. It's also clear now that another
message it sent to the rest of the Democratic Party was that Sanders was
becoming a real freight train in this race. And that if you were going
to stop him, you were going to need to do it real fast. So the moment
where Sanders is riding high like that, I think he's kind of faced with
a choice of either trying to more actively reassure the Democratic Party
that they can trust him to be the nominee --- and to make a more
explicit case about his own electability and to address himself more
clearly to moderate voters who have, you know, been beyond wary of his
campaign, just terrified of the idea of nominating him. Or he can stick
with the approach that got him there to begin with. And that's to run as
this anti-establishment progressive populist who is taking on his own
party in addition to taking on the Republican Party. And the question
then I think is, which version are we going to hear over the coming week
and the coming months from Bernie Sanders?

michael barbaro

And what happens?

alex burns

The day after he wins the Nevada caucuses, a ``60 Minutes'' interview
airs.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (anderson cooper)\\
  Back in the 1980s, Sanders had some positive things to say about the
  former Soviet Union and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  And everybody was totally convinced ---
\item
  archived recording (anderson cooper)\\
  Here he is explaining why the Cuban people didn't rise up and help the
  U.S. overthrow Cuban leader, Fidel Castro.
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  He educated their kids, gave them health care ---
\end{itemize}

alex burns

The piece of it that really pops out to a lot of Democrats is when
Anderson Cooper asked Bernie Sanders about his past praise for the
Castro regime in Cuba.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (bernie sanders)\\
  We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba. But it's
  unfair to simply say, everything is bad. When Fidel Castro came into
  office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is
  that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro ---
\end{itemize}

alex burns

And it just sends a shockwave through Democrats.

{[}music{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  Bernie Sanders has the lead in total votes in delegates. But his
  comments he made Sunday night on ``60 Minutes'' that are causing fresh
  panic for some Democrats.
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  It's absolutely inconceivable that any American as old as him, knowing
  everything we know about Fidel Castro and the people that he's
  murdered over the years, that anybody could support him in any way.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  The blowback is emblematic of broader uncertainty about how nominating
  a self-described democratic socialist could impact Democrats' chances
  in the general election.
\item
  archived recording 3\\
  I like Bernie.
\item
  archived recording 4\\
  How do you feel about him praising the Soviet Union and Fidel Castro?
\item
  archived recording 5\\
  Yeah, I don't like that part.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

So to hear that from Sanders, and to hear him essentially be
unapologetic about it, I think, was a real sign to people that if you
thought this guy was going to start moving to the middle now, that is
not happening.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  His response infuriated democratic lawmakers from South Florida, a key
  swing state where public support for the Castro regime is a
  nonstarter.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

More specifically, and in a more localized, but really no less important
way, this is terrifying to Democrats in Florida.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (reporter)\\
  Freshman Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, she called Sanders's
  comment quote, ``absolutely unacceptable.''
\item
  archived recording (debbie mucarsel-powell)\\
  He made more than a mistake. It's what he believes. And it's
  unacceptable to our community.
\item
  archived recording (reporter)\\
  And Congresswoman Donna Shalala, who suggested that Sanders talk to
  her constituents before quote, ``singing the praises of a murderous
  tyrant``, unquote.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

You see just a unified, almost unified, wall of criticism of Sanders
coming from Democrats in that state, saying, you are imperiling the
general election in one of the biggest swing states on the map.

{[}music{]}

After the ``60 Minutes'' interview, you then start to hear prominent
national Democrats say something that many of them haven't said so far,
which is, we just can't nominate this guy.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (jim clyburn)\\
  Let me thank all of you for joining us here this morning.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

And that's the point where you see Joe Biden get a major, major
endorsement from Jim Clyburn, popular congressman from South Carolina,
highest ranking African-American member of Congress.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (jim clyburn)\\
  Well, I want the public to know that I'm voting for Joe Biden. South
  Carolinans should be voting for Joe Biden. And here's why. I know Joe.
  We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us.
\item
  archived recording\\
  That's right. That's right.
\item
  archived recording (jim clyburn)\\
  That's important.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

So we head into the South Carolina primary, which Joe Biden was always
favored to win.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  NBC News is now projecting that former Vice President Joe Biden has
  won a decisive victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

And he wins it by 30 points.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  And he has done so by a substantial margin, potentially changing the
  dynamics of a race dominated so far by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

That is beyond what even the Biden campaign was expecting. Biden just
coalesces the overwhelming majority of Democrats who are not for Bernie
Sanders behind his campaign.

michael barbaro

And so why in that moment did we not see Biden's win in South Carolina,
which as you just said, was kind of mathematically quite significant as
the beginning of a turning point kind of comeback?

alex burns

So on the night of South Carolina, we can look at Biden's 30 point
margin, and say, wow, that was impressive. And this guy is clearly more
resilient than even some of his supporters, even some of his inner
circle believed he was. What we didn't know is that the next day ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (pete buttigieg)\\
  So tonight, I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign
  for the presidency.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

--- Pete Buttigieg would drop out of the race.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (pete buttigieg)\\
  I will no longer ---
\end{itemize}

alex burns

And then on Monday morning, Amy Klobuchar would drop out of the race.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (amy klobuchar)\\
  Today, I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president.
  {[}CROWD CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

alex burns

And by the end of Monday ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (pete buttigieg)\\
  That I'm delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president.
  {[}CROWD CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

alex burns

--- both of them would endorse Joe Biden.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (beto o'rourke)\\
  I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden. {[}CROWD CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

alex burns

And by the way, so would Beto O'Rourke, who dropped out of the race a
couple of months ealier. We saw a transformation of voter's preferences
within this field at a speed that I don't think it's an overstatement to
call it totally unprecedented.

michael barbaro

I want to understand this phenomenon. Let me just begin with those
endorsements that you just described. Why did Buttigieg, did Klobuchar
drop out and endorse him so quickly? What's your understanding now of
how that happened?

alex burns

There are a couple of things going on here. Pete Buttigieg was on track
to get totally waxed on Super Tuesday, which is just three days after
South Carolina. So he is staring at the possibility of not just defeat
and not just a setback, but something like political humiliation to go
in a month from essentially winning Iowa --- basically splitting the win
with Bernie Sanders --- to winning absolutely nothing on Super Tuesday.
And so there is a logic of self-interest that says, maybe you should
take your winnings and walk away from the table at this point. Amy
Klobuchar faces a somewhat different situation because she does look
like she will win her home state of Minnesota. But she is clear-eyed
enough at that point to recognize there's really no path forward for her
in the race beyond Super Tuesday. Beyond the self-interest, though,
these are two of the candidates who have been the bluntest and most
pointed all along about their concern for the implications of nominating
Sanders. They have been talking about the idea of nominating Sanders as
deeply, deeply politically risky. And there are people who can do the
math for themselves and see that after Nevada and South Carolina, there
are really only two candidates in this race who are putting up big
numbers on the national level in the way that it would take to go the
distance. And between those two candidates, there's no question about
whether they're closer to Biden or Sanders.

michael barbaro

OK, so at this point, post-South Carolina and post-Super Tuesday, Biden
is the front-runner. But there's a ton of primaries and delegates left.
And still theoretically, time for a Sanders comeback, right?

alex burns

Right, and it turns out to be very much a theoretical exercise, the
Sanders comeback. You see starting right after Super Tuesday, he points
the way to the next round of primaries, most importantly, Michigan.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Well, the ``Joementum'' continues. Former Vice President Biden
  swooping to victory overnight in a pivotal primary contest.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

Sanders ends up totally flopping in Michigan. It's a blowout in the
state.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Biden sweeping every county in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi. He
  also won Idaho. The wins giving him a commanding 160 delegate lead
  over Sanders.
\end{itemize}

alex burns

And what happens, essentially the night that Biden wins in Michigan and
in a number of other important states, is that the campaign is
essentially frozen in place by a force that hits the campaign and hits
the entire country in a way that nobody could have anticipated. And of
course, that's the coronavirus.

{[}music{]}

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

Alex, how exactly does the coronavirus epidemic --- eventually becomes a
pandemic --- how does that hurt Sanders and help Biden? That's not
entirely intuitive to me.

alex burns

Well, what it does is it essentially ends the active portion of the
campaign. On the night of the March 10 primaries, both of them are
supposed to hold election night events where they address a roaring
crowd of supporters. Both of those events get canceled. There have been
no campaign rallies since then. Bernie Sanders cannot hit the road and
gather tens of thousands of people in stadiums and deliver a forceful
plea to the Democratic Party to not go ahead and nominate Joe Biden. The
window to make that argument has essentially closed. What's also going
on is that the terms of debate go from being about ideological
differences and policy differences to the reality of a terrifying
national crisis. And what we see consistently in public polling for
months, and in exit polls taken around the March primaries, is that on
the question of which candidate you trust to handle a major crisis, Joe
Biden is overwhelmingly favored, not just over Bernie Sanders, but over
every alternative that democratic voters had in the race.

michael barbaro

So in a sense, the coronavirus doesn't just freeze the campaign and
freeze Joe Biden's advantages electorally, it amplifies them because
many democratic voters see him as a crisis-style leader.

alex burns

Exactly. Biden's biggest strengths from the beginning have involved his
experience, and his perceived steadiness, and the fact that voters
basically find him trustworthy, and reassuring.

michael barbaro

Well, that's interesting because another way of thinking about this, and
the impact that we're seeing already on Americans from this pandemic ---
the health care shortcomings, the thin financial cushion on which so
many Americans are living --- that's the stuff that Bernie Sanders has
been saying forever. So I could also imagine a version of this where the
pandemic strengthens Sanders's candidacy, not weakens it.

alex burns

I think that's really, really sharply put. But I do think people are
processing this differently than they would process, for instance, a
crash just of the financial sector. That if you saw an economic collapse
in which people felt like the government was racing to contain a
contagion from the financial industry, and that their lives were
basically safe, I suspect that we might be having a different political
debate right now. And that you would see Bernie Sanders holding these
enormous rallies and making exactly the case you just laid out. And I
think that things are so turbulent and unpredictable right now that we
can't totally rule out the possibility that maybe that happens at some
point once people see the scale of economic damage and the kind of
vividness that we certainly and unfortunately will. What we have right
now, though, is people who are experiencing a terrifying disruption in
their daily lives. They're experiencing it yes, as an economic crisis,
but also as a public health crisis, and something that probably feels to
a lot of people like a national security crisis. And while a lot of
Sanders's themes and ideas about the economy will probably be a bigger
part of the conversation in the coming months, I don't know that the
country has reached that point yet.

So I want to turn now to the practical question of how the rest of the
Democratic primary unfolds. Because the situation we're in hasn't just
frozen the dynamics of the race, it also seems to have actually frozen
the mechanics of the campaign. Which feels pretty tricky because people
have to leave their homes and go vote in order for there to ever be a
nominee. So how is that going to work?

alex burns

Well, the short answer is we still don't really know. Almost every day
now, we hear from another state that is delaying its primary well into
May or even into June. Now, some of the relevance of those changes is
going to depend on what Bernie Sanders does next. If Sanders does stick
around, and if Biden is not able to functionally unify the Democratic
Party, with or without Bernie Sanders's support, then we could see this
really weird long period of dormancy in the campaign followed by a
sudden frenzy of activity again in the late spring when maybe the virus
will be more under control, and maybe people will start voting again.
Personally right now, I think that that is an unlikely scenario.

michael barbaro

Alex, what's your understanding of how Bernie Sanders is thinking of the
big and difficult question of how long to stay in the race if it doesn't
really seem as a practical path to the nomination? He's certainly
hearing lots of calls to step aside in a moment of crisis, kind of let
the party coalesce around a nominee and prepare itself for a general
election.

alex burns

I think there are a couple things about the mindset of the Sanders's
camp right now that are really worth emphasizing here. One is that this
is a group that not that long ago thought that they were on, not a glide
path, but a pretty convincing course to the nomination. And they saw it
fall away with astonishing speed. So there's a level, I think, still of
kind of shell shock, at feeling like they had this, or they were close
to having this. And then it was yanked away from them. That's a hard
thing for a campaign, and especially, for a candidate to process. I
think the conditions of the pandemic also make it harder for, well,
anybody involved in the race at this point to think through, what is the
right thing to do next? What we know about Bernie Sanders is that he
cares a great deal about his agenda. And we also know that, as a
personal matter, he likes Joe Biden. This is not the Sanders-Clinton
rivalry. He doesn't feel that the party really conspired to kneecap him
in this race in the way that he did, with some justification, in 2016.
So what you see here is a candidate, Sanders, who I think understands
what an underdog he is right now, and an opponent in Biden, who is a
negotiator. And I think that's why you're seeing Biden make such
explicit overtures to Sanders supporters.

Finally, Alex, if Joe Biden is becoming a kind of de facto nominee over
the next few weeks during this dormancy in the campaign, and if it
starts to feel like a general election is getting underway between Biden
and President Trump, I wonder what this really unique set of
circumstances --- which has meant so much for the Democratic primary ---
is going to mean for Biden's potential challenger, the sitting
president, Donald Trump.

alex burns

We know that the president is not going to be able to run for
re-election on a message that happy days are here again, and there is
nothing but prosperity as far as we can see. That message is gone. What
we don't know is what kind of story he will be able to tell about
managing this crisis. We just don't know what the conditions on the
ground are going to be like in a couple of months, let alone in the
general election. When this crisis hit, Joe Biden had a pretty solid
advantage over the president in general election polls. The map just
feels to me like it's really up for grabs right now, because we've never
conducted an election under these kinds of conditions. And even 2008,
the election in the middle of a financial crisis, we hadn't had the kind
of time that we are going to have now to process the meaning of the
setbacks that the country is currently experiencing.

{[}music{]}

michael barbaro

It's interesting you mentioned 2008 because it feels to me that that
race might be the proper analogy, a crisis. And as you've said
throughout this conversation, Democrats are starting to view Joe Biden
as the candidate of crisis. I'm sure Republicans view President Trump as
the candidate of crisis. And the question will become, once this crisis
is over, what the general electorate views as the candidate of the
crisis, who handled the crisis well and who would get us out of the
crisis best.

alex burns

And is there a candidate they blame for the crisis? If people ultimately
see the president as having let them down in this, that feels awfully
hard to escape. As it is, we can't say that that's how the country is
going to feel. But we can say that he was an unpopular president on the
day this crisis started. And that it's certainly not, based on what we
know now, changing that picture in his favor.

He invoked Senator Elizabeth Warren and mentioned that he spoke with her
recently. He promised that, for his first 100 days in office, ``no one
will be deported at all.'' He highlighted his
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/biden-backs-free-college.html}{new
support} for making public colleges and universities tuition-free for
many students.

Mr. Biden, a relative moderate who has won a series of major primary
contests in recent weeks, is beginning to think about how to unify the
Democratic Party should he become the nominee --- and he is looking for
ways to appeal to progressives who have long been skeptical of his
candidacy, even as the coronavirus crisis has forced him
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/joe-biden-digital-campaign.html}{off
the campaign trail}.

On the debate stage, he noted his moves to the left on several policy
matters, and --- in a nod to Mr. Sanders's supporters --- promised that,
``If Bernie is the nominee, I will not only support him, I will campaign
for him.''

But Mr. Biden's efforts at extending olive branches only went so far ---
and sometimes, he appeared visibly frustrated by Mr. Sanders.

``He's making it hard for me right now,'' Mr. Biden joked, referring to
Mr. Sanders, when asked directly about how he would appeal to the
Vermont senator's supporters if he became the nominee. ``I was trying to
give him credit for things and he won't even take credit for things he
wants to do.''

\hypertarget{and-promised-to-pick-a-female-running-mate}{%
\subsection{\ldots{}and promised to pick a female running

Mr. Biden committed for the first time to selecting
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-female-vice-president.html}{a
female running mate} if he wins the Democratic nomination, a move sure
to be welcomed by many party activists, operatives and voters who have
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/us/politics/democrats-women-vice-president.html}{long
wanted to see} a woman on the Democratic ticket in November.

The former vice president has previously laid out other criteria he
would prioritize in a running mate, including the importance of trust,
shared values and experience.

But promising to select a woman could help him generate more enthusiasm
headed into upcoming primary contests, reassuring some voters who may
feel apathetic toward Mr. Biden, 77. It will also set off a round of
predictions about which specific Democratic candidates Mr. Biden may be
considering should he clinch the nomination.

And, given the crucial role that black voters played in first reviving
Mr. Biden's candidacy in South Carolina and then elevating him to become
a front-runner on Super Tuesday, the speculation will undoubtedly be
intense about whether he will select not just a woman but a black woman
as his running mate.

When the 2020 campaign is all over, Sunday night's debate may be
unearthed like a fossil from the La Brea Tar Pits.

Campaigning in person has stopped.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html}{Upcoming
primaries after Tuesday's four contests have been postponed}. The nation
is about to go into a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus.html}{collective
social} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/economy/federal-reserve-coronavirus.html}{economic
hibernation}. So what effect will this debate have on who wins the
Democratic presidential nomination?

Probably not all that much. Mr. Biden has a durable advantage with black
voters, the party's most reliable constituency. Mr. Sanders romps among
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/joe-biden-young-voters-bernie-sanders.html}{young
people}, who haven't shown much inclination toward Mr. Biden. But if Mr.
Sanders can't win at least one and probably two states on Tuesday, his
path toward the nomination will narrow nearly to a close without much of
an opportunity to change the direction of the campaign for weeks --- and
maybe months.

The Democratic National Committee's rules require all states to hold
presidential nominating contests and assign delegates to the national
convention by late June. It's now next to impossible that the party will
hold its last planned debate in April, given coronavirus concerns. So
Tuesday's debate between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders will serve as the
last opportunity for voters in remaining primary states to size up their
two options.

The question is how they'll weigh their choice --- extending the race
and opting for political revolution by picking Mr. Sanders or finishing
it and focusing on beating Mr. Trump by choosing Mr. Biden.

\hypertarget{the-choice-was-as-clear-as-ever-revolution-vs-restoration}{%
\subsection{The choice was as clear as ever: revolution vs.
restoration.}\label{the-choice-was-as-clear-as-ever-revolution-vs-restoration}}

Mr. Biden firmly believes that if and when Mr. Trump is defeated, there
will be a restoration of normalcy in the nation. Mr. Sanders believes
that Mr. Trump's exit is only the first step toward a necessary
political revolution.

That divide --- one of the most fundamental between the two remaining
candidates ---
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/debate-biden-sanders.html}{was
on vivid display in the debate}, especially over how they framed the
response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr. Sanders used the moment to pitch the need for his government-run
Medicare for all program. Mr. Biden was almost singularly focused on the
immediate crisis at hand.

``People are looking for results,'' Mr. Biden said. ``Not a
revolution.''

Later, Mr. Biden returned to the same theme. ``We have problems we have
to solve now,'' he said, arguing that the Sanders agenda was unfeasible
and unrealistic. ``What's the revolution going to do? Disrupt everything
in the meantime?''

But Mr. Sanders argued that his brand of democratic socialist revolution
was the only way to tackle the economic, social and health inequities in
a capitalist country.

Over and over, Mr. Sanders panned out beyond the immediate national
emergency to address systemic problems that he said were simply being
exacerbated by the current crisis.

``This coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and
dysfunctionality of our current health care system,'' Mr. Sanders said.
He applied the same logic to other fronts.

``It's time to ask the question of where the power is in America,'' Mr.
Sanders said in his final remarks of what could be his final debate.
``Who owns the media? Who owns the economy? Who owns the legislative
process?''
