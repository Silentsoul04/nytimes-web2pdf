OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — Commuters on bicycles and motorbikes wove
through traffic in this West African city wearing face masks to protect
their lungs — but not against coronavirus. They were protecting
themselves from the fine dust blowing in from the Sahara.

Widespread panic over the coronavirus has not yet arrived in this
country and many others in Africa, even as the pandemic has swept across
China, and now Europe and the United States.

Sub-Saharan
[Africa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/africa/Africa-middle-class-coronavirus.html)
has not been hit as hard or as early by
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/world/africa/coronavirus-kano-nigeria-hotspot.html),
despite [predictions by many
experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/africa/africa-coronavirus-china.html)who
had warned that the high traffic between the continent and China, where
the outbreak started, would set off the [infection in
Africa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/africa/Africa-middle-class-coronavirus.html).
Instead, it has been [mostly people coming from
Europe](https://www.afro.who.int/news/more-15-countries-africa-report-covid-19-cases)
and North America who have carried the virus to Africa.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The first two cases in Burkina Faso were a husband-and-wife team of
megachurch pastors, local celebrities, who contracted the virus after
attending a Lenten prayer conference in France. Of the 20 cases now
confirmed in Burkina Faso, two are members of the couple’s megachurch —
and both are from France.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Several African nations, including Uganda, Ghana, Kenya, South Sudan and
South Africa — the sub-Saharan country with the most cases — recently
imposed travel bans on swathes of Europe and on the United States,
countries that for years have set strict limits on Africans entering
their
borders.

But some experts said that people across the continent had yet to take
the threat of coronavirus seriously enough, even though African
presidents have begun announcing strict measures to try to prevent its
spread.

“That’s the danger I’m worried about. We can’t wait for a repeat of what
happened in China,” said Oyewale Tomori, a professor of virology and
former president of the Nigerian Academy of Science.

As the number of cases on the continent has slowly climbed, reaching
[more than 410 across 30 countries](https://twitter.com/WHOAFRO) on
Tuesday, some African leaders tried to prepare their countries. Senegal
banned public gatherings, including religious ones. South Africa
declared a national disaster and closed half its borders. Libya closed
its
airspace.

President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of
Ethiopia [posted
videos](https://twitter.com/PaulKagame/status/1239263206691999748?s=20)
on social media of themselves washing their hands.

In Burkina Faso, the government has closed schools and universities and
banned public gatherings, but has enforced the measure haphazardly, and
did not apply it to religious meetings.

The celebrity pastors, Mamadou and Hortense Karambiri, and their health
were the talk of the mango tree-shaded drinking spots that dot
Ouagadougou. The couple leads a church of 12,000 members, and had held a
service before coming down with symptoms. Their church, Bethel Israel
Tabernacle, canceled its Sunday services.

But the country is not in panic mode. Not
yet.

More than 5,000 people gathered for Friday prayers at Ouagadougou’s
Grand Mosque, where men in face masks and latex gloves pumped
disinfectant and soap into the hands of attendees.

On the weekend, thousands of men and women put on their Sunday best,
climbed aboard their motorcycles, and zoomed to church.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Worshipers arriving at the central Assemblies of God church put down
their tambourines to have their hands spritzed with sanitizer. The air
conditioning was turned off and the windows opened. Communion was
canceled.

“Don’t give in to panic, don’t give in to fear,” Rev. Jean-Baptiste
Rouamba told his congregation, after a special announcement about hand
washing and coughing into elbows. “Fear is another kind of sickness.”

After services, he said in an interview that he would cancel worship
services if the government ordered it. But he said that his services had
been more popular than ever since the outbreak, attracting up to 2,000
people.

If things got worse, he said, he would hold two Sunday services instead
of one so that people could sit with a seat between them.

“If it got the Karambiri couple, nobody is safe,” he said, putting his
hand on the shoulder of a young congregant who wore an airline eye mask
over his
mouth.

Experts have varying explanations for why coronavirus has not yet hit
Africa hard: [some
say](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551767) it is
slower to spread in warmer weather, though this [is
disputed](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/03/16/world/asia/16reuters-health-coronavirus-southeast-asia.html);
others that the continent’s [relatively limited international
links](https://www.theafricareport.com/24160/covid-19-is-only-slowly-reaching-africa-thats-no-surprise/)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It has not gone unnoticed on the continent that the preponderance of
cases originated from Europe and the United States. Last week, after
Kenya announced that the country’s first case of coronavirus was a woman
who had traveled from the United States through London to Nairobi,
rumors circulated on social media that Africans are immune to the virus.

“I would like to disabuse that notion,” said Mutahi Kagwe, Kenya’s
minister of health, [at a news
conference](https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/world/kenya-confirms-first-case-of-coronavirus-in-east-africa/ar-BB118ONC?ocid=st2).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Some warn that if and when the virus gets into crowded cities like
Kinshasa, Lagos and Addis Ababa, the results will be disastrous.

Many African countries set up public health institutions in the wake of
the Ebola outbreak that began in West Africa in 2013, and the African
Union established the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
which coordinates the fight against outbreaks.

“The Ebola outbreak was a wake up call for the entire continent that our
public health systems and health systems as a whole were weak,” said Dr.
John Nkengasong, director of the Africa C.D.C.

However, the continent’s public health systems have never been
well-funded, and experts warned that this vulnerability, along with
crowded conditions and poor sanitation in cities, and the unpredictable
movement of populations, could make outbreaks impossible to control.

“I don’t believe, if we have a large influx of people with the virus, we
can cope,” said Dr. Tomori.

Nevertheless, in Ouagadougou in recent days, life continued almost as
normal. Photographers jostled a stream of wedding parties into position
in front of Ouagadougou’s fanciest swimming pool. Strawberry hawkers
elbowed each other to sell their wares at car
windows.

More than 500 men gathered on Saturday in Samandin, a neighborhood in
the capital city, for the inauguration of a new local crime-fighting
group. Seeking shade in the 104 degree heat, they sat close together on
plastic chairs under tarpaulins for more than three hours. There were no
hand washing facilities, hand sanitizer or disposable masks to be seen.

Presiding over the ceremony was the Malgré-Naaba of Samandin, a
traditional chief, who gave up his personal name when he assumed the
role.

“I think we can manage it if we practice the correct behavior,” he said.
He then warmly shook the hands of a dozen supplicants.

The Malgré-Naaba acknowledged that the government had forbidden such
gatherings, but said the event was an exceptional case.

“This was planned in advance,” he said. “But coronavirus — that was
not.”

Abdi Latif Dahir contributed reporting from Nairobi, Kenya, and Kampala,
Uganda, Simon Marks from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Finbarr O’Reilly
from Ouagadougou.
