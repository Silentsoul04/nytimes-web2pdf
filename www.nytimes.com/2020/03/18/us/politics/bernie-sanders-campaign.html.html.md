\[*Read more:* [*Bernie Sanders has officially ended his 2020
presidential
campaign*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/bernie-sanders-drops-out.html).\]

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was reassessing the future of his
presidential bid on Wednesday after a crushing round of primary losses
left him with no realistic path to the Democratic nomination and the
2020 race itself was on hold because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Mr. Sanders’s campaign has stopped actively advertising on Facebook, and
his campaign manager sent an email to supporters without asking for
donations — the kind of steps that sometimes precede the end of
campaigns. His aides say Mr. Sanders is not suspending his bid, even as
some Democrats have become increasingly vocal that he should consider
leaving the race.

The party’s front-runner, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has now amassed a nearly
insurmountable lead in delegates needed to clinch the nomination after
winning the Arizona, Florida and Illinois primaries on Tuesday. Mr.
Biden has swept so many states and attracted so many demographic groups
that Mr. Sanders has little left to go on besides his political message
and his passionate base of liberal supporters.

Some Democrats said that with the delegate outlook so bleak, and with a
deadly pandemic gripping an anxious nation, Mr. Sanders risks appearing
self-centered and out of step if he insists on pressing ahead.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Bernie is getting beat by 30 and 40 points — it’s over,” said
Representative Don Beyer of Virginia, who has endorsed Mr. Biden. “This
is the adult thing to do — knowing when it is time to disappear."

Mr. Sanders, who has not said when he will make an announcement about
his future, was testy on Wednesday when asked by a CNN reporter about
his plans, suggesting his sole focus should be on the virus.

“I’m dealing with a fucking global crisis,” he said at the Capitol. “You
know, we’re dealing with it, and you’re asking me these questions.”

“Right now, I’m trying to do my best to make sure that we don’t have an
economic meltdown and that people don’t die,” he added. “Is that enough
for you to keep me busy for today?”

Some Democrats said Mr. Sanders had already accomplished a great deal by
promoting his liberal policy agenda. Yet they warned that staying in the
race could damage the coalition he has built since 2015.

“It’s time to throw in the towel knowing that he has won the battle of
issues,” said Wilbur Colom, a Democratic National Committee member from
Mississippi who formerly supported Michael R. Bloomberg. “The Democratic
Party has moved within inches of his revolution on all major
issues.”

Yet<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>26 states, territories and
the District of Columbia have yet to hold primaries and caucuses, and
there [are still 1,399 delegates left to be
awarded](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/delegate-count-primary-results.html).
With the primary season essentially on hold because of public health
concerns, it could be at least two months before Mr. Biden accumulates
enough to secure the nomination. D.N.C. rules require a presidential
nominee to accrue 1,991 delegates, and Mr. Biden cannot win those
delegates if states don’t hold their primaries.

But if Mr. Sanders does quit, Mr. Biden would be free to move on to
focus on the general election, President Trump and the national
challenges posed by the virus.

Even among those who view Mr. Biden’s eventual triumph as inevitable,
there is a belief that contested primaries are good for the party,
generating enthusiasm and spurring turnout. In Wisconsin, Democratic
officials worry that if Mr. Sanders drops out before the state’s planned
April 7 primary, it could depress turnout and hurt liberal candidates
for state and local offices.

“There’s thousands of people on the ballot right now,” said Andrew
Werthmann, a D.N.C. member from Eau Claire, Wis. “People should
recognize that having contested primaries does help drive turnout and
that helps all elections down the ballot.”

Others in the party say that prodding Mr. Sanders to drop out now would
deprive his loyalists of the right to show their support for him at the
ballot box. And for the party’s left wing, having Mr. Sanders continue
to run would enable them to win delegate slots at the national
convention, which would provide leverage when it comes to shaping the
party’s platform and writing rules for the next presidential nominating
contest.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Bernie is not running a campaign so much as leading a movement,” said
Winston Apple, a D.N.C. member from Missouri who supports Mr. Sanders.
“He will be a more effective leader for our movement if he remains in
contention throughout the process.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Former President Barack Obama, who is close to Mr.
Biden,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>has grown increasingly
anxious over the difficulties of incorporating the Sanders wing of the
party into the Biden coalition, according to former aides and
associates. But he has made it clear he will wait for the Vermont
senator to approach him before playing a larger role, one former aide
said.

One of the most conspicuous Sanders boosters on Wednesday was Mr. Trump
himself, who has regularly claimed that the Democratic establishment was
trying to rig the system against Mr. Sanders — and whose campaign viewed
Mr. Sanders as its preferred opponent.

“The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie
Sanders, far ahead of schedule,” [Mr. Trump wrote on
Twitter.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1240265729108303873)
“Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to
keep his supporters.”

Officials close to Mr. Biden say they are sensitive to being perceived
as pushing Mr. Sanders too hard. In a series of staff and surrogate
calls over the past week, Biden aides have increasingly pressed for an
approach in which Mr. Biden begins to ignore Mr. Sanders altogether and
instead tries to turn the race into a two-man contest with Mr. Trump,
according to people familiar with the campaign’s strategy.

Mr. Biden’s campaign also understands it is operating from a position of
strength. On Wednesday it sent a memo to reporters that declared he had
an “increasingly clear” path to the nomination and saying the 2020
primary race “is nowhere near as close as the 2008 and 2016 Democratic
primaries.”

The two campaigns have been communicating, however. Kate Bedingfield, a
deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said in a statement on Wednesday
that “since last week, the Biden and Sanders campaigns have been in
regular contact at a senior level to discuss how the coronavirus is
affecting the campaigns, how to adjust schedules and activities in light
of that — as well as to discuss both Vice President Biden’s and Senator
Sanders’s ideas on policy responses to the virus.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“While the two campaigns obviously have their differences,” she added,
“they are working together to try to promote the health and safety of
their teams, those who interact with the campaigns, and the American
people.”

Advisers to Mr. Sanders have begun to make peace with the fact that he
will in all likelihood lose the nomination to Mr. Biden. But they also
see no real downside in sticking it out, pointing to the uncertainty
surrounding the primaries because of the coronavirus.

Mr. Sanders also views the crisis as a moment when the progressive
agenda he has championed for years is especially vital, and he is eager
to leverage his influence at a time when issues like health care and
economic inequity are so resonant, some allies say.

On Tuesday night before most polls closed, he released [a list of
proposals](https://berniesanders.com/issues/emergency-response-coronavirus-pandemic/)to
deal with the crisis, including that Medicare cover all medical bills
and that $2,000 cash payments be provided to every American each
month.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>He has indicated he
plans to speak with Democratic leadership about the plans he has
proposed.

And one aide said there had been regular discussions in the last several
days about ways the campaign can help working families who may be stuck
at home, including putting together programming for children to occupy
them during the day.

After years of being excluded from what he sees as the party’s
establishment clique, Mr. Sanders is also still determined to show that
he is a superior candidate to Mr. Biden, whom he views as the
establishment’s choice, some close to him say.

On the debate stage on Sunday, he delivered pointed attacks on Mr.
Biden’s record in a way that vexed Biden supporters and left some
Democrats wondering aloud if he might weaken the presumptive nominee in
the general election against Mr. Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Sanders, however, has insisted he thinks Mr. Biden can beat Mr.
Trump, and none of his aides have indicated they are worried that
staying in the race will divide the party in a way that benefits Mr.
Trump.

Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, suggested Wednesday that a
decision on how the senator would proceed was not imminent.

“The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,” Mr. Shakir said
in a statement. “Senator Sanders is going to be having conversations
with supporters to assess his campaign. In the immediate term, however,
he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and
ensuring that we take care of working people and the most
vulnerable.”

The ultimate decision on how to proceed, aides said, rests with Mr.
Sanders and his wife, Jane, who were expected to return to Vermont on
Wednesday night; his top campaign advisers were not scheduled to travel
with him.

But discussions in recent days with more than 40 Democratic National
Committee members and members of Congress found a clear majority
believed he should get out of the presidential race now — with some
warning that staying in could damage the progressive coalition he has
built since 2015.

It is possible Mr. Sanders could stay in the race and run what
effectively amounts to an inactive campaign as he focuses on his
legislative agenda around the coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders confidant who is chairman of Our
Revolution, the political organization that spun out of the 2016 Sanders
campaign, said it was not in Mr. Sanders’s nature to drop out before all
the primaries are over, “but the pandemic and the current delegate count
could lead to a different outcome.”

“The delegate count,” he said, “speaks for
itself.”
