The former governor of Massachusetts carried out a long-shot primary
campaign focused on appealing to moderate Republicans.

WASHINGTON --- A day after President Trump officially
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/march-17-democratic-primary.html}{racked
up enough delegates} to become the presumptive 2020 Republican nominee
for president, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, his last
Republican challenger, ended his campaign.

``The reason that people all over the world look to the United States
for leadership, as they do, is our dedication to the rule of law under
our Constitution,'' Mr. Weld said in a statement announcing the
suspension of his campaign. He did not address Mr. Trump by name, but he
added that if a president does not observe the rule of law, ``we will
truly have lost our compass.''

Mr. Weld's announcement came in the midst of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/coronavirus-news.html}{the
coronavirus pandemic}, and aides said he planned to make no appearances
or conduct any interviews because he did not want to distract from
coverage of the crisis.

Brad Parscale, the president's campaign manager, on Tuesday night
credited Mr. Trump's victory in the primary to ``his response to the
coronavirus and a ``broad and strong economy,'' even as markets plunged
and a global recession appeared inevitable.

Mr. Weld, whose long-shot campaign had been based on appealing to
moderate voters in New Hampshire who might support a libertarian in
favor of abortion rights and legalized marijuana, held out even after
attracting
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/11/us/elections/results-new-hampshire-republican-primary.html}{just
9.1 percent of the vote} in that state, under the double-digit threshold
to win any delegates. His decision to stay in the race was more about
providing voters who dislike Mr. Trump with a place to cast a protest
vote, rather than harboring any realistic hope of wrestling the
nomination from the president.

Mr. Weld was the first Republican to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/bill-weld-trump-2020.html}{announce
a challenge to Mr. Trump}, in February 2019, and the last to drop out.
The field of contenders at one point included
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/politics/mark-sanford-2020.html}{former
Gov. Mark Sanford} of South Carolina and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/joe-walsh-drops-out.html}{former
Representative Joe Walsh} of Illinois.

``I applaud Bill Weld for doing this for the right reasons in the first
place and hanging in there as long as he could,'' said Sarah Longwell, a
Republican strategist who has been working to oppose Mr. Trump from
within the party. ``It was important that somebody stood up and made the
case against Trump.''

Lucy Caldwell, who served as an adviser to Mr. Walsh, said, ``There's no
doubt in my mind that Bill Weld, Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford will be
remembered as having been on the right side of history when so few
Republicans were.''

Intraparty challenges against an incumbent president always face long
odds. But the collective failure to launch by any Republican candidate
underscored Mr. Trump's grip on the party, with his approval rating
among Republicans remaining in the high 80s.

Mr. Trump's re-election campaign consistently dismissed all three
candidates as unserious, even as it meticulously worked with state
parties behind the scenes to shut down primaries and deprive any other
candidate of oxygen. When Mr. Trump did acknowledge them on Twitter, he
referred to them disparagingly as ``the Three Stooges.''

The small ``Never Trump'' movement of Republicans, meanwhile, has
recently been more focused on supporting the Democratic candidacy of
former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}, and getting center-right voters registered in the
Democratic primary election.
