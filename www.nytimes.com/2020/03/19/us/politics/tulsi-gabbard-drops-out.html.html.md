Representative [Tulsi
Gabbard](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/tulsi-gabbard.html)
of Hawaii, who ran a foreign policy-focused campaign for the
presidential nomination of a party she sharply criticized, announced on
Thursday that she was dropping out of the race.

Ms. Gabbard, who had been one of only three candidates and the only
woman remaining in the Democratic primary, said she would throw her
support to former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),
who has accumulated a nearly insurmountable lead in the delegate count.
Throughout the race, her campaign struggled to gain traction, never
breaking double digits in state or national polls. She won only two
delegates in the primary contests, both in American Samoa, where she was
born.

“Our nation is facing an unprecedented global crisis that highlights the
inextricable bonds of humanity, and how foreign policy and domestic
policy are inseparable,” she said. “The best way I can be of service at
this time is to continue to work for the health and well-being of the
people of Hawaii and our country in Congress, and to stand ready to
serve in uniform should the Hawaii National Guard be activated.”

She also cited her relationship with Mr. Biden’s son Beau, who served in
the Delaware Army National Guard and died in 2015.

“Although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know
that he has a good heart and is motivated by his love for our country
and the American people,” she said. “I’m confident that he will lead our
country guided by the spirit of aloha — respect and compassion — and
thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country
apart."

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Gabbard, 38, announced late last year that she would not seek
re-election to Congress in the fall.

She campaigned for president on a noninterventionist foreign policy,
denouncing “regime-change wars” and the idea of the United States as the
world’s police. She said her own deployments — she served two tours of
duty in the Middle East as a member of the National Guard — had taught
her the costs of war firsthand.

“We should be coming to other leaders in other countries with respect,
building a relationship based on cooperation rather than with, you know,
a police baton,” [she said last
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-race.html).

Her unorthodox platform, a mix of noninterventionist foreign policy,
liberal social policy and libertarian leanings on issues like drug
decriminalization, [attracted support from an unusual array of public
backers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard.html).
Alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activists and
some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heaped praise on [Ms.
Gabbard](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-clinton-new-hampshire.html).

Many Democrats were far more skeptical of her effort, at a loss to
explain her frequent appearances on Fox News, favorable coverage in
Russian state media and an ideology that both argued for getting out of
foreign wars and refused to strongly condemn some autocratic leaders.

A public fight with Hillary Clinton [brought attention and fund-raising
dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-clinton-new-hampshire.html),
keeping Ms. Gabbard on the primary debate stage and attracting some
support from independent and Republican voters, particularly in
libertarian-leaning New Hampshire.

Ms. Gabbard was once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party,
[even as she sometimes defied
it](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-rising-democratic-star-from-hawaii-makes-mark-on-party-by-defying-it.html).

Her progressive economics and noninterventionist foreign policy seemed
like obvious attractions for Democrats, her military résumé gave her
extra credibility, and she broke barriers as the first Hindu and the
first American Samoan elected to Congress. So it was not surprising when
[she entered the presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-president-announcement.html)
last January, even though no sitting representative has been elected
president in 140 years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a race that at its peak included six female candidates, Ms. Gabbard
ended up becoming the last woman standing.

But while she had a deeply devoted base, it was not large enough to
sustain her. And at times, she seemed to be campaigning against the same
party whose nomination she was seeking.

“Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by
and for the people,” she said [at a debate in
November](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-harris-debate.html).
“It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the
foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary
Clinton and others’ foreign policy, by the military industrial complex
and other greedy corporate interests.”

President Trump’s re-election campaign seized on that remark, clipping
the first sentence and [blasting it out on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1197342010191036416)
before the debate had even ended.

Perhaps no emblem of the establishment was a better foil for Ms. Gabbard
than Mrs. Clinton, who [suggested in
October](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-hillary-clinton-russia.html)
that Russia was backing Ms. Gabbard’s campaign and that Republicans were
“grooming” her as a third-party candidate. Ms. Gabbard pushed back
fiercely, calling Mrs. Clinton “the queen of warmongers, embodiment of
corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the
Democratic Party for so long” and then suing her for defamation.

The clash [helped raise Ms. Gabbard’s
profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-clinton-new-hampshire.html)
and won over some voters — including independents and conservatives —
who dislike the Clintons, while simultaneously alienating some members
of the party’s usual base.

Ms. Gabbard also broke from the Democratic pack on impeachment. She [was
the last
candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-impeachment.html)
to back an inquiry last year, and when the articles of impeachment came
to the House floor in December, she was the only Democrat [who refused
to cast a yes-or-no
vote](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/elections/tulsi-gabbard-impeachment-vote.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote
either yes or no,” she said at the time, calling the process too
partisan. “I am standing in the center and have decided to vote
present.”
