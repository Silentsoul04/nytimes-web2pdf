# Fine Print of Stimulus Bill Contains Special Deals for Industries

Small banks, retailers and for-profit colleges got provisions they
wanted. So did Boeing. Among those who could potentially benefit:
President Trump’s company.

WASHINGTON — Restaurants and retailers will get a tweak to federal tax
law they have been seeking for more than a year that could save them $15
billion. Community banks are being granted their long-held wish of being
freed to reduce the amount of capital they have to hold in reserve.

And for-profit colleges will be able to keep federal loan money from
students who drop out because of the coronavirus.

Tucked into the largest bailout in United States history — a $2 trillion
federal
[stimulus](https://www.nytimes.com/article/where-is-my-stimulus-payment.html)package
[agreed to by congressional leaders and the White House early
Wednesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/coronavirus-senate-deal.html)
in an effort [to reduce the economic
devastation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/business/2-trillion-stimulus-coronavirus-bill.html)
of the coronavirus outbreak — are a range of provisions that stand to
benefit specific industries and interest groups.

Even the fine print in a near-final [880-page version of the
bill](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6843-revised-final-cares-10-p-m-3-2/ae6f534c4fc474f4ba33/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
has fine print. Democrats proudly announced that they had won agreement
on language to block President Trump, other government officials and
their families from receiving assistance from a $500 billion fund to be
administered by the Treasury Department.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But it turns out that the provision might not preclude funds from going
to companies owned by the family of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and White
House adviser, Jared Kushner, while Mr. Trump’s companies would not be
barred from benefiting from other elements of the bill intended to help
broad swaths of American business.

For example, certain hotel owners, even those employing thousands of
people, will be eligible for small-business loans, a provision that
could potentially benefit Mr. Trump’s company to help to continue to pay
wages for his employees. The Trump Organization could also benefit from
the $15 billion change to the tax code won by restaurants and retailers.

The legislation, [which passed the
Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/coronavirus-senate-deal.html)
and could be passed by the House and signed into law by Mr. Trump by the
end of the week, is intended primarily [to put money in the hands of
many
households](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/whats-in-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html)
and prop up especially hard-hit industries like airlines.

But its sheer size and the rushed way it was put together made it an
irresistible target for lobbyists, who launched a [frenzied effort to
insert into the must-pass
legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/coronavirus-stimulus-lobbying.html)
provisions their clients wanted, some of which had a timely rationale
and others of which were largely unconnected to the coronavirus crisis.

This lobbying push was unlike any other, as social distancing measures
intended to limit the spread of the virus among lawmakers and their
staffs left the [Capitol eerily
quiet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/coronavirus-congress-voting.html).
Lobbyists instead pressed their causes to staff members and lawmakers
over the phone, or via email.

“We went to McConnell’s people, we went to Schumer’s people, and
Pelosi’s and McCarthy’s people — we pinged them all,” said Rachelle B.
Bernstein, [a

and tax counsel at the National Retail Federation, which pressed
successfully for the $15-billion-a-year change in federal tax law.

While some industries and companies are benefiting from provisions
tailored for them, others appear certain to get a piece of the pie
through more general components of the bill, from the $454 billion
general purpose fund for businesses and state and local governments to
the $50 billion earmarked for airlines and $8 billion for air cargo
carriers.

The deal specifically sets aside $17 billion for “businesses critical to
maintaining national security” — a category seen as intended at least
partly for Boeing, the troubled aircraft manufacturer and Pentagon
contractor, whose name appears nowhere in the
bill.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Despite the effort by Democrats to limit access by top federal officials
and members of Congress **** to the bailout funds, the law would still
leave room for Mr. Trump to benefit. At least two of the provisions,
intended to help the hotel and restaurant industries, could potentially
provide financial help to the Trump Organization.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A spokesman for the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for
comment. Mr. Trump declined to respond to a question this week about
whether his family business intended to take advantage of any of the tax
breaks or other benefits included in the legislation.

“I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Sunday. “I just
don’t know what the government assistance would be for what I have. I
have hotels.”

Many of these special-interest provisions would be impossible for a
casual reader of the legislation to identify. For example, on Page 15 of
the bill, there is a section with the title “Business Concerns With More
Than 1 Physical Location.” It says this change in federal law will apply
to companies that fit “a North American Industry Classification System
code beginning with 72” — a reference that turns out to mean the hotel
and restaurant industry.

The provision says that if a company owns multiple hotels, even if the
overall hotel or restaurant chain has more than 500 employees — the
limit to qualify for treatment as a small business — it will still be
able to take advantage of the small-business benefits offered in the
rescue package.

That means loans from the federal government worth up to 2.5 times the
firm’s monthly payroll that will not have to be repaid if the company
uses them to keep paying employees during any coronavirus shutdowns.

Representatives from the American Hotel & Lodging Association reached
out to Republicans and Democrats to push them to insert the language,
arguing that it would allow the federal assistance to cover an
additional 33,000 hotels, with a total of about one million employees.

The large corporations that own the big brands — like Marriott or Hilton
— would not be eligible. But any individual hotel, including from one of
these brands, that has fewer than 500 employees would be. Many hotels
are owned by franchisees.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The provision could benefit the Trump Organization, which operates a
relatively small chain, with six hotels in the United States in cities
including New York, Washington and Chicago. Several Trump hotels are
members of the trade association.

A representative for the trade group said executives at the Trump
Organization were not involved in the lobbying effort. Representatives
of the Trump Organization did not respond to a question on Wednesday
about the
provision.

The tweak to the tax code sought by the nation’s retailers and grocers
could mean $15 billion a year worth of tax savings for hotels,
restaurants, supermarkets and other retailers. Groups representing those
industries separately intervened with both Mr. Trump and leaders on
Capitol Hill to push lawmakers to include it in the final
package.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The provision could potentially benefit Mr. Trump’s companies, among
many others, by allowing them to immediately write off money spent on
renovations at hotels or restaurants, instead of having to take the
deduction over 37 years.

Industry lobbyists have been pushing for the change for more than a
year. They have called it a technical correction to the 2017 tax
legislation that Mr. Trump signed into law. The provision is simply
called “Technical Amendments Regarding Qualified Improvement Property.”

It would allow hotels, restaurants and retailers that have spent money
fixing up their properties in the last two years to accelerate the way
they write off those expenses, effectively giving them an immediate tax
refund, Ms. Bernstein, the industry lobbyist said. They could then use
the refund to help cover bills during the crisis. The special tax
benefit would be retroactive to 2018 and would last for at least three
more years, before it is gradually phased out.

“If you let us amend our returns, we will be getting billions back and
it will help us pay our employees and our rents and stay in business
until consumers can come back into our stores,” Ms. Bernstein said,
echoing the argument she said she made to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Meanwhile, the provision inserted by Democrats to block the families of
government officials from receiving certain assistance might not exempt
the companies owned by the family of Mr. Kushner.

While the provision expressly bars such funds from going to companies
controlled by “the spouse, child, son-in-law or daughter-in-law” of the
president and other officials, in order for the prohibition to kick in,
the person in question would have to “directly or indirectly” own or
control **** 20 percent or more of a company. Mr. Kushner rarely owns
that much in his family firm’s various real estate projects, according
to a person familiar with the family’s business arrangements. The
ownership is usually divided between Mr. Kushner, his three siblings,
his two parents and various outside investors.

Mr. Kushner’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request
for
comment.

Another business that could benefit from the bill is for-profit
colleges, which have been [championed by some
Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/betsy-devos-for-profit-colleges.html),
but targeted as predatory by Democrats and advocates for student
borrowers.

A provision in the bill would allow all colleges to retain federal funds
allocated to help educate qualifying students, even if the students in
question dropped out because of coronavirus-related emergencies. While
the provision applies to all colleges, critics of for-profit colleges
contend that, because those schools tend to have higher dropout rates,
they would be able to retain more of the money they collect via federal
loans to their students than would traditional nonprofit colleges.

“What’s happening now is causing a crisis for all sectors of higher ed,
and I understand the intent, but it would disproportionately help
for-profit schools because their dropout rates are higher than other
segments of higher ed,” said Toby Merrill, the founder of the Project on
Predatory Student Lending.

Both parties jammed in provisions to help favored constituencies. The
deal included $25 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington — money that has [generated
complaints](https://www.foxnews.com/media/dana-perino-democrats-coronavirus-bill-kennedy-center)
from some conservatives.

It also includes $7.5 million for the Smithsonian Institution, as well
as $75 million each for the National Endowment for the Arts and the
National Endowment for the Humanities to provide grants to arts
organizations, museums and libraries during the coronavirus outbreak.

The bill also contains a six-month extension of federal funding through
the end of November for abstinence-only education programs favored by
social conservatives who are a critical Republican voting bloc. The
extension is coupled with one for sex education programs that provide
information about birth control and safe sex, which are supported by
reproductive rights groups that tend to back Democrats.

Provisions sought by the nation’s smaller banks, a powerful
constituency, were also included in the bill. One change would allow
those banks to have lower requirements for capital reserves, the buffer
that financial institutions are required to keep on hand to ensure they
remain solvent if they run into trouble.

The industry late last year had fought for the change, and lost. This
time the banks used the disaster to reopen the fight and get the lower
capital requirements they wanted, arguing that it would allow them to do
more lending to small businesses during the coronavirus emergency. The
change would remain in effect as long as the virus emergency continued,
although the industry is already discussing looking for ways to make it
permanent.
