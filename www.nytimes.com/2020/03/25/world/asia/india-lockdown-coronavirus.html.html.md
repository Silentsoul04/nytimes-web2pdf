NEW DELHI — India’s economy was sputtering even before its leader
announced the [world’s largest coronavirus
lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html).
Now the state-ordered paralysis of virtually all commerce in the country
has put millions of people out of work and left many families struggling
to eat.

On the first day of the nationwide 21-day shutdown of nearly all
services on Wednesday, the streets of Mumbai, India’s largest metropolis
— usually so busy it’s known as [Maximum
City](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/112973/maximum-city-by-suketu-mehta/)
— were silent. Shuttered shops, empty train tracks, closed airports and
idle factories all across the country were signs of the economic impact
of the social distancing that the Indian government said was necessary
to prevent new
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)
infections.

India has reported 606 coronavirus cases so far, but with the population
density so high and the public health system so weak, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi ordered the country’s 1.3 billion residents to stay inside
to keep
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)
from sliding into a disaster that could potentially dwarf what China,
Italy, Spain, the United States and other countries have faced.

But Mr. Modi’s effort to prevent the spread of the virus will lead to
its own calamitous damage.

“The kind of devastation that is going to be faced by the bottom 50
percent of the workers in the informal sector is unimaginable,” said
Jayati Ghosh, an economist and professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru
University in New Delhi.

In some places, police officers have staked out roads and highways,
stopping motorists and demanding to know why they were outside. Several
states have closed their borders, forcing cargo trucks to simply park by
the roadside.

Flipkart, the country’s largest online retailer, found it so difficult
to move people and goods that it suspended delivery of everything except
food.

Grocery stores were allowed to remain open, and in the cities, crowds
swarmed and emptied the shelves. At an upscale market in New Delhi, one
man stuffed his Mercedes with groceries on Wednesday afternoon, jumped
behind the wheel and zoomed off — wearing blue rubber dishwashing gloves

The National Restaurant Association of India estimated that perhaps 20
percent of the 7.3 million restaurant workers will permanently lose
their jobs as employers go out of business. “Many companies may not
survive this onslaught,” said Anurag Katriar, the association’s chief
executive and the owner of a chain of upscale eateries.

Harcharan Singh, a vendor in rural Punjab state who usually goes door to
door peddling everything from oranges to cauliflower, has had nothing to
sell for days. The big wholesale food markets he normally relies on have
all been closed.

“Our business is completely shut,” he said. “We need this money to
survive, get food for our families.”

Hundreds of millions of Indians are like Mr. Singh, with little or no
savings. Rickshaw drivers, for example, buy food for their families with
the money they make that day. Banned from the roads, many drivers don’t
know how they will survive.

[Economists at Barclays
predicted](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/indias-21-day-lockdown-may-shave-off-2-percentage-points-off-gdp-growth)
Wednesday that the lockdown would last a month and shave two percentage
points off India’s anemic economic growth rate. Although India is likely
to escape a recession, Barclays said, such a significant slowdown would
mean rising joblessness in a country where millions of young people
enter the work force every year.

Mr. Modi acknowledged the trade-offs in a televised address on Tuesday
night, when he [first announced the nationwide
lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html).

“No doubt this lockdown will entail an economic cost for the country,
but saving the life of each and every Indian is the first priority for
me,” he said. “If we are not able to manage the next 21 days, then many
families will be destroyed forever.”

Economists are urging the government to create a huge stimulus package
to blunt the effects of the lockdown.

India’s government stores an enormous grain supply, which could quickly
be distributed to the poor, said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at
[CRISIL](https://www.crisil.com/en/home/about-us/our-offices.html#), a
Mumbai-based credit ratings agency.

Mr. Joshi also urged direct cash payments to individuals, and loans to
small and medium-size businesses. “Give a clear signal that you will
help,” he said.

The Modi administration is deliberating what kind of stimulus to offer,
and a plan is expected to be unveiled within days.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“All shops are shut, not even groceries or chemists are open,” he said,
which should not be the case, according to the government’s rules. “The
uncertainty is killing me.”

The lockdown includes schools, offices, factories, parks, temples,
railways, even the airspace. To impose social distancing where people
are ordinarily squeezed together, exempted businesses and the
authorities are looking to devise solutions.

In the city of Meerut, the police began shaming people caught evading
the lockdown, forcing them to hold signs — later posted on social media
— stating they did not care about protecting society.

In Veergaon, a farming village in central Maharashtra state, a few
farmers were still tilling the fields. But many stayed indoors, in small
cramped houses with sheet metal roofs.

“They fear the disease,” said Kapil Wagarhande, a villager.

During his address on Tuesday night, Mr. Modi spoke forcefully about the
dangers of social interaction and how Indians must make big, immediate
sacrifices. Mr. Modi remains widely popular in India. In many quarters,
what he says
goes.

“Everybody appreciates the steps taken by Modi ji,” said Kailash Dhoot,
a textile trader in Mr. Modi’s home state of Gujarat, using a term of
respect. “Of course people are facing problems like how to spend the
whole day. What do you do?”

Still, rumors and misinformation have led to the closure of essential
businesses and the harassment of citizens, outcomes that the government
likely did not intend.

Gaurav Gupta, chief operating officer of Zomato, one of the country’s
largest restaurant delivery services, said his couriers had been turned
back and in some cases detained by the police, despite clear orders from
the government permitting such deliveries.

[In a video
message](https://twitter.com/Teensthack/status/1242697679450210307),
Sandeep Nangia, president of a pharmacists’ association in New Delhi,
said the police were “raining sticks” on pharmacists for trying to do
their jobs.

Doctors and airline employees have reported landlords forcibly evicting
them as

tenants.

Amrita Saha, an employee at IndiGo, India’s largest airline, said her
neighbors in Kolkata were spreading rumors that she had the coronavirus
and harassing her mother, who lives with her.

“She cannot go to the market to buy groceries, because people are
refusing her, saying, ‘Your daughter has the corona and you might also
have it,’” Ms. Saha [said in a recent
video](https://twitter.com/Zebaism/status/1242309348749172736), nearly
in tears.

An association of doctors in New Delhi wrote to India’s home minister,
Amit Shah, on Tuesday, urging the government to protect medical
personnel from home eviction.

“Many doctors are now stranded on the roads with all their luggage,” the
letter
read.
