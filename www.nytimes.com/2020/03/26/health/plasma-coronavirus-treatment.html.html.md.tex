Patients}\label{blood-plasma-from-survivors-will-be-given-to-coronavirus-patients}}

In people who have recovered, plasma is teeming with antibodies that may
fight the virus. But the treatment beginning in New York is
experimental.

Can blood from
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/health/trump-plasma.html}{coronavirus}
survivors help other people fight the illness?

Doctors in New York will soon be testing the idea in hospitalized
patients who are seriously ill.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/health/trump-plasma.html}{Blood}
from people who have recovered can be a rich source of antibodies,
proteins made by the immune system to attack the virus. The part of the
blood that contains antibodies, so-called convalescent plasma, has been
used for decades to treat infectious diseases, including Ebola and
influenza.

``It's kind of difficult scientifically to know how valuable it is in
any disease until you try,'' said Dr. David L. Reich, president and
chief operating officer of the Mount Sinai Hospital, which will be using
the treatment. ``It's not exactly a shot in the dark, but it's not tried
and true.''

Dr. Reich said it would be tried as a treatment for hospitalized
patients who had a moderate form of the disease and had trouble
breathing, but not for those who are in advanced stages of the disease.

``The idea is to get to the right patients at the right time,'' he said.
``But it's experimental.''

Researchers at Mount Sinai were among the first in the United States to
develop a test that can detect antibodies in recovering patients, an
essential part of this treatment strategy.

On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration gave permission for the
plasma to be used experimentally on an emergency basis to treat
coronavirus patients, and hospitals in New York quickly began asking to
participate, said Dr. Bruce Sachais, chief medical officer of the New
York Blood Center, which will collect, test and distribute the plasma.

``Our main focus is, how do we implement this quickly to help the
hospitals get product to their patients,'' Dr. Sachais said. ``We have
blood centers in New England, Delaware and the Midwest, so we can do the
same thing in other regions. We're working with other blood centers and
hospitals that may collect their own blood and want to do this. We may
not be able to collect enough plasma in New York to help the entire
country, so we want to share with other centers to help them.''

Dr. Reich said that an email asking Mount Sinai staff members who had
recovered to consider donating plasma went ``a little viral,'' and
quickly drew 2,000 responses.

But volunteers will have to be carefully screened to meet strict
criteria. The donors will include people who tested positive for the
virus when they were ill, recovered, have had no symptoms for 14 days,
now test negative --- and have high levels, also called titers, of
antibodies that fight the virus. Dr. Reich said that because there were
delays and shortages in testing, the number of people who qualify may be
low at first.

``Our expectation, based on reports from the Chinese experience, is that
most people who get better have high-titer antibodies,'' Dr. Sachais
said. ``Most patients who recover will have good antibodies in a
month.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/26/science/26VIRUS-PLASMA2/merlin_170554578_9942a545-6a08-43c8-9ae3-d2e3caa4fffc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

People who qualify will then be sent to blood centers to donate plasma.
The procedure, called apheresis, is similar to giving blood, except that
the blood drawn from the patient is run through a machine to extract the
plasma, and the red and white cells are then returned to the donor.
Needles go into both arms: Blood flows out of one arm, passes through
the machine and goes back into the other arm. The process usually takes
60 to 90 minutes, and can yield enough plasma to treat three patients,
Dr. Sachais said.

People who have recovered have antibodies to spare, and removing some
will not endanger the donors or diminish their own resistance to the
virus, Dr. Sachais said. ``We may get rid of 20 percent of their
antibodies, and a couple days later they'll be back.''

The plasma will be tested to make sure it is not carrying infections
like hepatitis or H.I.V., or certain proteins that could set off immune
reactions in the recipient. If it passes the tests, it can then be
frozen, or used right away. Each patient to be treated will receive one
unit, about a cup, which will be dripped in like a blood transfusion. As
with blood transfusions, plasma donors and recipients must have matching
types, but the rules are not the same as those for transfusions.

``We think this is going to be an effective treatment for at least some
patients, but we don't really know yet,'' Dr. Sachais said. ``Hopefully,
we'll get some data in the next few weeks from the first patients, to
see if we're on the right track.''

``In other coronavirus epidemics I don't think we have strong
evidence,'' he said. ``We don't have controlled data. There were reports
from SARS and MERS that patients improved.''

He said the decision to try this approach was based in part on reports
from China that it seemed to help patients. But the reports are not
based on controlled studies or definitive data.

Dr. Sachais said an article in a journal that was not peer-reviewed
described treating 10 patients in China with one unit each of
convalescent plasma, and said it appeared safe and seemed to quickly
lower their virus levels.

``It's anecdotal,'' he said.

A researcher not associated with the new treatment plans said there was
evidence to support using plasma from survivors.

``Four to six or eight weeks after infection, their blood should be full
of antibodies that will neutralize the virus and that will theoretically
limit the infection,'' said Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the
University of Texas Medical Branch.

In studies in mice, he said, ``If you can drive the virus replication
down tenfold to hundredfold, that can be the difference between life and
death.''

He described the use of convalescent plasma as ``a classic approach that
is a really effective way to treat'' --- if there are enough donors with
enough of the right antibodies.

A potential risk, he said, is that the patient's immune system could
react against something in the plasma, and cause additional illness.

Although hospitals will gather information about the patients being
treated, the procedure is not being done as part of a clinical trial.
There will not be a placebo group or the other measures needed to
determine whether a treatment works.

``People are so desperately ill now, it isn't the right time,'' Dr.
Reich said. ``They're in the hospital, they're sick, in intensive care,
on ventilators. Some get sick so quickly, and it's such a severe illness
in some people, we feel it's not the right moment.''

He said the doctors were relying on science and evidence as much as
possible.

But he added: ``You see this steamroller coming at you, and you don't
want to sit there passively and let it roll over you. So you put
together everything you have to try to fight it. This has the potential
to help and also the potential to harm, but we just won't know until
it's later in the process of the disease and people have had an
opportunity to try different things.''

Survivors seem eager to help.

``We're getting a lot of requests,'' Dr. Sachais said. ``One center sent
a survey to patients who are getting better, and there were hundreds of
responses saying they were interested in being donors. This is going to
bring people together. People who've survived will want to do something
for their fellow New Yorkers.''
