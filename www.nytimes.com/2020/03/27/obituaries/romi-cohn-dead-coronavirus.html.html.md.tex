He was just 15 when he joined the underground resisting the Nazis in
what was then Czechoslovakia.

But Romi Cohn was resourceful enough to supply Jewish refugees with
housing and furnish them with false Christian identifications, stamping
them with German seals provided by a cooperative Gestapo source. In all,
he saved 56 families, according to the Twitter account of Rep. Max Rose,
his congressman on Staten Island, N.Y.

Mr. Cohn died of respiratory distress caused by pneumonia and the
coronavirus on Tuesday at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, his
great-nephew, Shulem Geldzahler, said. He was 91 and had homes in
Borough Park, Brooklyn, and Great Kills, Staten Island.

After the war, Mr. Cohn made his way to the United States and became
wealthy developing thousands of single-family homes on Staten Island. He
also turned himself into an expert mohel, performing thousands of
circumcisions and writing scholarly articles. He even set up an
operating theater in his Staten Island home to circumcise adult Russian
Jews who had not been able to undergo the ritual as infants because of
Soviet strictures.

Avraham Hakohen Cohn --- Romi was a nickname he adopted in America, and
he was usually called Rabbi Cohn --- was born in Pressburg, now known as
Bratislava, the capital of what is now Slovakia, on March 10, 1929. He
was one of seven children. When the Germans marched into Czechoslovakia
and deported Jews to concentration camps, his family managed to spirit
him across the border to Hungary. His mother, two brothers and two
sisters perished in the camps.

He studied at a Hasidic yeshiva until 1944, when the Germans occupied
Hungary and deported tens of thousands of Jews to Auschwitz. He managed
to slip back into Czechoslovakia and joined up with a partisan brigade
battling the retreating Germans.

With the German defeat, Mr. Cohn rejoined his father and two sisters in
Pressburg. He described his wartime experiences in an autobiography,
``The Youngest Partisan,'' published in 2001.

In the United States, he met Malvine Geldzahler, the woman who would
become his wife and who survives him. They had no children. Rabbi Cohn
set up a foundation that financed the education of 70 rabbinical
students in Israel. He considered them his offspring.
