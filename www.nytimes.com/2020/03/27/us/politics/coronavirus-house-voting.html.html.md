# $2 Trillion Coronavirus Stimulus Bill Is Signed Into Law

Dozens of lawmakers rushed back to Washington to thwart a stall tactic

WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday signed a sweeping [$2 trillion
measure](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html)
to respond to the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/coronavirus-news.html)
pandemic, but not before a late objection from a lone rank-and-file
Republican forced hundreds of lawmakers to rush back to the capital even
as the virus continued to spread through their ranks.

The move by Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky,
accomplished an extraordinary feat, uniting President Trump and John
Kerry, the former Democratic secretary of state and presidential
candidate, in a bipartisan moment of outrage against a lawmaker who
wanted to force the whole House to take a formal roll-call vote.

House Democrats and Republicans teamed up to bring just enough lawmakers
back to the Capitol to thwart Mr. Massie’s tactic, and the measure
passed on a voice vote. It was a resounding show of support for a bill
that lawmakers in both parties said was imperfect, but essential to
address a national public health and economic crisis.

“I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and
putting America first,” Mr. Trump said on Friday as he signed the
legislation in the Oval Office. But by then, the spark of bipartisanship
appeared to have faded. While the legislation was the product of a
compromise among Republicans, Democrats and the administration, Mr.
Trump did not invite any Democrats to the White House to celebrate its
enactment, as is typical.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The measure is unparalleled in its scope and size, touching on every
aspect of the country in an effort to send help to desperate Americans,
provide aid to hospitals combating the disease, and bolster an economy
forced to slow or shut down altogether to minimize the spread of the
pandemic.

In weeks, it will send direct payments of $1,200 to individuals earning
up to $75,000, with smaller payments to those with incomes of up to
$99,000 and an additional $500 per child. It will substantially expand
jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month
enhancement of benefits — including an extra $600 per week — and extend
it to freelancers and gig workers. The package also suspends all federal
student loan payments for six months through September, and the loans
will not accrue interest during that period.

For companies struggling under the strain of the crisis, the measure
will provide $377 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small
businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program for
distressed companies, including allowing the administration the ability
to take equity stakes in airlines that received aid to help compensate
taxpayers. It also sends $100 billion to hospitals on the front lines of
the pandemic.

For the 116th Congress, which began in the middle of a government
shutdown and emerged only weeks ago from a bitter impeachment fight, the
enactment of a mammoth government aid bill capped off a remarkable
flurry of bipartisan cooperation and expedited legislative work.

But in the final hours before its approval, chaos reigned on Capitol
Hill, as Mr. Massie, a libertarian with a [penchant for using procedural
maneuvers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/us/politics/disaster-relief-bill.html)
to try to block legislation, declared that a spending measure of such
proportions should not receive congressional approval without every
lawmaker having to record a position.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That threatened to upend a plan by House leaders to hold a voice vote on
the package, sparing most lawmakers a potentially dangerous trip back to
Washington as public health officials have advised people to shelter in
place and avoid large gatherings. Instead, the leaders in both parties
had to summon dozens of members back to the capital — piling into cars
or securing seats on near-empty red-eye flights — so that enough of them
would be present in the House chamber to block Mr. Massie’s
request.

Mr. Trump took to Twitter to
[berate](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243534441772974081?s=20)
the Kentucky Republican, calling him a “third rate Grandstander,” and
Mr. Kerry
[replied](https://twitter.com/JohnKerry/status/1243552337429438464?s=20)
that Mr. Massie “must be quarantined to prevent the spread of his
massive stupidity.” That drew an [appreciative
retweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243572588200280064?s=20)
from the president, who said he was “Very impressed” with the Democrat’s
sense of humor.

Mr. Massie’s own colleagues in both parties were even more scathing.
Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said on Twitter
that his colleague would have [blood on his
hands](https://twitter.com/RepPeteKing/status/1243595215828549635?s=20)
if lawmakers became infected.

Despite the [widespread disdain for Mr.
Massie](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/thomas-massie-coronavirus.html),
his late objection — like one [raised by Senate
Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/coronavirus-senate-deal.html)
in the hours before the measure unanimously passed that chamber on
Wednesday — pointed to some lingering ideological divides over the
government’s role in confronting a crisis. The political backlash that
followed the 2008 bailout of Wall Street and the enormous [stimulus
program](https://www.nytimes.com/article/where-is-my-stimulus-payment.html)
that followed in 2009 hung over the discussions, and members of Congress
are keenly aware that voters are closely watching their actions.

“They don’t want a recorded vote,” Mr. Massie told reporters of
congressional leaders. “They don’t want to be on record on making the
biggest mistake in history.”

In under four weeks, lawmakers have produced three substantial proposals
to confront the coronavirus, agreeing to emergency government help,
expansions of the social safety net and financial bailouts that would
have seemed unthinkable only a few weeks ago. Mr. Trump has signed all
of them.

Now that the largest of those is law, attention will turn to its effect
on a battered economy, where [3.3 million filed for unemployment last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html),
entire industries are in peril and many [experts
say](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/business/2-trillion-stimulus-coronavirus-bill.html)
a package of its size can provide a few months of ballast — if that —
before more help is needed. The administration now must scramble to find
ways of enforcing the vast new programs, including an array of benefits
for Americans and aid to nearly every industry — as well as strict
oversight measures to make sure bailed-out companies do not use the help
to enrich themselves at the expense of their workers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The law creates disclosure requirements, an inspector general and a
congressionally mandated board to monitor a $425 billion bailout fund to
be administered by the Federal Reserve. It also bars companies that
receive government infusions from doing stock buybacks for as long as
they are benefiting from federal aid, in addition to a year afterward.
Companies owned by Mr. Trump and members of his family are barred from
receiving any of the bailout money, although the president’s real estate
company [could potentially
benefit](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/virus-fineprint-stimulus-bill.html)
from other aspects of the stimulus law.

About two hours after Mr. Trump signed the legislation, however, the
White House issued a signing statement undermining a crucial safeguard
Democrats had demanded as a condition of agreeing to the corporate
bailout fund. The law empowers the inspector general to request
information from executive branch agencies and requires the official to
report any unreasonable refusal to Congress “without delay.” But Mr.
Trump suggested his constitutional powers permit him to decide what
information to share with lawmakers.

Democrats have vowed to push for a fourth round of government help that
would address priorities left uncovered by the bill signed on Friday,
including more benefits for workers and funds for hospitals, but it was
unclear whether Republicans would agree that additional aid was needed.

“The option that we have is to either let them suffer with nothing, or
to allow this greed and billions of dollars, which will be leveraged
into trillions of dollars, to contribute to the largest income
inequality gap in our future,” said Representative Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York. “There should be shame about what
was fought for in this bill, and the choices that we have to
make.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

But a sense of urgency in the face of a national crisis prevailed,
prompting most lawmakers to offer their support even as the coronavirus
continued to spread through Congress. Two more representatives announced
on Friday that they had tested positive for the virus — Joe Cunningham,
Democrat of South Carolina, and Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania —
bringing the total in the House to four. Senator Rand Paul, Republican
of Kentucky, reported on Sunday that he had the disease. Dozens more
lawmakers have quarantined themselves out of an abundance of caution.

“We have members on both sides of the aisle who have the virus,”
Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority
leader, told reporters on Thursday. “We have members who are
quarantined. We have members who have challenges with their flights
canceled. The floor will look different.”

Lawmakers who entered the chamber on Friday had to clean their hands
with sanitizer and enter through one door, before scrubbing again and
leaving through another, as if coming and going from an operating room.
Once inside the chamber, they kept their distance — leaving several
seats between one another — with a container of wipes for lawmakers to
use left in each row.

The hours of debate grew fiery at moments as lawmakers sought to
maintain a brisk pace of
statements.

Representative Haley Stevens, a freshman Democrat from Michigan who
drove through the night to reach the Capitol on Friday morning, wore
pink latex gloves in a nod to the risks faced by medical professionals.
Ms. Stevens, whose district has been rocked by both the spread of the
virus and the resulting economic slowdown, was repeatedly ruled out of
order after an emotional outburst in which she pleaded with colleagues
to “take this disease seriously.”

“I rise for every American who is scared right now\!” Ms. Stevens
shouted, as the presiding officer, Representative Anthony Brown,
Democrat of Maryland, banged his gavel in a futile attempt to silence
her. As other members shouted from the floor, she pressed on, delivering
an impassioned message to doctors and nurses: “You will see darkness\!
You will be pushed\! And our society needs you to stand together at this
time\!”

As she spoke in favor of the bill at the close of the debate, Ms. Pelosi
repeatedly prodded all members who were present to assemble, drawing out
her praise for the legislation to give lawmakers more time to filter
into the chamber. To maintain appropriate social distance, they began
filling the seats in the galleries typically reserved for the public,
which have been closed in recent days during the pandemic.

“The sooner you come, the shorter my remarks will be,” she said, later
interrupting herself to check on the number of lawmakers in the chamber,
calling: “Come on, my colleagues, to the gallery.”

Once debate concluded, Mr. Massie formally asked for a recorded vote,
declaring, “I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by
unanimous request in an empty chamber and request a recorded vote.”

But by that time, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. McCarthy and their top lieutenants had
worked together to ensure that at least 216 lawmakers — a quorum — would
be present to block the request. The bill cleared as lawmakers loudly
registered their assent. Mr. Massie and a handful of others shouted
“no\!” just before the gavel fell.

Then the chamber erupted into applause.
