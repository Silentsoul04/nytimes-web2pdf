Plague}\label{when-larry-kramer-aids-warrior-took-on-another-plague}}

As his onetime foe and current friend, Dr. Anthony Fauci, confronts the
coronavirus, the writer and activist watches history repeat itself.

In one of the last interviews before his death, Larry Kramer, the AIDS
activist who became that epidemic's wrathful prophet, said he was
writing a play for the age of Covid-19. It was, he said, a work he might
not live to finish.

``It's about gay people having to live through three plagues,'' he said
from his apartment in Greenwich Village. It was March 24, two days into
the governor's order to stay in place. Already Mr. Kramer was becoming
increasingly isolated.

Two months later, Mr. Kramer, who had cheated death several times in the
past,
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.nytimes.com\%2F2020\%2F05\%2F27\%2Fus\%2Flarry-kramer-dead.html}{died
on May 27}. His play, like his legacy, remained a work in progress. The
cause was pneumonia.

The three plagues are H.I.V./AIDS, Covid-19 and the decline of the human
body --- specifically, a broken leg that Mr. Kramer, 84, suffered last
April, when he fell in his apartment and lay on the floor until his home
attendant arrived hours later.

For Mr. Kramer, who had several brushes with death since receiving an
H.I.V. diagnosis in 1988, the days had haunting echoes of the AIDS
epidemic, which he felt never ended.

``The government has been awful in both cases,'' he said, his voice
softer than the old days but his anger undiminished. ``They were
terrible with AIDS and they're terrible with this thing. One wonders
what will become of us.''

As in the AIDS epidemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a fixture on the
nightly news. The two men had a complicated history. In the 1980s, Mr.
Kramer blamed Dr. Fauci for the federal government's slow response to
AIDS, calling him a murderer and an ``incompetent idiot.''

But the adversaries developed a grudging friendship, and Dr. Fauci
helped get Mr. Kramer into a lifesaving experimental drug trial after
Mr. Kramer had a liver transplant.

``We are friends again,'' Mr. Kramer said in an email. ``I'm feeling
sorry for how he's being treated. I emailed him this, but his one line
answer was, `Hunker down.'''

Also as with AIDS, people's casual encounters from the past have taken
on potentially lethal significance, and the news brought a steady drip
of death or diagnosis: the playwright Terrence McNally, whom Mr. Kramer
called a close friend and neighbor, dead at 81; the AIDS researcher Dr.
Michael Saag, diagnosed at 64 on his way home from organizing a medical
conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections, ill but not
critical.

``It's been so long that I have been losing friends that it becomes
surreal,'' Mr. Kramer said.

He did not find that his experience during the AIDS crisis gave him
perspective on the coronavirus pandemic, he said. Rather, the two eras
merged into each other.

``We certainly had our experience,'' he said of his generation of AIDS
activists. ``But I find it very hard to stay in touch with the outside
world, because of the hardships we are all having to go through. You can
read about everybody else's experiences on Facebook, but it gets
depressing after a while.''

He said he hoped the antiretroviral drugs that he and many friends were
taking for H.I.V. would bolster their immune systems against the
coronavirus. It was a slender hope.

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an
    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an
    all-or-nothing approach.

For Mr. Kramer, who was by then largely homebound, a challenge of the
pandemic was isolation. His husband, David Webster, whom he married in
2013 in the intensive care unit of NYU Langone Medical Center, was away
on a work project, wary of bringing potential exposure into the home.
Some of Mr. Kramer's home attendants, also, had to stop coming because
of exposure to the disease.

So he tried to lose himself in the new play, ``An Army of Lovers Must
Not Die,'' which he had to change almost daily as the news changed. ``I
wonder if it will ever be done now,'' he said of the play.

But Mr. Kramer, for all his doom-saying, repeatedly beat the odds,
surviving to finish his two-part epic novel, ``The American People,''
the second volume of which, at 880 pages, landed earlier this year.

``It's a great book to read when you're stuck for hours and hours,'' he
said.

Mr. Kramer was a maddening, titanic figure during the AIDS crisis, and
at moments seemed still to see himself in that thundering role.

``Show me a plague,'' he wrote in volume one of his epic, ``and I'll
show you the world!''

The current plague, he said, called for its own Larry Kramer to bring
the rage --- against disease, against governmental failure, against the
unfairness of death. It just would not be him. ``I wish I could be,'' he
said. ``I don't know how. I would like to have a big movement,'' he
added. ``But I'm not quite sure how to do that.''
