# Rhode Island Pulls Over New Yorkers to Keep the Virus at Bay

Police and National Guard troops are deployed to warn visitors they must
self-quarantine, as local resentment builds toward people fleeing

Police officers were watching Rhode Island’s highways, bridges and bus
stops. National Guard troops were trudging through resort towns with
clipboards, knocking on doors. They were all hunting for [fleeing New
Yorkers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/nyregion/coronavirus-second-homes-travel.html)
and their telltale Empire State license plates.

The states are increasingly finding themselves pitted against one
another, as they bid for scarce medical equipment, angle for federal aid
and [demand that nonresidents
self-quarantine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/coronavirus-united-states.html).

Few, though, have gone yet to the lengths Rhode Island has to try to
keep the potentially infected at bay, especially those from [New
York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/nyregion/coronavirus-second-homes-travel.html),
the biggest hot spot in the country.

Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, said on Friday that if New Yorkers
entering the state did not quarantine themselves for 14 days after
arrival, they would be fined and, if they continued to flout the order,
arrested.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“That’s a law — that’s an order,” Ms. Raimondo said. “It comes with
penalties. It’s not a suggestion.”

She sent troops and police officers to the main highways entering the
state, as well as to Amtrak stations and the main airport, to stop and
warn people coming from New York State about the quarantine order. And
on Saturday, she extended the order to cover travelers from any state.

She was not alone in establishing checkpoints to stop travelers from
places where the virus is widespread. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a
Republican, said on Saturday that his administration would try to set up
a checkpoint on Interstate 95 near the Georgia border to stop drivers
from the New York area and tell them they had to quarantine themselves
for two weeks.

President Trump said on Saturday that concerns raised by states like
Rhode Island and Florida about travelers from New York City had prompted
him to consider imposing a federal quarantine of New York, New Jersey
and part of Connecticut. He later backed off the idea.

Legal experts said that states were on shaky ground pulling people over
just for their license plates. And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Saturday
that Rhode Island’s action was “at the point of absurdity.”

“If they don’t roll back that policy, I’m going to sue Rhode Island,
because that clearly is unconstitutional,” Governor Cuomo said on CNN,
though he added that he didn’t think it would come to that. “We’ll work
it out amicably, I’m sure,” he said.

Even so, Rhode Island’s measures were welcomed by many “year-rounders”
who live in the state’s summer resort communities near the Connecticut
border. They have been growing increasingly frustrated with an influx of
New Yorkers fleeing the city to second homes and rental properties in
the area, and possibly bringing the virus with them.

Local residents have been posting videos and photographs in local
Facebook groups of cars with New York tags being pulled over.

John Austin witnessed a stop on Friday in Westerly, a town of about
23,000 in the corner of the state nearest to New York, when a trooper’s
flashing lights followed a driver into the parking lot of Sandy’s Fine
Food Emporium, where Mr. Austin is the store manager.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It is live, and it is happening,” Mr. Austin said. “It’s happening in
our backyard.”

He said that police officers were stationed all along Route 78 from the
state line at the Pawcatuck River to his store. “It’s not easy for any
one of us,” he said. “Let’s pray for a resolution
quick.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

When the police officers stop New Yorkers or [find them in their summer
homes](https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200327/not-rsquoall-that-neighborlyrsquo-police-national-guard-out-in-westerly-looking-for-new-yorkers),
they hand out copies of the governor’s [executive
order](http://www.governor.ri.gov/documents/orders/Executive-Order-20-12.pdf)
and collect contact information. Any who manage to avoid the officers
may face another penalty: public shaming.

“Leaving Walmart *filled* to the top,” one woman seethed in a posting to
a local Facebook group, alongside photos of a Volkswagen with New York
plates and a trunk loaded with paper towels. Another woman responded,
“They need to *go home*\!”

Nearly [half of the country’s more than 119,000 coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
have been confirmed in New York State, in part because of widespread
testing there. Rhode Island, the smallest state by area, had 239 cases
on Saturday evening, and had reported its [first two
deaths](https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200328/with-first-2-ri-coronavirus-deaths-raimondo-issues-stay-at-home-order-closes-non-essential-retail).

Texas, Maryland and South Carolina are among other states that have
ordered people arriving from New York to self-quarantine. In Texas, for
instance, [the Department of Public Safety
said](https://www.dps.texas.gov/director_staff/media_and_communications/pr/2020/0327a)
Friday that its agents would make surprise visits to see whether
travelers were adhering to the state’s mandate, and they warned that
violators could be fined $1,000 and jailed for up to 180 days.

The orders have not come without controversy: Steven Brown, the
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode
Island, said outright that the police stops in that state were
unconstitutional.

“Under the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate
simply does not, and cannot, constitute ‘probable cause’ to allow police
to stop a car and interrogate the driver, no matter how laudable the
goal of the stop may be,” Mr. Brown said in a statement.

Lawrence O. Gostin, the chair of global health law at Georgetown
University, agreed that the directive appeared “too arbitrary and
capricious” to be upheld by a judge. License plates were far from
foolproof indicators of whether someone had been exposed to the virus,
he noted.

The legal principle barring states from treating residents of other
states differently from its own citizens is one of the oldest in the
country, rooted in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the
Constitution. That clause forbids discrimination based on state
residence in most cases, underpinning the right of unfettered interstate
travel.

Neil MacFarquhar, Patricia Mazzei and Alan Blinder contributed
