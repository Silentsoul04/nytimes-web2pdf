Bay}\label{rhode-island-pulls-over-new-yorkers-to-keep-the-virus-at-bay}}

Police and National Guard troops are deployed to warn visitors they must
self-quarantine, as local resentment builds toward people fleeing
coronavirus hot spots.

Police officers were watching Rhode Island's highways, bridges and bus
stops. National Guard troops were trudging through resort towns with
clipboards, knocking on doors. They were all hunting for
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/nyregion/coronavirus-second-homes-travel.html}{fleeing
New Yorkers} and their telltale Empire State license plates.

The states are increasingly finding themselves pitted against one
another, as they bid for scarce medical equipment, angle for federal aid
and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/coronavirus-united-states.html}{demand
that nonresidents self-quarantine}.

Few, though, have gone yet to the lengths Rhode Island has to try to
keep the potentially infected at bay, especially those from
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/nyregion/coronavirus-second-homes-travel.html}{New
York}, the biggest hot spot in the country.

Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, said on Friday that if New Yorkers
entering the state did not quarantine themselves for 14 days after
arrival, they would be fined and, if they continued to flout the order,
arrested.

``That's a law ---~that's an order,'' Ms. Raimondo said. ``It comes with
penalties. It's not a suggestion.''

She sent troops and police officers to the main highways entering the
state, as well as to Amtrak stations and the main airport, to stop and
warn people coming from New York State about the quarantine order. And
on Saturday, she extended the order to cover travelers from any state.

She was not alone in establishing checkpoints to stop travelers from
places where the virus is widespread. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a
Republican, said on Saturday that his administration would try to set up
a checkpoint on Interstate 95 near the Georgia border to stop drivers
from the New York area and tell them they had to quarantine themselves
for two weeks.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/28/us/28virus-rhodeisland-2/merlin_171071865_2e78ad42-459e-4d7a-b863-409cc40234bf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

``It's not fair to the people of Florida'' that outsiders keep coming
in, Governor DeSantis said. ``It would make it a lot easier if we didn't
have folks coming in from hot zones where they may be very well carrying
the virus.''

On Friday, Mr. DeSantis extended his quarantine order to cover travelers
from Louisiana as well, and authorized highway checkpoints in the
Panhandle to intercept and warn them.

President Trump said on Saturday that concerns raised by states like
Rhode Island and Florida about travelers from New York City had prompted
him to consider imposing a federal quarantine of New York, New Jersey
and part of Connecticut. He later backed off the idea.

Legal experts said that states were on shaky ground pulling people over
just for their license plates. And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Saturday
that Rhode Island's action was ``at the point of absurdity.''

``If they don't roll back that policy, I'm going to sue Rhode Island,
because that clearly is unconstitutional,'' Governor Cuomo said on CNN,
though he added that he didn't think it would come to that. ``We'll work
it out amicably, I'm sure,'' he said.

Even so, Rhode Island's measures were welcomed by many ``year-rounders''
who live in the state's summer resort communities near the Connecticut
border. They have been growing increasingly frustrated with an influx of
New Yorkers fleeing the city to second homes and rental properties in
the area, and possibly bringing the virus with them.

Local residents have been posting videos and photographs in local
Facebook groups of cars with New York tags being pulled over.

John Austin witnessed a stop on Friday in Westerly, a town of about
23,000 in the corner of the state nearest to New York, when a trooper's
flashing lights followed a driver into the parking lot of Sandy's Fine
Food Emporium, where Mr. Austin is the store manager.

``It is live, and it is happening,'' Mr. Austin said. ``It's happening
in our backyard.''

He said that police officers were stationed all along Route 78 from the
state line at the Pawcatuck River~to his store. ``It's not easy for any
one of us,'' he said. ``Let's pray for a resolution quick.''

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

When the police officers stop New Yorkers or
\href{https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200327/not-rsquoall-that-neighborlyrsquo-police-national-guard-out-in-westerly-looking-for-new-yorkers}{find
them in their summer homes}, they hand out copies of the governor's
\href{http://www.governor.ri.gov/documents/orders/Executive-Order-20-12.pdf}{executive
order} and collect contact information. Any who manage to avoid the
officers may face another penalty: public shaming.

``Leaving Walmart \emph{filled} to the top,'' one woman seethed in a
posting to a local Facebook group, alongside photos of a Volkswagen with
New York plates and a trunk loaded with paper towels. Another woman
responded, ``They need to \emph{go home}!''

Nearly
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{half
of the country's more than 119,000 coronavirus cases} have been
confirmed in New York State, in part because of widespread testing
there. Rhode Island, the smallest state by area, had 239 cases on
Saturday evening, and had reported its
\href{https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200328/with-first-2-ri-coronavirus-deaths-raimondo-issues-stay-at-home-order-closes-non-essential-retail}{first
two deaths}.

Texas, Maryland and South Carolina are among other states that have
ordered people arriving from New York to self-quarantine. In Texas, for
instance,
\href{https://www.dps.texas.gov/director_staff/media_and_communications/pr/2020/0327a}{the
Department of Public Safety said} Friday that its agents would make
surprise visits to see whether travelers were adhering to the state's
mandate, and they warned that violators could be fined \$1,000 and
jailed for up to 180 days.

The orders have not come without controversy: Steven Brown, the
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode
Island, said outright that the police stops in that state were
unconstitutional.

``Under the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate
simply does not, and cannot, constitute `probable cause' to allow police
to stop a car and interrogate the driver, no matter how laudable the
goal of the stop may be,'' Mr. Brown said in a statement.

Lawrence O. Gostin, the chair of global health law at Georgetown
University, agreed that the directive appeared ``too arbitrary and
capricious'' to be upheld by a judge. License plates were far from
foolproof indicators of whether someone had been exposed to the virus,
he noted.

The legal principle barring states from treating residents of other
states differently from its own citizens is one of the oldest in the
country, rooted in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the
Constitution. That clause forbids discrimination based on state
residence in most cases, underpinning the right of unfettered interstate
travel.

Neil MacFarquhar, Patricia Mazzei and Alan Blinder contributed
