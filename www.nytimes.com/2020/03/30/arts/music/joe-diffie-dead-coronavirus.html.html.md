*This obituary is part of a series about* [*people who have died in the
coronavirus
pandemic*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Joe Diffie, who went from working in oil fields and foundries to
becoming one of the most commercially successful country singers of the
early and mid-1990s, died on Sunday in Nashville. He was 61.

His death, from complications of the coronavirus, was announced by his
publicist, Scott Adkins. Mr. Diffie had revealed on Friday that he was
being treated for the condition.

At the dawn of the 1990s, country music was embarking upon a great,
rollicking party period, and Mr. Diffie, with a touch of aw-shucks
wryness to his performances and a robust head of blond hair that shot
back from his head like wispy flames, was suited to the moment.

As a singer, he had a crisp, sentimental voice, which he deployed on
ballads like “Is It Cold in Here” and “Home,” his debut single from
1990; it topped the Billboard country chart, the first of his five No. 1
country singles. He placed a dozen more songs in the country Top 10.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But he was also given to a playful, plucky rowdiness, and that animated
his biggest hits. His third and fourth albums, which leaned heavily in
this direction — “Honky Tonk Attitude” (1993) and “Third Rock from the
Sun” (1994) — both went platinum. Two of his other albums went gold.

“Pickup Man,” from 1994, was his most successful song, topping the
Billboard country chart for four weeks. It was also the song that best
took advantage of his various talents: On the one hand, it was a gently
funny song about sexual attraction, but, on the other, it was also an
emphatically boisterous statement of pride about boys and the trucks
that boost their egos.

When he sang “Pickup Man,” he alternated between plain and direct
singing, humorously dipping and bending his syllables for emphasis.

“You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill/and I still
wouldn’t trade it for a Coupe de Ville,” he sang, adding, “I met all
my wives in traffic jams/There’s just something women like about a
pickup man.”

The title track from “Third Rock From the Sun,” which went to No. 1, was
a lighthearted catalog of rural misadventure. His 1995 Christmas album
included a honky-tonk anthem, “Leroy the Redneck Reindeer.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On “Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox (If I Die)” — the song’s video had a
strong dose of “Weekend at Bernie’s”-like high jinks — Mr. Diffie
regarded death with an arched eyebrow and a shrug: “Just let my
headstone be a neon sign/Just let it burn in memory of all of my good
times.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Joe Logan Diffie was born on Dec. 28, 1958, in Tulsa, Okla., to Joe and
Flora Diffie. His father held various jobs and later drove a tour bus
for the country superstar Toby Keith; his mother was a schoolteacher and
owned a flower shop. His family moved frequently before settling back in
Oklahoma, where Mr. Diffie attended high school and college. As a child,
he played with his aunt’s country band, and later as part of rock,
gospel and bluegrass outfits.

He began writing songs in the 1980s, and one of them, “Love on the
Rocks,” was recorded by Hank Thompson. Soon, Mr. Diffie moved to
Nashville, where he spent a few years writing songs and singing demos.
After singing background on a Holly Dunn recording of one of his songs,
he signed with Epic Records in 1990, and before long had his first No. 1
country hit.

Even in his performing era, Mr. Diffie continued writing songs,
including ones recorded by Tim McGraw (“Memory Lane”) and Jo Dee Messina
(“My Give a Damn’s Busted”). In 1998, Mr. Diffie won a Grammy for best
country collaboration, with vocals for “Same Old Train,” a multistar
collaboration.

He released albums throughout the 2000s and 2010s, and last year began
hosting a radio show on KXBL, a country station in his native Tulsa.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Diffie is survived by his wife, Tara Terpening Diffie; his mother;
two sisters, Meg Prestidge and Monica Stiles; four sons, Parker Diffie,
Travis Humes, Drew Diffie and Tyler Diffie; three daughters, Kara
Diffie, Kylie Diffie and Reaux Terpening; and four grandchildren. Mr.
Diffie’s first three marriages ended in divorce.

The brand of power country that he found much success with has lately
been experiencing a re-embrace. Last year, Mr. Diffie, along with Trace
Adkins, appeared on “Redneck Tendencies,” a song by the young country
singer Hardy, and in 2013 he recorded a duet with the Canadian country
star Gord Bamford on “Country Junkie,” singing, “I don’t think they’ve
got rehab for being a good ol’ boy.”

But the clearest mark of Mr. Diffie’s legacy came in 2013, when the
country superstar Jason Aldean released a single called “1994,” which
emphatically invokes Mr. Diffie’s work and influence, name-checking
several Diffie songs in the lyrics.

In the video, one of the dancers wears a T-shirt that reads, “Teach Me
How to Diffie,” a play on the “Teach Me How to Dougie” dance craze and a
nod to how Mr. Diffie would awkwardly shimmy a bit onstage.

Throughout the video, there are clips of almost all the country stars of
the 2010s — Luke Bryan, Little Big Town, Lady Antebellum, Dierks
Bentley, Florida Georgia Line and more — singing to the camera, “Joe,
Joe, Joe Diffie\!”

That refrain became the title of Mr. Diffie’s final album, released in
2019.
