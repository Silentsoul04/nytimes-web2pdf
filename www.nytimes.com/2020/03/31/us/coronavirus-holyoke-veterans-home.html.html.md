# Coronavirus Spreads in Veterans’ Home, Leaving ‘Shuddering Loss for Us All’

The mayor of Holyoke in Massachusetts confronted the superintendent of
the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home after hearing rumors that infections were
spreading.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

NEWTON, Mass. — The mayor of Holyoke, Mass., got an unsigned letter over
the weekend that deeply disturbed him.

“Are you aware of the horrific circumstances at the Soldiers’ Home?” the
letter read, and went on to describe serious breaches, like a resident
suspected of having the coronavirus, awaiting the results of a test,
being sent back to a dementia ward with 20 other veterans.

“Where is the state in addressing what is truly happening in this
building?” the letter concluded.

The mayor, Alex Morse, reached out to Bennett Walsh, the superintendent
of the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home, a 247-bed, state-managed [nursing
home](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-nursing-homes-racial-disparity.html)
for veterans, to figure out what was going on.

But by then, Mr. Morse said, the damage was far more than he had
imagined: In a matter of five days, eight veterans had died, apparently
without being reported to either state or local officials. Others were
sick with the coronavirus; staff members were too.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Walsh’s explanations left the mayor “incredibly disappointed,” and
so did a conversation with Mr. Walsh’s superior, Francisco Urena,
Massachusetts’ Secretary of Veterans’
Services.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Frustrated and “with
a sense of disappointment at the lack of
urgency,”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Mr. Morse contacted
Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito.

By Monday, state officials had announced a series of major moves.

Mr. Walsh was placed on administrative leave. A new command structure
was put in place. The National Guard was brought in to speed up testing
of staff and patients.

And that, Mr. Morse said, is increasingly the role of local government
in the coronavirus crisis: To keep watch.

“Mayors should make themselves available, should be vigilant in getting
as much information as possible,” he said. “Mayors have to know what’s
going on within their community. I don’t have oversight over the
facility, but it’s still my city.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By Tuesday, 10 residents and seven staff members had tested positive for
the coronavirus, with 25 more awaiting test results. Among 13 recent
deaths, tests had come back positive for the virus in six cases, while
five were still pending, another was inconclusive, and another came back
negative.

Flags in Holyoke, a city of 40,000 around 90 miles west of Boston, were
lowered to half-staff on Tuesday in honor of the veterans who died.

“These are people who gave their all, who risked their lives to protect
all of us, and they deserved better, frankly,” Mr. Morse said.

State Representative Aaron Vega, whose district includes Holyoke, said
he was still trying to understand how the virus could have moved so
swiftly through the home’s population without word getting out to local
officials.

“All of us in Western Mass support that home, and nobody knew anything,”
he said. “The fact that nobody knew anything until it was in the news is
trouble.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gov. Charlie Baker, in a news conference, said he had not learned of the
deaths until Sunday night, when he spoke with Mr. Morse.

“In the short term, our primary focus is going to be on stabilizing and
supporting the health and safety of the residents and their families,”
he said. “And we will get to the bottom of what happened and when — and
by
who.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Messages for Mr. Walsh were not immediately answered, and no one
representing the Soldiers’ Home could be immediately reached for
comment.

Brooke Karanovich, a spokeswoman from the state’s Executive Office of
Health and Human Services, said the state “took immediate action” as
soon as it learned the extent of the coronavirus outbreak.

Most of those who have died were not identified.

But one of the dead was Theodore A. Monette, 74, a former senior
official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who helped
coordinate the emergency response in Lower Manhattan after the World
Trade Center attacks, and in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.

A retired U.S. Army colonel who had served in the Vietnam War and
Persian Gulf war, Mr. Monette had moved into the facility two months ago
after the death of his wife, who had been his caretaker.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They told me he was probably the highest-ranked guy there,” but so
self-deprecating that he would rarely tell anybody his rank, said his
daughter, Aimee Monette.

She recalled that one of her father’s physical therapists once Googled
him and returned to her afterward in wide-eyed amazement.

Ms. Monette said she had initially learned from a community message
board on Facebook that some veterans at the Soldiers’ Home had
contracted the virus.

An anxious nurse called her last week, she said, to report that her
father’s oxygen levels had dropped. Ms. Monette said they should
transfer him to a hospital.

“They’re all dealing with something completely new, and everyone’s
scared,” she said. “I don’t want to place blame, but the protocol should
have happened faster.” Mr. Monette died on Monday, and no memorial is
yet scheduled, she said.

“He deserves the full-on Army taps and the flag and everything,” she
said. “But we have to wait.”
