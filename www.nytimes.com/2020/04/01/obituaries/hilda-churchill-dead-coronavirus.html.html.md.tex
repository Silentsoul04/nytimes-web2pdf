The Spanish flu struck her entire family and killed her baby sister a
century ago. She died of the coronavirus.

Hilda Churchill survived the Great War, the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic
that claimed her baby sister, and World War II, but eight days before
her 109th birthday she became Britain's oldest recorded victim of the
coronavirus.

Mrs. Churchill died on Saturday at a nursing home near Salford in
Greater Manchester, her grandson Will Hadcroft said.

Mrs. Churchill, a retired seamstress, never smoked or drank much. She
had recently been in protective isolation for several days but began
showing symptoms of the virus four days before she died. She tested
positive for the virus only the night before.

She was born in 1911 in Crewe, south of Manchester, where seven years
later the flu struck every member of her family except her and her
mother. Her father collapsed in the street. Her year-old sister, Beryl
May, died.

``She remembered standing at her bedroom window and seeing this little
coffin carrying her baby sister being put into a carriage and being
taken away,'' another grandson, Anthony Churchill, told
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/29/spanish-flu-survivor-dies-from-coronavirus-aged-108}{The
Guardian}.

He quoted her as saying that the latest pandemic was similar except that
in 1918 ``there were no planes, and somehow it still managed to spread
everywhere.''

With her husband, who was seeking work during the Depression, she moved
to Little Hulton, near Manchester, where he became head tailor at the
Burton men's wear store. He died in 1992.

The mother of four, grandmother of 11, great-grandmother of 12 and
great-great-grandmother of three, Mrs. Churchill was famous among her
family and friends as a cook, especially for her mince pies, scones and
gravy.

Until 10 months ago, when she moved into the Kenyon Lodge Care Home in
Little Hulton, she lived alone in her home nearby.
