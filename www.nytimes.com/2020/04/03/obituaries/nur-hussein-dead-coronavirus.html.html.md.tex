the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Nur Hassan Hussein, who led Somalia as its prime minister during a
crucial transitional period beset by insurgency and humanitarian crises,
died on Wednesday in London. He was 82.

His death came after he had contracted the coronavirus, his family said.
Mr. Hussein, popularly known as Nur Adde, had been treated at King's
College Hospital for over two weeks.

He was born in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, on Feb. 2, 1938, and
studied law in both Somalia and Italy. He spent decades in various
government jobs, including serving as a law enforcement official under
the Somali dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.

Mr. Hussein became the country's attorney general in 1987, four years
before a decades-long civil war began. He later ran the Somali Red
Crescent Society.

He became prime minister in November 2007 as tens of thousands of
Somalis were fleeing their homes amid fighting between Islamist
insurgents and Western-backed Somali and Ethiopian forces.

As that humanitarian crisis
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/20/world/africa/20iht-somalia.1.8401525.html}{unfolded},
Mr. Hussein was recognized for overseeing negotiations with the
insurgents, leading to the signing of a peace agreement in mid-2008 and
the formation of a unity government several months later.

He remained as prime minister until February 2009, replaced by the new
president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed. That June, Mr. Hussein was
appointed Somalia's ambassador to Italy.

He is survived by his wife and seven children, who live in the United
States, the United Kingdom and Somalia.

Adam Aw Hirsi, a former official who worked under Mr. Hussein,
\href{https://twitter.com/JustAwHirsi/status/1245262641016320000}{described
him on Twitter} as a ``most laid-back yet most decisive'' leader.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed of Somalia
\href{https://twitter.com/M_Farmaajo/status/1245353526496301057}{declared}
a three-day mourning period and ordered flags to be flown at half- staff
to give Mr. Hussein, he said, ``the national recognition he deserves.''
