\emph{This obituary is part of a series about}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

Just a few weeks ago, Mary Roman was using a local batting cage, as
usual, to practice the shot put, one of the many field events at which
the 84-year-old senior Olympian excelled.

Her late-in-life athletic success was so great --- she once ranked
eighth in the world in the weight throw for her age group --- that
everyone seemed to know her in Fairfield County, Conn.

Another source of good will came from being a fixture in local politics,
a Republican who was so beloved by the former Democratic mayor of
Norwalk, Alex Knopp, that he kept her on as city clerk when he was
elected in 2001.

Mrs. Roman died on Monday at Norwalk Hospital of complications of the
coronavirus, her son Craig said.

Mary Barboza was born on Sept. 9, 1935, in Pittsfield, Mass., the oldest
of three children. Her mother, who was Native American, worked as a
nurse and her father, of Portuguese background, helped dig Massachusetts
train tunnels.

She contracted polio as a child and took up English-style horseback
riding as a way to strengthen her legs. Her athleticism later extended
to skiing, basketball and softball. She graduated from Springfield
College, where she met her husband, Granville Roman, whom she married in
1953. (Mr. Roman descended into a train tunnel to ask her father for his
hand.)

She raised five boys and managed a career that went from bank teller to
bank executive and then later to Norwalk city clerk in 1999, a job she
served in for 20 years.

Her husband was active in the senior Olympics; after his death in 1999
she began to train for events herself and quickly excelled. She once
ranked first in the nation in both the superweight and ultraweight shot
put, and second in the throws pentathlon, eventually earning more than
300 medals.

Along with Craig Roman, she is survived by three of her five sons, eight
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

``A few weeks ago I noticed that she was slowing down,'' said her son
Kenneth, ``and I realized there is something wrong here and so I called
E.M.S. Days later she was gone.''
