93}\label{leuxefla-menchari-who-turned-store-windows-into-art-dies-at-93}}

A longtime Hermès window dresser, she created fantastical worlds that
held the gaze of passers-by. She died of the novel coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

For more than a half-century Leïla Menchari transformed the windows of
the Hermès flagship store in Paris into exotic worlds that allowed any
passer-by, even for just a minute, free access to the fantasies of a
luxury brand.

She built enormous winged feet and spinning meteorites and embedded a
sparkling Pegasus within a jeweled geode. She brought in artists to lend
their visions to the displays. In the process she elevated the store
window into an art form unto itself.

Her windows at 42 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, the store's address,
became so famous that the Grand Palais in Paris in 2017 held
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/style/hermes-windows-grand-palais-leila-menchari.html}{an
exhibit} devoted to her work, ``Hermès Takes Flight: The Worlds of Leïla
Menchari.''

``Hermès wouldn't be Hermès without Leïla,'' Axel Dumas, the chief
executive of the luxury house, said at the opening of the exhibit.

The filmmaker Josée Dayan made a documentary about her, and the French
novelist Michel Tournier christened her ``The Queen of Enchantment.''

Ms. Menchari died in Paris on Saturday She was 93. The cause was the
novel coronavirus, her friend Carla Sozzani said.

``She taught us to look at the world through the prism of color,''
Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the artistic director of Hermès and a cousin of
Axel, said. ``She was a storyteller without equal.''

Ms. Menchari was born in September 1927 in Tunis to a family of wealthy
landowners; her father was a lawyer, and her mother a court clerk and
women's rights activist. Ms. Menchari was the first woman admitted to
the Beaux-Arts institute in Tunis. She also studied at the Beaux-Arts
school in Paris, where she created theater sets that became a template
for her windows.

She briefly modeled for the designer Guy Laroche before joining the
decoration team at Hermès in 1961. She was appointed director of window
displays and, in 1978, of the silk colors committee, which determines
the palette for each season of the brand's scarves.

She was also instrumental in bringing such Tunisian fashion talents as
the designer Azzedine Alaïa to France.

She retired in 2013.

``When designing a scene, there must always be some mystery, because
mystery is a springboard to dreams,'' Ms. Menchari told Vogue Arabia in
\href{https://en.vogue.me/culture/remembering-hermes-leila-menchari/}{an
interview} in 2017. ``Mystery is an invitation to fill in the gaps left
by the imagination.''
