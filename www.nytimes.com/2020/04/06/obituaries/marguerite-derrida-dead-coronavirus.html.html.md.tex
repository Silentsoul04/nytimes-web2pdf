Marguerite Derrida, a prominent French psychoanalyst and translator of
important works in her field, died on March 21 in Paris. She was 87.

Ms. Derrida's son Pierre Alferi said the cause was the coronavirus.

Ms. Derrida, who was the wife of the French philosopher
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/magazine/jacques-derrida.html?searchResultPosition=1}{Jacques
Derrida}, trained at the Psychoanalytic Society of Paris and worked as a
clinician, but she was also known for translations into French,
including that of books by
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1960/09/23/archives/melanie-klein-is-dead-at-78-child-psychologist-in-britain-special.html?searchResultPosition=2}{Melanie
Klein}, the Austrian-British psychoanalyst who specialized in children.

The \href{http://psychanalyse.ihep.fr/}{Institute of Advanced Studies in
Psychoanalysis}, which is based near Paris and publishes essays and
organizes seminars in the field, said last month in its
\href{https://mailchi.mp/c133515b4808/la-lettre-de-lihep-21-mars-2020?fbclid=IwAR2pFA1Xe7iBcx2Os8u7HT5rAp5OK5QyiYLnhqSmCWCc1Ou8UPUOgnywrH8}{newsletter}
that with Ms. Derrida's death, ``a whole world is leaving.''

Marguerite Aucouturier was born on July 7, 1932, in Prague, the daughter
of Gustave Aucouturier, a French journalist who worked in Moscow and
Belgrade, and Marie Alferi, who was Czech.

Her father and her brother were enthusiasts and translators of Russian
literature. Ms. Derrida herself studied Russian in her youth, and some
of the works she later translated were by Russian authors like Vladimir
Propp, a scholar who studied the structure of Russian folk tales.

She met Mr. Derrida in 1953 through her brother, who at the time was
studying with him at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. The couple
married in 1957 in Cambridge, Mass., where Mr. Derrida was studying at
Harvard University.

They moved to the Paris suburb of Ris-Orangis in the late 1960s, when
Mr. Derrida started finding success as the author of books on
philosophy. He would go on to become the father of
\href{https://www.britannica.com/topic/deconstruction}{deconstruction},
a theory about the contradictions and confusions of textual language and
a method of inquiry that gained a wide international following in the
1970s and '80s.

Mr. Derrida
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/jacques-derrida-abstruse-theorist-dies-at-74.html}{died
in 2004}. Along with Mr. Alferi, a novelist and poet, Ms. Derrida is
survived by another son, Jean Derrida, an anthropologist and
philosopher.
