Anne Tyler knows what she's doing. She knows noisy, complaining, blaming
and manipulative siblings inside and out (and their offspring and all
those other people who get dragged in: babysitters, neighbors,
step-aunts), the chaotic reunions and holidays, marked by hilarious and
painful awkwardness, dotted with moments of grace, often offered by a
particularly graceless person.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/books/anne-tyler-clock-dance.html}{Anne
Tyler} knows the worn-out or angry or unappreciated mothers (and
hard-working older sisters and even the men who find themselves needing
to step up to that job), the marriages of miscommunication and dwindling
returns, the deeply unsatisfactory (and occasionally blessed) pasts and
presents of her own now-mythic

which is nothing like

and
\href{https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/reviews/980419.19shieldt.html}{planet}.
And Anne Tyler knows that memory is a powerhouse, a compass and also a
liar.

Micah Mortimer, a protagonist, not a hero, is familiar to readers of
Anne Tyler. He's reasonably fit, knows how to cook a few things, washes
up after dinner and is cautious and steady, and awfully pleased with his
own caution and steadiness (he even calls upon the traffic gods to
admire his skillful parking and good manners on the highway). Tyler's
protagonists are not the most exciting guys. They atone, they avoid.
They worry, they fear. They set themselves uninspiringly small tasks and
often fail. From ``The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/08/books/the-accidental-tourist.html}{Accidental
Tourist}'' to
``\href{https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/specials/tyler-saint.html}{Saint
Maybe}'' to
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/review/Harrison-t.html}{Noah's
Compass},'' they are passive, worried (or trying very hard not to
worry), cloistered, neither witty nor fun but not without humor. They,
like Micah, are clueless until something comes along (sometimes tragedy
but in Micah's case, not quite) to wake them, shake them and transform
them just enough to bring about a wry (not always happy) and fulfilling
ending.

by the Side of the Road.''}}\emph{{]}}

Micah is cocooned inside routine. When you meet his disorganized family,
you know why: a front hall with piles of sneakers atop pruning shears
and nail polish bottles, ``noisy, unkempt merry people wearing wild
colors, dogs barking, baby crying, TV blaring, bowls of chips and dips
already savaged.'' No one does the charms and horrors of family
gatherings better than Tyler. Micah also has a lovely girlfriend, a
sensible, kindhearted schoolteacher, Cass, and what she finds attractive
in Micah is not apparent to this reader. And even so, Tyler is too good
at what she does to let me dismiss Micah the way I want to. His barely
understood grief when he has caused Cass to break up with him, his
making a mess of his relationship with a young man who hopes Micah is
his long-lost father is visceral and moving.

``You have to wonder what goes through the mind of such a man. Such a
narrow and limited man; so closed off. He has nothing to look forward
to, nothing to daydream about. He wakes on a Monday morning and the
light through the slit-eyed window is a bleak, hopeless gray and the
news on the clock radio is all unspeakably sad ... immigrant children
torn from their parents will never ever be the same, even if by some
unlikely chance they are reunited tomorrow. Micah hears all this dully.
It doesn't surprise him.'' Even when he moves into a predictable snit
and when I have despaired of his willful blindness and self-deception,
Tyler draws us to Micah --- to the narrow shaft of light by which he
begins to see his own role in losing love.

Tyler has every gift a great novelist needs: intent observation, empathy
and language both direct and surprising. She has unembarrassed goodness
as well. In this time of snark, preening, sub-tweeting and the showy
torment of characters, we could use more Tyler.
