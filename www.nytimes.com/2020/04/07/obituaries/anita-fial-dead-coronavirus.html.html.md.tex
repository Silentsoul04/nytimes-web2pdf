87}\label{anita-fial-who-carried-the-banner-of-exotic-food-dies-at-87}}

Ms. Fial worked to burnish the reputation of mangoes, avocados, radishes
and celery, among other produce.

Brooklyn isn't famous for exotic fruits and vegetables, but it produced
Anita Fial who, as a home economist and marketing expert, helped make
Florida sweet corn, Mexican mangoes and avocados staples at green
grocers. She even helped revive the demand for radishes and celery.

``She normalized what might once have been considered exotic,'' Produce
News, an industry journal, wrote when Ms. Fial retired in 2011 as the
president of Lewis \& Neale, a public relations firm that represented
food growers and manufacturers.

Ms. Fial died in Manhattan on Thursday, her son, Jonathan, said. She was
87. The cause was complications of the coronavirus, he said.

She is also survived by her daughter, Alison Fial; her sister, Lynne
Winters; six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

Bernice Anita Janet Zicht was born on Nov. 17, 1932, in Brooklyn to
Rhoda Bachmuth (Duss) Zicht, a bookkeeper, and Harry Zicht, a radio
repairman. She married Allen Fial, who died in 1999.

After graduating from James Madison High School, she overcame her
father's resistance to the idea that women should attend college and
earned a bachelor of science degree in home economics from Cornell
University in 1954.

She joined Lewis \& Neale that year as a test kitchen assistant. The
firm over the course of her career there would come to represent the
Florida Tomato Committee, the Florida Fresh Corn Association, the
American Mushroom Council, the Dairy Council and the American Spice
Trade Association, among other groups.
