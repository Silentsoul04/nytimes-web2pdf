# Bernie Sanders Drops Out of 2020 Democratic Race for President

Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist making his second run for the White
House, withdrew after a series of losses to Joseph R. Biden Jr., who
emerges as the presumptive nominee for the general election.

Senator [Bernie
Sander](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-democrats.html)s
of Vermont ended his presidential candidacy on Wednesday, concluding a
quest that elevated him as a standard-bearer of American liberalism and
clearing the way for a general election between the presumptive
Democratic nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and President Trump at a time
of national crisis.

In a live-streamed speech, Mr. Sanders, eloquent but without his
characteristic spark, cast his decision in the broader context of the
fight against the coronavirus. “I cannot in good conscience continue to
mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the
important work required of all of us in this difficult hour,” Mr.
Sanders said, adding, “While this campaign is coming to an end, our
movement is not.”

If Mr. Biden, the former vice president, can now lay claim to the
Democratic nomination, he still faces considerable challenges in uniting
the party and mobilizing a broad base of voters for the November
election. Unlike Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden inspired little enthusiasm among
young voters, nor did he develop signature policy proposals. He
triumphed because many voters rejected Mr. Sanders’s policy agenda as
too far to the left and prohibitively expansive, and were convinced that
Mr. Biden had the best chance to beat Mr. Trump in November.

To motivate liberal Democrats who find him frustratingly conventional,
Mr. Biden, 77, will most likely need to do far more to articulate an
agenda on foundational Democratic issues like health care and climate
change.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Those issues are central to Mr. Sanders’s candidacy, and in recent days,
as Mr. Sanders began to consider dropping out more seriously, his aides
intensified talks to find common ground with the Biden campaign. Mr.
Sanders ultimately became satisfied that there was movement in
directions that he wanted, a top aide said. The Biden campaign is
expected to roll out a series of policy agreements with Mr. Sanders ****
on health care and other issues — potentially including student loans —
starting on Thursday, according to three people with direct knowledge of
their plans.

The two camps were still negotiating the details on Wednesday, and while
Mr. Biden is not expected to embrace Mr. Sanders’s full-throated call
for “Medicare for all,” for example, they are striving to arrive at
positions with which they are both comfortable.

Shortly after Mr. Sanders spoke on Wednesday, Mr. Biden issued a
statement thanking his opponent while acknowledging the need to draw Mr.
Sanders’s loyal base into his coalition. “I’ll be reaching out to you,’’
Mr. Biden wrote. “You will be heard by me.”

“And to your supporters," he added, “I make the same commitment: I see
you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to
get done in this country.”

Though Mr. Sanders made it clear on Wednesday that he viewed Mr. Biden
as the party’s 2020 nominee, he said he would remain on the ballot in
states that still have primaries to try to gather delegates — a move
that could give him leverage to influence the Democratic platform and
continue carrying his message.

Mr. Sanders’s departure from the race is a striking turnaround for a
candidate who less than two months ago was the clear front-runner, after
finishing in a virtual tie for first in
[Iowa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/who-won-iowa-caucuses.html)

But in a race reshaped, and eclipsed, by the escalating coronavirus
crisis, Mr. Sanders faced no realistic path to the nomination after a
series of lopsided losses to Mr. Biden, beginning in [South
Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/us/politics/joe-biden-south-carolina-primary.html)
in late February and culminating with victories by Mr. Biden in crucial
states like

and
[Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/biden-florida-illinois-primary.html)

month.

Persistent and unyielding in pushing his agenda, Mr. Sanders is loath to
admit defeat; his withdrawal represents a tacit concession that without
a chance of overtaking Mr. Biden, he would have more leverage to advance
his priorities if he ceded the race and joined forces with his rival.

His exit is also a sharp contrast to his bid in 2016, when he stayed in
an increasingly acrimonious race against Hillary Clinton even after it
became clear she would be the nominee. Talks between the Biden and
Sanders camps this time around were eased by the cordial relationship
between the two principals. Mr. Sanders has told people close to him
that he appreciated the fact that Mr. Biden did not overtly pressure him
to quit after Super Tuesday.

Mr. Sanders also talked to former President Barack Obama at least twice
in the last month, a person familiar with the discussions said, with Mr.
Obama praising the Vermont senator’s campaign and emphasizing the need
to unite against Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama, who has told friends he hopes to
ease the integration of Sanders voters into the party, made no effort to
pressure him to leave.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As Mr. Sanders pursued the White House for a second time, he promised
that he could transform the electorate, bringing new voters under the
Democratic tent, but [that goal eluded
him](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-voters.html).
Even Mr. Sanders has lamented that he was unable to produce a surge in
young voters.

In early primaries this year, he also failed to show that he had
remedied a crucial weakness from his 2016 run: a lack of support from
black voters, a vital base of the Democratic Party. In state after state
[across the
South](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/us/politics/super-tuesday-virginia-voter-turnout.html)
— Alabama, the Carolinas, Mississippi, Virginia — he was unable to chip
away at Mr. Biden’s strong support among African-Americans.

In many ways, Mr. Sanders never overcame the widely held view among
Democrats that he was a political outlier, a self-described democratic
socialist who proudly proclaimed himself to be an independent senator
from Vermont rather than a member of the party establishment.

Mr. Sanders championed liberal policies like “Medicare for all” and
tuition-free four-year public colleges aimed at lifting up America’s
working class, but he faced opposition from many party leaders, elected
officials and major donors, as well as large numbers of moderate voters
who saw him as too far left.

Mr. Sanders never accepted that argument. In recent weeks he said
repeatedly that he had won the ideological debate, asserting that a
strong majority of Democrats supported his progressive agenda.

But during a striking news conference in Burlington, Vt., last month, he
also acknowledged that he was [losing the electability
battle](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democrats-2020.html)
to Mr. Biden, saying voters had made clear that they thought the former
vice president was the best candidate to beat Mr. Trump.

The president immediately tried to sow discord among Democrats. [In a
Twitter
post](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247914464319504385) he
blamed Mr. Sanders’s inability to win Super Tuesday states on his
ideological rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and then invited Sanders
supporters to “come to the Republican Party.” At his evening news
briefing Mr. Trump was more pointed toward Mr. Biden, saying “It amazes
me that President Obama hasn’t supported Sleepy Joe. It just hasn’t
happened. When’s it going to happen?”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Indeed, Mr. Trump’s penchant for no-holds-barred political combat
presents another challenge for Mr. Biden. Some Democrats question
whether he can withstand the kind of bitingly personal onslaught that
Mr. Trump is certain to direct his way in the general election. The
president’s efforts to tar Mr. Biden with the overseas business dealings
of his son, Hunter, already upended the campaign once and led to Mr.
Trump’s
impeachment.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Sanders, 78, leaves the campaign having almost single-handedly moved
the Democratic Party to the left. He also transformed the way Democratic
campaigns raised money, eschewing big fund-raisers and instead relying
on an army of small-dollar donors.

But as he ascended to the top of the field in February, establishment
Democrats [scrambled to block his
path](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-party.html?searchResultPosition=1),
convinced his far-reaching proposals would alienate great swaths of the
electorate and make him an easy target for Mr. Trump.

Moderate candidates in the race who could not overcome Mr. Biden dropped
out and endorsed him just before Super Tuesday, on March 3, helping him
[sweep 10 of 14
states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/us/politics/super-tuesday-primary-winners.html)
on the biggest voting day of the primary. That led to a wave of new
endorsements and a remarkable coalescing around Mr. Biden that Mr.
Sanders could not match on the left.

Mr. Sanders’s insistence on Wednesday that he wants to amass delegates
to exert influence on the platform has convinced some Democrats that a
scaled-down or even virtual convention this summer might be preferable
to a traditional event. If the nomination is conferred virtually, the
argument goes, Mr. Biden’s campaign can control the platform
deliberations and program entirely, and ensure minimal dissent from
Sanders supporters.

The networks and cable stations would still carry whatever speeches Mr.
Biden’s advisers plan and there would be no live audience to interrupt
the proceedings.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For most of his campaign Mr. Sanders largely stuck to his familiar
message, battling establishment forces rather than his immediate rivals.
Amid a slump in the polls in the fall, he [suffered a heart
attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-hospital.html)
while campaigning in Las Vegas, a startling event that threatened to
upend his bid.

But in a remarkable turn of events — as he stood on the debate stage
just two weeks after his heart attack — [he received the
endorsement](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-queensbridge-park.html)
of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the most
visible liberal congresswomen and a star of the left. It helped
jump-start his candidacy just as it appeared in jeopardy of collapsing.

The endorsement helped carry him through the late fall and early winter,
and in January, as the first voting approached, Mr. Sanders was surging.
When he dominated the field in the
[Nevada](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/22/us/elections/results-nevada-caucus.html)
caucuses in February there was suddenly talk that he might run away with
the nomination.

But his loss in [South
Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/29/us/elections/results-south-carolina-primary-election.html)
to Mr. Biden, who had emerged as the leading moderate in the race,
brought his momentum to [an abrupt
halt](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/us/politics/joe-biden-south-carolina-primary.html).
