NEW DELHI — There are countless downsides to the world’s getting
walloped by the coronavirus and being put under severe lockdown.

But here in one of the most polluted cities on earth, where many people
routinely wear face masks to filter out the filth, something rare and
wonderful has emerged: a pure blue sky.

Because there are so few cars on the road, few factories belching out
black smoke and almost no active construction sites to create clouds of
choking dust, pollution levels in New Delhi, India’s megalopolis
capital, have dropped to [remarkably low
levels](https://www.cpcb.nic.in/air/NCR/jantacurfew.pdf).

At night there are stars. During the day the air is so clean that, for
once, you can’t taste it, free of the usual smoky metallic tang. One
cruelty of the coronavirus is to be under a tight lockdown right now,
with parks bolted shut, ordered to stay indoors unless vitally
necessary, only to look out your windows and see this.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the lockdown has spelled economic misery for the millions of people
who have been prevented from working.

But old-timers say Delhi’s air hasn’t been this clear for decades.

“I look at the sky quite often and enjoy its blueness from my balcony,”
said Sudhir Kumar Bose, 80, a retired English professor.

“I don’t know how long this will last,” he added. “But right now I feel
much better.”

It’s not just Delhi, but Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Ghaziabad.
All across India, cities can suddenly breathe. Los Angeles, New York,
Beijing, Seoul and Milan — [they have experienced less
pollution](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/coronavirus-pollution.html),
too, hit hard by the virus and restrictions on people’s movement.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

But those places aren’t nearly as polluted as India. Nowhere is. Last
year, once again, [India topped the charts of the worst
polluted](https://www.iqair.com/world-most-polluted-cities) as home to
14 of the 20 cities with the most hazardous air.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Delhi is among them, but last week it recorded a pollution reading of 38
on the Air Quality Index, about as good as anywhere in the world and
stunning to Delhiites who have become steeled to a reading of 150 AQI —
on a good
day.

*\[Update:* [*Unified in coronavirus lockdown, India splinters over
reopening*](http://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)*.\]*

Sometimes, especially in the winter, as cold air condenses car exhaust
and factory smoke and wind speeds drop, Delhi’s AQI (which measures
different airborne pollutants) can shoot up to 500 or more. That gives
many people chronic coughs and more serious lung disease.

But now sick people are savoring the reprieve.

“My old patients say they can’t believe it,” said Dr. Arvind Kumar, a
Delhi chest surgeon who has been studying the consequences of living in
a place with bad air. “They are feeling lighter, they are using their
inhalers less frequently, most of them are feeling better.”

Of course, everyone knows this is a sign of the frozen economy. The
clear skies are a consequence of a [tight
lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)
— the world’s biggest and one of the most severe — that has shuttered
factories, grounded flights, evicted taxis, rickshaws and crowded buses
from the roads and brought movement to a screeching halt. Many Indians
are obeying the orders to stay indoors in a lockdown that has become a
national house arrest for a nation of 1.3 billion people.

Environmentalists are using these strange times to make a point. One of
the most outspoken, [Jai Dhar Gupta](https://nirvanabeing.com/why-us/),
an Ivy League-educated environmental activist and entrepreneur, has been
fighting for years against the widely held belief that India is somehow
doomed to suffer bad air because of its geography and
climate.

“Clearly,” he said, “this is not something that can’t be reversed. We’ve
just reversed it.”

Towns more than a hundred miles from the Himalayas [can now see snow
peaks](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/ludhiana/from-jalandhar-rooftops-dhauladhar-in-full-glory/articleshow/74975862.cms).
Some people joked that they could see Canada from Punjab State. Others
said the air was so clear [they would soon be able to see
God](https://twitter.com/deepscribble/status/1246773230422994945).

The sky over Delhi is usually smudge gray, day or night. The gauze never
lifts. The sun sets mildly behind it.

Across much of China, too, air pollutants plunged after a lockdown to
stifle the epidemic closed factories, cut road traffic and drastically
reduced air
travel.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

China’s restrictions from January helped cut small, health-threatening
pollutants called PM 2.5 — for being less than 2.5 micrometers in
diameter, the smallest and most dangerous particles that are monitored —
by as much as 30 percent below normal levels, according to the
[Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring
Service](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/amid-coronavirus-outbreak-copernicus-monitors-reduction-particulate-matter-pm25-over-china).
Levels of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant caused by motor vehicles and
industry, also fell between 10 and 20 percent.

“This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a
wide area for a specific event,” said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher
at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, [according to a report from
NASA](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146362/airborne-nitrogen-dioxide-plummets-over-china).

But in China the near-pristine skies are already passing. There have
been [more bad days recently](https://aqicn.org/city/beijing/cn/), as
factories have restarted and more vehicles have returned to the roads.

In India, the lockdown is still in full effect, and it is unclear when
it will be lifted. Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, imposed the
strictures at the end of March, saying they would be for 21 days. But
many people fear he was just lowballing to keep the public from becoming
too
dispirited.

With some of the world’s poorest, most densely packed slums, India has a
huge risk of a coronavirus crisis. Health officials are racing to
contain the highly contagious disease, which could rip through areas
where millions live face to face. With India’s reported cases [doubling
around every four
days](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-covid-19-cases-doubling-every-4-days-set-to-touch-17-000-in-a-week-2207289)
and now topping 4,000, many people are bracing for a long lockdown.

At least there will be some dispensations.

There’s almost no honking, no shouting, no jostling. Roads and public
spaces are wide open and empty, perfect to see — and hear — birds.
Delhiites are now [spotting rare
birds](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/role-reversal-with-humans-caged-in-birds-fill-the-silence-as-sightings-go-up/articleshow/74975750.cms)
like gray hornbills and red-throated flycatchers.

The other evening, after sunset, another rare delight showed itself:
Venus, shining crisp and bright and steady with nothing to obscure it.
The pure black sky was bursting with stars, wrapping around us, endless
but somehow
consoling.
