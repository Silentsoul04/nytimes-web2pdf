WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. — When Chad Yazzie joined the Navajo Police
Department just a few months ago, he expected to issue speeding tickets
or break up the occasional fistfight.

But the coronavirus is now tearing across the largest Indian reservation
in the United States. The Navajo Nation’s casualty count is eclipsing
that of states with much larger populations, placing the rookie cop on
the front lines.

“My job is to tell our people to take this virus seriously or face the

outside the town of Window Rock to enforce the tribal nation’s 8 p.m.

Faced with an alarming spike in deaths from what the tribal health
department calls Dikos Ntsaaígíí-19 — or Covid-19 — Navajo officials are
putting up checkpoints, assembling field hospitals and threatening
curfew violators with 30 days in jail or a $1,000 fine.

The measures are part of a scramble to protect more than 150,000 people
on the vast Navajo reservation, which stretches 27,000 square miles
across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, and tens of thousands of others who
live in towns bordering the Navajo Nation. As of Wednesday night, the
virus had killed 20 people on the reservation, compared with 16 in the
entire state of New Mexico, which has a population 13 times larger.

Navajo officials, who have traced the surge in the reservation’s

peak in about a month.

Several factors — including a high prevalence of diseases like diabetes,

While the Navajo Nation may not technically be at war with the virus, it

gowns and other equipment, using Blackhawk helicopters to deliver it to
Kayenta, a town of 5,200 people near the sandstone buttes of Monument
Valley.

Guard members also converted a community center in Chinle into a 50-bed
field hospital for quarantining people who have tested positive for the
virus. And personnel visited a triage tent set up by Tuba City, near the
Navajo Nation’s western edge.

Going further, Navajo authorities said their entire nation would be
under curfew for 57 continuous hours, from Friday at 8 p.m. until Monday
at 5 a.m. The holiday weekend offers the opportunity to practice extreme
social distancing, the authorities said. Unlike many stay-at-home orders
around the nation, the Navajo curfews are being enforced with
checkpoints and patrols. Violators can face jail time and hefty fines.

The Navajo Nation’s president, Jonathan Nez, who has begun wearing a
mask in public, said in a telephone interview that authorities were
working under the assumption that the reservation’s peak in cases could
be about a month away, in early to mid-May.

Mr. Nez said he was growing exasperated with
[delays](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-american-indian-health-138724)
in receiving federal emergency funds and by the requirements that tribal
nations, unlike cities and counties, must apply for grants to receive
money from federal stimulus legislation. The extra hurdles have led to
weeks of additional bureaucratic delays, he said.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re barely getting bits and pieces,” Mr. Nez said. “You have
counties, municipalities, already taking advantage of these funds, and
tribes are over here writing our applications and turning it in and
waiting weeks to get what we need.”

The crisis among the Diné, as many Navajos prefer to call themselves, is
echoing throughout Indian Country. Around the United States, and
especially in New Mexico, tribal leaders have started barring
nonresidents from reservations. In South Dakota, the Oglala Sioux tribe
announced a 72-hour lockdown after a resident of the Pine Ridge
reservation tested positive for the coronavirus. The Blackfeet and the
Northern Cheyenne tribal nations in Montana have announced curfews.

The Hopi reservation, which is surrounded entirely by the Navajo Nation
and includes some of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the
United States, issued its own stay-at-home order. Signaling
vulnerabilities elsewhere in the Southwest, large clusters of cases
emerged this week in San Felipe Pueblo and Zia Pueblo, two of New
Mexico’s 23 federally recognized tribal
nations.

Native American leaders say they are also dealing with the potential for
racist attacks as outsiders try to cast blame for the pandemic on tribal
citizens.

Police in Page, an Arizona town bordering the Navajo Nation, said this
week that they had arrested a 34-year-old man, Daniel Franzen, on
suspicion of attempting to incite an act of terrorism. Mr. Franzen in a
Facebook post had called for using “lethal force” against Navajos
because they were, in his view, “100 percent infected” with the virus,
the Page Police Department said in a statement.

Infectious disease specialists say the virus is thought to have arrived
on the reservation later than in other parts of the United States. It
began spreading rapidly after it was detected among members of the
Church of the Nazarene, an evangelical congregation in the outpost of
Chilchinbeto near the Arizona-Utah border.

Families traveled from far-flung parts of the Navajo Nation to attend
the rally, which included a prayer service in response to the pandemic
already spreading in parts of the country.

Dr. Laura Hammitt, director of the infectious disease prevention program
at the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health, listed several
factors that have made citizens of the Navajo Nation especially
vulnerable to the coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The scarcity of running water on the reservation, she said, makes it
harder to wash hands. There are also pre-existing health conditions,
including respiratory problems caused by indoor pollution because of the
wood and coal used to heat many Navajo
homes.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“Instead of urban crowding in high-density cities like New York, you
have indoor crowding with several generations living under the same
roof,” she said.

That explains the special need for field hospitals where patients who
have tested positive for the virus can recuperate away from their
families. Officials are also searching for ways to mitigate the spread
of the virus in the so-called border towns where many Diné live.

For instance, in addition to the field hospitals assembled by the
Arizona National Guard, the iconic El Rancho Hotel in the town of Gallup
near the Navajo Nation is planning to house homeless people who have
developed respiratory problems in one of its buildings.

Despite such measures, fear is building on parts of the reservation, and
some are taking it upon themselves to protect their families.

In a culture prizing communal contact, Julian Parrish, a computer
science high school teacher in Chinle, said he and his girlfriend had
taken the unusual step of going on Facebook to request that visitors
refrain from coming to their home unannounced.

Mr. Parrish, 34, explained that he is prediabetic, his girlfriend is
pregnant and her son has asthma that sometimes requires trips to the
emergency room.

“We don’t want to go anywhere near the hospital at this time,” Mr.
Parrish said. “No one knows where the hell this virus is going
next.”

As the death count climbs, the virus is drawing grim comparisons with
previous epidemics that shaped the history of the Diné. From the start
of the European conquest, outbreaks of smallpox, bubonic plague and
typhus ravaged the tribe.

A century ago, the influenza pandemic of 1918 spread to the [most remote
corners](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.5250/amerindiquar.38.4.0459.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A70667e3ff079d8c69050297f2972d443)
of the reservation, killing thousands. Estimates put the mortality rate
as high as 10 percent; accounts from that time described how some
survivors died from starvation with no one left to care for them.

More recently, a [hantavirus
outbreak](https://www.aaas.org/virus-rocked-four-corners-reemerges) in
the region in 1993 stirred fear across the Navajo Nation. The virus,
carried by deer mice, left 13 dead including young, otherwise healthy
people who developed sudden respiratory failure.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Despite the rising death toll from the newest virus, epidemiologists say
the Diné may have advantages in the mitigation fight that other tribal
nations do not.

They point to the nation’s relatively large number of diabetes
specialists, who could help with outreach or trace the spread of the
virus. Robust civil society groups within the reservation have also
sprung into action, with volunteers replenishing water tanks for
hundreds of families.

As one of the largest tribal nations in the United States, the Diné, who
number more than 330,000 on the reservation and beyond, can also draw on
resources unavailable to other tribes.

That includes the 200-strong police force now charged with enforcing the
curfew every night in towns and along lonely stretches of road that
connect far-flung homesteads and sheep ranches.

“We have to get the situation under control,” Officer Yazzie said,
between chasing down curfew violators, writing citations and telling
motorists over a loudspeaker to “just go home” where it was safe.

“If we don’t do this,” he said, “it’s our own families at
risk.”
