\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{people
who have died in the coronavirus pandemic}}\emph{.}

Even among the many lively cultural worlds of Detroit, the city's
ballroom dancing scene is singular.

Its style incorporates cha-cha steps, glides and twirls to R\&B and
hip-hop music --- think Debbie Allen meets Chaka Khan --- and expert
Detroit ballroom dancers like Laneeka Barksdale are royalty in Motown.

Ms. Barksdale died on March 23 in a Detroit hospital at 47. The cause
was complications of the coronavirus, her brother, Omari Barksdale,
said. She had long had severe asthma, an underlying condition that can
make people who have it particularly vulnerable to the virus.

Detroit has been an epicenter of the pandemic, and
\href{https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/04/01/ballroom-dance-detroit-coronavirus-covid-19/5097523002/}{several}people
in the city's ballroom scene are believed to have died from the virus.

Ms. Barksdale, known as Nikki, was born in Detroit on May 22, 1972. She
graduated from Berkley High School, outside the city, and attended Henry
Ford College, a community college in Dearborn, Mich. She worked as a
bartender for many years, most recently at the MGM Grand Detroit hotel,
and was recently driving for Lyft.

Anonymous when behind a wheel by day, she was a popular virtuoso on the
dance floor by night, known for her gliding. She had also mastered bop,
stepping, hustles and other difficult ballroom steps.

``My earliest memory is her dancing in the middle of the living room in
my house,'' Mr. Barksdale, her younger brother, said. She found her way
as a young teenager onto a popular dance show on local cable called
``The Scene.''

``It was very popular among black folks in Detroit,'' Mr. Barksdale
said. ``All the local black-owned businesses would advertise during that
hour.''

Ballrooms, like Club Yesterday's, remained a constant in her life.

In addition to her brother, she is survived by three sons, a daughter
and her parents.
