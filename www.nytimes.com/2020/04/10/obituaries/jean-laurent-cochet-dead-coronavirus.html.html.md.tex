85}\label{jean-laurent-cochet-actor-who-taught-frances-stars-dies-at-85}}

Mr. Cochet, who had the coronavirus, was a major figure in French
theater. His students included Gérard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert.

Jean-Laurent Cochet was the most renowned acting teacher in France, and
one of the strictest.

``If a student arrived five minutes late to class, they didn't get into
the course,'' Maxime d'Aboville, a former student, said in an email.
``If we coughed in class,'' he added, ``we were sent out.''

But Mr. Cochet's demanding nature led to success. His former students
included Gérard Depardieu, Isabelle Huppert and a host of French
television, movie and stage stars.

``The Americans
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/18/obituaries/lee-strasberg-of-actors-studio-dead.html}{had
Lee Strasberg and the Actors Studio},'' said Pierre Delavène, director
of the
\href{https://www.courscochetdelavene.fr/}{Cochet-Delavène}School, which
Mr. Cochet founded in 1965. ``The French had Jean-Laurent Cochet.''

Mr. Cochet died on Monday at 85 in a hospital in Paris, a spokeswoman
for his agents said. The cause was complications of the new coronavirus.

Mr. Cochet ``asked the impossible,'' Mr. Delavène said by email, so that
his students could dedicate themselves fully to the craft of acting. If
he thought a student wasn't passionate enough, Mr. Delavène added, he
would encourage the student to quit acting entirely.

Ms. Huppert once said she was ``fascinated'' by his teaching, adding,
``In his class, I was more spectator than actress,'' the French
newspaper
\href{https://next.liberation.fr/culture/2020/04/07/mort-de-jean-laurent-cochet-maitre-des-acteurs-francais_1784481}{Libération
quoted her as saying}.

Jean-Laurent Cochet was born on Jan. 28, 1935, in Romainville, a suburb
of Paris, and wanted to be an actor from a young age,
\href{https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2020/04/07/le-metteur-en-scene-jean-laurent-cochet-est-mort_6035879_3382.html}{the
newspaper Le Monde} reported. His teachers made him focus on classics of
French drama by the likes of Victor Hugo and Molière, and he would later
insist that his own students do the same.

He would start classes by teaching his students how to recite a fable by
the 17th-century poet Jean de La Fontaine. ``His teaching didn't age a
bit,'' Mr. Delavène said. ``It is only by mastery of the great classical
repertoire that one finally comes closest to the modern repertoire.''

Mr. Cochet joined the Comédie-Française, France's oldest theater troupe,
in 1959, when he was 24. He went on to perform with the company in
numerous plays before deciding to start his own theater school in the
1960s.

Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.

Richard Berry, a prominent French actor, said in a phone interview that
Mr. Cochet's classes would focus on technique, so that students would
realize that the body was an instrument.

``Most actors, they act a text as they feel it --- it's inspiration,''
Mr. Berry said, ``but he showed me there is more.''
