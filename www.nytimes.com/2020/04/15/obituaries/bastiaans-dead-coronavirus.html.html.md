He was the kind of teacher who gave his lunch to a hungry student and

*This obituary is part of a series about people who died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

After he graduated from teachers’ college, Michael Angel Bastiaans was
sent to teach for two years on the remote Indonesian island of Siberut.
The wooden schoolhouse there was built on stilts, and small earthquakes
shook it daily. Power outages lasted for days, and food was sometimes in
short supply.

But the hardships didn’t trouble him. He gave his lunch to a student who
had no breakfast. He cracked jokes while fetching water and joined in
singing during blackouts. He taught his students how to play basketball
even though they had no court.

“He always knew how to lift people up, making sure everyone felt loved
and accepted,” said his fiancée, Devina Christi Setiawan.

Mr. Bastiaans died of complications of the coronavirus at a hospital in
the greater Jakarta area on April 4 after falling ill in mid-March, said
his brother, Gabriel Joshua Bastiaans. He was 31.

Family, friends and former students remembered Mr. Bastiaans as an
inspirational and generous teacher.

“He gave all his time and all his heart to the kids in his class,” said
Korryzon Akikalamu, who taught with him on Siberut, in the remote
Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra.

Mr. Bastiaans grew up in Bali, the fourth of six children. The family
fell on hard times when he was about 13, and he went door to door with
his mother to help her sell bedsheets, Gabriel Bastiaans recalled.

As a teenager, Michael expected to go into the hospitality business,
like many young people in Bali. But he received a scholarship to study
teaching at the [Universitas Pelita Harapan](https://www.uph.edu/), in
Tangerang, outside Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, and that is where he
found his calling.

.

He didn’t question his assignment to teach on Siberut. “He never
complained whatever the situation he faced,” said Anace Watilete, who
also taught there.

Mr. Bastiaans, a devout Christian, later taught Indonesian language at
Sekolah Pelita Harapan, a Christian school in Lippo Karawaci, also near
Jakarta.

Known to his students as Pak Mike, or Mr. Mike, he worked there on and
off from 2013 until last year. Last week, the school held a celebration
to honor his memory.

“Pak Mike wasn’t just a great teacher; he was a friend and made a family
out of our class,” said one student, Wilson Sugeng, reading a tribute
that he and his former classmates wrote.

Although he didn’t have much money of his own, friends recalled, he
would step forward to pay their way home when family emergencies arose.

But he was restless and looking for something more. He became passionate
about improving Indonesia’s educational system and believed he could be
more effective if he had money. He intermittently left teaching to try
ventures in investment and financial planning.

“He taught me to smile brighter, to love more fiercely, to dare to be
vulnerable, to forgive freely and, above all, to let down my guard and
live more genuinely,” said Ms. Setiawan, his fiancée. “I wish I got to
say thank you to him one last
time.”
