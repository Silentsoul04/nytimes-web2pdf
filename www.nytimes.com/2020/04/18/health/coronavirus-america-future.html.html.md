The
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-flatbush-brooklyn.html)
is spreading from America’s biggest cities to its suburbs, and has begun
encroaching on the nation’s rural regions. The virus is believed to have
infected millions of citizens and has killed more than 34,000.

Yet President Trump this week proposed guidelines for reopening the
economy and suggested that a swath of the United States would soon
resume something resembling normalcy. For weeks now, the
administration’s view of the crisis and our future has been rosier
than that of its own medical advisers, and of scientists generally.

In truth, it is not clear to anyone where this crisis is leading us.
More than 20 experts in public health, medicine, epidemiology and
history shared their thoughts on the future during in-depth interviews.
When can we emerge from our homes? How long, realistically, before we
have a treatment or vaccine? How will we keep the virus at bay?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some felt that American ingenuity, once fully engaged, might well
produce advances to ease the burdens. The path forward depends on
factors that are certainly difficult but doable, they said: a carefully
staggered approach to reopening, widespread testing and surveillance, a
treatment that works, adequate resources for health care providers — and
eventually an effective vaccine.

Still, it was impossible to avoid gloomy forecasts for the next year.
The scenario that Mr. Trump has been unrolling at his daily press
briefings — that the lockdowns will end soon, that a protective pill is
almost at hand, that football stadiums and restaurants will soon be full
— is a fantasy, most experts said.

“We face a doleful future,” said Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, a former
president of the National Academy of Medicine.

He and others foresaw an unhappy population trapped indoors for months,
with the most vulnerable possibly quarantined for far longer. They
worried that a vaccine would initially elude scientists, that weary
citizens would abandon restrictions despite the risks, that the virus
would be with us from now on.

“My optimistic side says the virus will ease off in the summer and a
vaccine will arrive like the cavalry,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a
preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University medical school.
“But I’m learning to guard against my essentially optimistic nature.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most experts believed that once the crisis was over, the nation and its
economy would revive quickly. But there would be no escaping a period of
intense pain.

Exactly how the pandemic will end depends in part on medical advances
still to come. It will also depend on how individual Americans behave in
the interim. If we scrupulously protect ourselves and our loved ones,
more of us will live. If [we underestimate the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/bishop-gerald-glenn-coronavirus.html),
it will find
us.

### More Americans may die than the White House admits.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
    
    Today: As President Trump urges states to begin reopening their
    economies, a debate begins over when and how to end the lockdowns.
    Science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. on what that might look like.
    
    It’s Monday, April 20.
    
    So Donald, we have come to you at just about every turn in this
    pandemic to understand what’s next, and the portraits of the future
    that you have painted for us each time we talk have been strikingly
    accurate. You told us all the way back in February to prepare for
    lockdowns. Those happened. You told us to prepare for high death
    rates. You said that people we know would die, and that, sadly, has
    happened. You warned us of shortages of medical supplies. That too
    has happened. Just about everything you said would happen has more
    or less happened. So I want to turn to the next installment of this
    rolling conversation we’ve been having with you.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    OK.

  - michael barbaro  
    And start with a question that I think is on everyone’s mind right
    now, which is when and how we start to reopen our society and what
    that would look like.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    OK. Well, look, I’m not some dark angel who’s simply looking into
    the future.

  - michael barbaro  
    Understood.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I’m talking to experts. I’m looking at the other pandemics I’ve
    covered. I’m talking to medical historians and making predictions
    based on data. And so I think a lot of people think that by May or
    June or August, we’re going to return to something like normalcy.
    But all the experts I talk to say, no, that’s a fantasy.

  - michael barbaro  
    Why is it a fantasy?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, because if we all tried to come out at once, everything would
    look cool for about three weeks. And a week or two after that the
    emergency rooms would start to fill again, and people would start to
    die again. Flattening the curve is a notion that people love, but
    when we say we’re flattening the curve, no, we’re plateauing at a
    very high level of the curve. That means a steady rate of deaths. So
    what we want is to see the lockdown last until we get back down to
    close to what the normal baseline rate of deaths is. And it’s going
    to be piece by piece. We might be able to let a certain number of
    people ride the subway each day. People still staying apart from
    each other. We’re not going to be able to let people sit next to
    each other in football stadiums. Maybe the team will play on the
    field, and there will be some cameramen in the stands, but it’s not
    going to be the way it was before.

  - michael barbaro  
    OK. So if there’s not going to be any kind of single moment where
    the curtain goes up and life resumes, what does a lifting of these
    lockdowns start to look like?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, the best description I heard of it was in an article. It was
    on March 19, by Tomas Pueyo, a writer in San Francisco. And it was
    called “The Hammer and the Dance.” And the hammer is the lockdown.
    There was no question of social distancing light. It was more like,
    bam, everybody has to go into their houses. But then, once you get
    the deaths down to a minimum, then you begin the dance. And the
    dance is dancing a little bit out, and opening up some of the
    restrictions and seeing, you know, how far can you let people go.
    And then you see what that does to death rates. And once the death
    rates go up, you have to go back and leave the dance floor and go
    into lockdown again. And it repeats again and again. And it’s dance
    in, dance out, dance in, dance out. And basically that’s what the
    epidemiological models show we have to do.

  - michael barbaro  
    So in this scenario, tiptoeing back to normal happens, and if there
    is a resurgence in infections, then the hammer comes back down.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Exactly.

  - michael barbaro  
    So let’s talk about what the opening starts to look like. Describe
    the dance.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    OK. So the dance is you have this whole list of things you can ask
    people to do. One of them being wear masks. Another one is sit six
    feet apart from your dining companions at a restaurant. So a
    restaurant that had 100 customers before now has about 10 customers
    in it. You have to cut down travel between cities, because people
    from a hot zone, like New York recently, could go to a cool zone and
    start infections. International travelers will have to be
    quarantined for 14 days so that we’re sure they’re not infected when
    they come in. So we will have to find restrictions on people’s
    movements that keeps them from getting too close and letting the
    virus spread again. Because when the virus spreads, deaths follow.

  - michael barbaro  
    OK. Let’s get a little more specific here. What does the dance mean
    for, let’s say, schools?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, schools is a big mystery, because we don’t know much about the
    virus in children. Very, very few children get hospitalized and die.
    It happens, but it’s very uncommon. But the question is, how much do
    the kids get the virus and transmit the virus? Because if you open
    schools, the children may be fine, but the teachers won’t
    necessarily be, and the children’s parents and grandparents won’t
    be. So mayors and governors are going to have to decide, maybe we’re
    going to open school for two weeks and see what happens? Or maybe
    we’re going to let half the kids go to school this week but have
    them sitting six feet apart, and then next week the other half of
    the kids get to come to school.

  - michael barbaro  
    And Donald, what about the typical workplace. From the way you’re
    describing schools, it sounds like, at the very least, people at an
    office or a factory would need to be six feet apart. What else?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, it depends on what you mean by the average workplace. Are you
    a construction crew? Are you an office, like The New York Times? Are
    you a factory? Are you a food processing plant? Everyone is
    different. And for those of us who work most of the day on
    computers, there’s not a whole lot of reason to go back to the
    workplace. It may be more of a source of danger than any advantage
    you get from being there. Whereas if you work in a chicken
    processing plant, you’ve got to be near the chickens. So somehow
    they’re going to have to stretch out those chicken disassembly
    lines, so that people can do it safely without infecting each other.
    And they’ll have to wear masks, and maybe there’ll be plexiglass
    between the workers. There’s lots of measures you can take, and
    they’re going to be different for every single workplace.

  - michael barbaro  
    I want to talk for just a moment about geography, because I wonder
    if the scenarios you’re describing would apply as rigorously in one
    part of, for example, the United States as another, based on issues
    like density or the cycle of this virus. There are many places in
    the United States that have been largely untouched by this virus. Or
    there are places like Washington state, where it seems the virus has
    turned a corner. So would this hammer and dance scenario apply in
    the same way to every corner of the country? Or could it be applied
    more lightly or more severely, based on density, based on number of
    infections?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes and no. It’s a fantasy to believe that there are any parts of
    the country that are untouched by this virus. It is much more
    intense in some places, like New York and New Orleans and Detroit,
    but it’s everywhere. If you look at any map of cases, it’s certainly
    in every state. It’s in multiple counties in every state. So it’s
    going to have to be different techniques developed, not just for
    every state in every county, but for every work situation, so that
    you are not transmitting virus to each other.

  - michael barbaro  
    Donald, is the point of the hammer and the dance to avoid having the
    rest of the country get infected, or does it simply slow a
    inevitable version of mass infection but not prevent it?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    It slows it down. A certain amount of infection is inevitable,
    because emergency workers are going to have to be at their jobs.
    Medical workers are going to get infected. There’s going to be a
    certain level of infection at all times, but you want to damp it
    down to the minimum. But all the models say that maybe 3 percent of
    America is infected by now. The other epidemiologists think maybe
    it’s 10 percent. That 10 percent is a pretty high guess. So that
    still leaves 300 million Americans uninfected. So we’re a country
    that’s somewhere north of 90 percent susceptible. And each time we
    do the dance out and dance in, we chop a few more people off that
    susceptible list. A few of them are dead. A bunch of them become
    immune. But it only proceeds in fits and starts. Maybe we go three
    million at a time, three million at a time, three million at a time.
    It’s not a fast process.

  - michael barbaro  
    And how long do the experts you talked to say that this dance will
    need to occur? At some point, do we stop dancing and we just get to
    go back to normal?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    The dance will end when we have a vaccine that we can all take, or
    if we have a prophylactic pill that will protect us all, like PrEP
    protects you from HIV. Or when so many of us would become infected —
    70-plus percent have become infected, and the virus dies out or
    slows down just because it can’t find any new victims to infect.

  - michael barbaro  
    Mm-hmm.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    But making a vaccine within 18 months is extremely optimistic. The
    record we’ve ever had for producing a vaccine is four years. That
    was a mumps vaccine produced back in the ‘50s. We’ve got new
    techniques that speed it up, but some things can’t be sped up. And
    then after we design the vaccine, we have to think about producing
    the vaccine. If we need 300 million doses of vaccine, or if we need
    two shots — if we need 600 million doses of vaccine — that’s a
    gigantic undertaking. I talked to some vaccine production experts,
    and they said, the average vaccine plant in America makes 5 to 10
    million doses. So we’ve got to find some way to make 300 to 600
    million doses of vaccine, and we have to start planning now, even
    before the vaccine exists.

  - michael barbaro  
    Donald, you just said that the record for making a vaccine is four
    years. Are you saying that there is a version of this where this
    dance, in the hammer and dance metaphor, goes on not for one year
    but something like four years?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    That’s a kind of worst case scenario, as far as timing is concerned.
    Everything may get lowered in this. We may test vaccines in a way
    that we would think of as ethically unthinkable in normal times. We
    may go with somewhat lower safety standards for vaccines, because
    we’re facing a situation where life is dangerous. But yeah, the
    fastest human vaccine ever made was mumps. Four years, from start to
    finish.

  - michael barbaro  
    So I just want to be clear. Is there a world, according to the
    experts you’re talking to, who say the world of tiptoeing out and
    coming back and realizing that there’s a resurgence, and then
    tiptoeing back out again, that that could last years?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes.

  - michael barbaro  
    And during that, the virus lasts? It doesn’t die off in the hot
    summers?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    There is zero evidence that this virus dies off in hot weather. The
    virus is circulating now in India, in Brazil, in Australia.

  - michael barbaro  
    Very, very hot environments.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Exactly. There’s no evidence that it’s going to die out in the
    summer.

  - michael barbaro  
    Donald, I’m willing to speak for many listeners when I say that the
    idea of living in masks, with everyone sitting six feet apart, and
    the expectation that a viral resurgence might mean that even that
    becomes too risky and so everyone goes back under lockdown — that
    that could go on for years is really pretty depressing and kind of
    hard to wrap one’s head around.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I know. But if we don’t go into a dance, means there’s going to be
    more infections and more deaths.

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    We’ll be right back.
    
    Don, during this period, it feels like not everyone is going to be
    on equal footing, in the sense that some of us will have been
    infected and will possess some kind of immunity to Covid-19, right?
    And many of us, of course, will not have been infected and will not
    possess that immunity. So how does that factor into this, give and
    take, this dance you’re describing?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Well, we’re already seeing this happen. There are a very small
    number of people now who are immune. And they’re very much in
    demand. They’re in demand for their blood, because you can harvest
    antibodies from their blood. They’re in demand for doing medical
    jobs that are dangerous, like intubating patients, because they can
    do it without fear of infection. They’ll be in demand for all sorts
    of other jobs, because they can travel anywhere. They can do
    face-to-face interactions with customers without any fear. And
    they’re going to be a special class in society. There’ll be
    different standards, different ways of living for two different
    classes in society. So say you’re an immune and I’m not. I basically
    have to stay inside here in hiding, and I’m depressed as hell about
    it. I have a granddaughter who’s going to be born in June, and I sit
    here in my apartment thinking, I may not see her until she’s two
    years old. And that’s horrible to contemplate, but it may be a fact.
    Meanwhile, you, as an immune, could go visit my granddaughter or go
    out and take my job, or —

  - michael barbaro  
    No one can take your job, Donald, just to be clear.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Not a heck of a lot of people want my job. There’ll be different
    standards, different ways of living for two different classes in
    society for a while. It’s quite science fiction-y. It’s kind of
    dystopian.

  - michael barbaro  
    Right. That kind of a societal schism, right, between the immune and
    the still susceptible, it would seem to require a few pieces of firm
    knowledge. One is that there’s a widespread ability to tell who is
    immune versus who is not, and the other piece of knowledge is that
    we know for sure that being infected confers immunity. So how do you
    resolve either of those?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    We don’t know those things yet. We don’t know them for dead sure,
    but as Tony Fauci says, usually when you recover from disease,
    you’re immune for a while. But we don’t know how long the immunity
    lasts, because this disease has only been around since November at
    the earliest.

  - michael barbaro  
    Mm-hmm. Are there plans? Do you envision a universe in which people
    literally wear some sort of sign that they are immune and that that
    can be rigorously proven?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes. That is already beginning to take place. Germany is talking
    about issuing certificates, but you don’t want something you can
    pass from person to person. So China takes people’s cell phones and
    has a QR code that you read as you come into the subway, you come
    into a restaurant, you come into any place where somebody can check
    your phone. And that readout tells the person looking at your phone
    that you’re immune. So yeah, people are already thinking about this.

  - michael barbaro  
    In the scenario that you’re laying out, immunity and the ability to
    show immunity would seem to be incredibly desirable and might create
    some very complicated incentives.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes. People are going to be tempted to become immunes and to do it
    the chickenpox party way.

  - michael barbaro  
    What do you mean?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    To deliberately infect themselves, hoping for the best, but that
    they emerge at the end of it as an immune. That temptation is going
    to be enormous.

  - michael barbaro  
    You’re describing deliberate and perhaps large scale acts of
    self-infection.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yes. I am. There is a lot of historical precedent for that stuff. In
    the years before smallpox vaccine, people used to take pus from the
    blisters of smallpox victims, or dried up scabs from smallpox
    victims, and put the pus into — stab a little hole in their child’s
    arm and put some of the pus in there, or blow the scabs into your
    nose. And that would give you a usually mild case of smallpox. And I
    talked to an immunologist who said, look, the child had about a 1
    percent chance of dying, and the parents recognized that. And that
    was better, because if you had a smallpox epidemic come through,
    usually, about a third of the susceptibles died. So if you had six
    kids, you might think hard about giving them all a little bit of
    smallpox in their arm.

  - michael barbaro  
    Don, what you’re describing is a very calculated risk that some
    people may take to self-infect, and I wonder just how dangerous it
    may be if people miscalculate.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    With the virus acting the way it is acting now, it’s very dangerous.
    We know that there are people who are more at risk, but we also know
    that it’s unpredictable — that young, athletic, healthy people,
    totally unpredictably, end up on a ventilator, and a few of them
    die.

  - michael barbaro  
    Right.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    So it’s people making life or death decisions for freedom.

  - michael barbaro  
    And a paycheck.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    And a paycheck, yes.

  - michael barbaro  
    Everything that you’re talking about here seems to assume the
    absence of a successful treatment and a world where we’re pretty
    much waiting for a vaccine. Could that change? When we’ve asked you
    this question in the past, you have said that there wasn’t a viable
    treatment. Do you have any sense that that may be changing and that
    a treatment might come before a vaccine?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I don’t have any sense that it’s changing in an important way. There
    is something that doctors place some hope in, and that is taking the
    blood from people who’ve recovered from the disease, and removing
    the red blood cells and the white blood cells and everything else
    and leaving just the antibodies. Those antibodies glob onto the
    virus and neutralize it, and so you can inject them into somebody
    who’s sick. But it’s a technology that is not fast-moving, so it’s
    not in the immediate future. But scientists are hopeful that it’s in
    the mid-term future.

  - michael barbaro  
    So in other words, for the time being, we are left pretty much with
    the hammer and the dance as our most practical solution.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Exactly.

  - michael barbaro  
    So Donald, with everything that you just said in mind, I want to
    return to that first time we ever spoke. Because when we had that
    conversation, you were well ahead of anybody else in preparing us
    for what the pandemic would mean on a personal level. You told us
    about your stockpile of food, your month worth of medicine, and you
    told us that we should be prepared not to see our friends and our
    family for a while. And all of that proved prescient. But there’s
    one area where I recall you, perhaps, underestimated something. You
    said be prepared for a couple of months of something that might look
    like a lockdown. And now, it’s feeling like it’s going to last a lot
    longer. So with that in mind, what preparations are you making now
    that the rest of us may end up making for ourselves in the coming
    days, weeks, months, to prepare for that new reality?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    I’m busy. I’m working harder than I’ve ever worked hard before, and
    that’s given me a sense of purpose. That gives me some psychological
    stability that a lot of other people don’t have the luck to have.
    I’m thinking about what am I going to do to entertain myself? I’m
    thinking of buying a fishing rod and becoming one of those old guys
    on the piers who’s fishing for bluefish. I like trout fishing, but
    it seems unlikely I’m going to get away to do that for a while. So
    it’s just, you have to mentally prepare yourself for these things.
    And now be it said, I have visions for the future that are rosy, and
    that keeps me going too.

  - michael barbaro  
    You do?

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Yeah. If you look at the periods after World War I and after World
    War II, not only did the economy come back after both those periods.
    Remember, after the one-two punch of World War I plus the Spanish
    influenza, we had the roaring ‘20s. After World War II, we had a
    period in which, in Europe, the war widows and pensions fund became
    the European welfare state. War profiteers suddenly faced higher
    taxes and a lot of scrutiny. People had pretty much had it with the
    rich by that time, and they wanted more. They wanted the G.I. Bill.
    They wanted federally-sponsored mortgages for housing. They wanted
    better health care. And to some extent, they got it. I was born in
    1954, and my parents were of the generation that had made it through
    the Great Depression and through the Second World War. And they had
    a different attitude on life. They had a sense of, hey, we did this
    incredible thing. We did it all together. We got through it. I hope
    that sort of era comes again, that people will take more pleasure in
    small things in life. And that we will do more to make sure that we
    take care of each other, and that that’ll go through all levels of
    society. And like I said, I try not to predict the future, but maybe
    something like that will emerge from this.

  - michael barbaro  
    Well, of all the visions that you have given us, I like that one the
    best.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Me too.

  - \[music\]

  - michael barbaro  
    Donald, thank you very much.

  - donald g. mcneil jr.  
    Thank you.

  - michael barbaro  
    On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence declared that states have
    sufficient amount of testing to begin the process of reopening their
    economies, a claim that governors in multiple states immediately
    rejected as untrue. It’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of
    testing out there, and the governor should just get it done. That’s
    just not being straightforward. In interviews on CNN on Sunday, the
    governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, and the governor of Virginia,
    Ralph Northam, said they would need significantly higher levels of
    testing before they would consider lifting their lockdowns.

  - archived recording (ralph northam)  
    That’s just delusional to be making statements like that. For the
    national level to say that we have what we need and really to have
    no guidance to the state levels is just irresponsible, because we’re
    not there yet.

\[music\]

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to today.

  - archived recording (protestors)  
    \[CHANTING\]

michael barbaro

Demonstrators took to the streets in several states across the country
over the weekend to protest stay-at-home orders that they said were
destroying the economy.

  - archived recording (protestor)  
    I hope Whitmer understands that she’s not just going to be able to
    rule Michigan like other politicians rule China or something like
    that. We’re going to take our liberties, and we’re going to keep
    them, and we’re going to fight for them.

michael barbaro

The protests, which drew hundreds of people in Michigan, Texas and North
Carolina, among other states, were largely organized by anti-government
activists and libertarian groups, and were encouraged by President
Trump, who took to Twitter to urge residents to liberate their states.
But polling shows that most Americans support the lockdowns. A recent
survey by Pew Research found that 66 percent of respondents feared that
states would lift restrictions too quickly.

Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, is arguably [the
leading cause of death in the United
States](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1830480/) right
now. The virus has killed more than 1,800 Americans almost every day
since April 7, and the official toll [may be an
undercount](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-death-count.html).

By comparison, heart disease typically kills 1,774 Americans a day, and
cancer kills 1,641.

Yes, the coronavirus curves are plateauing. There are fewer hospital
admissions in New York, the center of the epidemic, and fewer Covid-19
patients in I.C.U.s. The daily death toll is still grim, but no longer
rising.

An epidemiological model produced by the White House originally
predicted 100,000 to 240,000 deaths by midsummer. Another model, by the
University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation,
now puts that figure at 60,000.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While this is encouraging news, it masks some significant concerns. The
institute’s projection runs through Aug. 4, describing only the first
wave of this epidemic. Without a vaccine, the virus is expected to
circulate for years, and the death tally will rise over time.

The gains to date were achieved only by shutting down the country, a
situation that cannot continue indefinitely. The White House’s “phased”
plan for reopening will surely raise the death toll no matter how
carefully it is executed. The best hope is that fatalities can be held
to a minimum.

Reputable longer-term projections for how many Americans will die vary,
but they are all grim. Various experts [consulted by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in
March](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html)
predicted that the virus eventually could reach 48 percent to 65 percent
of all Americans, with a fatality rate just under 1 percent, and would
kill up to 1.7 million of them if nothing were done to stop the spread.

A model by researchers at Imperial College London [cited by the
president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-14/)
on March 30 [predicted 2.2 million
deaths](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf)
in the United States by September under the same circumstances.

By comparison, about 420,000 Americans died in World War II.

The limited data from China are even more discouraging. Its epidemic has
been halted — for the moment — and virtually everyone infected in its
first wave has died or recovered.

China has officially reported [about 83,000 cases and 4,632
deaths](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), which is a fatality
rate of over 5 percent. The Trump administration [has questioned the
figures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/cia-coronavirus-china.html)
but has not produced more accurate ones.

Fatality rates [depend heavily on how
overwhelmed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-death-count.html)
hospitals get and what percentage of cases are tested. China’s estimated
death rate was 17 percent in the first week of January, when Wuhan was
in chaos, according to [a Center for Evidence-Based Medicine
report](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/),
but only 0.7 percent by late February.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In this country, hospitals in several cities, including New York, came
to the brink of chaos. Officials in both
[Wuhan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/world/coronavirus-news.html#link-f029419)
and [New
York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-deaths.html)
had to revise their death counts upward this week when they realized
that many people had died at home of Covid-19, strokes, heart attacks or
other causes, or because ambulances never came for them.

In fast-moving epidemics, far more victims pour into hospitals or die at
home than doctors can test; at the same time, the mildly ill or
asymptomatic never get tested. Those two factors distort the true
fatality rate in opposite ways. If you don’t know how many people are
infected, you [don’t know how deadly a virus
is](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html).

Only when tens of thousands of antibody tests are done will we know how
many silent carriers there may be in the United States. The C.D.C. [has
suggested it might be 25
percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html)
of those who test positive. Researchers in Iceland [said it might be
double
that](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/europe/iceland-testing-coronavirus-intl/index.html).

China is also revising its own estimates. In February, a [major
study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130)
concluded that only 1 percent of cases in Wuhan were asymptomatic. [New
research](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3080058/coronavirus-china-launches-study-asymptomatic-cases-and-shared)
says [perhaps 60
percent](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3079012/coronavirus-68-cent-cases-confirmed-china-past-eight-days-had-no)
were. Our knowledge gaps are still wide enough to make epidemiologists
weep.

“All models are just models,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, science adviser to
the White House coronavirus task force, has said. “When you get new
data, you change them.”

There may be good news buried in this inconsistency: The virus may also
be mutating to cause fewer symptoms. In the movies, viruses become more
deadly. In reality, they usually become less so, because asymptomatic
strains reach more hosts. Even the 1918 Spanish flu virus eventually
[faded into the seasonal H1N1
flu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180813/).

No one knows exactly what percentage of Americans have been infected so
far — estimates have ranged from 3 percent to 10 percent — but it is
likely a safe bet that at least 300 million of us are still vulnerable.

Until a vaccine or another protective measure emerges, there is no
scenario, epidemiologists agreed, in which it is safe for that many
people to suddenly come out of hiding. If Americans pour back out in
force, all will appear quiet for perhaps three weeks.

Then the emergency rooms will get busy again.

“There’s this magical thinking saying, ‘We’re all going to hunker down
for a while and then the vaccine we need will be available,’” said Dr.
Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at
Baylor College of Medicine.

In his wildly popular March 19 article in Medium, “[Coronavirus: The
Hammer and the
Dance](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56),”
Tomas Pueyo correctly predicted the national lockdown, which he called
the hammer, and said it would lead to a new phase, which he called the
dance, in which essential parts of the economy could reopen, including
some schools and some factories with skeleton crews.

Every epidemiological model envisions something like the dance. Each
assumes the virus will blossom every time too many hosts emerge and
force another lockdown. Then the cycle repeats. On the models, the
[curves of rising and falling deaths resemble a row of shark
teeth](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf).

Surges are inevitable, the models predict, even when stadiums, churches,
theaters, bars and restaurants remain closed, all travelers from abroad
are quarantined for 14 days, and domestic travel is tightly restricted
to prevent high-intensity areas from reinfecting low-intensity ones.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The tighter the restrictions, experts say, the fewer the deaths and the
longer the periods between lockdowns. Most models assume states will
eventually do widespread temperature checks, rapid testing and contact
tracing, as is routine in Asia.

Even the [“Opening Up America Again”
guidelines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/) [Mr. Trump
issued on
Thursday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-guidelines.html)
have three levels of social distancing, and recommend that vulnerable
Americans stay hidden. The plan endorses testing, isolation and contact
tracing — but does not specify how these measures will be paid for, or
how long it will take to put them in place.

On Friday, none of that stopped the president from contradicting his own
message by [sending out tweets encouraging
protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-cases-news-update.html#link-23cd1c40)
in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia to fight their states’ shutdowns.

China did not allow Wuhan, Nanjing or other cities to reopen until
intensive surveillance found zero new cases [for 14 straight days, the
virus’s incubation
period](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-lockdown-lifted-intl-hnk/index.html).
Compared with China or Italy, the United States is still a playground.

Americans can take domestic flights, drive where they want, and roam
streets and parks. Despite restrictions, everyone seems to know someone
discreetly arranging play dates for children, holding backyard barbecues
or meeting people on dating apps.

Partly as a result, the country has [seen up to 30,000 new case
infections each
day](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/). “People
need to realize that it's not safe to play poker wearing bandannas,” Dr.
Schaffner said.

Even with rigorous measures, Asian countries have had trouble keeping
the virus under control.

Resolve to Save Lives, a public health advocacy group run by [Dr. Thomas
R. Frieden](https://resolvetosavelives.org/about/team/tom-frieden), the
former director of the C.D.C., has [published detailed and strict
criteria](https://vitalstrategies.zoom.us/rec/play/uJUkIe2t-m83SYeSsgSDA6UsW426e6qs1iBIq6Zeyk7kUHkCZlL0YLcSZOrv8sWG1OUPpKL9uf0WUssz?continueMode=true)

and when it must [be
closed](https://preventepidemics.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COV020_WhenHowTightenFaucet_v3.pdf).

Reopening requires declining cases for 14 days, the tracing of 90
percent of contacts, an end to health care worker infections,
recuperation places for mild cases and many other hard-to-reach goals.

“We need to reopen the faucet gradually, not allow the floodgates to
reopen,” Dr. Frieden said. “This is a time to work to make that day come
sooner.”

### Immunity will become a societal advantage.

Imagine an America divided into two classes: [those who have recovered
from infection with the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/coronavirus-survivors.html)
and presumably have some immunity to it; and those who are still
vulnerable.

“It will be a frightening schism,” Dr. David Nabarro, a World Health
Organization [special envoy on
Covid-19](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-on-21-february-2020),
predicted. “Those with antibodies will be able to travel and work, and
the rest will be discriminated against.”

Already, people with presumed immunity are very much in demand, [asked
to donate their blood for
antibodies](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=229963)
and doing risky medical jobs fearlessly.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Soon the government will have to invent a way to certify who is truly
immune. A test for IgG antibodies, which are produced once immunity is
established, would make sense, said Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, an expert on
pandemics at Georgetown University’s law school. Many companies are
working on them.

Dr. Fauci has said the [White House was discussing
certificates](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/10/fauci-coronavirus-immunity-cards-for-americans-are-being-discussed-178784)
like those [proposed in
Germany](https://www.newsweek.com/germany-antibodies-tests-general-public-immunity-certificates-1494934).
China [uses cellphone QR
codes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html)

The California adult-film industry [pioneered a similar idea a decade
ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/health/unlikely-model-for-hiv-prevention-porn-industry.html).
Actors use a cellphone app to prove they have tested H.I.V. negative in
the last 14 days, and producers can verify the information on a
password-protected website.

As Americans stuck in lockdown see their immune neighbors resuming their
lives and perhaps even taking the jobs they lost, it is not hard to
imagine the enormous temptation to join them through self-infection,
experts predicted. Younger citizens in particular will calculate that
risking a serious illness may still be better than impoverishment and
isolation.

“My daughter, who is a Harvard economist, keeps telling me her age group
needs to have Covid-19 parties to develop immunity and keep the economy
going,” said [Dr. Michele
Barry](https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/people/michele-barry), who
directs the Center for Innovation in Global Health at Stanford
University.

The comment, she explained later, was meant in jest. Still, it has
happened before.

In the 1980s, Cuba [successfully contained its small AIDS epidemic by
brutally
forcing](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/health/a-regimes-tight-grip-lessons-from-cuba-in-aids-control.html)
everyone who tested positive into isolation camps. Inside, however, the
residents had their own [bungalows, food, medical care, salaries,
theater troupes and art
classes](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/health/cubas-aids-sanitariums-fortresses-against-a-viral-foe.html).

Dozens of Cuba’s homeless youths [infected
themselves](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/health/cubas-aids-sanitariums-fortresses-against-a-viral-foe.html)
through sex or blood injections to get in, said Dr. Jorge Pérez Ávila,
an AIDS specialist who is Cuba’s version of Dr. Fauci. Many died before
antiretroviral therapy was introduced.

The next two years will proceed in fits and starts, experts said. As
more immune people get back to work, more of the economy will recover.

But if too many people get infected at once, new lockdowns will become
inevitable. To avoid that, widespread testing will be imperative.

Dr. Fauci has said “the virus will tell us” when it’s safe. He means
that once a national baseline of hundreds of thousands of daily tests is
established across the nation, any viral spread can be spotted when the
percentage of positive results rises.

Detecting rising fevers as they [are mapped by Kinsa’s smart
thermometers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-fever-thermometers.html)
may give an earlier signal, Dr. Schaffner said.

But diagnostic testing has been [troubled from the
beginning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html).
Despite assurances from the White House, doctors and patients [continue
to complain of delays and
shortages](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/health/coronavirus-testing-us.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To keep the virus in check, several experts insisted, the country also
must start isolating all the ill — including mild cases.

In this country, patients who test positive are asked to stay in their
homes but keep away from their families.

Television news has been filled with recuperating personalities like
CNN’s Chris Cuomo, sweating alone in his basement while his wife left
food atop the stairs, his children waved and the dogs hung back.

But even Mr. Cuomo ended up illustrating why the W.H.O. strongly opposes
home isolation. On Wednesday, he [revealed that his
wife](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/15/us/chris-cuomo-wife-coronavirus/index.html)
had the virus.

“If I was forced to select only one intervention, it would be the rapid
isolation of all cases,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, who led the [W.H.O.
observer team to
China](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).

In China, anyone testing positive, no matter how mild their symptoms,
was required to immediately enter an infirmary-style hospital — often
set up in a gymnasium or community center outfitted with oxygen tanks
and CT scanners.

There, they recuperated under the eyes of nurses. That reduced the risk
to families, and being with other victims relieved some patients’ fears.
Nurses even [led dance and exercise
classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7fqUHdoOyc) to raise spirits,
and help victims clear their lungs and keep their muscle tone.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, experts were divided on the idea of such wards. Dr. Fineberg
co-wrote [a New York Times Op-Ed
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/coronavirus-smart-quarantine.html)
calling for mandatory but “humane quarantine processes.”

By contrast, [Marc
Lipsitch](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/marc-lipsitch/), an
epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, opposed
the idea, saying: “I don’t trust our government to remove people from
their families by force.”

Ultimately, suppressing a virus requires [testing all the
contacts](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/a-national-plan-to-enable-comprehensive-COVID-19-case-finding-and-contact-tracing-in-the-US.pdf)
of every known case. But the United States is far short of that goal.

Someone working in a restaurant or factory may have dozens or even
hundreds of contacts. In China’s Sichuan Province, for example, each
known case [had an average
of 45](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)
contacts.

The C.D.C. [has about 600 contact
tracers](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/10/831200054/cdc-director-very-aggressive-contact-tracing-needed-for-u-s-to-return-to-normal)
and, until recently, state and local health departments [employed
about 1,600,](https://www.ncsddc.org/an-army-of-contact-tracers-will-bend-the-covid-19-curve/)
mostly for tracing syphilis and tuberculosis cases.

China hired and trained [9,000 in Wuhan
alone](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).
Dr. Frieden [recently estimated that the United States will
need](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/cdc-coronavirus.html)
at least
300,000.

Even though limited human trials of three candidates — two here and one
in China — have already begun, Dr. Fauci has repeatedly said that any
effort to make a vaccine will take at least a year to 18 months.

All the experts familiar with vaccine production agreed that even that
timeline was optimistic. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccinologist at the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that the [record is four
years](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html), for the
mumps vaccine.

Researchers differed sharply over what should be done to speed the
process. [Modern
biotechnology](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/health/coronavirus-vaccines.html)
techniques using RNA or DNA platforms make it possible to develop
candidate vaccines faster than ever before.

But clinical trials take time, in part because there is no way to rush
the production of antibodies in the human body.

Also, for unclear reasons, some previous vaccine candidates against
coronaviruses like SARS have triggered “antibody-dependent enhancement,”
which makes recipients more susceptible to infection, rather than less.
In the past, vaccines [against
H.I.V](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490694/)[.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443089/)and
[dengue](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(18\)30023-9/fulltext)
have unexpectedly done the same.

A new vaccine is usually first tested in fewer than 100 young, healthy
volunteers. If it appears safe and produces antibodies, thousands more
volunteers — in this case, probably front-line workers at the highest
risk — will get either it or a placebo in what is called a Phase 3
trial.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

It is possible to speed up that process with “challenge trials.”
Scientists vaccinate small numbers of volunteers, wait until they
develop antibodies, and then “challenge” them with a deliberate
infection to see if the vaccine protects them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Challenge trials are used only when a disease is completely curable,
such as malaria [or typhoid
fever](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/health/typhoid-vaccine-trial.html).
Normally, it is ethically unthinkable to challenge subjects with a
disease with no cure, such as Covid-19.

But in these abnormal times, several experts argued that putting a few
Americans at high risk for fast results could be more ethical than
leaving millions at risk for years.

“Fewer get harmed if you do a challenge trial in a few people than if
you do a Phase 3 trial in thousands,” said Dr. Lipsitch, who recently
published [a paper advocating challenge
trials](https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa152/5814216)
in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. Almost immediately, he said, he
heard from volunteers.

Others were deeply uncomfortable with that idea. “I think it’s very
unethical — but I can see how we might do it,” said Dr. Lucey.

The hidden danger of challenge trials, vaccinologists explained, is that
they recruit too few volunteers to show whether a vaccine creates
enhancement, since it may be a rare but dangerous problem.

“Challenge trials won’t give you an answer on safety,” said Michael T.
Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for
Infectious Disease Research and Policy. “It may be a big problem.”

Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School
of Public Health, suggested an alternative strategy. Pick at least two
vaccine candidates, briefly test them in humans and do challenge trials
in monkeys. Start making the winner immediately, even while widening the
human testing to look for hidden problems.

As arduous as testing a vaccine is, producing hundreds of millions of
doses is even tougher, experts said.

Most American vaccine plants produce only about 5 million to 10 million
doses a year, needed largely by the 4 million babies born and 4 million
people who reach age 65 annually, said Dr. R. Gordon Douglas Jr., a
former president of Merck’s vaccine division.

But if a vaccine is invented, the United States could need 300 million
doses — or 600 million if two shots are required. And just as many
syringes.

“People have to start thinking big,” Dr. Douglas said. “With that
volume, you’ve got to start cranking it out pretty soon.”

Flu vaccine plants are large, but those that grow the vaccines in
chicken eggs are not suitable for modern vaccines, which grow in cell
broths, he said.

European countries have plants but will need them for their own
citizens. China has a large vaccine industry, and may be able to expand
it over the coming months. It might be able to make vaccines for the
United States, experts said. But captive customers must pay whatever
price the seller asks, and the safety and efficacy standards [of some
Chinese companies are
imperfect](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/world/europe/coronavirus-antibody-test-uk.html).

India and Brazil also have large vaccine industries. If the virus moves
rapidly through their crowded populations, they may lose millions of
citizens but achieve widespread herd immunity well before the United
States does. In that case, they might have spare vaccine plant capacity.

Alternatively, suggested Arthur M. Silverstein, a retired medical
historian at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the government might
take over and sterilize existing liquor or beer plants, which have large
fermentation vats.

“Any distillery could be converted,” he
said.

### Treatments are likely to arrive first.

In the short term, experts were more optimistic about treatments than
vaccines. Several felt that so-called convalescent serum could work.

The basic technique has been used for over a century: Blood is drawn
from people who have recovered from a disease, then filtered to remove
everything but the antibodies. The antibody-rich immunoglobulin is
injected into patients.

The obstacle is that there are now relatively few survivors to harvest
blood from.

In the pre-vaccine era, antibodies were “farmed” in horses and sheep.
But that process was hard to keep sterile, and animal proteins sometimes
triggered allergic reactions.

The modern alternative is monoclonal antibodies. These treatment
[regimens](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/health/ebola-outbreak-cure.html),
which recently [came very close to
conquering](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/relief-ebola-outbreak-drc-declared-200410121800377.html)
the Ebola epidemic in eastern Congo, are the most likely short-term game
changer, experts said.

The most effective antibodies are chosen, and the genes that produce
them are spliced into a benign virus that will grow in a cellular broth.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But, as with vaccines, growing and purifying monoclonal antibodies takes
time. In theory, with enough production, they could be used not just to
save lives but to protect front-line workers.

Antibodies can last for weeks before breaking down — how long depends on
many factors, Dr. Silverstein noted — and they cannot kill virus that is
already hidden inside cells.

Having a daily preventive pill would be an even better solution, because
pills can be synthesized in factories far faster than vaccines or
antibodies can be grown and purified.

But even if one were invented, production would have to ramp up until it
was as ubiquitous as aspirin, so 300 million Americans could take it
daily.

Mr. Trump has mentioned hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin so often
that [his news conferences sound like
infomercials](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/health/coronavirus-drug-trump-hydroxycholoroquine.html).
But all the experts agreed with Dr. Fauci that no decision should be
made [until clinical trials are
completed.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/health/trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html)

Some recalled that in the 1950s inadequate testing of thalidomide caused
thousands of children [to be born with malformed
limbs](http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/themes/controversies/thalidomide).
More than one hydroxychloroquine study has been halted after patients
who got high doses [developed abnormal
heart](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/health/chloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html)
rhythms.

“I doubt anyone will tolerate high doses, and there are vision issues if
it accumulates,” Dr. Barry said. Others were just as harsh, especially
about Mr. Trump’s idea of combining a chloroquine with azithromycin.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s total nonsense,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, a former director of
medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council. “I
told my family, if I get Covid, do not give me this combo.”

Chloroquine might protect patients hospitalized with pneumonia against
lethal cytokine storms because it damps down immune reactions, several
doctors said.

That does not, however, make it useful for preventing infections, [as
Mr. Trump has implied it would
be](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2004/05/sitroom.02.html),
because it has no known antiviral properties.

Several antivirals, including remdesivir,
[favipiravir](https://www.scmp.com/tech/science-research/article/3051820/chinese-trials-gileads-antiviral-drug-treat-coronavirus-still)
and baloxavir, are being tested against the coronavirus; the latter two
are flu drugs.

Trials of various combinations in China are set to issue results by next
month, but they will be small and possibly inconclusive because doctors
there ran out of patients to test. End dates for most trials in the
United States are not yet
set.

### Goodbye, ‘America First.’

Stimulus checks, intended to offset the crisis, began landing in
checking accounts this week, making much of America, temporarily, a
welfare state. [Food banks are
opening](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/economy/coronavirus-food-banks.html)
across the country, and huge lines have formed.

A public health crisis of this magnitude requires international
cooperation on a scale not seen in decades. Yet Mr. Trump is [moving to
defund the
W.H.O.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-updates.html),
the only organization capable of coordinating such a response.

And he spent most of this year antagonizing China, which now has the
world’s most powerful functioning economy and may become the dominant
supplier of drugs and vaccines. China has used the pandemic to extend
its global influence, and says it has sent medical gear and equipment to
nearly 120 countries.

A major recipient is the United States, through Project Airbridge, an
air-cargo operation overseen by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

This is not a world in which “America First” is a viable strategy,
several experts noted.

“If President Trump cares about stepping up the public health efforts
here, he should look for avenues to collaborate with China and stop the
insults,” said Nicholas Mulder, an economic historian at Cornell
University. He has called Mr. Kushner’s project “Lend-Lease in reverse,”
a reference to American military aid to other countries during World War
II.

Dr. Osterholm was even blunter. “If we alienate the Chinese with our
rhetoric, I think it will come back to bite us,” he said.

“What if they come up with the first vaccine? They have a choice about
who they sell it to. Are we top of the list? Why would we be?”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Once the pandemic has passed, the national recovery may be swift. The
economy rebounded after both world wars, Dr. Mulder noted.

The psychological fallout will be harder to gauge. The isolation and
poverty caused by a long shutdown may drive up rates of [domestic
abuse](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/nyregion/new-york-city-domestic-violence-coronavirus.html),
[depression](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-depression-anxiety.html)
and
[suicide](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2764584).

Even political perspectives
[may](https://time.com/5674850/2020-election-demographics/) shift.
Initially, the virus heavily hit Democratic cities like Seattle, New
York and Detroit. But as it spreads through the country, it will spare
no one.

Even voters in Republican-leaning states who do not blame Mr. Trump for
America’s [lack of
preparedness](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html)
or for [limiting access to health
insurance](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/03/trump-obamacare-coronavirus-164285)
may change their minds if they see friends and relatives die.

In one of the most provocative analyses in his follow-up article,
“[Coronavirus: Out of Many,
One](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-out-of-many-one-36b886af37e9),”
Mr. Pueyo analyzed Medicare and census data on age and
[obesity](https://www.inverse.com/article/33016-trump-voters-more-likely-to-be-fat-no-college-education)
in [states that recently resisted
shutdowns](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-states-without-stay-home.html)
and counties that voted Republican in 2016.

He calculated that those voters could be 30 percent more likely to die
of the virus.

In the periods after both wars, Dr. Mulder noted, society and incomes
became more equal. Funds created for veterans’ and widows’ pensions led
to social safety nets, measures like the G.I. Bill and V.A. home loans
were adopted, unions grew stronger, and tax benefits for the wealthy
withered.

If a vaccine saves lives, many Americans may become less suspicious of
conventional medicine and more accepting of science in general —
including climate change, experts said.
