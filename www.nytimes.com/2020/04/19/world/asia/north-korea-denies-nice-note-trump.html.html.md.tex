SEOUL, South Korea --- North Korea on Sunday denied President Trump's
assertion that its leader,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/world/asia/kim-jong-un-absence-north-korea.html}{Kim
Jong-un}, had sent a letter to him, and suggested that Mr. Trump was
using his vaunted relationship with Mr. Kim for ``selfish purposes.''

Mr. Trump said the day before during his daily press briefing on the
coronavirus that he had received a ``nice note'' from Mr. Kim.

``I received a nice note from him recently. It was a nice note. I think
we're doing fine,'' Mr.
Trump\href{https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4869685/user-clip-mad-man}{told
reporters on Saturday} at the White House. He also claimed that the
United States would have been at war with North Korea had he not been
elected and played down the threat of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/world/asia/north-korea-fires-missiles.html}{short-range
missile tests} that North Korea has been conducting since March.

During a phone conversation with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea,
Mr. Trump also ​said he had received a ``warm letter'' from the North
Korean leader, Mr. Moon's aides told reporters on Sunday. But ​later
Sunday, ​the North's Foreign Ministry ​said, ``There was no letter
addressed recently to the U.S. president by the supreme leadership'' of
the North.

``He could have referred to the personal letters that had been exchanged
in the past, we are not sure,'' the ministry said in a statement carried
by the North's official news agency.

``We are about to look into the matter to see if the U.S. leadership
seeks anything in feeding the ungrounded story into the media,'' it
said, warning that the​ relationship between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump
should not ``be misused for meeting selfish purposes,'' or ``for
diversion.''

Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have in the past often praised their unusual
relationship. They exchanged a number of personal letters before and
after
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/north-korea-summit.html}{their
first summit} meeting, in Singapore in 2018, and at one point Mr. Trump
said he and Mr. Kim had fallen
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV6mVmAVQU4}{``in love.''}

Last month, North Korea
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/asia/coronavirus-north-korea-trump-kim.html}{revealed}
--- and the White House later confirmed --- that Mr. Trump had sent a
letter to Mr. Kim expressing his willingness to help the North battle
the coronavirus. North Korea has taken vigorous steps against the
pandemic, and claims it has not had a single
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html}{case
of Covid-19.}

Relations between Pyongyang and Washington have cooled since
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/world/asia/trump-kim-vietnam-summit.html}{the
leaders' second summit meeting,} in Vietnam in February 2019, collapsed
over differences regarding how quickly North Korea should dismantle its
nuclear weapons program and when Washington should ease sanctions
against the North.

Since then, Mr. Kim has repeatedly said that North Korea was no longer
interested in diplomacy with the United States unless it changed what he
called its hostile policy, including sanctions. North Korea has also
said the ``special personal relations'' between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump
were not enough to improve their countries' ties.
