<div class="css-53u6y8">

In January, at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, one diner infected with
the novel coronavirus but not yet feeling sick appeared to have spread
the disease to nine other people. One of the restaurant’s
air-conditioners apparently blew the virus particles around the dining
room.

There were 73 other diners who ate that day on the same floor of the
five-story restaurant, and the good news is they did not become sick.
Neither did the eight employees who were working on the floor at the
time.

Chinese researchers described the incident in [a paper that is to be
published in the July issue of the Emerging Infectious
Diseases](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article#comment),
a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The field study has limitations. The researchers, for example, did not
perform experiments to simulate the airborne transmission.

That outbreak illustrates some of the challenges that restaurants will
face when they try to reopen. Ventilation systems can create complex
patterns of airflow and keep viruses aloft, so simply spacing tables six
feet apart — the minimum distance that the C.D.C. advises you keep from
other people — may not be sufficient to safeguard restaurant patrons.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The social nature of dining out could increase the risk. The longer
people linger in a contaminated area, the more virus particles they
would likely inhale. Eating is also one activity that cannot be
accomplished while wearing a mask. Virus-laden droplets can be expelled
into the air [through breathing and talking, not just through coughs and
sneezes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/14/science/coronavirus-transmission-cough-6-feet-ar-ul.html).

As the C.D.C. now advises, “Avoid large and small gatherings in private
places and public spaces, such a friend’s house, parks, restaurants,
shops, or any other place.”

On the other hand, all of the people who became sick at the restaurant
in China were either at the same table as the infected person or at one
of two neighboring tables. The fact that people farther away remained
healthy is a hopeful hint that the coronavirus is primarily transmitted
through larger respiratory droplets, which fall out of the air more
quickly than smaller droplets known as aerosols, which can float for
hours.

“I think it’s a well-done study with the limitations of being a field
study,” said Werner E. Bischoff, the medical director of infection
prevention and health system epidemiology at the Wake Forest School of
Medicine in North Carolina. Dr. Bischoff was not involved with the
research.

On Jan. 24, a family went to lunch at the restaurant in Guangzhou, a
sprawling metropolis in southern China located 80 miles from Hong Kong.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The family had left Wuhan, 520 miles to the north and the hot spot of
the initial coronavirus outbreak, one day before Chinese officials
imposed a lockdown on the city and the surrounding province of Hubei to
slow the spread of the disease.

At lunch, the five members of the family — designated Family A in the
paper — appeared healthy. But later in the day, one of them, a
63-year-old woman, experienced a fever and a cough and went to the
hospital where she tested positive for the coronavirus.

Within two weeks, nine others who ate lunch on that floor of the
Guangzhou restaurant that day also tested positive. Four were relatives
of the first infected woman. They could have been infected outside of
the restaurant.

But for the other five, the restaurant appears to have been the source
of the virus.

Family A’s table was on the west side of the 1,500-square foot dining
room, between tables where two unrelated families, B and C, were also
having lunch. Family B and Family A overlapped for a period of 53
minutes, and three of its members — a couple and their daughter — became
sick. Family C sat next to Family A at the other neighboring table along
the same side the room, overlapping for 73 minutes, and two of its
members — a mother and her daughter — became
ill.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

An air-conditioning unit next to Family C blew air in the southward
direction across all three tables; some of the air likely bounced off
the wall, back in the direction of Family C.

Because the coronavirus had not yet spread widely beyond Wuhan, public
health officials were able to trace the recent contacts of Families B
and C and determine that the restaurant was the only likely place where
they would have crossed paths with the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The researchers did not state in the paper whether any of the other
diners who did not contract the coronavirus were members of the three
affected families or if they were all customers at 12 other tables. The
73 people were quarantined for 14 days and did not develop symptoms.

“We conclude that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by
air-conditioned ventilation,” the authors wrote. “The key factor for
infection was the direction of the airflow.”

Harvey V. Fineberg, who leads the Standing Committee on Emerging
Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, described the report as
“provocative and eye-opening.”

He said restaurants should be mindful of the direction of airflow in
arranging tables. Germicidal ultraviolet lights could also be installed
to destroy floating virus particles, Dr. Fineberg said. And the paper’s
findings could have implications beyond restaurants.

“It’s illuminating for the kind of thing we need to keep learning about
as we try to configure safe work spaces,” Dr. Fineberg said. “Not just
safe restaurant and entertainment venues but where you go to work.”
