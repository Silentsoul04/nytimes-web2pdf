\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Ann Sullivan, who applied her refined brush and palette as an animator
to latter-day Disney classics like
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/15/movies/review-film-andersen-s-mermaid-by-way-of-disney.html}{The
Little Mermaid},''
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/15/movies/review-film-the-hero-within-the-child-within.html}{The
Lion King}'' and
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/21/movies/film-review-escaping-deep-space-exile-and-making-friends-in-hawaii.html}{Lilo
\& Stitch},'' died on April 13 at the \href{https://mptf.com/}{Motion
Picture and Television Fund} retirement home in Woodland Hills, Calif.
She was 91.

Her daughter Shannon Jay said the cause was Covid-19.

Ms. Sullivan was the third of four people at the home who have died from
the coronavirus, according to a fund representative. More than
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html}{7,000
people have die}d of the disease in care facilities around the United
States.

Ms. Sullivan began bringing cartoons to life at Walt Disney's animation
studios in the 1950s, working on films like ``Peter Pan'' (1953) before
giving up her job to care for her children.

She returned to animation in 1973, first working for Hanna-Barbera and
later rejoined Disney. She worked on Disney films like ``Oliver \&
Company'' (1988), ``Pocahontas'' (1995) and ``Hercules'' (1997) as well
as films released by other studios, like ``Cool World'' (1992) and ``The
Pagemaster''(1994).

Sara Ann McNeese was born on April 10, 1929, in Fargo, N.D., to Thomas
and Helen (Kossick) McNeese. Her father was an accountant, and her
mother was a stenographer. Ann graduated from Catholic school and
attended North Dakota State University before moving to California,
where she studied at what is now the ArtCenter College of Design in
Pasadena.

She started working for Disney soon after graduation, at first in the
studio's vast paint lab.

She married Kevin Sullivan in the early 1950s. Their marriage ended in
divorce in the 1970s.

In addition to her daughter Shannon, she is survived by another
daughter, Liz McCrary; two sons, Joe and Tom; eight grandchildren; and
four great-grandchildren.

Ms. Sullivan, an avid painter, taught art to neighborhood children near
the family's home in La Mirada, in Los Angeles County, and was a member
of the \href{https://malibuartassociation.com/}{Malibu Art Association},
her daughter Shannon said.

Among the subjects Ms. Sullivan tackled were landscapes of the
California coastline, portraits of family members and Jimi Hendrix, and
a semiabstract rendition of the Disney characters Goofy and Daisy Duck,
which hung in her bedroom.

Susan C. Beachy contributed research.
