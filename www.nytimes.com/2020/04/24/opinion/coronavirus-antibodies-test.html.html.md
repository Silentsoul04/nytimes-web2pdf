My first reaction to the news that the coronavirus seems to have spread
more widely than initially understood — potentially to [20 percent of
New York City
residents](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html),
for example — was optimism.

If more people have had the virus, it means that its death rate is
lower. That’s just math. We have a decent idea of how many people [have
died](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) from the virus. If the total
pool of people who have had it is larger than the early estimates
suggested, the chances that any individual patient will die from it are,
by definition, smaller — closer to about 0.5 percent on average, instead
of 3 or 4 percent, as initially seemed possible.

But as I spent some time talking to public health experts yesterday, my
optimism faded. The new statistics still suggest that the overall death
toll could be catastrophic, and on the high end of the range of the
[various statistical
models](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/14/coronavirus-models-ihme-ic/).

How could that be? There are two main reasons.

One, the fact that more people may have already had the virus also
suggests that it’s more contagious than the initial numbers suggested —
that any one person with the virus tends to pass it to a greater number
of others. And if it’s more contagious, it may be harder to contain in
coming months. As society begins to reopen, the virus could spread more
quickly. The number of Americans who get it before a vaccine is
developed would then be larger.

Two, even if the death rate is lower than feared, it’s still very high.
“It is still, with these new findings, many times more deadly than
influenza,” [Caitlin
Rivers](https://twitter.com/cmyeaton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor),
an epidemic researcher at Johns Hopkins University, told me. The best
current guess is that the death rate for coronavirus is about five times
higher than that of seasonal influenza.

A few basic calculations show how scary a 0.5 percent death rate is. If
about one in three Americans ultimately get the virus — or 110 million
people — more than 500,000 would die. If 200 million people get it, 1
million would die.

[Ezekiel
Emanuel](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/ezekiel-j-emanuel) of the
University of Pennsylvania pointed out to me that about 20 percent of
virus fatalities so far in the United States have been among people aged
between 35 and 64. If the total number of deaths ends up in the ranges
I’ve mentioned here, the virus could end up being the No. 1 killer of
people in that age group, surpassing both cancer and heart disease.

The latest news, Emanuel said, “doesn’t make any of the goals you want
to reach easier.”

As I’ve [written
before](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing.html),
it’s likely that we have a long and very difficult fight ahead of us.

  - [Jared
    Baeten](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/jared-baeten), a
    vice dean of the School of Public Health at the University of
    Washington, offered this perspective on the virus’s spread, in an
    email:

> It isn’t a surprise — the evidence has been growing for weeks that the
> number of infections, especially asymptomatic infections, is far
> greater than are being found through testing. Thus, the death rate is
> lower. That gives me a bit of optimism, at least for individuals who
> get a positive test. But, it doesn’t make me optimistic yet — there’s
> still a large fraction of the population out there who hasn’t been
> infected yet.

  - [Scott
    Gottlieb](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1251207647166160901)
    of the American Enterprise Institute, writing about two studies that
    suggested a wider than expected spread of infections [in
    California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/health/coronavirus-antibodies-california.html):
    “This probably aligns with what overall national exposure may be, on
    order of about 5 percent once we do wide serology … The data so far
    suggest that nationally, total exposure is still low.”
