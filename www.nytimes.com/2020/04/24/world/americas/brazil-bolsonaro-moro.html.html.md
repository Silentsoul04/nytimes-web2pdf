RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s justice minister, Sergio Moro, a former
federal judge who became the face of a powerful anti-corruption
crackdown that swept Latin America, resigned Friday after accusing
President Jair Bolsonaro of seeking to assert improper control of the
federal police for political gain.

The resignation of Mr. Moro, one of Brazil’s most [popular
politicians](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/world/americas/brazil-judge-lula-bolsonaro.html),
set off a political uproar in Brazil, as critics across the political
spectrum accused the president of having undermined a key pillar of
democracy.

In his resignation speech, Mr. Moro delivered an extraordinary parting
rebuke, recounting in great detail a conversation during which he failed
to persuade the president not to follow through on his plan to fire the
federal police chief, Maurício Valeixo, who was forced to step down
Friday morning.

Brazil’s attorney general, Augusto Aras, later on Friday asked the
[Supreme Court to open an
investigation](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpf.mp.br%2Fpgr%2Fnoticias-pgr%2Faugusto-aras-solicita-inquerito-ao-stf-para-apurar-fatos-narrados-e-declaracoes-de-sergio-moro%2F)
into the outgoing minister’s account.

Mr. Moro’s acrimonious departure was a volatile and unexpected
development in Brazil, where the rapid spread of the coronavirus has
overwhelmed hospitals and roiled the political establishment. Mr.
Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the gravity of the virus, last week [fired
his health
minister](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/04/16/world/americas/ap-lt-virus-outbreak-brazil-health-minister.html)
after the two clashed over strict quarantine measures to slow the
contagion.

*\[Read:* [*Hidden toll: Mexico ignores wave of coronavirus deaths in
capital*](http://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/world/americas/mexico-coronavirus-count.html)*.\]*

Mr. Moro was [the eighth
minister](https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/04/24/veja-os-ministros-que-sairam-do-governo-bolsonaro.ghtml?utm_source=push&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=pushg1)
to leave Mr. Bolsonaro’s cabinet during the 15 months he has been in
office.

“Moro’s resignation is a seismic event in Brazilian politics,” said
Ilona Szabó, the executive director of Igarapé Institute, which studies
public safety in Brazil. “His departure signals a dangerous new phase
for Brazil.”

Ms. Szabó called the president’s move a “coup against democracy because
the autonomy of the federal police is an essential foundation for
democratic governance.”

In his resignation speech, Mr. Moro said Mr. Bolsonaro had confided that
he wanted a police chief he could call directly and count on to obtain
sensitive investigative information and intelligence dossiers.

The request came as [several

of the president — including two of his sons — are under criminal
investigation by the federal police and the Supreme
Court.

Speaking Friday at the Justice Ministry, Mr. Moro provided a politically
damaging account of his final substantive conversation with the
president, which took place on Thursday.

“The president said more than once, expressly, that he wanted a person
he could be in touch with personally, whom he could call directly, from
whom he could receive information, intelligence reports,” Mr. Moro said,
describing the kind of relationship Mr. Bolsonaro wanted with a new
police chief.

Although Mr. Moro said he had urged Mr. Bolsonaro to reconsider the
implications of his plan, the president was determined, Mr. Moro added,
to have a federal police chief who would do his bidding.

Mr. Moro said that the president was “worried about pending cases before
the Supreme Court,” and that the change at the federal police “would
also be helpful in that sense.”

After Mr. Moro spoke, the attorney general, Mr. Aras, [issued a
statement](http://www.mpf.mp.br/pgr/noticias-pgr/augusto-aras-solicita-inquerito-ao-stf-para-apurar-fatos-narrados-e-declaracoes-de-sergio-moro/)that
the conduct described, if true, suggested Mr. Bolsonaro had broken
numerous laws, including ones against corruption and obstruction of
justice. If Mr. Moro’s account were to turn out false, Mr. Aras added,
the minister would have committed the crime of making a “slanderous
accusation.”

In Brazil, the attorney general is appointed by the president, and the
office is independent of the Justice Ministry.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bolsonaro fired back at Mr. Moro in a lengthy, angry televised
address on Friday afternoon.

“I never asked to have any member of my family shielded,” Mr. Bolsonaro
said, referring to Mr. Moro’s clear implication that the firing of the
police chief was done in part to help protect his sons

Mr. Bolsonaro accused Mr. Moro of being vain, self-interested and
dishonest.

The president also asserted that he was empowered to hire and fire
department heads at will.

“I don’t need to ask for permission from anyone to replace a director or
anyone else,” Mr. Bolsonaro said in the rambling address, in which he
also spoke of the heating system of the presidential palace’s pool,
corporate credit cards and plastic surgery, without explaining how they
were relevant to Mr. Moro’s ouster.

Brazil’s federal law-enforcement agencies were given a tremendous degree
of independence when the country’s 21-year period of military rule ended
in the late 1980s.

Mr. Moro called the president’s dismissal of Mr. Valeixo a clear breach
of a condition he set when he accepted the ministry. Mr. Moro said the
president had promised him “carte blanche” in making critical
law-enforcement appointments and safeguarding the political independence
of institutions under his command.

“I cannot stay on without being able to preserve the autonomy of the
federal police,” Mr. Moro said. Failing to resign, he added, “would
signal agreement with interference in the federal police that stands to
have unpredictable consequences.”

Mr. Valeixo is a veteran federal police official who worked closely with
Mr. Moro in corruption investigations.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In joining his cabinet, Mr. Moro took a widely criticized gamble by
leaving a 22-year judgeship to enter the political arena, which called
into question the integrity of his work on the bench.

Mr. Moro, 47, was the most visible leader of a sprawling corruption
investigation known as Car Wash that began in Brazil in 2014 and rippled
[across the
region](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/americas/peru-colombia-venezuela-brazil-odebrecht-scandal.html),
leading to the imprisonment of presidents and powerful business
moguls.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

The most high-profile defendant Mr. Moro convicted as part of that
operation was [former
President](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/world/americas/brazil-lula-surrenders-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer)
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was found guilty of money laundering and
corruption in July 2017. That outcome thwarted Mr. da Silva’s bid to
seek a third presidential term at a time when he was the front-runner.

Mr. Moro’s conduct in that prosecution came under scrutiny after the
Intercept Brasil, an online news site, published articles last year
based on [leaked private
messages](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/americas/brazil-car-wash-lava-jato.html)
from the hacked phones of federal prosecutors. Those messages made clear
Mr. Moro broke ethical and legal rules by providing strategic guidance
to prosecutors.

Mr. Moro’s resignation deepens Mr. Bolsonaro’s political isolation as he
steers a [public health
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus.html)
that has plunged Brazil into a new economic plight.

Mr. Bolsonaro has come under withering criticism for minimizing the
seriousness of the coronavirus, which is spreading at an accelerated
rate and overwhelming hospitals in several Brazilian states.

The president has called the virus a “measly cold” that doesn’t warrant
quarantine measures detrimental to the labor market and economic growth.

That view has sparked daily protests and a movement in Congress to
impeach him.

The Social Liberal Party, or P.S.L., a right-wing party Mr. Bolsonaro
joined to run for president, issued a statement calling the events that
led to Mr. Moro’s departure deeply disturbing and likely criminal. Mr.
Bolsonaro left the party in November after fighting with former allies.

The P.S.L. called the “unjustified dismissal” of the police chief a
“clear form of political interference by President Jair Bolsonaro in
the fight against organized crime that not only breaks with his campaign
promises, but amounts to a series of crimes of responsibility, including
obstruction of justice.”

Joice Hasselmann, a lawmaker from São Paulo who led the push on Mr.
Bolsonaro’s agenda in Congress until October, accused the president on
Friday of seeking to shield his sons from criminal investigations.

“The president is trying to meddle with the leadership of the federal
police to prevent it from doing the work they need to do,” she said. “So
that they don’t get to his sons.”

Mr. Bolsonaro’s son Flávio Bolsonaro, a senator, is under investigation
for allegedly skimming off the salaries of some public employees in his
former office as a state lawmaker in Rio de Janeiro. Flávio Bolsonaro
has denied wrongdoing.

According to news reports, another son, Carlos Bolsonaro, a state
lawmaker,[is among the targets of an
investigation](https://istoe.com.br/pf-teria-identificado-carlos-bolsonaro-como-mentor-de-fake-news-contra-stf/)
by the Supreme Court into defamatory misinformation campaigns conducted
online.

During his resignation speech, Mr. Moro recounted his legacy as a judge
and presented himself as a law-abiding public servant who would find
other ways to serve Brazilians in the future.

“What he was trying to do was maintain some of the political capital he
has gained,” said Malu Gatto, an assistant professor of Latin American
politics at University College London. “And distance himself from a
president that seems to be increasingly toxic.”
