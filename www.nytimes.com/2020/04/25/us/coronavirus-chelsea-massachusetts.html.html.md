# In a Crowded City, Leaders Struggle to Separate the Sick From the Well

Chelsea, Mass., has an infection rate higher than any other community in
the state. With families in cramped housing, it is difficult to contain
the spread.

CHELSEA, Mass. — Paul Nowicki, the director of operations for the
housing authority in this small, crowded immigrant city, walked the
halls of the Buckley Apartments last week in a plastic face shield and
white gown, trying to stop an invisible predator.

Chelsea is the epicenter of [the coronavirus crisis in
Massachusetts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/massachusetts-coronavirus-cases.html),
with rates of infection that surged last week to 3,841 per 100,000
people, around [six times the statewide
average](https://www.mass.gov/doc/confirmed-covid-19-cases-in-ma-by-citytown-january-1-2020-april-22-2020-pdf/download).
And officials fear the virus is still spreading.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Take Mr. Nowicki: There were nine confirmed cases of the virus in the
Buckley Apartments, tucked among eight floors of public housing. Mr.
Nowicki had ordered waves of deep-cleaning, wiping of railings and
elevator buttons. He watched the residents shuffle in and out of the
lobby, mostly grandparents, fragile and disabled. It was his job to
safeguard them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But how could he do that when, because of medical privacy laws, he did
not know where the nine infected people lived? “It’s the specificity of
the floor you’d like to know,” Mr. Nowicki said. “Like, are the cases on
the 7th floor or the 9th floor? Are all the infections on one floor? Or
is it spread along all the floors? You’d like to know.”

He is not the only one. Residents call Mr. Nowicki’s wife, Tracy, the
city’s director of elder services, demanding to know who in their
building is positive, and she gently deters them.

“They want to make sure they don’t knock on their door,” she said. “I
totally understand that. I totally understand why the residents that are
still healthy want to stay that way.”

As the virus spreads through American communities, many leaders will
face the same stubborn challenge: How, in a country that values its
citizens’ medical privacy and autonomy, can authorities separate the
sick from the well?

The question is an urgent one if public life is to resume.

Chinese cities solved this problem by giving infected people no choice.
In the city of Wuhan, authorities realized that social distancing was
not enough to [rapidly bring the virus's reproduction rate down to near
zero](https://threader.app/thread/1251276061398220800), which they felt
was necessary to reopen schools and businesses.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Household transmission represented the bulk of new cases. So when people
had mild symptoms, or were known to have been exposed, they were
[removed to vast quarantine
centers](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/isolate-isolate-isolate-chinas-approach-covid-19-quarantine/).
There, they were medically monitored and provided with food, until two
successive tests showed they were not infectious.

Two months of this regimen brought the number of new confirmed cases to
nearly zero, said [Xihong
Lin](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-rvZs0zsXF_0Tw8TNsBxKH4V1LQQXq7Az9kDfCgZDfE/edit#slide=id.p1),
a biostatistician at Harvard’s [T.H. Chan School of Public
Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/xihong-lin/). But the United
States, she said, will have to encourage sick people to separate from
family
voluntarily.

“Western countries are different from Asian countries,” she said. “One
cannot force people to do things.”

Chelsea, a city of 40,000 people crammed into less than two square
miles,[has 1,447 confirmed
cases,](https://www.mass.gov/doc/confirmed-covid-19-cases-in-ma-by-citytown-january-1-2020-april-22-2020-pdf/download)
according to state data, by far the highest rate in Massachusetts.

And those confirmed cases represent only the tip of an iceberg. Last
weekend, when researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital [conducted
antibodies tests on 200 apparently healthy pedestrians in Chelsea,
selected at
random,](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/17/business/nearly-third-200-blood-samples-taken-chelsea-show-exposure-coronavirus/)
nearly [a third of them tested
positive](http://chelsearecord.com/2020/04/23/mgh-researcher-finds-interesting-results-here/),
suggesting that many had been infected without knowing it.

“They may infect other people around them who are high risk,” said John
Iafrate, vice chairman of Massachusetts General’s pathology department
and [the study’s principal
investigator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLQ9Alai5Ps). “That is a
very, very serious infection control issue.”

This month, city officials began offering people who tested positive for
the virus the option of moving into a 157-room hotel in nearby Revere,
to avoid infecting their family members or housemates. Ten days later,
though, only 14 people from Chelsea are staying there.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We were expecting the floodgates to open,” said Alexander Train, the
assistant director of the city’s Department of Planning and Development.
He said undocumented immigrants may be afraid to take advantage of the
offer, fearing it would lead to deportation.

“I think there is some uncertainty and anxiety that is inhibiting the
flow of guests to the hotel, because it is attributed to the
government,” he said. “It’s about, ‘what if I don’t make it back to my
family?’”

Most people, given a choice, will stay home, despite the risk of
infection, said Roy Avellaneda, the City Council president, who said he
tried in vain to persuade an employee at the restaurant he runs, who
risked infecting her family members, to check into a hotel.

“For all the love we have in this country,” Mr. Avellaneda said, “the
reason we’re probably going to be hit sicker is that we still have a
government that cannot make those decisions for the benefit of its
residents.”

## ‘The Air Would Have Been Contaminated’

Separated from Boston by the Mystic River, Chelsea is a world apart, a
first stop for immigrant families — Lithuanian, Polish, Irish, and more
recently Honduran and Guatemalan — who cannot afford the bigger city’s
sky-high rents.

It has a population density of nearly 17,000 people per square mile,
with whole families crowding into single rooms in triple-decker
rowhouses, buildings with high rates of lead paint, asbestos and air
pollution.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Katharine Robb, a researcher at the Harvard Kennedy School who spent a
summer following housing inspectors in Chelsea, was [stunned by what she
found](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/40976724) — families living on
porches, in unfinished basements or even closets, without access to
running water, heat or sanitation.

“I didn’t think conditions like this were happening in the 21st
century,” she said. “It reminded me of stories I heard of the late
1800s, at the beginning of sanitary reform, at the beginning of
urbanization.”

This spring, the fast-spreading virus collided disastrously with the
city’s overcrowded housing. A warning flare came in the second week of
April, when, late at night, a young mother called the city housing
authority from the street; she had disclosed her test results to her
roommates, and they had kicked her out. “It dawned on me that this
situation was going to replicate itself,” said Thomas Ambrosino,
Chelsea’s city manager, “and we better have a solution.”

Over the weeks that came after, some of the sick isolated themselves.
One man, worried about infecting his family, slept in his car for two
days, until his relatives sought help from the city.

Gladys Vega, a longtime community activist, helped a man who had been
banished to a freezing, unfinished dirt basement, where he was riding
out the illness on a piece of cardboard. Another man had been sent to
sleep on a porch, despite temperatures that still dropped below freezing
at night.

“People are being treated as if they have leprosy,” said Ms. Vega,
[executive director of the Chelsea
Collaborative.](https://www.chelseacollab.org/meet-the-team-1)

Others did their best to ride out the virus in small spaces. Marisol
Lima, 35, was eight days from her move-out date, in the tiny room she
rented from a Colombian family, when she noticed that her downstairs
neighbor was coughing. Within days, six of the seven people in the
apartment were seriously ill, feverish, breathing with difficulty.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“I think it was impossible not to get the virus,” she said. “It was a
very small living space. The air would have been
contaminated.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Wendy Rosales, a restaurant kitchen manager, discovered she had the
virus when she went to the doctor for an earache, and tried to isolate
from her husband and daughters by staying in a bedroom. But the room had
no lock and her three-year-old toddled into the room any time her
father’s attention drifted, running to hug her mother. When Ms.
Rosales pushed her out and shut the door, the girl would stand outside,
crying.

“I didn’t sleep,” she said. “I spent almost the whole night thinking
what to do, and thinking about the little one — she’s young and doesn’t
understand what’s
happening.”

## A Safety Valve

The opening of the Quality Inn in Revere last week provided the city
with a safety valve. Those who checked in would get three meals a day
and medical monitoring, but would not be allowed to leave their rooms,
or leave until cleared by medical staff.

Ms. Rosales was one of the first to check in.

After her night of crying, she stuffed a few possessions into a backpack
and left home without saying goodbye, or even looking back. [Now in her
seventh day at the Quality
Inn](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/contact-tracing-deployed-in-effort-to-fight-coronavirus/),
she is both intensely homesick and intensely relieved.

“I was terrified I was going to infect them,” she said. “It was the best
decision.”

But many in the city are choosing to ride out the illness at home.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Mr. Ambrosino, the city manager, it is part of a bigger problem for
the city of Chelsea: Infected people must be persuaded to take difficult
steps — like social distancing and isolating in the hotel — themselves.
“We’re not going to engage in violent physical sealing of doors,
that’s not how we operate in the U. S. of A.,” he said.

He said compliance rates were very good, as high as 95 percent, but that
left a significant number to spread the virus.” If the compliance rates
were 95 percent, that means that I have 2,000 nitwits out on the
street,” he said.

Another obstacle, he said, are medical privacy laws that can prevent the
city’s public health staff from disclosing who, in this crowded city,
has tested positive.

“She can’t call me and say, ‘I’ve got someone in Unit 6 who is
positive,’” Mr. Ambrosino said. “I can’t know their names or
addresses. She can say, ‘the city is ready to help you, call this help
line,’ but if that person doesn’t call, because they don’t understand,
or they’re afraid of the government, there is no way for us to help
them.”

“Unless someone tells us they’re Covid-19 positive, I have no way of
knowing,” he said.

And many sick people are withholding their status out of fear. Earlier
this month, Maria Belen Power,[a community
activist](http://www.greenrootschelsea.org/team), found herself begging
an undocumented friend, Floridalma Ochoa, to call 911. Ms. Power was
weeping; her friend had spent the night gasping for air.

“They just didn’t want to call, because they were afraid,” said Ms.
Power, associate executive director of
[GreenRoots](http://www.greenrootschelsea.org/), an environmental
justice organization. “She kept saying, ‘but what if they ask me for
papers?’ Honestly, I thought she could die. I was saying, ‘You have to
call. You’re losing time.”

Ms. Lima, who was infected by one of her roommates, said many people she
knows don’t want to reveal that they have the illness. “Fear exists
heavily among the Latino people,” she said. “A lot of people do not want
to speak, or even accept that they are sick, because they are scared of
how the rest of the people will look at them.”

And many simply cannot fathom leaving sick relatives alone. Ruth
Gabriela Santos, 34, is counting the days until her mother, Ms. Ochoa,
is released from the hospital. She has been on a respirator for three
weeks, a period during which the city was transformed.

“The impact is terrible,” said Ms. Santos. “Knowing you are at the
epicenter, looking around and realizing how many people have died. And
that the numbers of infections are not only increasing, but doubling and
tripling. Learning that people you’ve known your whole life are
infected.”

Bringing her mother home, into a four-room apartment with eight other
people, comes with the risk that she is contagious. But Ms. Santos
cannot bear to think of her mother’s loneliness if she should be moved
to the hotel. She wants to cook for her.

“Our parents had their time,” Ms. Santos said. “They gave everything to
us. Now it is my time to return it, and take care of them.”
