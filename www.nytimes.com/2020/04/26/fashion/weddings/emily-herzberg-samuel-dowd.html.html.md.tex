Dr. Emily Marie Herzberg and Samuel William Dowd were married April 25
at the home of the groom's parents in Dennis, Mass. The groom's father,
William F. Dowd, officiated, having received permission from the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to solemnize the marriage.

The couple had planned to be married at the Dennis Inn, which is also in
Dennis, on the same date, but altered their plans because of the
coronavirus pandemic. Instead, they will celebrate their marriage there
on Nov. 14, exchanging their wedding vows again before friends and
family.

Dr. Herzberg, 34, is a chief fellow in neonatal-perinatal medicine at
Boston Children's Hospital. She graduated and received a medical degree
from Georgetown.

She is a daughter of Mary Christenson Herzberg of Winnetka, Ill., and
Michael A. Herzberg of New York. The bride's father is an independent
investment manager in New York. Her mother was a stay-at-home parent and
is now a substitute teacher for the public schools of Winnetka.

Mr. Dowd, 31, is a product manager, overseeing the software component of
the program that brings international high school students to study in
an American public or private school through EF Education First, a Swiss
company; he works in the company's Cambridge, Mass., office. He
graduated from Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., and received
a master's degree in education technology from Framingham State
University and a master's degree in management from Harvard.

He is also a son of Kelli J Richardson. The groom's mother was a
stay-at-home parent. His father retired as a senior vice president for
human resources at National Grid, the utility company; he worked in
Waltham, Mass.

The couple met in 2018 through the dating app Bumble and had their first
date at a restaurant in Boston. On their second and third dates, the two
began and finished answering

questions that lead to love,''} which, Dr. Herzberg said, apparently
worked.
