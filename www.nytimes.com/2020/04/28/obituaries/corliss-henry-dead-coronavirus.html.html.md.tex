\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

If Corliss Henry spent time assessing her perpetual role as a
trailblazer, she largely kept it to herself.

She was one of the few black students at Hunter College High School in
the 1940s, then an all-girls school on Manhattan's Upper East Side. She
became, in 1957, the first black nurse on staff at Muhlenberg Hospital
in Plainfield, N.J., where her husband was the first black person on the
sales floor of any store downtown.

Mrs. Henry died on April 14 at Overlook Medical Center in Summit, N.J.
She was 95. The cause was the novel coronavirus, her son Steve said.

She was born in Manhattan on Sept. 10, 1924, to Kenneth and Ethel
Taylor, who were immigrants from Jamaica.

Throughout the 1920s, the family shuttled between Jamaica and New York
City, settling in Harlem in 1936 in an elegant house with wood paneling,
fireplaces and a curved banister she was charged with polishing. But the
house was soon lost to unpaid debts.

``She remembered standing with her mother and siblings on the sidewalk
surrounded by their belongings, locked out of the house,'' Mr. Henry
said. They then moved to the Bronx.

Mrs. Henry graduated from Hunter in 1942, and worked briefly in a
factory in the Bronx as a solderer. Later that year, she applied to a
federal program at the Harlem Hospital School of Nursing for black
nurses, who had few opportunities to study in the field.

Her first job was at Harlem Hospital and after marrying Preston Henry,
she moved to Plainfield. When she was being considered for a job at
Muhlenberg Hospital, the board of directors was required to hold a
special meeting, said her son Bruce Henry. ``In the mid 50s there were
very few things that women of color were allowed to do,'' he said. ``The
fact that she was able to become a nurse, that was something to be proud
of.''

She earned a master's degree in education at New York University and
remained at Muhlenberg until 1968, when she took a job as an instructor
at Middlesex County College's nursing program in Edison, N.J., where she
later became an associate professor and teacher's union representative.
She retired in 1991.

Her husband died in 2012, and she is survived by her sons. A previous
marriage, to Harold Wallace, in 1948 ended in divorce. Mr. Henry adopted
their son Bruce.

In 2018, Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey presented her with a Legacy
Award for her professional and lifetime achievements. ``She encountered
a lot of racism,'' Steve Henry said. ``She didn't take it home with her.
She left it at the door.''
