# Pence Tours Mayo Clinic and Flouts Its Rule That All Visitors Wear a Mask

</div>

The vice president, who leads the White House’s coronavirus task force,
said that masks were meant to prevent the spread of the virus and that
he was tested regularly and does not have it.

WASHINGTON — The Mayo Clinic, the renowned medical center in Minnesota,
has a clear policy in place during the coronavirus outbreak that any
visitor should wear a protective face mask.

But when a delegation of Trump administration officials arrived at the
clinic on Tuesday to thank the doctors there for their work on the
virus, one person decided to flout the rule: Vice President Mike Pence,
the chairman of the White House coronavirus task force.

Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration,
wore a mask as did other administration officials and members of the
clinic’s staff. Mr. Pence stood out as the only person with his face
uncovered as he toured the virology laboratory’s labeling area and spoke
to a clinic staff member who had recovered from the coronavirus. Mr.
Pence also participated in a round table with local officials and Gov.
Tim Walz of Minnesota, who were also wearing masks.

After his visit, the Mayo Clinic posted on Twitter that it had “informed
@VP of the masking policy prior to his arrival today.” The clinic then
deleted the tweet, with no explanation.

It was [the latest example of Mr. Pence’s refusal to don a face mask
even as he travels the
country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/coronavirus-masks.html)
representing the administration. This month, he was photographed
arriving in Colorado Springs and being greeted by the Democratic
governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, who wore a face mask emblazoned with
images from his state flag. Mr. Pence tapped elbows, but kept his face
bare.

Mr. Pence later defended his maskless appearance at the Mayo Clinic to
reporters.

“As vice president of the United States, I’m tested for the coronavirus
on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the
coronavirus,” he said. He added that he was following guidelines issued
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which indicate that a
face mask is effective in preventing the spread of the virus by those
who have it.

His aides in the past have said the guidelines were meant to protect
people from asymptomatic spread. Because Mr. Pence is tested regularly,
they said, he is not asymptomatic. Mr. Pence did not explain why he
chose not to honor the Mayo Clinic’s own guidelines for its facility.

But public health experts dismissed his argument for skipping a face
mask as faulty.

Even in coronavirus patients who show symptoms, diagnostic tests may
detect the virus only 75 percent of the time, said Dr. Mark Loeb, a
microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at McMaster University
in Ontario, Canada, and it is unclear how sensitive the tests are in
asymptomatic cases.

Mr. Pence was immediately rebuked by the administration’s critics.

American Bridge, a progressive group, called for Mr. Pence to be removed
from the coronavirus task force, which he oversees. “He just didn’t care
enough about the health and safety of doctors, nurses, and patients to
follow their guidance,” said Kyle Morse, a spokesman for the group.
“Pence, like Donald Trump, thinks the rules don’t apply to him.”

But he has one important ally — President Trump.

Mr. Trump has traveled only once since his administration released its
federal guidelines advising against unnecessary travel. But he has made
it clear, both in public and in private, that he believes face masks are
not necessary and does not plan to use one himself.

“Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators,
kings, queens — I don’t know,” he has said. “Somehow, I don’t see it for
myself.”
