\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Arlene Saunders, a charismatic soprano who was a fixture of opera
companies in New York and Hamburg, Germany, died on April 17 at the
Hebrew Home at Riverdale in the Bronx. She was 89.

Lisa A. Raskin, her stepdaughter, said the cause was complications of
Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Ms. Saunders was never wanting for praise for her musicianship, but she
rose to fame as an affecting performer with dramatic authority. As Eva
in Wagner's ``Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg'' at the Metropolitan
Opera,
\href{https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/04/04/139798682.pdf?pdf_redirect=true\&ip=0}{she
was described} in The New York Times as ``singing as easily as if she
were conversing.'' And The Times, writing about a stadium concert in
1963,
\href{https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/07/24/82081738.pdf?pdf_redirect=true\&ip=0}{said
she had} ``something rare and exciting in a soprano: a genuine flare.''

Arlene Pearl Soszynski was born on Oct. 5, 1930, in Cleveland to Walter
and Julia Soszynski. She grew up there and went to college at Baldwin
Wallace University in nearby Berea, Ohio.

Her career was sparked by two debuts in 1961, both as Mimì in Puccini's
``La Bohème'': at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan, and with New York City
Opera.

\href{https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/10/30/119426196.pdf?pdf_redirect=true\&ip=0}{The
Times's review} of the City Opera production began, ``Arlene Saunders is
a soprano who can sing beautifully, act effectively and illuminate any
operatic stage fortunate enough to be graced by her talents.'' She would
go on to star in more classics with the company, including Puccini's
``La Fanciulla del West,'' Bizet's ``Carmen'' and Mozart's ``Don
Giovanni.''

She continued to perform internationally in the 1960s, singing Pamina in
``The Magic Flute'' at the Glyndebourne Festival in Britain and becoming
a regular at the Hamburg State Opera --- where she performed in the
premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's ``Help, Help, the Globolinks!'' in 1968
and was honored with the title Kammersängerin.

When the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts opened in 1971,
\href{https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/09/19/91305513.pdf?pdf_redirect=true\&ip=0}{Ms.
Saunders starred in its inaugural opera}, Ginastera's ``Beatrix Cenci.''
She also made a belated debut with the Met that decade in
``Meistersinger.'' Her farewell came in 1985, in ``Der Rosenkavalier''
at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires.

In 1986, Ms. Saunders returned to New York and married Dr. Raymond A.
Raskin, who died in 2017. She is survived by her stepchildren, Ms.
Raskin and Dr. Jonathan M. Raskin, as well as two step-grandchildren.

Away from the stage, she was never far from opera. She led programs,
including one at New York University, and for most of the 1990s ran a
nonprofit group called Opera Mobilé, which packed a production of
``Pagliacci'' in a truck to be staged in parks throughout New York City.
