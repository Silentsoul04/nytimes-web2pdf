Haney was accused of verbal abuse and mistreatment of athletes, which
included forcing them to train through injuries.

Maggie Haney, an elite gymnastics coach in New Jersey who was accused of
verbally abusing and mistreating athletes, has been suspended from the
sport for eight years by U.S.A. Gymnastics after a weekslong
disciplinary hearing.

The accusations against Haney, which included forcing athletes to train
through injuries, were laid out in U.S.A. Gymnastics documents and
interviews with two people with knowledge of the hearing. The suspension
was confirmed by the federation in a statement on Wednesday night.

Haney, 42, owns MG Elite Gymnastics in Morganville, N.J., where until
recently she coached Riley McCusker, a member of the United States team
that won the 2018 world championship. Laurie Hernandez, a 2016 Olympian,
also used to train under Haney in the New Jersey gym.

Haney has had at least one athlete on the junior or senior national team
every year since 2013.

At least six families made accusations about abuse, according to Karen
Goeller, another gymnastics coach in New Jersey and one of the two
people who provided information about the effort to discipline Haney.
Goeller submitted one of the formal complaints against Haney last May.
The other person requested anonymity to discuss the delicate topic.

U.S.A. Gymnastics said that an independent hearing panel composed of
three members of the gymnastics community --- a lawyer, a club owner,
and a former national team athlete --- had determined that Haney would
be barred from membership in the federation ``and any coaching of U.S.A.
Gymnastics athletes or in member clubs.''

A two-year probationary period is to follow the suspension. After that
Haney will be allowed to reapply for membership after submitting proof
that she has completed specified courses overseen by the United States
Center for SafeSport, the organization that investigates incidents of
misconduct in Olympic sports.

Haney did not respond immediately to a request for comment, but Russell
Prince, a lawyer representing her, said they disagreed with the hearing
panel's findings.

``We don't think that it in any way, shape or form evaluated all of the
facts of the circumstances,'' Prince said. ``The process is completely
heavy-handed. I would anticipate an arbitration.''

Judie Saunders, a lawyer representing Hernandez and some of the other
gymnasts in the case, said the penalties against Haney were ``a micro
step in the right direction for how athletes are treated in the
hypercompetitive world of sports.''

Haney's suspension is the latest turbulence in a period of upheaval for
U.S.A. Gymnastics after revelations that Lawrence G. Nassar, a national
team doctor, had sexually abused hundreds of athletes. The organization
has filed for bankruptcy and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/sports/USA-gymnastics-nassar.html}{offered
\$217 million to settle legal claims} brought by athletes molested by
Nassar, who in 2018 received prison sentences of up to 175 years.

The disciplinary hearing for Haney began on Feb. 3. She received an
interim suspension that day barring her from contact with minors in the
sport.

Concerns about the practices of Victoria Levine, an assistant MG Elite
coach who is partial owner of the gym where the team trains, were raised
during the hearing. Levine received an interim suspension on March 17
that barred her from unsupervised contact with minors.

The gym is currently closed because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Goeller has trained both current and former MG Elite athletes at a gym
she rents. She said she became aware of concerns about Haney's methods a
year ago, when six families she worked with separately described
mistreatment. In some cases, Goeller said, athletes were forced to
remove casts and train on injured limbs.

Goeller said Haney told her gymnasts that they were not allowed to tell
anyone what happened in the gym. ``The kids were afraid to speak up,''
Goeller said.

Haney has also threatened people who are testifying against her, Goeller
said.

It is unclear when U.S.A. Gymnastics started investigating Haney, but
Goeller submitted her report of misconduct --- which raised concerns
about one other coach and another gym --- to the federation last May.

Until she was suspended at the start of the hearing, Haney continued to
coach at national team camps while under investigation.Haney also
coached at last summer's Pan-American Games, where McCusker won five
medals.

McCusker, 18, is considered a strong candidate to make the American team
for the Tokyo Olympics next year, though she
\href{https://twitter.com/usagym/status/1175505704184090626?lang=en}{had
to withdraw} from a selection camp for last year's world championships
because of mild rhabdomyolysis, a muscle disorder associated with
overtraining. McCusker moved in February to train with the Arizona
Sunrays, working alongside Jade Carey, another national team member.

McCusker, through her mother Jessica, declined to comment.

Hernandez, 19, won a gold medal in the team competition at the 2016 Rio
Olympics and a silver on the balance beam. Hernandez took time off after
the Olympics and returned to national team camps in November. She now
trains at Gym-Max in Southern California, where the 2012 Olympic gold
medalist Kyla Ross trained.

Hernandez, through her agent, declined to comment.

Juliet Macur contributed reporting.
