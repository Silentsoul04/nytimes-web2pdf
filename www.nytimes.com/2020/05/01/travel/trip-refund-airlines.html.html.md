*Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread

### **Dear Tripped Up,**

In September 2019 B.C. — “before coronavirus” — my family and I booked a
round-trip flight from Tampa, Fla., to London with British Airways,
scheduled to depart in March. Then the coronavirus hit and our flight
was canceled by the airline. We contacted British Airways to request a
refund, but they have refused, stating they will only provide a voucher
for future use. Philip

### Dear Philip,

By now, you’ve probably read a number of coronavirus-related stories
about refunds for canceled travel plans — I’ve written a handful myself.
But there’s a reason we’re deliberately pounding the topic into the
ground: It’s a big deal and there’s lots of confusion and contradictory
information out there.

To begin, airlines are required to issue cash refunds when they cancel
(or significantly delay) flights because of the [coronavirus
pandemic.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/coronavirus-updates.html)
That applies to domestic airlines as well as international airlines for
canceled flights to, within or from the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As you know, [travel restrictions and closed
borders](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html)
have asphyxiated commercial aviation; airlines have slashed [routes and
schedules.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/travel/international-airlines-service-cuts-coronavirus.html)
As of last month, airlines [still owed passengers $35
billion](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/ceoblog/passenger-tickets-refunds/)
for flights that could not or cannot take place, according to the
International Air Transport Association, an industry group.

In an emailed statement, a British Airways spokeswoman said that you
are, in fact, entitled to a refund; the airline’s customer service team
has reached out to you to resolve the issue. “If a customer’s flight has
been canceled, they should call us to discuss their options. They can
rebook, refund or choose to take a voucher to fly at a later date,” she
said.

The fact that you called and were initially told the exact opposite
tracks with scores of other readers who feel that refunds have been
turned into an all-out game of
Frogger.

“At best, airlines are just hiding the fact that customers are owed
refunds if they want one,” said Scott Keyes, an aviation industry expert
and the founder of the website [Scott’s Cheap
Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/). “At worst, they’re actively
not giving those refunds even when they’re asked. The thinking is: Right
now we are in such a cash crunch that we want to maintain as much cash
as possible —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>we can deal with
the reputation ramifications and legal ramifications down the road.”

Micky, another reader, got an email from Delta Air Lines with the
subject line: “Your Trip Has Been Canceled.” The body of the message
stated that a canceled plane ticket had been turned into an eCredit;
there were zero mentions of refunds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I reached out to Delta (which just posted its first quarterly loss in
five years) and was able to get Micky a refund. I also got the direct
link to the refund form ([here it
is](https://www.delta.com/refunds/refundsHomeAction.action)), which is
otherwise buried in the FAQs on Delta’s [coronavirus landing
page.](https://www.delta.com/us/en/travel-update-center/overview)

“To save customers time, we proactively issued eCredits so they could
easily reschedule without having to wait further. That said, customers
whose flights have been canceled or significantly delayed by Delta are
absolutely eligible for refunds upon request, in keeping with our
longstanding policy. We’ll evaluate opportunities to clarify this in
future correspondence,” said a company spokeswoman.

Last month, fueled by a surge in passenger complaints, the United States
Department of Transportation issued a statement reminding airlines of
their duty to issue refunds for canceled flights. But enforcement has
been less than straightforward.

Class-action lawsuits against several major airlines, including Delta,
Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, are certain to crank up the
pressure. In the meantime, there are three concrete things one can try
that don’t involve hiring a lawyer.

First, send the airline a direct message on social media. It may sound
sophomoric, but several industry players have told me (anecdotally) that
this can be a consistently reliable tactic. One reader also shared her
luck with this
approach.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“Delta did not notify us, but I saw online that the flights were
canceled,” Linda wrote. “No emails. No phone calls. Nothing got a refund
confirmation. Well, until I sent a private instant message through
Facebook. Almost immediate reply. Asked for our names and confirmation
number. Bingo. Refund confirmation received.”

The second course of action is to [file a
complaint](https://airconsumer.dot.gov/escomplaint/ConsumerForm.cfm)
with the transportation department. The federal agency tracks complaints
by airline and releases them monthly; March complaints will be released
in May and April complaints will be released in June. That data will be
used by the department’s Aviation Enforcement Office to monitor
airlines’ compliance with the refund policy, according to an agency
spokeswoman.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last tip: If you do manage to get an airline representative on the
phone, do everything you can to get yourself passed around to another
agent if the initial point of contact is unwilling to budge. That may
mean asking to speak with a manager or asking to be transferred to a
different department (then asking to be transferred back). Be patient;
you’ll need a good chunk of time in order to let your options play out.

Or, as Mr. Keyes recently [put it on
Twitter:](https://twitter.com/scottsflights/status/1253023249744588800)
“When a parent says ‘no’ what’s the \#1 thing every kid knows to do?
Go ask the other parent.”
