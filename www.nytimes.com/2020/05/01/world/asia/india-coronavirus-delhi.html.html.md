NEW DELHI — The first thing that disappeared was the annoying sound of a
power drill up the street, from a house under construction.

Then the newspapers.

Then the fruit sellers, the taxis, the rickshaws, and chicken.

Day by day, [life under coronavirus lockdown in
India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/world/asia/india-lockdown-coronavirus.html)
took away something else, usually something good. And nearly six weeks
into it, much of this country is still frozen.

In many cities like New Delhi, practically nothing is moving on the
roads. People stay indoors, as instructed, emerging only to collect the
basic necessities. One friend who gets his food delivered told me he
hasn’t left his house for a month.

All the airlines are grounded. Schools and offices are closed. The only
businesses that I’ve seen operating are food shops, pharmacies and
banks. The banks have lines running out the door and down the sidewalk
where red circles have been spray-painted for people to stand in, six
feet apart, like little islands.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The other day, I drove to Delhi’s outskirts. India is a place rightly
known for teeming crowds and riotous traffic. There seems to be a
national aversion to sticking to your lane, so I felt almost guilty
blazing down an empty highway, past miles of shuttered shops, with no
one to cut me off.

Whenever we turned off the highway, every village, no matter how small,
was barricaded — some with oil drums, others with rope. Behind the
barricades stood villagers carrying sticks to keep strangers out and
wearing frayed bandannas over their faces, the virus vigilantes.

Even the sky above us is different these days. New Delhi is usually one
of the world’s most polluted cities; its ceiling is invariably smudge
gray. But now with so few cars and factories running, the air here is
[cleaner than it has been in
decades](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/world/asia/india-pollution-coronavirus.html).  
  
The weather that first weekend under lockdown, in late March, was
especially lovely: mid-80s, breezy, clear skies. So on the following
Monday when I saw The Times’s driver, Jag Singh, one of the few Indians
I now see on a regular basis because of our isolation, I asked if he had
managed to get
outside.

“No.” Did his neighbors? Again, “no.”

Having seen the photos of some Americans rushing to beaches as soon as
they were allowed, I asked why he thought Indians felt so constrained.  
  
His answer came quickly: “Everyone’s scared. People are saying if they
get sick, where will they go?”  
  
That explained a lot. It explained why I wasn’t seeing anyone in my
neighborhood venturing into the parks or strolling under the banyan
trees. It explained why few people in India were testing the lockdown
limits.

It’s not that they are automatically more willing to follow the rules
than say, California’s sun lovers who were not nearly social distancing.
It’s that in this case, Indians are more
scared.

India has a lot of great doctors but the ratio of doctors or hospital
beds per person is much lower than in the West. And many people here
survive on a few dollars a day.

India seems to be doing better than many richer countries in containing
the virus, at least so far. With reported infections relatively low,
around 35,000, [the government is trying to loosen the national
tourniquet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)
and reopen some industries, such as agriculture and select
manufacturing.

But many Indians don’t want to take the tourniquet off, even if it is
stanching the economy’s flow.

A good chunk of the population has decided that the best way to protect
themselves is not only to stick to the lockdown rules, but to go above
and beyond them, like the volunteer virus squads who sealed off entire
villages. Even people in my Delhi neighborhood have become lockdown
enthusiasts.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

A few weeks ago when I biked with my two sons to the neighborhood milk
depot — perfectly permissible under lockdown rules — someone leaned out
a window and boomed: “Go home\!”

My kids’ eyes widened. I pedaled away shaken. Did he mean back to our
apartment? Or to America? Many people here have blamed foreigners for
bringing India the coronavirus.

So my family now does what everyone does: we stay inside, looking out
the windows at one beautiful day passing after another. We used to sit
around the table and share upcoming plans. Now we don’t have
any.

We are marooned in the present tense. We couldn’t leave New Delhi even
if we wanted to. I crave sitting in the open night air in a Rajasthani
village, listening to tabla music. Or simply standing in a freshly
turned field that smells of earth and shaking a farmer’s hand.

Lockdown is a blow to what I do and why I’ve dragged my family into
this. Foreign correspondents relocate themselves and their families to
soak up new experiences and transmit as much of that as possible to
readers back home — not just the news but also the feel of a place, the
humanity. We wither doing Zoom calls from our couches.

But there is so much suffering around me, I’m not focusing on that right
now.

I get out a couple of times a week with my journalist pass, and just a
few days ago I met a mother and her 9-year-old daughter moving from
spray-painted circle to spray-painted circle down a sidewalk in a food
line. The mother was a maid who had lost her job because of the
lockdown. The daughter told me coronavirus came from stones that fell
from the sky.

They had zero money and I could tell from how listlessly they accepted
their two pieces of fried bread and two lumps of potato curry that they
hated taking handouts.

Behind them, in the bright sun, were hundreds of people just like them,
marching slowly
forward.
