Fighting between the Indian Army and militants threatened to heighten

raged for weeks.

NEW DELHI --- A gun battle between the Indian Army and militants in
Kashmir left at least seven people dead, Indian officials said on
Sunday, and the violence threatened to heighten tensions in the disputed
region.

The army said soldiers were hunting down militants fighting Indian rule
in the remote town of Handwara, in northern Kashmir, close to the border
with Pakistan, when the militants took civilians hostage on Saturday
afternoon. The claim could not be independently verified.

As fighting worsened, the army said, five Indian security personnel ---
including a colonel, a major and a Kashmiri police officer --- were
killed. India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh,
\href{https://twitter.com/rajnathsingh/status/1256809990062436352}{said
on Sunday on Twitter} that the loss was deeply disturbing.

``We will never forget their bravery and sacrifice,'' he said.

Kashmir --- caught in a territorial dispute between Hindu-majority
India, which controls much of the territory, and Muslim-majority
Pakistan --- has endured brutal conflict for decades. A violent
secession movement that started in the late 1980s saw many guerrilla
fighters crossing the border from Pakistan into India. In turn, India
increased its military presence in the region to try to quell the
uprising.

In recent weeks,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/02/world/asia/ap-as-kashmir-india-pakistan.html}{tensions
have risen} between India and Pakistan along the rugged and mountainous
Line of Control, which divides the Kashmir region into two parts. Videos
shot late last month in northern Kashmir depicted soldiers firing
artillery shells across the watch towers and bunkers that dot foothills
populated by villages.

On Saturday, a spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said India was
seeking to divert attention from
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/06/world/asia/kashmir-india-torture.html}{its
human rights violations in Kashmir} by raising false allegations of
``infiltration attempts.'' The ministry has not denied that Indian
soldiers were killed over the weekend.

``Pakistan's policy and approach is clear as it does not allow use of
its soil for any activity against anyone,'' a statement by the ministry
said.

Kashmir was cast into chaos in August when the Indian government
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-jammu.html}{revoked
the region's partial autonomy}. Since then, tensions have been high in
Kashmir Valley, where many businesses were shuttered, streets emptied
and, doctors said, residents' hopelessness morphed into a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/world/asia/kasmir-india-mental-health-coronavirus.html}{severe
psychological crisis}.

Life had started to rebound a bit before India imposed a nationwide
lockdown in March to fight the coronavirus, plunging Kashmir into fresh
turmoil. Police officers blocked roads with coils of glistening
concertina wire. Shops closed once again, and thousands of Kashmiris
lost their jobs.

But despite the lockdown, firefights and skirmishes in Kashmir have not
stopped. At least 50 militants and 20 soldiers have been killed this
year, according to data collected by the South Asia Terrorism Portal, a
research project that tracks the conflict.

The gun battle raged late Saturday for hours in Handwara, where Indian
Army and police officers found themselves trapped between houses as they
came under fire from militants, witnesses said.

A shopkeeper, Mushtaq Ahmad Wagee, 61, who lives near the site of the
gun battle, said his family could not sleep as the firing between the
holed up militants and forces continued and giant plumes of smoke filled
the sky.

``In the end, someone dies every day in Kashmir,'' he said. ``This
bloodshed should stop now.''
