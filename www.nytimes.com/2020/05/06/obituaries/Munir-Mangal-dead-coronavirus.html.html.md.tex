coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

Munir Mohamad Mangal, an Afghan general who had served in the country's
security forces for four decades, most recently as national police
commander, died on May 2 at his home in Kabul. He was 70.

The cause was Covid-19, the Interior Ministry said. He was Afghanistan's
highest-profile casualty of the pandemic and the second member of his
family to die of the virus. His son, a physician, also died.

``He was a patriot --- a strong and calm officer,'' said a former
colleague, Mirza Mohammad Yarmand, who had worked with General Mangal
for several years.

In a time when
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/world/what-in-the-world/being-an-afghan-general-is-nice-work-if-you-can-get-it-and-many-do.html}{promotion
to general became more about political connections} and less about the
years spent in the force, General Mangal had climbed the ladder, Mr.
Yarmand said. He could relate to the officers at different levels --- he
had been there.

General Mangal was born in 1950 in Samkanay District of eastern Paktia
Province and attended primary and military school in Kabul before
earning a master's degree in military affairs in the Soviet Union.

He started his military career as a lieutenant in an artillery division
in Kabul in 1972. In nearly 40 years in uniform, he served under the
many shades of government that took power in Kabul, the last being the
American-backed leadership, before retiring in 2016.

Survivors include his wife, four sons, two daughters and 13
grandchildren.

In the early years of the U.S. invasion, General Mangal helped with the
forming of the new army, serving as a corps commander. His final
assignment was deputy minister of interior for security, in which he
commanded the nation's police force.

The Afghan police are at the forefront of the fight against the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/world/asia/taliban-attacks-afghanistan-coronavirus.html}{Taliban},
and hundreds die every month. General Mangal ran the force when about
100,000 NATO and American troops were in the country and shouldered much
of the fighting. Colleagues said that in areas where the police were
engaged, his attention to detail and thorough planning ensured that
casualties were kept low.

He could also be decisive in the moment. Once while he was traveling by
helicopter from Kandahar to Kabul, the craft he was in started losing
stability over a Taliban-controlled area in Ghazni province, Gen. Ghulam
Mujtaba Patang, a colleague who later became minister of interior, said.

``The pilot asked if he should do an emergency landing,'' General Patang
said. ``General Mangal said `No.' He turned his face to me and said:
`It's better to die in a crash than be taken hostage by the Taliban.'''
