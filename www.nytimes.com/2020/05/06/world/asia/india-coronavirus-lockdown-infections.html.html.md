NEW DELHI — Part of India’s success in blunting the spread of the
coronavirus had been [a fierce lockdown that was zealously
obeyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/world/asia/india-coronavirus-delhi.html).

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in the last few days, the government has loosened up the rules,
drawing people into the streets. And now the dangerous contagion appears
to be spreading more aggressively.

The doubling rate of infections — the amount of time it takes for the
number of coronavirus cases to double — has dropped from around 12 days
to 9.5. The daily death rate has shot up from a few dozen in mid-April
to more than 100 now.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This is still a long way from the devastating toll that the United
States and several European countries have been enduring. The total
number of reported infections in India is around 50,000, giving it a
much lower per capita case rate than many other countries.

But a tour of Delhi shows how much has changed just this week.

The streets of working-class neighborhoods that last week were deserted
are thronged with people. Bicycle rickshaws dart in and out of traffic.
Pedestrians flow down the sides of the road. Most wear masks, as
required, but many wear them off their chins with their noses and
sometimes even their mouths exposed.

At liquor stores, which reopened Monday for the first time in six weeks
— the government was desperate for liquor tax revenue — there is
nothing close to social distancing. Instead, there is utter chaos.

Police officers try to beat back the crowds with long sticks, but it’s
no use. The crowds just keep growing, with lines at stores sometimes
stretching nearly a mile. At one shop in Delhi on Tuesday, hundreds of
men converged to buy whiskey, pushing and shoving to get closer to the
front, crumpled bills in their fingers, wild looks in their eyes. Many
packed so close to each other that they rested their hands on the sweaty
backs of people in front of them.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the heat rises — it hit 104 degrees in New Delhi a few days ago —
people who live in cramped quarters, sometimes eight to a room, are
finding it unbearable to stay indoors as the government has ordered. So
they spill outside. They mingle in the streets. They
gather.

“There’s no police around, nobody is enforcing the lockdown, people are
out everywhere,” said an exasperated Delhi shopkeeper who goes by one
name, Mehtab.

The virus’s hot spots are India’s crowded urban areas, especially New
Delhi, the political capital, and Mumbai, the business capital. About a
third of all reported infections are from these two cities, each home to
around 20 million people.

In Mumbai, the police officers enforcing the lockdown seem exhausted,
and withdraw from neighborhoods at
night.

“Every night when the police leave, the people get out as if there is a
party,” said Rakhi Jadhav, a local representative in eastern Mumbai.

Dharavi, one of Mumbai’s biggest slums, where a million or so people are
squeezed into less than one square mile of shacks and narrow alleyways,
is emerging as a serious concern. At least 600 residents there have been
infected and it’s nearly impossible to socially distance. People live
face to face and share communal toilets, often dozens of people using
just one.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Across the city, people are watching Dharavi closely. Officials are
beginning to worry they might not have the resources they need to
prevent a much wider outbreak.

“Testing labs, beds, facilities — they are all being overburdened with
asymptomatic and mildly infected patients,” said Pradip Awate, an
epidemiologist and chief surveillance officer in Maharashtra state, home
to Mumbai.

Six weeks ago, India’s prime minister, [Narendra Modi, imposed a strict
nationwide
lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)
for India’s 1.3 billion people. Mr. Modi ordered Indians to stay in
their homes, and his government shut down just about everything from
schools and offices to railroads and the country’s airspace. Even the
borders separating India’s states were
sealed.

Many Indians obeyed the rules, wary of catching the virus and not
trusting India’s beleaguered health care system to save them.

But as the weeks have dragged on, the economic costs have piled up and
people are becoming more desperate. Many Indians live hand-to-mouth on
the equivalent of a few dollars a day, and countless millions have been
thrown out of work. [Endless streams of migrant workers have trudged
hundreds of miles back to their
villages](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-india-migrants.html),
hoping to rely on their families and farms to
survive.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has

        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Many out-of-work laborers are still marooned in India’s cities with no
source of income and no way to feed their families except for meals
provided by charities or the government.

With the pressure building, the central government and many states
loosened up the lockdown rules this week, allowing small wedding
ceremonies to resume, buses to operate and many businesses to open,
including salons, pet shops and electrical stores.

So now Indians are wondering if the easing of the lockdown has led to
the surge in reported infections or if this is the right time, with
cases already rising, to allow people to interact more easily. The
increase in reported infections could also be from an increase in the
number of tests, from about 20,000 in late March to more than a million
today. India has reported just one positive case for every 25 tests,
compared with one infection for every six tests in the United
States.

Still, Dr. S.D. Gupta, a public health expert and a member of the
government’s Covid-19 task force, said testing would need to ramp up
significantly to capture the full scope of India’s coronavirus outbreak.

States like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat are witnessing sharp jumps in the
number of cases. Officials in West Bengal have been accused of [sitting
on higher-than-usual mortality
figures](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/extremely-high-mortality-rate-in-west-bengal-says-central-team/article31501093.ece).
In Punjab, the rate at which new cases were doubling dropped from 18
days to four this past week, largely because of [an aggressive outbreak
among religious
pilgrims](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjabs-double-whammy-no-let-up-in-spiralling-cases/articleshow/75545299.cms)
returning from Maharashtra, India’s worst afflicted state.

Dr. Gupta said it was difficult to say whether India was in the midst of
experiencing a dangerous upward trajectory of new cases. But he warned
that the country’s growth curve of new infections had still not peaked.
With so many asymptomatic patients unaware of their status, he said,
officials needed to remain especially vigilant as more restrictions were
eased in the coming weeks.

“What we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “Unless we do
testing, we will never know how many cases we have. That’s a problem.”
