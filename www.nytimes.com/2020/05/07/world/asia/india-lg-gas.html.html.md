# Gas Leak in India at LG Factory Kills 11 and Sickens Hundreds

Residents in eastern India woke up in the middle of the night surrounded
by a cloud of styrene vapor. Many couldn’t breathe.

NEW DELHI — D.V.S.S. Ramana, who lives about a mile from an industrial
plant in eastern India, said he woke up early Thursday morning enveloped
in a strange white mist.  
  
He started coughing. His eyes burned. He flipped on his TV to learn that
a cloud of toxic vapor had just escaped from a nearby plastics factory
owned by the South Korean industrial giant LG Corp. in the Indian
coastal city of Visakhapatnam.

Mr. Ramana jerked his wife and two children awake. As he rushed outside,
he heard sirens blaring and saw people staggering into the street. Some
collapsed right in front of him.  
  
“We could smell the gas in our mouths,” Mr. Ramana said, speaking by
telephone as he was driving off, trying to get his family as far away as
possible. “It was terrifying.”  
  
The leak, which officials said came from a tank of styrene, a liquid
material used in making plastics, sent out a cloud of toxic vapor that
drifted over the outskirts of Visakhapatnam, killing at least 11 people
and sickening
hundreds.

Dozens of men and women were left lying unconscious in the street.
Mothers ran to hospitals with limp children in their arms. Police
officers moved house to house to evacuate hundreds of people. Sometimes
they had to break down doors because the residents inside were
unconscious.  
  
Indian officials said the accident happened around 2:30 a.m., as the
chemical plant was restarting operations after a six-week hiatus because
of [India’s strict coronavirus
lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/world/asia/india-coronavirus-delhi.html).
The tanks of styrene had been left unattended, Indian officials said,
and in the course of the factory resuming operations, a major leak
erupted.  
  
“It seems unskilled labor mishandled the maintenance work and because of
that, the gas leaked,” said Srijana Gummalla, one of the top government
officials in Visakhapatnam.

The plant had been closed since India’s coronavirus lockdown began in
late March, but this week the lockdown was eased and many businesses,
including heavy industries, have begun to reopen.  
  
A former manager of LG Polymers, the Indian subsidiary of LG Chemical,
said in an interview that liquid styrene required careful attention, and
that because of the lockdown, workers were not going to the factory. He
said that may have played a role in the leak.

Indian news media broadcast [clips of
victims,](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/vizag-over-1000-fall-sick-after-gas-leak-from-chemical-plant/articleshow/75590112.cms)
including villagers lying face down on a muddy road, their mobile phones
spilled out next to them. In one shot, a woman frantically pounds the
chest of another woman who had just collapsed. In another, a stray dog
struggles to stand and then crumples to the floor.

Though this accident was not close to the scale of the 1984 gas leak at
a Union Carbide pesticide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal, which left
nearly 4,000 dead and a half million poisoned, it immediately drew
comparisons, especially among Bhopal survivors.

“When I saw the images on television of people struggling to breathe and
laying on the roadside,” said Rashida Bi, a Bhopal survivor, “something
hit me deep inside as if I was laying motionless, among them, begging to
save my life and struggling to breath.”  
  
“At least they had people ready to take them to hospitals,” she added.
“We had none. All of us were looking at each other, waiting for death
to come.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the Bhopal disaster brought to the fore India’s dangerous
industrial practices, forcing the government to improve some safety
standards, Bhopal survivors and many others said India still hasn’t
learned the right lessons.

For example, several union officials said that the warning sirens at the
Visakhapatnam factory failed to go off and that more people had died as
a result.

Mantri Rajsekhar, the local leader of a union representing LG Polymers,
accused the company of ignoring safety issues raised by the group,
including poor maintenance of equipment.

LG Chemical said in a statement that it was investigating how the leak
happened and “the cause of deaths.”

“We are working together with the local authorities to assess the damage
caused to the local people and to take whatever it takes to protect them
and our workers,” the statement said. “The gas leak from the factory is
now under control. But the gas can cause vomiting and dizziness when
inhaled. We are doing all we can to ensure medical treatment as quickly
as possible.”

Medical officials in Visakhapatnam [said hundreds of patients ended up
exposed to the
styrene](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/three-dead-many-trapped-in-houses-after-chemical-leaked-from-polymers-firm-in-visakhapatnam/articleshow/75590150.cms)vapor,
which can immobilize a person within minutes of inhalation and be deadly
at high concentrations. Doctors said that many patients were vomiting
and experiencing “neurological deficiencies.” At least a dozen remained
in critical condition.

India’s National Disaster Response Force sent men in camouflaged hazmat
suits with oxygen tanks on their backs into the factory. By Thursday
afternoon, there was “hardly any leakage,” said S.N. Pradhan, the
disaster force’s director.

South Korea’s [LG Chemical took over
the](http://www.lgpi.co.in/AboutLGPI.html)factory from a local Indian
company in the late 1990s. It employs several hundred people, the former
manager said, and makes polystyrene (a hard plastic used for appliances,
toys, and electronics) and expandable polystyrene (a foam material used
as an insulator for buildings and packaging for items.)

The factory sits at the edge of Visakhapatnam, surrounded by train
tracks, small villages, dirt roads, and neem and ficus trees. It is an
old port city now home to many industrial plants, and is one of the
biggest cities in southeastern India, in Andhra Pradesh State.

The accident happened when most people in the area were sleeping. Indian
officials said the cloud of toxic vapor spread over an area with a three
kilometer radius, exposing more than 1,000 people.

At least two children died, authorities said, and several other people
perished while trying to run away. Officials said that one villager who
was temporarily blinded by the vapor fell into a well.

Mr. Ramana, who works as a store manager at an ironware factory, said he
plans to stay at a relative’s place a couple of hours drive from
Visakhapatnam.

By Thursday afternoon, speaking from further along the highway, far from
Visakhapatnam, he sounded much more relieved.
