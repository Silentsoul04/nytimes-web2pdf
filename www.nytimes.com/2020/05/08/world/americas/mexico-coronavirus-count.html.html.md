MEXICO CITY — The Mexican government is not reporting hundreds, possibly
thousands, of [deaths from the coronavirus in Mexico
City](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/world/americas/coronavirus-mexico-factories.html),
dismissing anxious officials who have tallied more than three times as
many fatalities in the capital than the government publicly
acknowledges, according to officials and confidential data.

The tensions have come to a head in recent weeks, with Mexico City
alerting the government to the deaths repeatedly, hoping it will come
clean to the public about the [true toll of the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
on the nation’s biggest city and, by extension, the country at large.

But that has not happened. Doctors in overwhelmed hospitals in Mexico
City say the reality of the epidemic is being hidden from the country.
In some hospitals, patients lie on the floor, splayed on mattresses.
Elderly people are propped up on metal chairs because there are not
enough beds, while patients are turned away to search for space in
[less-prepared
hospitals](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/world/americas/virus-mexico-doctors.html).
Many die while searching, several doctors said.

“It’s like we doctors are living in two different worlds,” said Dr.
Giovanna Avila, who works at Hospital de Especialidades Belisario
Domínguez. “One is inside of the hospital with patients dying all the
time. And the other is when we walk out onto the streets and see people
walking around, clueless of what is going on and how bad the situation
really is.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mexico City officials have tabulated more than 2,500 deaths from the
virus and from serious respiratory illnesses that doctors suspect were
related to Covid-19, according to the data, which was reviewed by The
New York Times. Yet the federal government is reporting about 700 in the
area, which includes Mexico City and the municipalities on its
outskirts.

Nationwide, the federal government has reported about 3,000 confirmed
deaths from the virus, plus nearly 250 suspected of being related, in a
country of more than 120 million people. But experts say Mexico has only
a minimal sense of the real scale of the epidemic because it is testing
so few
people.

Far fewer than one in 1,000 people in Mexico are tested for the virus —

Development, which average about 23 tests for every 1,000 people.

The government says Mexico has been faring better than many of the
world’s largest countries, and on Monday its Covid-19 czar estimated
that the final death toll would be around 6,000 people.

But the government did not respond to questions about the deaths in
Mexico City. It also denied repeated requests by The Times over the
course of three weeks to identify all deaths related to respiratory
illnesses since January, saying the data was incomplete.

One former health secretary, José Narro Robles, has accused Mr.
López-Gatell of lying to the people of Mexico. And some state
governments are beginning to draw similar conclusions: that, much like
Mexico City found, the data presented by the government does not reflect
reality.

Official counts in many countries have understated the number of deaths
during the pandemic, especially where limited testing has prevented the
virus from being diagnosed, [a Times review of mortality
data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html)
has found. In Ecuador, six times more people have died than official
figures reflect, the data show. In Italy, the overall increase in deaths
in March was nearly twice official counts.

In Mexico City, the doubts started a month ago, when the city’s mayor,
Claudia Sheinbaum, began to suspect that federal data and modeling on
the epidemic were flawed, according to three people with knowledge of
the matter.

She had already instructed her staff to call every public hospital in
the Mexico City area to ask about all confirmed and suspected Covid-19
deaths, the people said. In the last week, that effort found that the
deaths were more than three times what the federal government reported.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The disagreements have taken place largely behind the scenes, as Ms.
Sheinbaum, who declined to comment for this article, has been loath to
publicly embarrass President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, her close
political ally. The city and the federal government continue to work
together on a number of fronts, including getting ventilators.

But the data from Mexico City calls into question the federal
government’s grasp of the crisis in the country.

With such limited testing and doubts about the government’s models,
experts say federal estimates for when the nation will reach its peak,
how long the epidemic will last and how bad the damage will be may not
be reliable.

That disconnect has left cities and states across the country scrambling
to meet the demand for protective equipment and ventilators. It also
underplays the severity of the epidemic for millions of Mexicans, making
it hard for them to determine how bad the situation is — and how
seriously to take
it.

“That is shocking,” said Fernando Alarid-Escudero, who has a Ph.D. in
health decision sciences and who developed an independent model in
collaboration with scientists at Stanford University to chart the curve
of the epidemic in Mexico. “If that is case, and we are not really
capturing all those people who eventually die, we are not getting a
sense of the picture.”

“We are way underestimating the magnitude of the epidemic,” he added.

In Tijuana, hospitals are already overwhelmed. Doctors and nurses across
the country have held public protests against the lack of protective
gear, and several hospitals along the border have suffered outbreaks of
the virus among medical personnel. Federal officials have been
scrambling to buy respirators, long after seeing the outbreaks grip
China, Europe and the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One big reason for the competing death tolls in Mexico has to do with
the way the federal government is testing, vetting and reporting the
data. The official results include a two-week lag, people familiar with
the process say, which means timely information is not available
publicly.

More worrisome, they say, are the many deaths absent from the data
altogether, as suggested by the figures from Mexico City, where the
virus has struck hardest of all. Some people die from acute respiratory
illness and are cremated without ever getting tested, officials say.
Others are dying at home without being admitted to a hospital — and are
not even counted under Mexico City’s
statistics.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The gap in information has left many Mexicans with a sense that their
country has avoided the harrowing outbreaks afflicting nations like the
United States, where nearly 1.2 million people have been infected and
more than 70,000 people have died, according to the Centers for Disease
Control.

Publicly, Mr. López-Gatell, the health ministry official, has become
something of a celebrity, steering nightly news conferences in which he
assures the public that things are moving according to plan.

But there have been problems with the government’s assumptions from the
very beginning, according to three people familiar with its
preparations. As early as February, they said, the government was using
Wuhan, China — the city where the pandemic originated — to model the
potential needs and response in Mexico.

But those calculations quickly went awry, the people said, as officials
realized the dynamic in China was entirely different from the one in
Mexico. As the outbreak spread in Wuhan, Chinese officials locked down
the city and the surrounding province, prohibiting tens of millions of
people from traveling.

In Mexico, by contrast, the lockdown measures have been optional, with
officials simply urging people to go to hospitals or stay at home,
depending on symptoms. There are no travel restrictions in or out of
Mexico
City.

In the last month, the government has added experts to review the data
and analysis, after urging from the country’s foreign minister, Marcelo
Ebrard, and other officials. But even those newer models make
assumptions that experts feel are inadequate.

The main model the country is believed to now be using assumes only 5
percent of the infected population show symptoms, and that only 5
percent of those patients will go to the hospital, according to modeling
documents obtained by The Times.

“Their model is wrong,” said Laurie Ann Ximénez-Fyvie, a Harvard-trained
Ph.D. at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, adding that
symptomatic and severe cases could be significantly higher. “There is
very good consensus on that.”

Several experts also questioned Mexico’s assumptions of how quickly the
epidemic will pass. Its model shows a sharp rise in infections, followed
by a sharp decline. But in almost no other country in the world has
there been a rapid decline after a peak.

“There is a long tail for the curve, and the number of deaths does not
drop to zero anytime in the near future,” said Nilanjan Chatterjee, a
professor in the department of biostatistics at the Bloomberg School of
Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. “The graph they are using is
inconsistent with the shapes of the curve in other
countries.”
