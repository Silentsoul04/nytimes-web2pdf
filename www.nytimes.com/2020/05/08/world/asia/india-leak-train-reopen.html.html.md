NEW DELHI — Sixteen migrant workers were crushed to death by a freight
train in central India on Friday as they were traveling home, the latest
casualties connected to [India’s coronavirus
lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html)
and efforts to reopen the economy.

Just the day before, a [disaster at a plastics
factory](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/world/asia/india-lg-gas.html)
that was reopening after a lockdown killed 11 people and sickened
hundreds. Officials said that workers at a plant owned by the South
Korean industrial giant LG had mishandled a valve on a styrene tank that
sent a cloud of deadly vapor floating over the outskirts of
Visakhapatnam, a city of several million people, that left people
choking to death in the streets.

The moral of those stories for the Indian government, which imposed one
of the world’s strictest lockdowns six weeks ago and is now trying to
restart its economy, is that [the changes brought by the coronavirus
carry risks beyond
infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown-infections.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many of the country’s struggles before the pandemic — including mass
internal migration, unsafe workplaces and industrial disasters — have
been amplified by the lockdown and the subsequent move to reopen
businesses. And with millions of its citizens working overseas to send
money home, and many of their lives now upended by the pandemic, India
is also undertaking a giant repatriation effort.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The gas leak wasn’t the only industrial accident as Indian businesses
began resuming operations. On Wednesday, [half a dozen workers who had
not been given safety gear were
hospitalized](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gas-leak-at-paper-mill-in-chhattisgarhs-raigarh-hours-after-vizag-incident-2225018)
after inhaling dangerous fumes at a paper mill in Chhattisgarh, in
central India, that was trying to restart operations after weeks of
inactivity. And on Thursday, several hundred miles to the south, in
Tamil Nadu, [a boiler exploded at a thermal power
plant](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/puducherry/8-injured-in-neyveli-boiler-blast-2-critical/articleshow/75611875.cms),
badly burning several workers.  
  
“Industry is desperate to open up after the lockdown, and rules are not
being followed,” said Shankar Gopalakrishnan, a labor rights activist.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some of the mishaps may have been exacerbated by the extraordinary
exodus of workers from India’s cities. As soon as Prime Minister
Narendra Modi imposed the nationwide lockdown in late March, hundreds of
thousands of young men who were put out of work [streamed back to their
home
villages](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-india-migrants.html),
trudging along highways in lines miles long, hoping to survive with
their families.

Mr. Modi’s government appeared to be caught off guard by the scale of
the displacement. It might have hastened the spread of the coronavirus
from cities to rural areas, and it created a shifting hunger crisis of
millions of Indians who could no longer earn a living and dispersed to
all corners of the country, fearful of relying on the government for
help.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The migrants killed on Friday along the railway tracks were among this
desperate wave. In recent days, India’s government, which initially
blocked migrants from moving state to state, has eased the lockdown
rules to allow some to travel. Over all, Mr. Modi’s government has been
softening the lockdown, deeply concerned about the economic hit on a
country in which many people scrape by on a few dollars a
day.

At the same time, several state governments are loosening labor
protections in an effort to get industry back on its feet. Labor
activists fear that this will make it even more dangerous for workers.

On Friday around 5 a.m., a cargo train was barreling down the tracks
near the town of Aurangabad, about 200 miles northeast of Mumbai, in the
center of the country. The railways ministry said the [locomotive driver
had seen a group of people on the tracks and tried to
stop](https://twitter.com/RailMinIndia/status/1258595033260929029) but
ended up hitting
them.

factory, and officials said they had been sleeping on the tracks. (Most
passenger train service in India has stopped, but freight trains
continue to run.)

They were on their way home, several hundred miles away, and apparently
were exhausted from walking.

“They thought trains were not moving and it was a safe spot,” said
Dnyanoba Banapure, a government official in the area.

        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The news of the migrants’ deaths disturbed an Indian public already
rattled by the accident at the LG plastics factory. Preliminary
investigations indicate that the accident was caused by a leak in a
styrene tank that had been neglected for weeks.

Officials said that dangerous pressure had been building in the tank
during the lockdown and that factory workers had improperly opened a
valve, releasing a huge cloud of toxic vapor.

On Friday, police officers put up more barricades around the factory and
were not letting anyone near it. With many of the evacuated villagers
being housed in government shelters, the entire area bore a deserted
look.

All day Thursday, Indian television channels showed [clips of the
accident
victims](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/vizag-over-1000-fall-sick-after-gas-leak-from-chemical-plant/articleshow/75590112.cms).
The images of people choking on fumes and lying motionless in the roads
conjured up painful memories of the enormous [industrial accident in
Bhopal](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/world/asia/07bhopal.html), in
1984, when a pesticide plant released toxic gas that killed 4,000
people.

But even if this period under lockdown has caused severe problems, it
might have saved more lives than it has taken, and not just from the
coronavirus.

The number of fatal car accidents is way down — no surprise, perhaps,
given that roads across India were deserted until this week. A [recent
report](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/road-accidents-during-india-lockdown-6397368/)
found that 140 people died in car accidents nationwide from March 24 to
May 3 — an average of 3.4 deaths per day, much lower than the 414 people
killed on average each day in 2018.

And with many people confined to their homes, as the government has
instructed, to blunt the spread of the coronavirus, figures show that
overall [death rates have been lower than
normal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india-casualties/mortality-rates-drop-sharply-in-parts-of-india-bucking-coronavirus-trend-idUSKCN2260WM)
in many large cities, including Mumbai and Ahmedabad.

The general sense in India is that the lockdown’s strictness has helped
keep confirmed coronavirus infections relatively low, reported to be
around 60,000, for a population of 1.3 billion.

But in recent days, as the lockdown has eased and many businesses have
resumed, [virus infections — and related deaths — are
increasing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown-infections.html).
