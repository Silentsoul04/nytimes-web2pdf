# Sister Fights to Free Uighur Businessman Held in China After U.S. Trip

Ekpar Asat came to the United States for the State Department’s most
prestigious program for foreign citizens. Chinese security officers
detained him weeks after he returned home.

WASHINGTON — When Ekpar Asat saw his older sister for the last time one
winter night in Manhattan, he promised her he would return to the United
States in a few months with their parents to watch her graduate with a
master’s degree from Harvard Law School — the first ethnic
[Uighur](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-court.html)
to do so.

But three weeks after returning to China from that trip in 2016, when he
was attending a prestigious [State Department leadership training
program](https://eca.state.gov/ivlp), he disappeared into the shadows of
a vast [detention
system](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html)
in the country’s northwest.

This winter, his sister, Rayhan Asat, heard that he had been sentenced
to 15 years in prison on suspicion of inciting ethnic hatred.

“It’s so upsetting,” she said. “After he came to the U.S., he had an
elevated profile, and then he was labeled an enemy of the state.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Asat, a lawyer and permanent American resident in Washington,
described her 34-year-old brother as a model citizen — an entrepreneur
who founded a social media app for
[Uighurs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/technology/china-uighurs-hackers-malware-hackers-smartphones.html)
and took part in state-organized events. Their parents are members of
the Communist Party. The mother retired as a chemistry professor and the
father as a civil servant in water resources administration.

But Ms. Asat said the State Department project, the [International
Visitor Leadership Program](https://eca.state.gov/facesofexchange/),
which for 80 years has trained many prominent foreign citizens, appears
to have tainted her brother in the eyes of Chinese security officers.

Though department officials have raised Mr. Asat’s case with Chinese
counterparts, Ms. Asat is now calling for the agency to escalate its
efforts — especially because he appears to have been detained and
convicted of crimes based on his association with the program, she said.
She stressed, though, that the weeks he had spent in the United States
had been a positive experience.

“I told the State Department this was the very reason that he was in
danger,” Ms. Asat, 36, said. “When the United States organizes these
programs and brings over these people, we have to protect them after the
fact so these programs can be successful.”

Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman, said diplomats would
continue to raise Mr. Asat’s case with the Chinese government.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We call on Beijing to immediately release all those arbitrarily
detained, and to end its draconian policies which have forcibly
indoctrinated and intimidated its own citizens in Xinjiang,” she added,
referring to China’s northwest region, where most Uighurs live.

John Ullyot, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council,
said the Trump administration “has called out the Chinese Communist
Party for its treatment of millions of Uighurs like Ekpar Asat whom it
arbitrarily detains, indoctrinates and forces into labor to erase their
ethnic identity and religious beliefs.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The State Department mentioned Mr. Asat in its [2019 human rights
report](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CHINA-INCLUSIVE-2019-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf)
on China, which said he apparently had been detained in 2016 “after
participating in a program in the United States” and then was sentenced
to 15 years in prison. The report, which identifies Mr. Asat by his
official Chinese name, Aikebaier Aisaiti, also described the “mass
arbitrary detention” of
[Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/china-xinjiang-uighur-dna-thermo-fisher.html)
in Xinjiang.

The Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim group that [calls Xinjiang
their
homeland](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/weekinreview/12wong.html).
The Chinese Communist Party says it is [clamping
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-labor.html)
on separatism and religious extremism in the region, but most Uighurs
suffering from the [hard-line anti-Muslim
policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html)
are [innocent
citizens](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/world/asia/china-xinjiang-children-boarding-schools.html).

[John Kamm](https://duihua.org/team_member/john-kamm/), a human rights
advocate in California who has advised Ms. Asat, said the State
Department should make public cases of persecution that might be linked
to its programs.

“I think it’s simply prudent,” he said. “I’m not calling for canceling
the program.”

The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing said it had no information on
Mr. Asat, and the Xinjiang regional government did not answer submitted
questions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Asat was detained around the time that officials in Xinjiang were
[building up an internment camp
system](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html)
that has held at least one million Muslims over four years. Since 2018,
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [has denounced the
camps](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/politics/pompeo-china-sanctions.html).

The fact that Mr. Asat ran a social media app with about 100,000 users
might also have made Chinese officials suspicious, since they are wary
of [online mass
communications](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/business/china-twitter-censorship-online.html).
But Ms. Asat said her brother was careful to abide by censorship rules.

Ms. Asat said she learned of her brother’s fate in January. The Chinese
Embassy in Washington sent an email to the office of [Senator Chris
Coons](https://www.coons.senate.gov/), Democrat of Delaware, telling
them about Mr. Asat’s 15-year sentence. That was in response to [a
bipartisan
letter](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6938-senators-ekpar-asat/b23f1159370b5d1ad5a8/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
that the senator and six other lawmakers, including [Senator Todd
Young](https://www.young.senate.gov/), Republican of Indiana, sent
[Ambassador Cui
Tiankai](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-china-us.html)
in December urging China to release Mr. Asat.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Coons said in a statement that he was “deeply concerned” about the
repression in Xinjiang. “China must be held accountable for this gross
abuse of human rights against Aikebaier and other innocent people,” he
added.

Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said this week that the
Senate would [move
soon](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-xinjiang/senate-leader-expects-vote-soon-on-seeking-china-sanctions-over-uighurs-idUSKBN22J3E4?il=0)
to pass a bipartisan bill, the [Uighur Human Rights Policy
Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/us/politics/trumps-human-rights-congress.html),
that would compel President Trump to take tough measures against China
on Xinjiang, including imposing sanctions on some officials. Tensions
between Washington and Beijing have risen sharply during the pandemic,
which began in central China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Asat said the accusation of ethnic hatred was absurd. She pointed to
state-run news reports that featured her brother’s business or his
participation in government-sponsored events. “They always said he was a
bridge builder between the ethnic minorities and the majority Han,” she
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2014, Mr. Asat was among a small group of businesspeople selected to
meet with Max Baucus, then the American ambassador to China, who had
traveled to Xinjiang.

The United States Embassy in Beijing then encouraged Mr. Asat to apply
for the State Department’s leadership program, Ms. Asat said. After
being accepted, he flew to the United States in February 2016, where he
completed a three-week program for journalists that introduced him to
institutions and figures across Washington and five states. There were
eight other participants.

“He was by far the most curious of the group; he was constantly asking
questions,” said Sheridan Bell, a former diplomat and senior program
manager at [Meridian International Center](https://www.meridian.org/), a
nonprofit group that runs the program for the State Department.

“He focused his questions on the line between doing what your bosses
want you to do and telling the truth — the narrow line between doing
your job as a journalist and propaganda,” he added. “He was very
cautious. I can’t imagine he said things that would have gotten him into
trouble.”

The State Department’s website says the program has [trained more
than 225,000
people](https://eca.state.gov/highlight/launching-80th-anniversary-international-visitor-leadership-program)
since its inception in 1940. [Prominent
alumni](https://eca.state.gov/facesofexchange/) include Margaret
Thatcher, the former prime minister of Britain, and [Jacinda
Ardern](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/world/australia/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-leader.html),
the current prime minister of New Zealand. The courses focus on
different industries and professions.

Mr. Bell said Chinese participants are often affiliated with the
Communist Party or the government. One alumnus of a U.S. foreign policy
program is [Xie
Feng](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/opinion/coronavirus-china-government.html),
now the Foreign Ministry’s commissioner in Hong Kong. There have been
occasional ethnic minority participants, including Tibetans.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Asat was effusive about the program. While in Washington, he wrote
on WeChat, the Chinese social media app: “It’s an incredible honor to
participate in the I.V.L.P. I hope to gain profound insight into
American culture and media\!”

He posted photographs of his travels. He posed with Americans to whom he
had given traditional Uighur hats and scarves. He sat in a Formula One
racecar in Florida, attended an N.B.A. game in Indiana and posed next to
the CNN logo at the network’s headquarters in
Georgia.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Asat, who was studying for her master of laws at Harvard after
having lived outside China since 2009, flew to Washington for a job
interview while her brother was there. The two had dinner at Clyde’s of
Georgetown, then went for a stroll by the shops along M Street.

She saw him once more afterward, for a few hours in New York. He told
her that since he now had a visa to enter the United States, he would
return in May with their parents for her graduation.

“He was inspired,” she said. “He wanted to spend the summer here and
learn more English. He liked the tech landscape and wanted to learn more
about how to innovate his company.”

Ms. Asat said she felt guilty for not having spent more time with her
brother. “There is so much regret,” she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After Mr. Asat returned to their home city of Urumqi, nothing seemed
unusual at first. He helped sponsor an international boxing tournament
that was covered by China Central Television, the state-run network. He
stood in the ring next to a famous Uighur boxer holding up a trophy.

Then Ms. Asat stopped hearing from him. No new messages appeared on his
WeChat account after April 7.

Her parents told her they would not attend her graduation.

During what should have been a high point in her life — graduating from
Harvard — Ms. Asat was distraught and in tears.

She soon began working in the Washington office of a Wall Street law
firm and talking to American officials. She noticed her brother’s
employees were still posting news items to his app, Bagdax, as were
public users of the app, until April 2017, which suggests its existence
was not the reason for his detention.

As [public
reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/07/world/europe/uighur-whistleblower.html)
have emerged of the mass detentions in Xinjiang, Ms. Asat has tried
quietly to get the State Department, the National Security Council and
congressional offices to press harder for her brother’s freedom.

She sometimes speaks briefly with family members in Xinjiang, but it is
all small talk. They avoid discussing her brother.

In early March, two months after finding out about his sentencing, she
decided to speak publicly at Harvard Law School about his case and the
crisis in Xinjiang.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I know from trying to help Rayhan Asat over the past four years that
she is a person of real courage and integrity,” said [William P.
Alford](https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10010/Alford), the
vice dean and law professor who hosted the talk. “The case of her
brother, arrested right after returning from the U.S. and largely
shrouded by Chinese authorities, is tragic.”

Ms. Asat said she was aware her family might suffer reprisals as a
result of her speaking out. That [has happened to other
Uighurs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/asia/uighur-muslims-china-detainment.html)
abroad. But she said her brother’s ordeal had made her realize that no
matter what she and her family do to conform as model citizens, the
Chinese government sees Uighurs “forever as outsiders.”

“When you grow up in China, you’re not supposed to engage in politics,”
she said. “But China is pushing me to become political.”
