\emph{With travel restrictions in place worldwide, we've launched a new
series,}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-world-through-a-lens}{\emph{The
World Through a Lens}}\emph{, in which photojournalists help transport
you, virtually, to some of our planet's most beautiful and intriguing
places. This week, Susan Wright shares a collection of photographs from
a saffron harvest in the Abruzzo region of Italy.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Italy's Abruzzo region, although remote, has not been spared from the
devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. The area has reported
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-cases.html}{thousands
of cases} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-home-isolation.html}{hundreds
of deaths}.

A few years ago, though, in happier times, I traveled to this isolated
corner of Italy, east of the Apennine Mountains, to photograph the
annual autumn saffron harvest.

It was my first adventure across the country's rugged central mountains
--- to the wilder side, away from the popular tourist spots, where the
terrain is pristine and sleepy medieval villages are scattered
throughout the pretty foothills.

The small village of Navelli, in the province of L'Aquila, where saffron
has been cultivated and harvested for several hundred years.

Having grown up in a rural setting in Australia, I was fascinated by the
Italian agricultural communities:~their deep connection to centuries-old
traditions, and the infusion of their land and culture with an
infectious love and passion.

How wonderful that these rural communities throughout Italy come
together for their annual festivals, known as sagre, which are often
dedicated to a specific local food.

Giovannina Sarra (often called the
\href{https://www.lifeinabruzzo.com/navelli-saffron-queen-the-power-bling/}{Saffron
Queen}) and her family hosted me and a handful of others at their home.
Early in the morning, in the Navelli plateau, we fanned out among the
misty, violet-tinged fields and participated in the harvest.

The saffron is harvested in the hours just before sunrise, while the
crocus petals remain closed.

Saffron, which is taken from the stigmas of the saffron crocus, is a
lucrative crop. Also called oro rosso, or red gold, it was first
introduced into the region around the 13th century --- an import from
Spain. Prized as an exotic spice, it was sold in the wealthier regions
and cities of Milan and Venice, and abroad in France, Germany and
Austria.

It takes roughly 4,000 flowers to make one ounce of saffron powder.

Saffron is harvested in the hours just before sunrise, while the crocus
petals remain closed; this makes the flowers easier to pick and helps
protect their precious crimson-red stigmas. The delicate buds are
handpicked and placed into baskets.

Later, on the same day, the stigmas --- three tiny threads per flower
--- are separated from the moist petals. It's a delicate process that
takes hours with a skilled and patient hand.

Image

Separating the tiny threads from the moist petals is a delicate and
time-consuming process.

Image

In the evening, over an open wood fire, the bright threadlike stigmas
are dried in wire baskets, a process that adds to the richness of both
the color and the flavor.

It takes roughly 4,000 flowers to make one ounce of saffron powder
---~which means there's a staggering amount of labor packed into the
tiny containers in which the spice is sold.

Image

Drying saffron adds to the richness of the color and flavor.

Not long ago, when I sat down to a mouthwatering plate of
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/3244-risotto-alla-milanese}{Risotto
alla Milanese} (a dish that's infused with saffron), I recalled the
early misty morning I spent with Gina Sarra~and her family.

Ms. Sarra, I was saddened to learn,
\href{https://dreamofitaly.com/2019/01/03/farewell-to-the-signora-of-saffron/}{died
in 2018}. The
\href{https://www.facebook.com/pg/coopaltopianodinavelli/posts/}{saffron
cooperative} she and her family helped organize in the early 1970s is
struggling now with market closures. And it will be a long time before
life in Italy --- for many weeks the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-bergamo.html}{epicenter
of the coronavirus outbreak} in Europe --- returns to normal.

Sebastiano Gianiorio.

But there's no doubt that families like the Sarras will one day return
to the restorative power of their sagre --- and to the many traditions
that have endured for generations in the fields of the Navelli plateau
and beyond.
