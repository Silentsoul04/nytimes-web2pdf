# TikTok Broke Privacy Promises, Children’s Groups Say

</div>

Twenty consumer groups said the video app had failed to make some
changes it agreed to carry out last year to settle federal charges.

TikTok, the popular app for making and sharing short videos, has flouted
an
[agreement](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/musical.ly_proposed_order_ecf_2-27-19.pdf)
it made with the Federal Trade Commission to protect the privacy of
children on the service, a coalition of 20 children’s and consumer
groups said on Thursday.

Last year, TikTok [agreed to make major
changes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/ftc-tiktok-child-privacy-fine.html)
to settle charges that one of its predecessor companies, Musical.ly, had
violated the federal [children’s online privacy
law](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy).
The alleged violations included collecting names, email addresses,
videos and other personal information from users under the age of 13
without a parent’s consent.

[Federal regulators
said](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/video-social-networking-app-musically-agrees-settle-ftc)
at the time that the app had made users’ information public by default,
which meant that a child’s user name, picture and videos could seen by
others. The agency also said adults had used the video-sharing app to
try to message children.

As part of the settlement, the video-sharing app agreed to obtain a
parent’s permission before collecting their child’s personal
information. It also agreed to delete personal information, including
videos, of any children identified as younger than 13 and to remove
videos and other personal details of users whose ages were unknown.

But the consumer groups, led by the [Campaign for a Commercial Free
Childhood](https://commercialfreechildhood.org/) and the [Center for
Digital Democracy](https://www.democraticmedia.org/), said in a
complaint to the F.T.C. that TikTok had failed to abide by its
commitments. Among other things, the complaint identified a number of
videos posted by children under 13 in 2016 that TikTok had not deleted
and that remain on the
app.

</div>

</div>

The groups also identified problems with age verification for younger
users. Last year, the app set up a service for children under 13, TikTok
for Younger Users, which prevents them from posting videos and does not
collect their personal data. But the complaint said a child who
initially registered for a TikTok account for younger users could
instantly delete it and sign up for an over-13 account on the same
mobile device simply by using a fake birth date.

(A reporter who tested this on Tuesday was able to set up an account for
a user older than 13 after deleting a children’s account she had
registered.)

“For years, TikTok has ignored” the children’s privacy law, “thereby
ensnaring perhaps millions of underage children in its marketing
apparatus, and putting children at risk of sexual predation,” said Josh
Golin, the executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free
Childhood. “Now, even after being caught red-handed by the F.T.C.,
TikTok continues to flout the law.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In an emailed statement, a TikTok spokesperson said: “We take privacy
seriously and are committed to helping ensure that TikTok continues to
be a safe and entertaining community for our users.”

TikTok’s popularity is soaring among Americans sheltering at home during
the pandemic. The app was downloaded about 11 million times by new users
in the United States in March, nearly twice the total in December,
according to Sensor Tower, a company that tracks app usage data.

Members of Congress have raised [national security
concerns](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/technology/tiktok-national-security-review.html)
about TikTok’s growing influence and about the risk that the app may
share user data with its parent company, ByteDance, a Chinese
conglomerate. ByteDance [bought Musical.ly for $1
billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/business/dealbook/musically-sold-app-video.html)
in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, an app it already owned.
