His sound didn't fit neatly into any hip-hop archetypes, and he pushed
to make room for unconventional voices.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Ty, a British rapper known for a lyrically thoughtful, musically
polyglot approach to hip-hop and for serving as a bridge between
generations of British rap, died on May 7 in London. He was 47.

His death was announced on a
\href{https://www.gofundme.com/f/community-support-for-ty}{GoFundMe
page} that had been established by a family friend, Diane Laidlaw, while
he was hospitalized with complications of the coronavirus. He was placed
in a medically induced coma, woke from it and later died of pneumonia.

In the late 1990s and 2000s, just before the early flickers of the
rap-adjacent genre known as grime presaged a sound and scene with a firm
British identity, Ty was among the most adventurous British M.C.s --- a
wordplay-focused scene-builder indebted to American movements like the
Native Tongues and the New York underground.

Ty didn't fit neatly into any hip-hop archetypes, in England or anywhere
else. ``I hate the word alternative,'' he told
\href{https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/ty-hip-hop-has-no-culture-856859.html}{The
Independent} in 2008. ``I hate the word off-key, I hate the word jazzy
and I hate the word laid-back. I'm not a laid-back person.''

But even though he was difficult to neatly categorize, Ty was widely
respected for his relaxed but complex storytelling. Charlie Sloth, the
British hip-hop D.J. and radio host, called him ``a true foundation of
UK rap'' in a
\href{https://twitter.com/CharlieSloth/status/1258482571219959818?s=20}{Twitter
tribute}.

Ty was born Benedict Okwuchukwu Godwin Chijioke on Aug. 17, 1972, in
London to parents who had emigrated from Nigeria. He was raised in the
Brixton neighborhood, apart from a long spell during his younger years
when his parents left him and his sister in private foster care with a
white family in Jaywick, Essex, an experience that left lasting scars of
identity confusion.

``I learned, long way, to love who I am. To love my identity, my
nationality. I learned with bloodied lips,'' he told
\href{https://www.channel4.com/news/the-west-african-children-brought-up-by-white-foster-families-in-the-english-countryside}{England's
Channel 4 News} last year.

In the 1990s, Ty worked as a sound engineer, and in 1995, he co-founded
Ghetto Grammar, a London workshop series that functioned at the
intersection of hip-hop and spoken word. He began recording music in the
late 1990s alongside British hip-hop figures like Funky DL and Shortee
Blitz. He also was a host of the Lyrical Lounge club night at the
crucial venue Jazz Café.

In 2001 he released his casually jaunty debut album, ``Awkward,'' which
featured strong storytelling and had echoes of acid jazz and 1990s New
York rap. His 2003 follow-up, ``Upwards,'' was more ambitious in its
music and narrative.

The album was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, the annual British
music award (now simply the Mercury Prize). His third album, ``Closer,''
was full of dreamy electro-adjacent production and featured his most
overt engagement with American hip-hop, including collaborations with De
La Soul, Speech of Arrested Development, Bahamadia and more.

But Ty always remained interested in strengthening the ties between
generations of British rappers, which became even more fragmented after
the ascendance of grime.

He appeared on a remix of Bashy's ``Black Boys,'' an influential 2007
protest song, alongside the future grime star Skepta and others.

Ty continued releasing music into the late 2010s, including with Umar
Bin Hassan of the Last Poets and the highly regarded jazz saxophonist
Soweto Kinch. He was also part of
\href{https://kingdemrodneyptyandblaktwang.bandcamp.com/album/the-kingdem-ep}{Kingdem},
a cross-generational supergroup of British rap elders, which also
featured Rodney P (of London Posse) and Blak Twang.

Ty's survivors include his mother and his sister, Maria.
