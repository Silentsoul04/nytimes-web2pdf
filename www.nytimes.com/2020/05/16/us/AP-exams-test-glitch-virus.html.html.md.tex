Anxieties}\label{glitches-in-online-ap-tests-add-to-students-anxieties}}

Technical problems with the digital versions of the Advanced Placement
exams caused angst for high school students and parents at an already
stressful time.

Julia Rock-Torcivia had everything in place for her Advanced Placement
chemistry test.

She taped a handwritten sign to her bedroom door that said ``Stop!'' in
a warning to family members not to disturb her.

The family's two yappy dogs --- Stella and Nixie, a terrier mix and a
pug-Labrador mix --- were relegated to a room from which they could not
see squirrels. Her parents and sister had agreed not to use the Wi-Fi so
they would not slow down the connection.

The exam started well, she said. But, with six minutes left, she tried
to upload a photo of her answers, and the ``submit'' button froze.

She ran into the living room, sobbing.

``Everyone was yelling out suggestions: `Turn the Wi-Fi on and off! Do
this and do that!''' she said, as her mother, father and sister hovered
over the router trying to help.

Nothing worked. Time ran out. Her test was invalid.

Julia, a 17-year-old junior at Morris Hills High School in Rockaway,
N.J., soon realized it was not just her: Students in her class, and
thousands across the country, had also experienced problems with their
A.P. exams.

Technical glitches during the online exams were the latest problem
students have confronted as they navigate testing, college applications
and college visits remotely during the coronavirus pandemic.

Testing problems have heightened stress for students and families
figuring out a process that's anxiety-inducing even under the best of
circumstances.

The College Board, a nonprofit organization that administers the A.P.
exams, said that submission issues had affected fewer than 1 percent of
the roughly 2.2 million tests taken this week and that students would
have the opportunity to retake tests next month.

``We share the deep disappointment of students who were unable to
complete their exam --- whether for technical issues or other reasons,''
Zach Goldberg, a College Board spokesman, said in a statement. ``We're
working to understand these students' unique circumstances in advance of
the June makeup exams.''

The College Board said on Sunday that beginning Monday, if students are
unable to upload their responses to the exam website, they can submit
them by email immediately after the exam.

The College Board said in March that it would administer digital
versions of the A.P. exams. The tests are a capstone to advanced high
school courses that determine whether students can, in some cases, get
credit for and avoid taking certain introductory-level courses in
college.

The College Board, which also oversees the SAT, a standardized test that
serves as a gateway to college for millions of applicants each year,
also said that it would
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/sat-act-test-coronavirus.html}{develop
digital versions for students to take at home} in the fall if the
pandemic continues to require social distancing.

A spokesman for the ACT, a rival test, said that it too would move to
at-home digital testing if necessary.

Critics have said that aside from technical difficulties, at-home tests
could worsen inequality and make it easier to cheat. In a recent
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/admissions-scandal.html}{college
admissions scandal}, prosecutors accused some wealthy parents of helping
their children cheat on the tests to get into top universities.

Mr. Goldberg, the College Board spokesman, said that when it became
clear the A.P. test could not be administered in person, 91 percent of
A.P. students surveyed nationwide said they preferred to take the exams
online rather than not be able to take them at all.

Lynn Lubrecht, a math teacher at Morris Knolls High School in Rockaway,
said despite all of the College Board's practice exams and tips for
students on taking the test online, four of her students, out of 50 who
took the exam, had had problems.

``Every test they've ever taken has been in a school, in a room, with a
No. 2 pencil,'' she said. ``Even though there was a trial, when it's the
real deal, there's still a lot of stress.''

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

Joseph DosSantos, one of Mrs. Lubrecht's students, was relieved when he
finished his A.P. calculus exam.

``I initially was like, `Whew, I submitted the test, I'm all good,'''
Joseph said. But when he double-checked his work and after he had
already submitted the test, he realized he had accidentally uploaded the
wrong photo of his answers for one problem.

He ran into the hallway outside his parents' home office, where he was
taking the test, panic-stricken.

``He said: `Oh my God! I can't believe this! All that work!''' said his
mother, Sarina DosSantos, who urged him to calm down and email his
teacher. He is waiting to hear from the College Board about whether he
qualifies for a retest in June.

Julia, who will retake the A.P. chemistry exam next month, said she had
struggled with chemistry and was worried about the makeup test.

In frustration after her exam wouldn't submit, she crumpled the sign
that she had taped to her bedroom door telling family members to keep
out.
