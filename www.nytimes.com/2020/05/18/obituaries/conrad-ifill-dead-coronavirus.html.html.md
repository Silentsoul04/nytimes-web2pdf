*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

Conrad Ifill, the owner of Conrad’s Famous Bakery in Brooklyn, learned
to bake out of necessity.

“He grew up in Trinidad and Tobago with seven siblings,” said his
daughter Jillian Ifill Demming. “With a family that big he always said
they never had enough bread, so he started making it himself.”

Mr. Ifill — a fixture in central Brooklyn’s Little Caribbean
neighborhood, known for his generosity and his nine rum fruit cake —
died on April 17 at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital in Hempstead, N.Y.
He was 81. The cause was the novel coronavirus, Ms. Ifill Demming said.

In 1981, Mr. Ifill walked away from a career as a data processor on Wall
Street to pursue his dream of owning his own business. He opened
Conrad’s Famous Bakery on Utica Avenue in the Crown Heights
neighborhood. In 2015 he opened a second location on Church Avenue in
East Flatbush.

Conrad’s Famous Bakery quickly gained popularity with homesick
immigrants yearning for a taste of the Caribbean.

“Even if people weren’t able to get pastries specifically from their
home islands, they could always find something that would remind them of
home — currant rolls, guava tarts and, of course, hard dough bread,” his
son, Andre Ifill, said. “His bread was so buttery, it would just melt in
your mouth.”

Monty Atwell, who worked at the bakery for 40 years, attributed Mr.
Ifill’s success to his focus on quality. “He was a very strict boss,” he
said. “He always made sure to check on what we were doing. He wanted
everything the way he liked it.”

Despite his no-nonsense work ethic, Mr. Atwell said that Mr. Ifill cared
deeply about his employees. “It was really important to him that we stay
open through the virus because he knew that he had people depending on
him.”

Mr. Ifill was born on June 10, 1938, in San Fernando, Trinidad and
Tobago, to Eudora Ifill, a homemaker, and Joseph Ifill, who worked in an
oil field. He left the island for Montreal, Canada, in 1968 before
arriving in the United States in the early 1970s.

In New York City, he participated in several cultural groups including
the Trinidad and Tobago Community Association and was honored as a grand
marshal in the 2016 West-Indian Day Parade.

“He was always encouraging people to keep the culture alive,” said
Andrea Sealy, a chairwoman of the West-Indian American Day Carnival
Association, which organizes the parade. “Any group that needed help
with their events, he would always donate food or try to help in some
way.”

In addition to his son and daughter, Mr. Ifill is survived by his wife,
Faye Ifill, another daughter, Andrea Ifill, and a
granddaughter.
