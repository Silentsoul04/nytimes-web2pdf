# Germany’s Coronavirus Protests: Anti-Vaxxers, Anticapitalists, Neo-Nazis

The pandemic marginalized the far right, as Germans rallied behind
Angela Merkel. But the reopening has brought them back, and they are
preparing to seize new opportunities.

BERLIN — Outside Germany’s Parliament building, a vegan celebrity cook
grabbed the mic and shouted that he was “ready to die” to stop
self-serving elites from using the pandemic to topple the world order.
Some distance away, a group of women discussed how Bill Gates was
plotting to force immunization on the population. Youngsters sporting
cardboard cutouts of the German constitution chanted: “End the corona
dictatorship\!” Few wore masks, and those that did came with slogans
like “Merkel’s muzzle.”

Even as Germany is celebrated as Europe’s[foremost example of pandemic
management](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html),
an eclectic protest movement that began last month with a few dozen
people marching against coronavirus restrictions has ballooned into more
than 10,000 demonstrators in cities across the country.

The one driving force behind the mobilization is the country’s far
right, particularly the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which had
been marginalized by the
[pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/world/coronavirus-news.html).
Now, the AfD’s leaders see the protests as a first step toward moving
back into the national conversation, using them to position their
message for the months ahead, when Germany must confront job losses and
a battered economy.

“The crisis is coming, it isn’t here yet,” said Nicolaus Fest, head of
Berlin’s AfD chapter, who was protesting near the Brandenburg Gate on
Saturday. “Some time soon, a lot of people will be unemployed.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Alongside
[anti-vaxxers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/health/vaccines-protest-doctors.html),
anticapitalists and ordinary citizens concerned about job losses and
safety at reopened nurseries and schools, the marches have attracted
neo-Nazis, hooligans and, consistently, members of the AfD, a [party
best known for its noisy
nationalism](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/world/europe/germany-election-afd.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer)
and anti-immigrant views.

They rarely organize the protests. But the AfD and more extreme
far-right groups are trying to capitalize on the discontent as they
begin positioning themselves for what may be a much uglier political
scene some months from now if the economy deteriorates further, as most
economists expect.

“When the depression hits and people really start feeling it, they will
start asking: Who do we share the little that is left with? Who belongs
and who does not?” said [Götz
Kubitschek](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/magazine/the-prophet-of-germanys-new-right.html?searchResultPosition=3),
a far-right publisher and the most prominent ideologue of Germany’s
so-called New Right.

Then, Mr. Kubitschek predicted in a recent interview, “it will become a
question of identity.”

Germany’s domestic intelligence office, which recently classified both
Mr. Kubitschek’s Institute for State Politics and a group of AfD
politicians close to him as extremist, is worried.

“We see a trend that extremists, especially far-right extremists, are
weaponizing the demonstrations,” Thomas Haldenwang, president of the
agency, told the German newspaper Welt on Sunday. “There is a risk that
far-right extremists, with their image of who the enemy is and their
ambitions to undermine the state, will take the lead of a movement that
for now is attended mostly by citizens who are loyal to the
constitution.”

“We are concerned that extremists are using the current situation in
exactly the same way as the so-called refugee crisis,” Mr. Haldenwang
said.

Some have already compared the coronavirus protests to the protests
against the refugee crisis in 2015, when Pegida — Patriotic Europeans
Against the Islamization of the West — drew hundreds and then thousands
of marchers every week before turning into a potent incubator of
far-right extremism.

“We are the people,” the slogan associated with Pegida marches, is now
popular at the coronavirus protests, too.

Then as now, Chancellor Angela Merkel was celebrated as an exemplary
leader who navigated her country through extraordinary
circumstances.

But in early 2016, the mood began to shift. A year later, the AfD became
the first far-right party to enter the federal Parliament since World
War II. It is now the biggest opposition party, with seats in every
state legislature in the country.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Some lawmakers from Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats speak privately of
a sense of déjà vu — and worry that by the time the next election is
scheduled, in the fall of 2021, the AfD might once again eat into
conservative votes.

The pandemic arrived in Germany at a moment when the influence of the
far right, and its ability to crack open the political system from the
local level up, was strong. Mainstream parties, Ms. Merkel’s Christian
Democrats included, worried about losing votes.

As recently as February, the fallout from an inconclusive election in
the eastern state of Thuringia, where a [particularly extreme
chapter](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/world/europe/afd-election-east-germany-hoecke.html)
of the AfD became the second-strongest party, ultimately [brought
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/world/europe/annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-resign.html)
the chancellor’s anointed successor in Berlin.

When the virus began spreading, the situation changed. Almost overnight,
Germans rallied [behind their
chancellor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/europe/coronavirus-merkel-germany.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
and the monthlong shutdown that slowed the spread of the virus and
allowed the country to get through its first wave of infections with a
[relatively low death
toll](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html).

But now that very success has become one thing driving the protests.

“They told us this virus was so dangerous that we had to give up all our
democratic freedoms,” said Sabine Martin, a mother of two who marched in
Berlin on Saturday for the third weekend in a row. “But we are no fools:
Our hospitals are half empty.”

“I’m not afraid of this virus,” she added. “I’m afraid of the
recession.”

Some call it the prevention paradox: Because Germany has been relatively
successful in containing the disease, it is becoming harder to persuade
people that the pandemic still presents a real danger, and easier for
conspiracy theorists and populists to spin narratives of deceit.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This so-called pandemic is nothing but the flu,” scoffed Robert Farle,
a state lawmaker of the AfD. He has been joining protests in his eastern
hometown, Magdeburg.

In Berlin, the AfD dominated one of about 20 protests, each limited to
50 people, near the Brandenburg Gate. “Germany,” “Constitution” and
“Freedom,” their signs
read.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in

        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

But in conversation, the topic quickly returned to the AfD’s hallmark
issue of immigration. Several of the protesters felt vindicated by a
crisis that forced Germany to swiftly close its borders.

“They shut the borders, they stopped refugees from coming in,” Mr.
Kubitschek, the far-right publisher, said. “It proves that it can all be
done.”

For now, despite the noise they make, the protesters remain a small
minority. [A recent survey found that two in three
Germans](https://presse.wdr.de/plounge/tv/das_erste/2020/05/20200507_ard_deutschlandtrend_3.html)
are satisfied with the government’s response to the crisis. Six out of
10 say they are not worried if certain freedoms have to be curtailed for
longer. Ms. Merkel’s party remains the most popular in the country, with
nearly four in 10 voters saying they would support it, the highest level
since 2017.

But the European Commission expects the German economy to shrink by 6.5
percent this year, the worst performance since World War II. The AfD’s
popularity, which early on in the crisis slumped below 10 percent, has
begun to edge up.

Many worry that a prolonged economic slump might open up new voter
potential for the party, which has found most of its support in the
former Communist East. The biggest protests in recent weeks, however,
have been in Stuttgart, the wealthy western heartland of Germany’s car
industry.

In the seven years since the AfD was founded, Germany has consistently
enjoyed economic growth and low unemployment, said Matthias Quent, an
expert on far-right extremism and the director of [an
institute](https://www.idz-jena.de/ueber-das-institut/mitarbeitende/)
that studies democracy and civil society. “We just don’t know what the
AfD looks like in a recession,” Mr. Quent said. “It worries me,” he
added. “Historically, big recessions tend to feed populist
narratives.”

And it is not just the AfD that has seen the fallout from the
coronavirus crisis as an opportunity.

Message boards are flush with far-right conspiracy theories and prepper
groups, which have long fantasized about a crisis so deep that it would
lead to the collapse of Germany’s liberal order, said Stephan Kramer,
the head of the regional office of the domestic intelligence agency in
Thuringia.

“They are mobilizing,” Mr. Kramer said. “The corona crisis feeds into
their narrative of a decline in Western liberalism. It feeds militancy
and potentially violence.”

The authorities are on high alert. Over the past year, far-right
terrorists have assassinated a regional politician on his front porch
near Kassel, attacked a synagogue in Halle, and in February, killed 10
people in Hanau. Even before the pandemic hit Germany, far-right
extremism and far-right terrorism had been [officially
identified](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/germany-afd.html)
as the biggest danger for the country’s democracy.

“That has not changed,” Mr. Kramer said. “On the contrary. This plays
into their hands.”
