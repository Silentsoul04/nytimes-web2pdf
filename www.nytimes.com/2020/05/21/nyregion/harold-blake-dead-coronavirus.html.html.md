*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus)*.*

During the Depression, Harold Blake’s father, who had retired with a
disability pension from the New York City Sanitation Department,
instilled in his son the value of a civil service job: It was secure. So
when Mr. Blake was finally offered one, after working for a failed
brokerage on Wall Street and a trucking company, he jumped at the
opportunity.

It was a clerk’s position at the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority
paying $2,580 a year, $300 more than a comparable job in city
government. Nevertheless, a neighbor who worked for the city advised him
not to take it.

“You don’t want to go to work for that guy Moses,” the neighbor warned.
“He’s a slave driver.”

Mr. Blake ignored the advice and in 1952 joined the authority, a
quasi-public agency run by Robert Moses, the imperious urban planner
immortalized in [Robert A.
Caro’](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/01/magazine/robert-caro-working-memoir.html)s
Pulitzer Prize-winning 1974 biography, “The Power Broker.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When Mr. Moses became president of the 1964-65 World’s Fair in New York,
Mr. Blake joined him as his executive assistant. He returned to the
authority as personnel director in 1971 and remained in contact with
[Mr.
Moses](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/30/obituaries/robert-moses-master-builder-is-dead-at-92.html)
almost daily until Mr. Moses’s death in 1981 at 92. By then many other
former colleagues and supporters had abandoned him.

Mr. Blake died of the new coronavirus on May 10 at a Manhattan hospital.
He was 91. His death was confirmed by Dave Gentile, a nephew by
marriage.

In an email, Mr. Caro said of Mr. Blake: “He helped me know and
understand the poignance of Robert Moses’s last years, when Moses had
been stripped of power. He told me once, ‘It’s sad to see’ — and he
helped me understand how sad it was. Loyal to ‘RM’ to the end, he was
bitter about those who, once his power was gone, dropped him.”

In “The Power Broker,” Mr. Blake described [William J.
Ronan](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/nyregion/william-j-ronan-architect-of-the-metropolitan-transportation-authority-dies-at-101.html),
a Rockefeller ally who deposed Mr. Moses with the creation of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as having a “smug,
college-professor look,” which Mr. Moses tolerated, he said, because he
wanted “to stay in public life, so what do you do? Swallow your pride.”

Harold James Blake was born on April 5, 1929, in Greenwich Village and
never left the neighborhood. His Irish-born mother, Mary (Lennon) Blake,
was a hotel chambermaid. His father, Patrick, opened a candy store in
the Village after retiring from the Sanitation Department.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Harold graduated from St. Alphonsus High School in Manhattan, served in
the Army stateside during the Korean War and earned a degree in business
administration from New York University after attending classes at
night. He retired in 1987.

In [an
interview](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/interviews/harold-blake-xvv7o2)
in 2016 with the New York Public Library Community Oral History Project,
Mr. Blake said that he had few regrets; that contrary to Mr. Moses’s
image as “a bulldozer, I couldn’t have worked for a nicer man”; and that
after nine decades “the more I live the more I enjoy seeing the Village
change.”

His only lament had to do with the World’s Fair. He was so busy, he
said, “many of the exhibits I never set foot
in.”
