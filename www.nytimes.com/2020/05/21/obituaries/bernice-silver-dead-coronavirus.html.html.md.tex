\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Bernice Silver, a hummingbird of a woman at 4-foot-8, was a puppeteer
whose performances were mock-chaotic, subtly cerebral and always slyly
subversive. She made sure to slip in a history lesson, or a plug for
conservation or social justice. She called them happenings, for the
political theater she was schooled in.

Her fellow puppeteers called her
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muhRXY_1IPI}{the Queen of
Potpourri}, for the fast-and-furious storytelling form at which she
excelled. (Potpourris, as these performances are known because they
contain a little bit of everything, are a beloved feature of puppetry
festivals.)

Ms. Silver died of respiratory failure on April 18 at Englewood Health,
a hospital in Englewood, N.J., said Dean Freedman, her nephew. She was
106. She had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

Ms. Silver was a member of the sprawling tribe of troubadours and
activists who inhabit the overlapping worlds of folk music, social
justice, puppetry and political theater. Pete Seeger had been a friend
and fan. (Ms. Silver had long been involved with the
\href{https://www.clearwater.org/}{Hudson River Sloop Clearwater}, Mr.
Seeger's environmental organization.)

The \href{https://breadandpuppet.org}{Bread and Puppet Theater} once
halted a show mid-performance to honor her. That tribute was at an event
in Manhattan a month after the 2016 election, about which she declared,
with typical good humor: ``Where there's light, there's hope. Where
there's dirt, there's soap.''
\href{https://www.facebook.com/groups/178715305925/}{The Bernice Silver
Appreciation Society} on Facebook has been flooded with accolades since
her death.

The world of puppetry, said John Bell, director of the
\href{https://bimp.uconn.edu}{Ballard Institute and Museum of
Puppetry}at the University of Connecticut, ``is multifaceted,
permanently in flux, and ranges from the well-known arts of children's
entertainment and education to serious drama and avant-garde spectacle
and performance.''

``\href{http://puppetvision.blog/2014/10/happy-101st-birthday-bernice-silver/}{Bernice
embraced that whole range of work,'' he added.} ``She was a beloved
central figure in American puppetry.''

Bernice Silver was born Oct. 7, 1913, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to Sam and
Frances (Resnikoff) Silver. Her father was an itinerant salesman and
candy store owner. The eldest of eight, she was so sickly as a child
that she couldn't quite believe that she had outlived her siblings, Mr.
Freedman said. The family was poor and moved often, finally ending up in
a tenement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Ms. Silver was trained as a nursery school teacher. She also worked at
factories making candy, Eskimo Pies and radios; later, in the 1940s, she
sold encyclopedias and hair care products door to door in California.

She learned activism and political theater in New York in the 1930s,
joining groups that were part of the workers' theater movement of the
time and giving agitprop performances on street corners and in
factories, sneaking in through windows and singing to striking workers.
She was always up for a good rally, and
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gX8Hhraz8Q}{joined the Occupy
Wall Street protesters} at Zuccotti Park in 2011.

It is not clear exactly when she became a puppeteer, or why, her nephew
said, but he noted that puppetry can be a form of activism, and maybe
that's what drew her to it, sometime in the early 1960s.

For more than a half-century, Ms. Silver lived in a studio apartment on
the corner of West 95th Street and Riverside Drive in Manhattan, which
Mr. Freedman described as chockablock with books and fliers and sheet
music and puppets stuffed in drawers.

She had been living --- and performing --- since 2016 at the Lillian
Booth Actor's Home in Englewood and was a participant in the New England
Centenarian Study at Boston University's School of Medicine. In addition
to her nephew Mr. Freedman, she is survived by several other nephews.

``At first glance you might dismiss Bernice as just a little old lady
with puppets,'' Mr. Bell said. ``But she was telling stories about
history and democracy. They weren't just fairy stories for children. She
believed the role of the arts was to support justice and equality.''
