*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

[John
Driscoll’s](http://www.driscollbabcock.com/exhibitions/installation/john-driscoll-1949-2020#works)
first visit to a museum, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, at age 10,
had been a tedious affair until he came upon
[“Lucretia,”](https://collections.artsmia.org/art/529/lucretia-rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn)
Rembrandt’s painting of the suicide of a Roman nobleman’s wife.

Her gown is bloody. A dagger is still in her right hand.

“And I can tell you right now that painting went through me like a
freight train,” Dr. Driscoll recalled in 2019. “I don’t know if I was
shaking on the outside, but I was shaking on the inside. I was
mesmerized.”

He soon began craving more of that type of sensory experience, and he
would go on to find it often in a career in art that included owning the
venerable [Driscoll Babcock Galleries](http://www.driscollbabcock.com/)
in Manhattan and assembling a major collection of English studio
pottery.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He died on April 10 in Peekskill, N.Y., at 70. His death, which was not
widely reported at the time, was caused by the new coronavirus,
according to his wife, Marylyn Dintenfass, a painter.

When Dr. Driscoll bought Babcock Galleries — on East 80th Street near
Madison Avenue — in 1987, he had already held several curatorial jobs
and been a partner in a Boston gallery. At Babcock — New York’s oldest
gallery, having opened in 1852 — he widened its focus, combining
historical and more recent work under one roof. Where the gallery had
specialized in early 20th-century art and the American Modernism of
artists like Marsden
[Hartley](https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.1375.html), he
added 19th-century paintings, in particular landscapes by the Hudson
River School, as well as the work of post-World War II artists.

“He was one of the first dealers who had come as a scholar from the
museum world and one of the first to combine earlier historical art with
more contemporary art,” Barbara Haskell, a curator at the [Whitney
Museum of American Art](https://whitney.org), said in an interview.

Dr. Driscoll’s biography “John Frederick Kensett: An American Master”
(1985) — one of many books he wrote — helped establish him as a leading
authority on that [Hudson River artist known for his
luminist](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kens/hd_kens.htm)paintings.

John Paul Driscoll was born on Oct. 28, 1949, in Madison, Minn., and
grew up nearby in Clarkfield, a farming village. His mother, Vida
(Loafman) Driscoll, owned dry cleaning shops, a cafe and a uniform
store. His father, Paul, was a high school teacher and coach.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With his father’s encouragement, John hunted for agates and Native
American artifacts and collected coins and stamps. He grew so enamored
with the beauty of early American coins that he started his own
coin-dealing business when he was about 12.

“His father once read in the paper that there was a coin show in town,”
Ms. Dintenfass said in a phone interview. “And after telling John, who
was 14 or 15, he saw that John’s name was on it — that he’d put the
whole thing together without telling his parents.”

After earning a bachelor’s degree in history and art history at the
University of Minnesota, Morris, Dr. Driscoll studied for a master’s in
art history at Penn State University, where he also earned a Ph.D. in
American art.

His interest in collecting ceramics, in particular British pottery,
began when he was a graduate assistant at the Museum of Art at Penn
State [(now the Palmer Museum of Art)](https://palmermuseum.psu.edu/).

Captivated by the pots, he found he could afford them even on his modest
salary. Paying from $4 to $80 for individual pieces, he bought works by
significant contemporary potters like [Lucie
Rie](http://www.artnet.com/artists/lucie-rie/), [John
Ward](https://www.oxfordceramics.com/artists/89-john-ward/overview/),
[Annette
Fuchs](https://www.20thcenturyforum.com/t11375-annette-fuchs)and Hans
Coper. Soon he traveled to England to visit potters, including Ms. Rie
and Mr. Ward, spending $3,000 on 50 to 60 pots.

Dr. Driscoll continued to amass a world-class collection of pottery
privately as he rose to registrar at the Penn State museum; curator of
the private art holdings of the [William H. Lane
Foundation](https://www.mfa.org/give/gifts-art/lane-collection)in
Leominster, Mass.; guest curator at the [Worcester Art
Museum](https://www.worcesterart.org/) in Massachusetts; and partner at
Driscoll & Walsh Fine Arts in Boston in the mid-1980s. After acquiring
Babcock in New York, he renamed it [Driscoll Babcock
Galleries](http://www.driscollbabcock.com/) in 2012.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Driscoll sold works both to private collectors and to museums,
including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art,
the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts,
where he first saw “Lucretia.”

In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughters, Emily and
Gillian Driscoll; his stepdaughters, Sharon Katz and Elana Amsterdam;
his stepsons, Robert and Marc Katz; his brothers, Charles and Robert;
and five grandchildren. His marriage to Jeanne Baker ended in divorce.

In 2015, Dr. Driscoll arranged the purchase of one of two surviving
versions of [Emanuel Leutze’s “Washington Crossing the
Delaware](https://www.mmam.org/collections),” from 1851. A collector who
had lent it to the White House for 35 years sold it to the founders of
the Minnesota Marine Art Museum in Winona.

“It’s probably the most famous American painting west of the Hudson
River,” Dr. Driscoll [said when it was
unveiled](https://www.startribune.com/washington-crossing-the-delaware-lands-in-winona-museum/297329091/).
“At auction, this picture would have pulled out not only art collectors
but ultrapatriots who are very wealthy.”

After his death, Mary Burrichter, one of the museum’s founders, lauded
his help as an adviser.

“We would get comments from guests like, ‘This museum belongs on the
East Coast or West Coast; why is it in a small town of 27,000 and not in
a major city?’” [she told the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis.](https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-born-art-scholar-john-driscoll-dies-of-covid-19-complications/569964762/)
“John just loved that feedback.”
