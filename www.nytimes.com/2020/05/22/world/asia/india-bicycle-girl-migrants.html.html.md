A 15-year-old migrant girl pedaled hundreds of miles to bring her
injured father back to their home village. India’s cycling federation

<div class="css-53u6y8">

NEW DELHI — She was a 15-year-old with a simple mission: bring papa
home.  
  
Jyoti Kumari and her dad had nearly no money, no transport, and their
village was halfway across India.  
  
And her dad, an out-of-work migrant laborer, was injured and could
barely walk.  
  
So Jyoti told her dad: Let *me* take you home. He thought the idea was
crazy but went along with it. She then jumped on a $20 purple bike
bought with the last of their savings. With her dad perched on the rear,
she pedaled from the outskirts of New Delhi to their home village, 700
miles away.  
  
"Don’t worry, mummy,” she reassured her mother along the way, using
borrowed cellphones. “I will get Papa home good.”

During the past two months under India’s coronavirus lockdown, millions
of migrant laborers and their families have poured out of India’s
cities, desperate and penniless, as they try to get back to their native
villages where they can rely on family networks to survive.

Many haven’t made it. Some have been crushed by trains; others run over
by trucks. A few have simply collapsed while trudging down a long, hot
highway, dead from exhaustion.  
  
But amid all this pain and sadness now emerges a tale of devotion and
straight-up grit. The Indian press has seized upon this feel-good story,
gushing about Jyoti [the
“lionhearted](https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-she-is-indeed-my-shravan-kumar-15-year-old-girl-brings-father-from-gurugram-to-bihar-on-bicycle-2825465).”

And a few days ago, the story got even better.

While resting up in her village, Jyoti received a call from the [Cycling
Federation of
India](http://www.cyclingfederationofindia.org/about.html). Convinced
she had the right stuff, Onkar Singh, the federation’s chairman, invited
her to New Delhi for a tryout with the national team.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“She has great talent,” Mr. Singh said.

Reached by phone on Friday in her village of Sirhulli, in Bihar, one of
India’s poorest states, Jyoti said in a scratchy voice barely above a
whisper, because she still sounded exhausted: “I’m elated, I really want
to
go.”

As India struggles with the coronavirus and the severe measures to
contain it, the plight of the nation’s migrant workers has become a
crisis within a crisis.

Within hours of a national lockdown imposed on March 25, [thousands upon
thousands of migrant laborers began to bolt from the
cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-india-migrants.html).
Many had gravitated to urban areas for work and lived hand-to-mouth, as
rickshaw pullers, tea sellers, brick haulers on construction sites.

When it becomes a matter of survival, said Priya Deshingkar, a professor
of migration and development at the University of Sussex, migrant
laborers “will try to go home, because that is where their real social
safety net lies.”

That’s exactly why Jyoti hit the road.

Her father, Mohan Paswan, a rickshaw driver from a lower rung of India’s
caste system, was injured in a traffic accident in January and was
running out of money even before the lockdown. He was among the legions
of migrant workers performing menial jobs in the shadows of Gurugram, a
satellite city of New Delhi and home to corridors of shimmering glass
towers and many millionaires.

Jyoti came out from their village in Bihar to care for Mr. Paswan. She
had dropped out of school a year ago because the family didn’t have
enough money. Things got even worse after the lockdown, with their
landlord threatening to kick them out and then cutting off their
electricity.

When Jyoti came up with the escape plan, her father shook his head.

“I said, ‘Look, daughter, it’s not four or five kilometers that you will
drag me from here. It’s 12-, 13-hundred kilometers. How will we go?’’ he
said in a video broadcast by the BBC’s Hindi service.

The two bought a simple girl’s bike for the equivalent of about $20. On
May 8, they set off, Jyoti at the handlebars, dad sitting pillion on
back. Jyoti was pretty confident on a bike, having ridden a lot in her
village.

Many days they had little food. They slept at gas stations. They lived
off the generosity of strangers. Jyoti said that except for one short
lift on a truck, she pedaled nearly 100 miles a day. It wasn’t easy. Her
father is big, and he was carrying a
bag.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

As they moved down the long roads under the withering sun, many people
teased them, saying it was ridiculous for a girl to pedal while her
father sat on the back.

“Father would become upset when he heard such things, but I told him not
to worry as people did not know that he was wounded,” Jyoti[told an
interviewer at The
Wire](https://thewire.in/rights/jyoti-kumari-bihar-gurgaon-cycle-covid-19-lockdown),
an Indian publication. (Over the past few days, she has done [a lot of
interviews](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/15-year-old-girl-brings-father-from-gurugram-to-bihar-on-bicycle-87464)).

After they arrived in their village last weekend, her father went into a
quarantine center — many states in India have tried to sequester migrant
laborers returning from the cities, to stop the coronavirus from
reaching deep into the countryside. How well that is working is
unclear.

As the lockdown has relaxed, infections are rising quickly. India has
reported around 120,000, [its curve one of
the](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-virus-cases-cross-100000-jump-at-fastest-pace-in-asia/articleshow/75829868.cms)steepest
among large countries. Many health experts believe the real numbers are
even higher but hidden because of India’s relatively low rates of
testing.

Jyoti’s mother convinced village elders to let her quarantine at home.
She was exhausted and soon besieged by reporters.

Then, a few days later, on Thursday morning, she got The Call.

The Cycling Federation of India, which scouts young talent and sends the
best to international competitions, including the Olympics, tracked her
down through a journalist. Mr. Singh, the chairman, said he had been
moved by how far she pedaled with a heavy person on the back.  
“And luggage,” Mr. Singh was quick to add.

The federation is planning to bring her to New Delhi via “something
comfortable, like an AC train,” he said, referring to the
air-conditioned service. She will then do a series of cycling tests.

As for how much she actually rode versus the help she received from
trucks, Mr. Singh acknowledged that maybe the story had become a bit
stretched, totally understandable in times like these.

But one thing was not in doubt, Mr. Singh said.

“She has guts.”

Jeffrey Gettleman reported from New Delhi and Suhasini Raj from Lucknow,
India. Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.
