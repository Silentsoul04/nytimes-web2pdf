65}\label{sal-capozucca-rock-drummer-with-a-real-estate-gig-dies-at-65}}

He had a day job as a broker specializing in townhouses, but his heart
belonged with his rock 'n' roll drum set and his local band. He died of
Covid-19.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/series/people-who-have-died-of-the-coronavirus}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

The Rousers, a rock band formed by a couple of high school buddies from
Connecticut, once veered close to stardom when a young Madonna opened
for them at Max's Kansas City in 1981, right before that incubator of
downtown Manhattan cool closed.

That same year, the band released a single, ``Party Boy.''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/08/movies/new-faces-a-guide-to-fresh-talent-now-on-the-local-scene.html}{``Psychedelic
rockabilly''} is how the critic Robert Palmer of The New York Times
described it.

After the release the band switched out their drummer for Sal King ---
born Salvatore Michael Capozucca --- a handsome, powerful player with a
sparkly 1960s-era Ludwig drum kit and a florid, swing-inspired style.
Like his new bandmates, Tom Milmore, the lead guitarist, and Bill
Dickson, the bass player, Sal had been playing since he was a child. In
his case, since age 3, when an uncle gave him a drum set.

Fame may have eluded the band, yet as the decades wore on and their hair
turned gray, \href{https://www.facebook.com/TheRousersNYC/}{the Rousers}
continued playing. They rehearsed every week and performed year round,
though some years less than others as family responsibilities and day
jobs demanded more of their time.

Mr. Capozucca --- or Mr. Cappi, as he called himself at work --- became
a successful real estate broker, with a specialty in Brooklyn
brownstones. He married his longtime girlfriend, Veronica Griffith, in
1983. She had spotted him across the dance floor at Club 82, a storied
drag bar on East 4th Street, 11 years earlier. On that night, Mr.
Capozucca --- always a flashy dresser (David Bowie was his hero) --- was
peacocking in blue satin pants and a white satin scarf.

Mr. Capozucca died on May 13 at N.Y.U. Langone Health hospital in
Manhattan, where he had spent the last two months being treated for
Covid-19, his wife said. He was 65.

Mr. Capozucca was born on April 28, 1955, in Brooklyn. His father, Tony
Capozucca, was a salesman, his mother, Betty Jean (Gibbons) Capozucca, a
legal secretary.

As a teenager, Sal played at proms, weddings and street festivals. He
loved Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa, and made sure to work a drum solo into
his performances. In addition to his wife, Mr. Capozucca is survived by
his daughter, Victoria; his brother, John; and his sister, Vera.

``Things happen for a reason,''
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/nyregion/new-york-punk-out-of-retirement.html}{Mr.
Capozucca told The New York Times in 2017}, in an article about a new
New York City club scene for aging rockers and their sometimes arthritic
fans (early sets!). ``It wasn't meant to be. That life, that rock 'n'
roll life, is a life of heavy partying. So being famous might have led
to my early demise.''

In late February, the Rousers played a gig at Bowery Electric, with a
set that featured songs like ``Old Man Band,'' a sendup of the Rousers'
demographic (sample lyric: ``older and slower than we were before/you
should listen as we rock some more''). They played so well, said Mr.
Milmore, they surprised themselves. ``Sal called me the next day and
said, `What the hell happened to us? How come we were that good?'''

Less than a month later, Mr. Capozucca was hospitalized.

``The band was always a celebration of our friendship and our long time
together,'' Mr. Milmore said. ``We were just brothers, and it was always
about that before anything else. Of course, Sal was always mad we
weren't famous.''
