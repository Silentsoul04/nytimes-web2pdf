Inside the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home was a man who had served as a jailer
to Hitler’s top aide. A man who had rescued Japanese kamikaze pilots
from the sea. A man who carried memories of a concentration camp.

HOLYOKE, Mass. — In 1945, James Leach Miller returned from the war and
said nothing.

He said nothing about it to his wife, not for 64 years of marriage. He
folded up his Army uniform, with the medals still pinned to it, and put
it in the basement, where his older boy would sometimes take it out to
play soldiers.

He joined the fire department. He went to church on Sundays. He never
complained.

“That generation, they didn’t air their problems,” said his younger son,
Michael. “He would say, ‘It was not a good time. I’ve had better times.’
He would not embellish.”

Mr. Miller was already in his 70s when he began to tell Michael, an Air
Force flight engineer, little bits about landing on Omaha Beach on
D-Day. “Fragments would come out,” his son said. The deafening roar as
they waited for the beach to clear, crowded into a landing ship with
other 21-year-olds. A blur that lasted 24 hours. The buzz-drone of
Messerschmitts. Dust clouds. Mud.

Michael once offered to take him back to Normandy — World War II
veterans were making the journey — but his father shook his head and
said, “I’ve been there once.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This story comes up for a reason. Mr. Miller, 96, who survived what was
for Americans the bloodiest battle of World War II, [died of
complications from the coronavirus on
March 30](https://obits.masslive.com/obituaries/masslive/obituary.aspx?n=james-miller&pid=195864379&fhid=25292)
inside the [Holyoke Soldiers’
Home](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/soldiers-home-in-holyoke). The virus has
spread in more than 40 veterans’ homes in more than 20 states, leading
to the deaths of at least 300 people.

The [conditions
inside](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/us/coronavirus-holyoke-veterans-home.html)
the 247-bed, state-run home, [where Mr. Miller had lived for five
years](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/22/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-veterans-home.html),
were [so
chaotic](https://www.gazettenet.com/Employees-allege-lax-COVID-19-safety-protocols-at-Holyoke-Soldiers-Home-33631412)
that his children cannot recount them without breaking down.

When Mr. Miller lay weak and gasping that weekend, his two daughters, in
a car in the parking lot, pleaded with a nurse on duty over an iPhone to
give him morphine or atropine to relieve his suffering. “She said, ‘we
can’t do it,’ and she started to cry,” said his daughter Linda McKee.
“There was no one there giving orders.”

Michael Miller, at his father’s bedside, did the only thing he could do
— moistened his lips with a sponge on a wooden stick.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“At that point, he was choking,” Ms. McKee said. “He died with no care
whatsoever.”

The question of what went wrong at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home will be
with Massachusetts for a long time.

With [scarce protective
gear](https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/05/01/holyoke-soldiers-home-coronavirus-cases-deaths-outage-families)
and a shortage of staff, the facility’s administrators [combined wards
of infected and uninfected
men](https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/05/staffing-concerns-predated-coronavirus-outbreak-at-holyoke-soldiers-home.html),
and the [virus spread
quickly](https://www.propublica.org/article/superintendent-bragged-about-va-review-of-short-staffed-soldiers-home-two-months-later-73-veterans-are-dead)
through a fragile population.

Of the 210 veterans who were living in the facility in late March, 89
are now dead, 74 having tested positive for the virus. Almost
three-quarters of the veterans inside were infected. It is one of the
highest death tolls of any end-of-life facility in the country.

Multiple investigations have been opened, several of which seek to
determine whether state officials should be charged with negligence
under civil or criminal law. The facility’s superintendent, Bennett
Walsh, [a retired Marine Corps lieutenant
colonel](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/02/metro/holyoke-soldiers-home-has-been-overlooked-understaffed-led-by-inexperience/)with
no nursing home experience, was placed on administrative leave on March
30.

But many in the state are [revisiting
decisions](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/12/opinion/did-baker-administration-pay-lip-service-holyoke-soldiers-home/)
made since 2015, when a moderate, technocratic Republican governor,
Charlie Baker, was elected on [a promise to rein in
spending.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/12/06/baker-cut-million-from-state-budget/mV9k1k6H4Ce9xSkqGC0sHM/story.html)

The facility’s budget increased by 14 percent over the last five years,
according to a spokesman for the state’s health department. Even so,
there were [persistent shortfalls in
staffing](https://pioneerinstitute.org/covid/holyoke-soldiers-home-study-targets-inadequate-nursing-home-staffing-standards/),
and the local unions complained that workers were frequently pressured
to stay for unplanned double shifts. The facility’s previous
superintendent [stepped down
in 2015,](https://www.masslive.com/news/2015/12/holyoke_soldiers_home_meeting_1.html)
declaring that the home could not safely care for the population on the
existing budget.

All this was well known before the coronavirus arrived in the state this
spring, said Erin O’Brien, an associate professor of political science
at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.

“All these regular Massachusetts folks that are now outraged, I don’t
disagree, but veterans’ programs require funding,” she said. “When you
vote to shrink government, it has ramifications.”

## They each had stories

In 1952, young men were returning to the industrial towns of western
Massachusetts [after serving in World War
II](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/01/metro/soldiers-homes-sprung-national-effort-care-wounded-aged-veterans/).
They were kids from poor families. And [they were
damaged](https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/bitstream/handle/2452/237911/ocm39986874-1949-SB-0575.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y):
shellshocked, learning to live without limbs, unable to communicate what
they had seen.

It was [to these
men](http://holyokemass.com/2010/04/27/dedication-of-soldiers-home-in-holyoke-attracts-15000/)
that Gov. Paul Dever, who had fought in the war himself, dedicated the
Holyoke Soldiers’ Home, promising to protect injured veterans from what
he called “the scissors of false economy.”

Fifteen thousand people lined the streets for that day’s parade, and the
facility — built on a hill and illuminated with floodlights — became a
source of great pride in this part of the state.

The men in its wards had some stories.

There was Emilio DiPalma, a retired crane operator, who died of the
coronavirus on April 8.

At 19, an Army staff sergeant, Mr. DiPalma had [guarded Hermann
Goering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlBPFDCNog), the driving force
behind the Nazi concentration camps, during the Nuremberg trials. Mr.
DiPalma called him “Hermann the German.” They didn’t get along.

In [his memoir, “Just a Kid, A Guard at the Nuremberg
Trials,”](https://www.amazon.com/Just-Kid-Guard-Nuremberg-Trials-ebook/dp/B004HFRLJC)Mr.
DiPalma [recalled Goering as arrogant and
uncooperative](https://www.witf.org/2020/05/22/remembering-her-father-a-wwii-veteran-who-stood-guard-at-the-nuremberg-trials/),
often berating him in rapid-fire
German.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Goering used to ask his
young guard to bring him cups of water, which Mr. DiPalma poured out of
a chlorinated pouch.

Goering hated the taste of it, and would grimace and hand it back,
remarking “Bah, Amerikanisch.” After a few rounds of this, “I had had it
with Hermann’s antics,” Mr. DiPalma said.

So the next time, Mr. DiPalma brought him a cup of water from the
toilet. Mr. Goering drank it down, and said, “Ah, gute wasser\!”

“He smiled, and so did I,” Mr. DiPalma wrote. “I guess I felt it was my
little contribution to the war effort.”

There was [Sam
Lococo](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/gazettenet/obituary.aspx?n=samuel-joseph-lococo&pid=196051871&fhid=15489),
a retired postal worker, who contracted coronavirus and died April 16.

At 20, Mr. Lococo had joined the Navy and[shipped out to the South
Pacific](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/04/20/final-salute-for-soldiers-home-vet-who-died-of-coronavirus/).
He lived in fear of attacks by Japanese kamikaze pilots. And at the same
time, he was part of a team that sent out whaleboats to [rescue these
pilots after they had crashed into the
Pacific](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/jul/31/kamikaze-pilot-is-reunited-with-his-us-rescuers/).

In [an interview with a local
historian](https://forbeslibrary.org/store/product/touched-with-fire-an-american-community-in-world-war-ii/),
he recalled looking into the face of one of those battered and
half-drowned men, and seeing terror.

“The Japanese had been taught that the Americans were savages, so
probably he was afraid of us,” he said. “He kept saying in English, ‘You
are going to kill me. You are going to kill me.’” They pulled him from
the sea, dressed his wounds in the sick bay, and transferred him to the
U.S.S. Lexington.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And this was the point of the story. “We treated that pilot like a
king,” Mr. Lococo
said.

Then there were those like Mr. Miller, who didn’t talk about the war.

“As far as his service, what he encountered in Europe, I really am at a
loss, ma’am,” said his oldest son, James P. Miller. “Dad probably just
didn’t want to talk about it. It was past.”

But from time to time, he startled the people around him with his swift,
instinctive response to crisis, James Miller said.

There was a time when a lawn-mower blade flew off an engine in the shop
where he worked, and sliced into a man’s leg so deeply that the other
workers started screaming and ran out, but Jim went to the hurt man and
bound him up, in his quiet way.

Michael recalls sitting with his father and a V.A. psychologist
screening him for signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. “She said, so
what do you do if you’re reading the newspaper and you see something
that upsets you? He said, ‘I turn the page and I read the funny
papers.’”

Only once, in fact, did he see his father overcome with emotion about
the war.

It was in the 1990s, and Jim Miller learned for the first time that
there were people who denied that the Holocaust had occurred. And Mr.
Miller — a man who never got upset about anything — was as angry as his
son had ever seen him. “It’s like he had a hot-point button,” Michael
said.

Mr. Miller dug out a box of old photos, and drove them to a small
Holocaust museum in Springfield, which [eventually sent them to the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington,
D.C](https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn43802).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“He wanted people to remember,” Michael said. “I think, having lived
through all the physical issues, the psychological issues, if someone
says it never really happened, he was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, you folks, you
have no idea.’”

## ‘They were trying to do their jobs’

Mr. Miller’s children had worried about the Soldiers’ Home, enough to
request repeated private meetings with its superintendent, Mr. Walsh.
The trouble, they said, was staffing.

“When you live through those cuts, and have someone physically there,
you feel it every day,” Ms. McKee said.

“They were trying to do their jobs,” she said of the staff, “they just
didn’t have the
means.”

The home had [passed three successive yearly
inspections](https://www.propublica.org/article/superintendent-bragged-about-va-review-of-short-staffed-soldiers-home-two-months-later-73-veterans-are-dead),
meeting or provisionally meeting the standards set by the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs. But the union representing most of the
staff, Chapter 888 of S.E.I.U.,[warned
persistently](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/us/holyoke-soldiers-home-coronavirus/index.html)
that the facility was operating at 80 percent staffing levels..

By March 14, the home was closed to most visitors, like most nursing
facilities in the state. A man in a dementia unit began showing
symptoms, declining so fast that it alarmed Joseph Ramirez, the vice
chair of the union chapter.

“We’re used to seeing death, we know what it looks like when it comes,
but I was in shock, I was just like, ‘Oh, my god,’” he said. The man was
not fully isolated, and staff who treated him were rotated to other
units. “What they had us doing, we were spreading it around,” he
said.

By the third week of March, a quarter of the staff was not reporting to
work, [Mr. Walsh has said through his
lawyer](https://www.gazettenet.com/Soldiers-Home-superintendent-responds-33796782).
To accommodate the low staffing, medical staff decided to consolidate
two units, crowding together infected and uninfected veterans.

Mr. Walsh has said his superiors approved that decision, and were
routinely updated on the distress the facility was in. He said he had
called for help from the National Guard, but been refused.

“No one was kept in the dark,” he said in a statement.

Gov. Baker has said little about these assertions, citing an ongoing
investigation.

Brooke Karanovich, a spokeswoman for the state Executive Office of
Health and Human services, called the deaths at the Soldiers’ Home “a
reminder of the insidious nature of Covid-19.”

She added: “We are deeply saddened by the extent of the outbreak and the
loss of life."

As for Mr. Miller’s children, they have trouble describing that last
weekend without crying.

“We’re very bitter because of the way he died,” said Ms. McKee.

She and her sister, Susan, sat in the parking lot, peering into her
father’s room through her brother’s iPhone. She heard spasms of coughing
from her father’s roommates; two of the three would die that weekend.
She saw a large refrigerated truck pull up to a loading dock in the back
of the facility, for the bodies.

“It was complete panic,” Ms. McKee said. “It was pandemonium. Nobody
knew where to turn. ”

Inside, Michael sat with his father, holding his hand and praying,
reassuring him that he wasn’t alone. Watching him breathe, stop
breathing, and start breathing again.

“I wouldn’t wish that upon anybody,” he said. “It’s something I will
remember for the rest of my life.”

Mr. Miller died on March 30, on the day when a cascade of scrutiny began
to fall on the facility. From his father’s bedside, Michael could see a
group of public health officials making their way through the units.

But his attention was with his father, who was breathing but no longer
responding, and the strangeness of surviving Omaha Beach to die that
way.

“That’s the irony, he landed on Normandy beach and your chances of
survival weren’t great,” he said. “And he made it.”
