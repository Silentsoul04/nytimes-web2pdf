Despite an amnesty law, Mr. Galante continued to gather evidence and
press for the prosecution of police officials. He died of Covid-19.

MADRID --- José María Galante was relentless in gathering evidence of
torture and other abuses committed during the Franco dictatorship in
Spain. He did so for decades, despite an amnesty law passed in 1977, two
years after Franco's death, that was intended to help smooth Spain's
return to democracy.

Mr. Galante, known as Chato, died on March 29 in a Madrid hospital at
71. His partner, Justa Montero, said the cause was Covid-19.

Mr. Galante fought particularly hard to bring to trial former members of
Franco's police, including
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/obituaries/antonio-gonzalez-pacheco-accused-policeman-in-francos-spain-dies-at-73.html}{an
inspector}, Antonio González Pacheco, whom he accused of torturing him
and many others.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/world/europe/facing-his-torturer-as-spain-confronts-its-past.html}{In
an interview with The New York Times} in 2014, Mr. Galante recalled how
he had found that Mr. González Pacheco was living near him in central
Madrid and explained why he was determined to bring his torturer to
justice.

``I agree with the idea of reconciliation,'' Mr. Galante said. ``But you
just can't turn the page. You have to read that page before you turn
it.''

He continued his crusade even after Spain's national court in 2014
rejected an extradition request for Mr. González Pacheco filed by a
judge in Argentina, who was investigating the case.

``We will bring these torturers before judges,'' Mr. Galante said last
year during a presentation of a
\href{https://thesilenceofothers.com/}{documentary} film about victims
of Franco in which he participated. ``We will end up winning, and they
know it.''

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/obituaries/antonio-gonzalez-pacheco-accused-policeman-in-francos-spain-dies-at-73.html}{Mr.
González Pacheco died in May} in a Madrid hospital without having stood
trial or losing his police decorations, despite a promise made recently
by Spain's left-wing government to remove them.

Mr. Galante was born in Madrid on April 27, 1948, one of 12 children.
His mother was a homemaker, and his father was a military engineer who
rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. While at university, where he
studied economics and telecommunications, Mr. Galante joined an
underground movement called the Popular Liberation Front, which aimed to
overthrow Franco's regime.

He was arrested for the first time in 1967 and spent almost five years
in and out of prison. During the final years of the regime, he was made
to do his compulsory military service in a special battalion formed to
punish government opponents.

After Franco's death in 1975, Mr. Galante ran unsuccessfully in local
elections as a member of the Communist Revolutionary League, a
Trotskyist party.

He joined unsuccessful campaigns to bar Spain from hosting U.S. military
bases and from joining NATO. (Spain became a member in 1982.) And he
turned to environmental activism, helping to found a nongovernmental
organization in 1998 called Ecologists in Action. One of his campaigns
was to hold the authorities responsible for mishandling the oil spill
caused by
t\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/19/international/oil-tanker-sinks-off-spain-threatening-disaster.html}{he
sinking of a tanker off} the coast of Spain in 2002.

Along with Ms. Montero, a prominent figure in the feminist movement in
Spain, his survivors include seven siblings.
