Since the pandemic forced theaters to close their doors in mid-March,
there has been no shortage of noble attempts to recreate the magic of
the stage on streaming platforms including Zoom, Instagram Live and
YouTube (where the Broadway interview show “[Stars in the
House](https://www.starsinthehouse.com/)” streams two theater
productions daily). Virtual theater productions, of course, are mediated
through technology and thus not experienced as they would be from the
front mezzanine, and yet they’re not fully polished or always
prerecorded, either. Part of the thrill of theater is its immediacy and,
along with it, the potential for something to fall to pieces. That
aspect remains perfectly intact, and recent performances have been
felled by late starts, spotty internet and A/V connections, missed cues
and poor lighting. “It can all feel like the local portions of the Jerry
Lewis telethon,” jokes the producer and writer Jonathan Tolins. “As
though these actors might be in their laundry rooms.”

Surely, stumbles can be endearing — who wouldn’t delight in watching
Jake Gyllenhaal, bathed in yellowish light, belt “Move On” from “[Sunday
in the Park With
George](https://www.thehudsonbroadway.com/whatson/sunday-in-the-park-with-george/)”
(1983) in front of an average-looking window blind? — and all the more
so because they are relatable. Increasingly, us non-thespians, too, are
expected to present ourselves via digital platforms, and to issue
compelling performances, whether for a conference meeting, a job
interview, a friendly catch-up or an Instagram Live segment about
cutting a spouse’s hair. Really, all the digital world’s a stage. So,
for help navigating it, why not look to Broadway?

Luckily, in addition to trials, there have been triumphs. Sometimes this
has **** been on account of the choice of work. Intimate narratives with
homey settings, such as “Buyer & Cellar,” Tolins’s 2013 one-man play
about an actor hired to work as a faux shopkeeper in Barbra Streisand’s
Malibu basement, a benefit revival of which Broadway.com livestreamed
last month, make for easier transfers, requiring less coordination and
perhaps less suspension of disbelief from their audiences. But that
production’s team was also thoughtful about technical aspects — in his
midtown apartment, Michael Urie, its star, had three ring lights
(circular fixtures that distribute light evenly), two cameras and one
cameraman (his partner, Ryan Spahn). A two-camera setup might be
overkill for your standard Zoom call, but chances are a few of the below
tips will feel doable and help you stand out from the crowd amid the
stranger-than-fiction reality we’re all living.

### **Lights**

Clothes and makeup can be important — dress the part but stay away from
houndstooth, which might register onscreen as a dizzying blur — but
lighting, which can be the difference between looking like yourself and
a washed-out or shadowy version thereof, is a trickier art. On its own,
the fluorescent light emitted from digital devices is about as
flattering as that from a bug zapper. First, set your computer between
an external light source and your desk chair, so that your face acquires
a glow. Your computer can also give you a boost: While delivering the
introductory remarks for the streaming run of “Buyer & Cellar,” Tolins
had his computer’s desktop background set to solid yellow to create a
warmer tone and add a bit of dimension to his complexion, which is on
the paler side. For those with darker skin tones, the comedic performer
[Ziwe Fumudoh](https://www.instagram.com/ziwef/?hl=en), who writes for
the late-night comedy series “Desus & Mero” and films weekly Instagram
Live shows from her Bushwick apartment, suggests “a whitish, bluish”
light, which can be achieved with Apple’s night mode. As of late,
Fumudoh has also been using a [Fotodiox ring
light](https://fotodioxpro.com/products/vlog-led-ringlight) to remove
pesky shadows and illuminate the eyes.

Not that a natural look is always the right one. [Alex
Bickel](http://www.alexbickel.com/), a film colorist responsible for the
iconic bluish tint in “Moonlight” (2016), recently bought a [smart LED
light from
Philips](https://www.usa.lighting.philips.com/consumer/smart-wifi-led)
that, when installed in a floor lamp or a flashlight, offers a seemingly
infinite mix of colors and special effects and transforms the whole
room. (Bickel chose a flickering lavender option for a kaleidoscopic
thank-you video he messaged to a friend, an emergency-room doctor in New
York.) And [Sam Levy](http://samlevydp.com/), a cinematographer who’s
worked with Greta Gerwig and Frank Ocean, among others, and his wife,
the filmmaker Karen Cinorre, have been experimenting with taping colored
gel swatches by [Lee
Filters](https://www.leefilters.com/lighting/colour-list.html) over
their camera lenses. These sorts of overlays are also popular with
Broadway technicians tasked with setting the mood onstage. Purple might
be used for a cheerful pantomime, the brand’s website suggests, whereas
a Victorian melodrama might call for a pale green. Levy also recommends
using Photo Booth or your camera app to get a preview of your light and
look before an important call.

### **Camera (and Set and Sound)**

You don’t have to worry much about the camera device itself, which
however unkind, is essentially fixed when it comes to standard streaming
platforms. But there are other staging elements that benefit from
attention. “Watching all of these new productions on Zoom or YouTube,
you can tell who knows how to film themselves and who doesn’t,” says
[Sara Isaacson](https://www.saraisaacsoncasting.com/), a Los
Angeles-based casting director who consults actors on the dos and don’ts
of self-taped auditions. “I always tell my actors to make sure there are
no distractions behind them, like a refrigerator door or a dying plant,”
she says. She recommends painting a small square of any available wall
space a neutral color so that the background won’t take away from the
action at hand.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For sound purposes, you might want to cover your *other* walls with
blankets. Soon after Alison Koch was brought on as the digital content
producer of “Soundstage,” Playwrights Horizons’s audio-only play and
musical project, she says she realized that “recording episodes while
huddled in a makeshift studio in a dressing room wasn’t going to cut
it.” And so the team decamped to professional studios, which naturally
offer top-of-the-line compressors, microphone preamplifiers and more.
But [Gary Atturio](https://www.instagram.com/gare_saw_bear/?hl=en), a
sound engineer and mixer who has worked on both musical episodes for the
series, one being Kirsten Childs’s “Edge of Night” (out next month),
says that some aspects of a studio can be imitated at home. “You want a
room that’s very isolated — no street noise, no air conditioning, no cat
meowing — and then you want to eliminate that boxy sound you’d get in a
new, empty apartment.” In addition to blankets, furniture also helps
dampen reverberation. “It’s actually more about the room than the
microphone,” Atturio says, though decent dedicated mics, which provide a
cleaner, more focused sound than internal laptop models, are
[available](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/) for just over
$100.

But what if you need a set with drama, or simply want to enjoy the nice
weather and take a call on your porch or fire escape? Earlier this
month, the actor and producer [Erich
Bergen](https://www.instagram.com/erichbergen/?hl=en) did a location
scout (via FaceTime) of Bette Midler’s Dutchess County, N.Y., home for a
virtual appearance the actress was set to make at a gala for the [New
York Restoration Project](https://www.nyrp.org/), a nonprofit that
Midler founded in 1995 to support city gardens and parks, and landed,
fittingly, on a corner of her garden. “When filming outside,” he warns,
“be wary that an iPhone microphone can only carry sound from so far
away.” In other words, speak into the mic. And, should a great gust of
wind or honking truck pass by, mute accordingly.

### **Action**

“Eye line is super important. I don’t want to feel like I’m being stared
at directly in an audition, so it’s better to look slightly to the side
of the lens,” says Isaacson. Though she adds that she occasionally
encounters someone “who refuses to look at me and only shows their
profile, which is really weird.” On most devices, there’s a green light
right next to the lens, which is a good place to gaze (make sure that
your camera is sitting just above eye-level, which will show your face
at a favorable angle and encourage good posture). And, it goes without
saying, try not to stare at the image of your visage projected back at
you. (If you can’t help yourself, you may be meant for the stage after
all — nevertheless, opt to hide self-view.) Another place not to look
would be your notes — Tolins, for example, taped a printout of his
speech to his monitor — or the room around you. The camera doesn’t lie,
and you never know when someone might pin your image and get a detailed
view of you barely listening, or nervously ad-libbing.

The last step might be to not think about anything you just read. “Give
yourself time to get set up and make sure everything works. That peace
of mind will come through and allow you to forget about the devices and
just focus on connecting with people,” says Levy. Finally, if something
does go wrong, just do your best to recover and get on with the show. “I
don’t like that we’re here,” Levy adds, “but I like the honesty and the
human persistence built into this moment.”
