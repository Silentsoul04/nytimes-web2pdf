Blizzards of bugs are descending on India at an already tough time.
Scientists say climate change is making the infestation worse.

NEW DELHI — Magan Doodi, a groundskeeper at a golf course in Jaipur, was
making his rounds earlier this week when he saw the sky suddenly turn a
weird pink.

It wasn’t some quirk of the weather. It was
[locusts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/india-new-delhi-locusts.html)
— millions of them, “like a spreading bedsheet,” he said.

“The locusts have attacked the golf course\!” Mr. Doodi yelled into his
cellphone during the battle Monday morning. “It’s man versus locusts\!”

As if
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/world/asia/india-monsoon-lightning-rainstorms.html)
needed more challenges, with coronavirus infections steadily increasing,
[a heat wave hitting the
capital](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/heatwave-intensifies-across-india-delhi-records-hottest-day-since-2002-120052700142_1.html),
a recent killer cyclone and [100 million people out of

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scientists say it’s the worst attack in 25 years and these locusts are
different.

“This time the attack is by very young locusts who fly for longer
distances, at faster speeds, unlike adults in the past who were sluggish
and not so fast,” said K.L. Gurjar, the deputy director of India’s
Locust Warning
Organization.

The locusts were flying in from Iran and Pakistan, blanketing half a
dozen states in western and central India. Because most of the crops
were recently harvested, the hungry swarms have buzzed into urban areas,
eager to devour bushes and trees, carpeting whatever surface they land
on.

On Monday, Jaipur, a sprawling city of 4 million and the biggest in the
state of Rajasthan, was besieged. [A blizzard of bugs flew over concrete
buildings](https://twitter.com/srinivasaiims/status/1264898868740669441?s=21)
and the wealthier neighborhoods, swooping in on trees and plants,
crossing graveyards and jewelry markets, attracted to the manicured golf
course in the heart of the city.

After he saw what was happening, Mr. Doodi, the groundskeeper, yelled
out to the caddies and other key personnel, urging them to make whatever
loud noise they could to drive the bugs away. Some grabbed firecrackers.
Others steel plates to bang on. Another person ran up to the roof of a
maintenance building and started thumping on empty plastic containers,
like drums.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Residents clamored to protect themselves and their flora, spilling onto
the streets banging plates with spoons and jumping into parked cars to
honk horns.

“I got out of my room and came out on my terrace at around 10 a.m. and
saw a long shadow on the ground,” recalled Nikhil Misra, a lawyer in
Jaipur. “I just stood still. It was something I had never seen in my
lifetime.”

“I looked up and saw a cloud, not the cloud that gives you rainfall, but
a cloud of locusts, thousands and thousands of them hovering over my
head,” he said. “It was a silent attack. It was a strange kind of fear,
as if being overtaken by
aliens.”

Scientists say that this outbreak, similar to [recent outbreaks in East
Africa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/africa/locusts-kenya-east-africa.html),
is driven by the same factors: unusually warm weather and more rain.
They blame climate
change.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“All this started in late 2019, when there were warm waters in the
western Indian oceans,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at
the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune. “These waters
triggered lot of rains over the East African regions and the Arabian
