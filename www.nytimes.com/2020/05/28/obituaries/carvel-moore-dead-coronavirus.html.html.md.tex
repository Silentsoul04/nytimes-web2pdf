\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Many remember the blight of 1970s New York, when the city, financially
strapped, had its share of subway graffiti, trash-strewed streets and
seemingly rampant crime. That era faded for a variety of reasons,
including the contributions of residents, business owners and urban
renewal advocates who refused to abandon their neighborhoods and devised
ways to lift them up.

Carvel H. Moore made a career out of that mission by developing some of
the city's first business improvement districts --- public-private
partnerships to help maintain community space.

She died of complications of the coronavirus on April 25 at a nursing
home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., , her son Jack Moore said. She was 90.

Ms. Moore, living in Manhattan near Union Square in the 1970s, found her
first endeavor there: the 14th Street‐Union Square Area Project, which
included an effort to clean up Union Square Park and establisha green
market there.

She joined with many in the area, including police officers and
merchants, to curb crime, her son said. The New York Times at the time
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/19/archives/project-aimed-at-sprucing-union-square.html}{described
Ms. Moore} clipping hedges in the park herself.

The effort led to the Union Square Partnership, which continues to
operate.

Ms. Moore also co-founded the Stuyvesant Park Neighborhood Association,
became chairwoman of Community Board 6 in mid-Manhattan and served as a
consultant to other business improvement districts, including those
covering Times Square, Madison Square Park and Hudson Square.

``She was very old-school, and she had a tenacity, but she wasn't that
quintessential outspoken New Yorker,'' Mr. Moore said. ``She was
soft-spoken and super-organized. That's how she won people over --- not
by bluster.''

Carvel Hidlay was born on Feb. 11, 1930, in Bloomsburg, Pa., a
Susquehanna River town in the east-central part of the state. Her
father, William Clair Hidlay, owned a home-heating oil delivery
business; her mother, Eugenia (Terwilliger) Hidlay, was a homemaker.
Carvel Hidlay graduated from Vassar College in 1951 and moved to New
York City shortly after. She married James Moore, a lawyer and property
manager, in 1954, had two sons and bought a home in the Gramercy Park
section of Manhattan.

As a neighborhood improvement consultant, she lobbied prominent city
property owners.

``I think it gave her a bit of a thrill to mix with the mighty,'' Mr.
Moore said. ``She was self-taught but could still run in all these
circles.''

No matter the size or nature of her efforts, they were always in the
interest of bettering each community, according to her son, who survives
her along with his brother, James I. Moore Jr.

``Everything she did was always in the context of doing the right
thing,'' Jack Moore said. ``Her career was a challenge, and she swam
with the sharks, but she was not of that world.''
