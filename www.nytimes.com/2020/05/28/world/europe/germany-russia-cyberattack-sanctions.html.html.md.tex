Intelligence}\label{germany-wants-eu-to-sanction-head-of-russian-military-intelligence}}

Berlin plans to invoke a new European sanctions mechanism to target a
hacker who orchestrated a cyberattack on the German Parliament --- and
the head of Russian intelligence himself.

BERLIN --- Germany wants to impose a European travel ban and asset
freeze on the head of Russia's military intelligence agency and several
of its spies in response to a 2015 cyberattack on the German Parliament
that was traced back to Moscow
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/world/europe/merkel-russia-cyberattack.html}{earlier
this month}.

The government will invoke a European Union sanctions mechanism, created
last year, that allows member states to ask that restrictions be imposed
on individuals involved in cyberattacks. The mechanism has not been used
before.

The sanctions, which would also include a ban on business contacts
inside the bloc, have to be agreed upon by the other 27 E.U. member
states. The process, officials said, could take time.

A senior German diplomat, Miguel Berger, informed Russian Ambassador
Sergey Yuryevitch Nechayev of the government's decision during a meeting
at the German foreign ministry on Wednesday.

Mr. Berger ``sharply condemned'' the cyberattack ``in the name of the
entire government,'' according to a foreign ministry statement.

In addition to the head of the Russian military intelligence service,
Igor Kostyukov, Berlin wants to blacklist
\href{https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/dmitriy-sergeyevich-badin}{Dmitriy
Sergeyevich Badin}, the hacker accused of orchestrating the attack, and
others at ``Center 85,'' his unit inside the service.

Mr. Badin is a member of the hacker group known as APT 28, or Fancy
Bear, the same group that targeted the Democratic Party during the
United States presidential election campaign in 2016. The F.B.I. issued
an
\href{https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/dmitriy-sergeyevich-badin}{arrest
warrant} for him two years ago, and Germany followed suit this month.

Intelligence officials had long suspected that Russian operatives were
behind the German cyberattack, but it took five years to collect the
evidence, which was presented in a report given to Chancellor Angela
Merkel's office in early May.

Ms. Merkel has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/world/europe/merkel-russia-cyberattack.html}{called
the attack ``outrageous''} and accused Russia of pursuing ``a strategy
of hybrid warfare.'' The report tracing the hack back to Moscow came
eight months after a Russian man believed to have links to Russian
intelligence murdered
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/world/europe/germany-assassination-russia.html}{a
former Chechen commander} in plain daylight in a central Berlin park,
the Kleine Tiergarten.

``The government is also assessing this against the backdrop of the
ongoing investigation in the so-called Tiergarten murder and is
reserving the right to take further measures,'' the foreign ministry's
statement said.

But even as its patience with President Vladimir V. Putin has run thin,
Berlin has often struggled to figure out a good way to respond to
Russia's actions.

In December, after the federal prosecutor's office said it suspected
that Russia was behind last year's assassination in Berlin, the
government expelled two employees of the Russian Embassy. This time,
that option was discarded because it would almost certainly have
prompted Moscow to send German diplomats home, too, reducing Berlin's
network inside Russia.

Instead, officials are mulling less public options for retaliation,
including pressuring Moscow to withdraw some of its many spies in
Berlin. German officials believe that a third of the diplomats
registered at the Russian Embassy in Berlin work for the Russian
intelligence service, known as the G.R.U.

The Russian Embassy in Berlin rejected all allegations against its
intelligence service. In a statement issued on Wednesday, it referred to
the cyberattack as ``a hackneyed story.'' It also offered Germany a
``factual expert dialogue'' on the issue of cybersecurity.
