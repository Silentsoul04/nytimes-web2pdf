Worried for its economy, India loosened tough restrictions and may lift
them entirely this weekend. But infection numbers are climbing fast.

NEW DELHI — Its [coronavirus cases are
skyrocketing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown-infections.html),
putting it among the world’s most worrisome pandemic zones in recent
weeks. Nonetheless,
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/world/asia/india-coronavirus-wedding-groom.html)
is reopening, lifting its lockdown at what experts fear may be the worst
time.

Migrant workers are becoming infected at an alarmingly high rate,
leading to [fresh
outbreaks](https://indianexpress.com/article/coronavirus/up-migrants-coronavirus-6423381/)
in villages across northern India. Public hospitals in Mumbai are so
overwhelmed that patients have taken to [sleeping on
cardboard](https://twitter.com/BDUTT/status/1264942589448384512) in the
hallways.

Doctors fear that the lockdown, which started over two months ago, has
been eased too soon, after slowing the virus but failing to flatten the
new-case curve as effectively as other nations have. If India does not
find a way to curb the virus in high-risk states, epidemiologists
project that its total caseload [could approach a million within several
weeks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india-medics-insig/more-patients-than-beds-in-mumbai-as-india-faces-surge-in-virus-cases-idUSKBN23103F).

“India is not out of the woods,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of
the Harvard Global Health Institute.

“From a public health point of view, I do think the lockdown has brought
the disease under control,” he said. “But of course, as restrictions
have lifted in the last week or 10 days, the number of cases has started
to rise quickly.”

At first, India moved aggressively to contain the coronavirus. In late
March, Prime Minister [Narendra
Modi](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/india-china-border-clashes.html)
implemented one of the most severe lockdowns anywhere, ordering all
Indians to stay inside, halting transportation and closing most
businesses.

But the lockdown was brutally hard on the poorest Indians and those who
rely on day labor to survive. And the country’s economy, which had
already been ailing, was sustaining deep wounds. Government officials
[began lifting some restrictions last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown-infections.html),
hoping to ease the suffering, and the lockdown may end entirely as soon
as Sunday, if Mr. Modi does not decide to extend it.

Infections are rising quickly now, however, with outbreaks in some
states that had reported few cases. This month, India’s doubling rate
for new infections averaged about 12 days, putting it on par with
countries of high concern like
Brazil.

That number compares poorly to those of other nations where stay-at-home
orders were imposed. In the United States, the doubling rate improved
from around 26 days at the start of May to about 50 days on Monday.
Italy crossed the 100-day mark early this month.

But in India, a nation of 1.3 billion people, locking down has posed
different challenges than in many Western societies. Its metro areas are
among the world’s densest, with millions living in packed slums,
sometimes sleeping eight to a room.

Almost half of India’s cases have been traced to just four cities: New
Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and
Ahmedabad.

Testing has also been severely restricted, making it tough to gauge the

1,000 people, one of the lowest ratios among the world’s worst-afflicted

It is conducting many more tests than it had been — roughly 90,000 a day
through May, up from around 4,200 daily tests in late March. But
officials have sounded alarms about [an increasing proportion of
positive results in recent
samples.](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/last-10-days-positivity-curve-begins-to-steepen-6425753/)

Dr. G.C. Khilnani, a public health expert and pulmonologist, said [a
peak in infections might not be reached until the end of
July](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indias-covid-curve-likely-to-flatten-reach-peak-by-july-end-who-envoy-2225754).
He said India’s relatively low number of total cases per capita (about
160,000 infections and 4,706 deaths) should not be taken as a sign that
the country had necessarily escaped the worst.

“Nobody can predict to what extent the numbers will go up,” Dr. Khilnani
said.

As many parts of India continue to see days with record-high infections,
a political consensus on how to fight the virus has deteriorated, giving
way to acrimony and finger-pointing.

“We are the only country in the world where the virus is exponentially
rising,” Rahul Gandhi, a leader of the opposition Indian National
Congress party, [said in a video
statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUgfhdafnIg). “What India is
facing now, in front of us, is the result of a failed
lockdown.”

Amit Malviya, a spokesman for Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, [fired
back in a television
interview](https://twitter.com/TimesNow/status/1265194712270430209). He
accused Mr. Gandhi of not taking stronger action to contain infections
in Maharashtra, India’s hardest-hit state, which is governed by a
coalition that includes the Indian National Congress.

“Maharashtra is completely over the top, it’s bleeding, people are
dying, the health infrastructure’s crumbled,” Mr. Malviya said. Health
officials have traced nearly 40 percent of India’s cases to the state.

Questions have also been raised about whether the lockdown played a role
in spreading the virus to remote areas of
India.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

When Mr. Modi announced the restrictions, he gave Indians just four
hours to prepare before they went into effect. Millions of migrant
workers were stranded in cities. With bus and train services suspended,
some walked hundreds of miles to reach their villages, using dirty
pieces of cloth to cover their faces. [The human suffering has been
staggering](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/world/asia/india-leak-train-reopen.html).

Shiv Dutt Gupta, a member of a government task force crafting the
lockdown exit plan, partially attributed the surge in new cases to
laborers bringing the coronavirus into rural India.

[Test
results](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/coronavirus-migrants-back-in-bihar-show-high-positivity-1-in-4-tested-from-delhi-6416531/)
for several hundred migrant workers who traveled from New Delhi to the
state of Bihar this month found that one in four had contracted
Covid-19. Bihar now has [one of the steepest infection curves in
India](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/coronavirus-numbers-explained-bihar/),
and troubling clusters have also been tracked to laborers traveling to
their homes in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous
state.

“The rate of positive cases among the migrant workers is very high,” Mr.
Gupta said. “That is alarming.”

But he said the lockdown could not go on forever. Around 122 million
Indians lost their jobs in April, [according to the Center for
Monitoring Indian
Economy](https://www.thehindu.com/data/data-over-12-crore-indians-lost-their-jobs-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-april/article31520715.ece),
a leading business analytics company. Some industries have teetered on
the edge of bankruptcy.

If the lockdown continues, Mr. Gupta said, “We will be devastated
economically.”

Officials have justified loosening rules by pointing out that not all of
India has been hit equally, with hopeful improvements in states like
Kerala. And doctors note that the lockdown did buy the government time
to ramp up infrastructure in the country’s already overburdened health
facilities.

India’s [public health sector has long been
overstretched](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/india-worse-than-bhutan-bangladesh-in-healthcare-ranks-145th-globally-118052400135_1.html),
with around 0.5 hospital beds for every 1,000 people, [according to
data](https://data.oecd.org/healtheqt/hospital-beds.htm) from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By comparison,
Germany has 8 and Japan has 13.1.

“Two months of lockdown has helped us fine-tune our treatment protocols,
our isolation protocols, our quarantine protocols,” said Naresh Trehan,
a prominent Indian surgeon.

Now, the resumption of cross-country transportation and industry has
raised the prospect that previously spared states may find themselves
confronted with imported outbreaks.

But many Indians seem ready to venture out, despite the numbers.

After weeks of self-isolating at home, Mujtaba Rizvi, an artist living
in Chennai, said he went for a walk last weekend and was stunned by what
he saw. Streets were clogged with cars. Shoppers spilled out of crowded
shops without wearing masks or observing social distancing.

At this point, Mr. Rizvi said, it appeared there was no turning back.

“Freedom comes at a price, and people seem to be ready to pay,” he said.
“Even if more people die now, it would be difficult to send us back into
isolation.”
