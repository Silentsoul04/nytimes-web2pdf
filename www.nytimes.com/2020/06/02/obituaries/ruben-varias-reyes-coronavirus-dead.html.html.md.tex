\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Ruben Varias Reyes, a Philippine diplomat who left the foreign service
after questioning extravagant purchases by the family of the dictator
Ferdinand Marcos, died on March 25 at St. Mary's Hospital in London. He
was 79.

The cause was the coronavirus, said his daughter, Rachel A.G. Reyes.

In 1974, at age 33, Mr. Reyes was sent from Manila to London to serve as
the finance attaché at the Philippine Embassy. He had a degree in law
and administration from the University of the Philippines and was an
army reservist trained in intelligence work.

At the time, Marcos ruled the Philippines by martial law, and his wife,
Imelda, was known for her international shopping sprees. They were later
accused of looting the Philippine treasury and shipping billions of
dollars overseas.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/imelda-marcos-sentenced-philippines.html}{Most
of the money} was never recovered.

Mr. Reyes challenged the excesses of the Marcos era, including family
members' expenditures in London on items such as Persian rugs, perfume
and real estate, his daughter said. At one point, he blocked the
purchase of luxury cars imported from Germany.

``He scrutinized spending on banquets and receptions, and the expense
accounts of staff, which sometimes included hundreds of dollars' worth
of drinks at nightclubs and escort services for visiting VIPs,'' Ms.
Reyes said.

Mr. Reyes also questioned expenditures on dog food by Jose Manuel
Stilianopoulos, the Philippine ambassador to Britain at the time, who
was said to have devoted a floor of the embassy to his dogs, an Afghan
hound and a Great Dane.

Mr. Reyes was eventually recalled to Manila and was offered a
significant promotion to a post at the embassy in Moscow. He declined
the assignment because he saw it is an effort to co-opt him, and he
resigned from the foreign service in 1982.

``It was a difficult moment for the family,'' Ms. Reyes recalled. ``My
father ultimately felt that his decision not to accept the posting was
for the good of the family and, I think, possibly also for his soul.''

After Mr. Reyes left his embassy post, the family remained in London,
where he started a travel and tour agency. Later, he and his wife, Neria
Gesmundo Reyes, had a successful real estate business. She died in 2015.

Mr. Reyes is survived by two children and three grandchildren.
