Ms. Wilson, who had the coronavirus, was the first African-American
senior zookeeper at what is now the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

There was the time, about 25 years ago, when a bat flew into Mary J.
Wilson's home in Baltimore. Picture the scene: pandemonium. Ms. Wilson
calmly raised an arm, snatched the bat in mid-flight and tossed it back
outside.

``I never saw anything like it,'' her grandson, Felipe Herrera, said.

Ms. Wilson was a sports fan, a trash talker, a fearless woman who stood
6 feet tall. But mostly, Ms. Wilson, the first African-American senior
zookeeper at what is now the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, had a way with
animals, especially loose ones.

``She was a no-nonsense lady,'' said her daughter, Sharron Wilson
Jackson, who became the first African-American female senior zookeeper
at the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, in Omaha, before switching to the
music business. ``If something got out, she'd go there and coach an
animal back into its cage. She did it with an elephant that got out. She
just started cussing. The elephant was charging towards my mother. My
mother just stood there and said, `You better come over here.' And the
elephant did.''

That was her mother, Ms. Jackson said. ``She could catch monkeys with a
net in midair. She just didn't show any fear.''

Ms. Wilson died of the new coronavirus in Randallstown, Md., on May 25,
her daughter said. She was 83. She is also survived by her grandson.

Mary Jeannette Wilson was born on Jan. 2, 1937, in West Baltimore, the
middle child of Willie Wilson and Mary Henry. She attended Paul Laurence
Dunbar High School, then made her career with just a high school degree
and a passion for big animals, especially primates. Colleagues and her
daughter said she had never talked about breaking a racial barrier ---
she just loved her work.

There were other stories about her. The time Bianca the jaguar got out.
The time Spunky the chimpanzee got loose and bit a worker's ear nearly
off. Ms. Wilson bullied both animals back into their cages, Bianca with
a hose that Ms. Wilson had picked up while running toward the cat,
Spunky just by facing him down until he whimpered, then taking his hand
and walking him back where he belonged.

One exception: Put a mouse near her, said her fellow zookeeper Gwen
Mullen, and ``you would see this very tall woman standing on a chair.''

Ms. Wilson often cared for zoo babies at home at night, her daughter
remembered --- a baboon, a gorilla, all kinds of monkeys, even snakes.
It was a different era for zoos.

``I would take them to the store with a blanket,'' Ms. Jackson said. ``I
scared people.''

Dementia crept into Ms. Wilson's final year, and then the coronavirus.
On a video call the day before her mother died, Ms. Jackson said, she
tried everything to get a response, to no avail. Then she remembered
something Ms. Wilson had once said to an ailing bull elephant: ``Shake
it up, Joe.'' And Joe had shaken his massive head.

``I thought about that time,'' Ms. Jackson said. ``I said, `Can you
shake it up like Joe?' And she shook her head like the elephant did. I
lost it.''
