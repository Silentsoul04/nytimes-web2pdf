Whether serious or silly, TikTok is an outlet for expression unlike
anything that came
before.

I had mostly avoided
[TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/technology/tiktok-china-ban-model.html);
it made me feel old. But for me and [many of
you](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/05/tech/tiktok-bytedance-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html),
TikTok has become a needed dose of silliness during the pandemic — and
more recently, a unique home for grieving and activism.

Alongside short videos of a hamster[jamming on the
piano](https://www.tiktok.com/@hamstarz/video/6829822490131434757) and
an [incredible watermelon
carving](https://www.tiktok.com/@cakelover363/video/6824418668445846789?lang=en),
there are [scenes of the
protests](https://www.tiktok.com/@kareemrahma/video/6831762210218446085?lang=US)
against the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and a [history
lesson](https://www.tiktok.com/@theleftistdude/video/6826796142299254021)
on the 1921 massacre of residents of a black neighborhood in Tulsa.

What’s unusual about TikTok is that it’s not another place to see what’s
happening. It’s a distilled expression of how people are feeling. At its
best, a TikTok video gives me a sense of someone’s essence — and taken
together, of our collective essence.

TikTok feels familiar, but its soul is unlike that of other social media
that came before it. It can be mindless fun, but it’s also a force to
pay attention to. TikTok is the first entertainment powerhouse born in
and built for the smartphone age — and it might change everything.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s also the first time that Americans have had to consider that U.S.
companies might not always rule the internet. There’s a lot of
importance wrapped in [a (mostly) goofy
app](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html).

Last month, a reader named Richard wrote us asking, “Can you explain why
TikTok is all the rage?”

Well, the magic is TikTok makes it easy [to be
creative](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html)
and to watch others’ best work. A 60-second limit on videos means users
don’t need to create much filler, and there’s often a common thread with
many videos set to the same song or riffing on a “challenge” like
[cleaning
mirrors](https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/tiktok-wipe-it-down-challenge-bmw-kenny-explainer.html).

TikTok makes it easy to watch by pushing you videos that its computers
predict you will like. You don’t need to search or know whom to watch.
(But that is also why TikTok can operate like a bubble. I might see
Black Lives Matter videos, while you might see only celebrities
dancing.)

TikTok doesn’t necessarily show you the reality of the world. It’s about
expression, but it’s not like anything we’re used to.

Netflix, YouTube and most other internet video services grafted existing
business behaviors onto new distribution models. TikTok blew up all of
that. It wasn’t made for cord cutters. It’s for people who never watched
TV at all.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If you’re on TikTok to talk politics, you’ll find irreverent [political
in-jokes](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/camp-pence-tiktok-memes-lgbtq-conversion-therapy)
and [none of the usual TV-like
conventions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/style/tiktok-politics-bernie-trump.html).
Hollywood productions are absent. Whether fun or solemn, everything is
tailored to TikTok’s id.

TikTok does have many of the familiar internet problems like overreach
of [data
collection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/technology/tiktok-kids-privacy.html),
[stalking](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-tik-tok-lewd-acts-arrest-20190214-story.html)
and harmful
[misinformation](https://www.mediamatters.org/fake-news/tiktok-hosting-videos-spreading-misinformation-about-coronavirus-despite-platforms-new).

The biggest questions stem from [TikTok’s
ownership](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/technology/tiktok-alex-zhu-interview.html)
by the Chinese internet conglomerate ByteDance. Some American
[politicians
worry](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2020/05/28/house-democrats-join-gop-in-going-after-tiktok-787945)
that TikTok is a conduit for China to siphon Americans’ data. (TikTok
says it doesn’t do this.)

TikTok faced questions last year on whether it was [hiding videos from
Hong Kong’s
protests](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2019-09-17/hong-kong-protests-raise-censorship-concerns-for-hot-app-tiktok?sref=7ooTCNG1)
to appease the Chinese government. The company said it didn’t.

I don’t know whether those fears are valid. But TikTok is definitely
a[mind
bender](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/business/tiktok-china-bytedance.html).
It’s one of the first Chinese internet services that is globally
popular. That’s a challenge for Americans who are used to U.S. internet
companies dominating much of the world.

TikTok might be rewiring entertainment, giving the next generation of
activists new ways to tell stories and challenging the global internet
order.

### Tip of the Week

## How to make your own TikTok videos — for cheap

[*Brian X. Chen*](https://www.nytimes.com/by/brian-x-chen)*, a consumer
technology writer at the The New York Times, suggests some apps and
products to help you create your own online videos and photos.*

It’s hard to become famous on social media. (I have firsthand experience
[failing to make my dog, Max, an Instagram
celebrity](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/technology/personaltech/instagram-influencers-dogs-food.html).)
But if you want to give it a shot, you don’t have to splurge on fancy
cameras and lights to make videos and photos look better. You can just
use your smartphone camera and a few tools.

Here are some low-cost hacks I’ve used over the years:

  - **A phone tripod.** My wife occasionally posts cooking videos to
    demonstrate her recipes, and [this tiny $20 phone
    tripod](https://www.amazon.com/UBeesize-Portable-Adjustable-Universal-Compatible/dp/B06Y2VP3C7)
    fits nicely on the kitchen counter while holding the smartphone
    stable at different angles. That beats spending $300 to $400 on a
    GoPro camera.

<!-- end list -->

  - **A work light.** Professional photographers spend hundreds of
    dollars on light kits. You know what else works great? A [$20 work
    light from the hardware
    store](https://petapixel.com/2018/07/26/these-portraits-were-shot-with-a-20-work-light-from-home-depot/).
    These powerful lights were designed for outdoor construction, but
    they do a miraculous job at lighting for indoor photography.
    
    The light is very harsh, though. To diffuse it, I tape a piece of
    parchment paper over the light’s metal grill.

<!-- end list -->

  - **A good photo-editing app.** There are plenty of cheap photo and
    video editing apps to do touch-ups before posting your selfies.
    [VSCO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vsco-photo-video-editor/id588013838)
    charges for special filters and editing tools, but the free basic
    features will get you one small step closer to internet stardom.

-----

## Before we go …

  - **Tough questions for the Facebook boss:** Mark Zuckerberg told
    Facebook employees on Tuesday that [he stood by the company’s
    hands-off
    approach](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/technology/zuckerberg-defends-facebook-trump-posts.html)
    to recent inflammatory posts by President Trump, despite dissent
    from some employees and outsiders, my colleagues reported. Facing
    fury at times during a virtual meeting with employees, Zuckerberg
    said it was “a tough decision,” but that he made a thoroughly
    considered call based on the company’s policies.

  - **There are no magic bullets for our** **[city transportation
    hellscape](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/technology/public-transportation-cities-pandemic.html)**
    **but…** Brian, our consumer tech writer, tried and loved electric
    bikes, and he said they’re an [effective and fun transportation
    option](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/technology/personaltech/e-bikes-are-having-their-moment-they-deserve-it.html)
    for commuters looking to reduce the risk of the coronavirus and
    avoid nightmare traffic. (I was converted long ago to the joys of
    biking for transportation, so yea\!) Check out Brian’s
    recommendations on what to consider if you’re e-bike curious.

  - **If you were confused about the black squares on Instagram:** My
    colleagues
    [debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/style/instagram-blackout.html)
    whether people sharing images on Instagram of black boxes on Tuesday
    was an effective symbol of solidarity for people abused by police,
    or a way for people to avoid doing something meaningful about
    racism.

### Hugs to this

Sticking with today’s TikTok theme: Here is a [mewing
kitten](https://www.tiktok.com/@miaamabile/video/6807566845948873990) in
the couch cushions.
