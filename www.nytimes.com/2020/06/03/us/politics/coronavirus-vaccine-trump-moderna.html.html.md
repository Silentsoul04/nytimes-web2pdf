WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has selected five companies as the
most likely candidates to produce a [vaccine for the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html),
senior officials said, a critical step in the White House’s effort to
deliver on its
[promise](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline.html)
of being able to start widespread inoculation of Americans by the end of
the year.

By winnowing the field in a matter of weeks from a pool of around a
dozen companies, the federal government is betting that it can identify
the most promising
[vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/09/magazine/covid-vaccine.html)
projects at an early stage, speed along the process of determining which
will work and ensure that the winner or winners can be quickly
manufactured in huge quantities and distributed across the country.

The announcement of the decision will be made at the White House in the
next few weeks, government officials said. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the
federal government’s top epidemiologist and director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, hinted at the coming
action on Tuesday when he told a medical seminar that “by the beginning
of 2021 we hope to have a couple of hundred million doses.”

The five companies are
[Moderna](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html),
a Massachusetts-based biotechnology firm, which Dr. Fauci said he
expected would enter into the final phase of clinical trials next month;
the combination of [Oxford
University](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html)
and AstraZeneca, on a similar schedule; and three large pharmaceutical
companies: Johnson & Johnson, Merck and
[Pfizer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html).
Each is taking a somewhat different approach.

President Trump has been eager to show rapid progress as the nation
slowly emerges from lockdown, and as he faces the growing challenge of
winning re-election in the midst of national upheaval: [more
than 106,000 Americans
dead](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
from the virus, unemployment at record levels and now discord and
violence in the streets.

Despite [promising early
results](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccines.html)
and the administration’s strong interest in nurturing a
government-industry partnership, substantial hurdles remain, and many
scientists consider Mr. Trump’s goal of having a vaccine widely
available by early next year to be optimistic, if not unrealistic.
Vaccine development is notoriously difficult and time-consuming; the
record is four years, and a decade is not unusual.

Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and the Oxford-AstraZeneca group [have
already received a total of $2.2 billion in federal
funding](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/health/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca.html)
to support their vaccine programs. Their selection as finalists, along
with Merck and Pfizer, will give all five companies access to additional
government money, help in running clinical trials and financial and
logistical support for a manufacturing base that is being built even
before it is clear which if any of the vaccines in development will
work.

More funding is likely to be announced soon, officials said. This week,
the Department of Health and Human Services added $628 million to a
contract with Emergent BioSolutions, a Maryland firm, to expand
development of vaccine manufacturing capacity.

Dr. Fauci, who had been sounding cautionary notes, now sounds more

The project — called Operation Warp Speed — amounts to a sprawling,
on-the-fly experiment in industrial policy by a Republican
administration that has been otherwise dedicated to giving private
industry a free hand.

Democrats in Congress are already seeking details about the contracts
with the companies, many of which are still wrapped in secrecy. They are
asking how much Americans will have to pay to be vaccinated and whether
the firms, or American taxpayers, will retain the profits and
intellectual property.

Other countries, including China, are also rushing their own efforts to
produce a vaccine, raising concerns that nationalism rather than need
could drive decisions about who first gets inoculated.

Two of the vaccine candidates selected by the Trump administration —
developed by Moderna and scientists at Oxford — are already in Phase II
trials, meaning their effectiveness is being tested on scores of human
subjects.

They will likely shift to large-scale human trials, called Phase III, as
early as July, two senior administration officials said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While Johnson & Johnson has said it would begin Phase I trials by
September at the latest, that now appears likely to be sped up
considerably, officials said. Phase I focuses on testing for safety, a
particularly important factor for vaccines since they are administered
widely to healthy people.

Several of the companies said that they did not want to speak ahead of
any announcement by the White House, and the others did not respond to
requests for a comment. Along with Moderna, Merck, Pfizer and Johnson &
Johnson are based in the United States. AstraZeneca is based in Britain.

Under the administration plan, according to officials, around 30,000
people will take part in Phase III trials for each vaccine when they
reach that stage. If all five companies reach Phase III trials, around
150,000 people, mostly Americans, would ultimately become the test
subjects for a vaccine.

All age groups will be covered, including older people and those with
underlying health conditions.

It is possible, officials and corporate executives in several of the
firms said, that some of the Phase III trials will be conducted outside
the United States, and may be focused on coronavirus hot spots, where a
greater possibility of infection could speed the process of determining
the effectiveness of a potential vaccine. The other alternative
— deliberately exposing inoculated volunteers to the disease
—<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>is fraught with ethical
issues and officials seem reluctant to take that route, even if it might
speed results.

The plans are being assembled in an office suite on the seventh floor of
the Department of Health and Human Services’s headquarters, where two
newly appointed leaders of the project, Dr. Moncef Slaoui and Gen.
Gustave F. Perna, have set up temporary offices.

Dr. Slaoui comes from the pharmaceutical and venture capital worlds.
General Perna heads the Army Matériel Command and is an expert in
complex logistics but not medicine.

Their work is monitored by Mr. Azar, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and
Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. They are
coordinating with the senior infectious disease experts on the White
House’s coronavirus task force, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who
is overseeing the task force’s day-to-day operations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Weeks ago, Mr. Trump compared the Warp Speed effort to the Manhattan
Project, the government-led program during World War II to develop the
atomic bomb. There are superficial similarities: Lives at stake,
crushing deadlines, and a combination of civilian and military
leadership. (The Manhattan Project was headed by J. Robert Oppenheimer,
a theoretical physicist, and Gen. Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the
project to deliver the bomb to its targets in Japan.)

But even some of the president’s top aides say the analogy goes only so
far: This effort is an amalgamation of private-industry vaccine
projects, with an overlay of military
coordination.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

One senior administration official said the more appropriate comparison
would be Lockheed Martin’s [“Skunk
Works”](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/05/business/business-people-lockheeds-skunk-works-appoints-engineermanager.html)
program in California, where the company’s most sensitive aircraft
projects have been developed and built. Many never left the design
stage.

Much of the work at the Warp Speed project involves making sure no
surprises slow development.

But Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar
at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said that
the administration should “be prepared for things to slow down once we
get further along.”

“All of the timelines are optimistic,” he said. “Vaccine development
doesn’t always go as predicted. There are a lot of hiccups in the
production
process.”

Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday [wrote to Mr.
Azar](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2020-06-02.Clyburn%20CBM%20to%20HHS%20re%20Vaccine%20and%20Treatment%20Contracts.pdf)
with concerns about how his department was awarding contracts to the
pharmaceutical companies.

Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina and the
chairman of the House’s select committee on the coronavirus, and
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the
chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, said that they were
“seeking to determine whether these contracts include provisions to
ensure affordability and prevent profiteering.”

Agreements have included promises from pharmaceutical companies related
to intellectual property, the number of doses that will be produced if a
candidate is successful and the price of a vaccine, one senior
administration official said. But few details have been made public.

Contracts are being awarded through the department’s Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority. Congress allocated billions of
dollars for vaccine development in various components of the $2 trillion
coronavirus relief package.

Senior administration officials said that between new congressional
funds and money that can be drawn from appropriations for the federal
health agencies, the project will have plenty of funding.

Behind the scenes, the project has undergone upheaval in its leadership.

Dr. Peter Marks, the federal scientist who devised and initially oversaw
the project at the Food and Drug Administration, stepped aside from his
role as its lead vaccine specialist, in part because he believed Dr.
Slaoui had potential conflicts of interest, according to senior
administration officials.

Dr. Slaoui, a venture capitalist and a former executive at the
pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline, sat on the board of Moderna before
accepting his current role last month. The value of his stock holdings
in Moderna [jumped
significantly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html)
when the company released preliminary data from an early phase of its
candidate vaccine trial. He sold his $12 million in shares afterward,
and the administration said he would donate the increased value to
cancer research.

Dr. Slaoui also joined the project on a contract rather than as a
government employee, [leaving him
exempt](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccine-czar.html)
from federal disclosure rules that would require him to list his outside
positions, stock holdings and other potential conflicts. The arrangement
is not subject to the same conflict-of-interest laws and regulations
that executive branch employees must follow.

In a May 20 meeting, according to one official, Dr. Marks, the director
of the F.D.A.’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, informed
Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the agency’s commissioner, that he wanted to exit
the vaccine program.

He also left the White House’s coronavirus task force, a group he had
been named to five days earlier.

Two senior officials said that [Col. Matthew
Hepburn](https://ghss.georgetown.edu/people/hepburn/), who is also a
physician, has stepped in for Dr. Marks on the vaccine program.
