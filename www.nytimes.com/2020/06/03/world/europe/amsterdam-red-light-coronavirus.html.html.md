# Amsterdam’s Red Light Zone Stays Shut as Rest of City Edges Open

Many Dutch professions went back to work in May, and most will return by
July. But sex workers must wait until September — sending hundreds into
poverty and forcing some to risk working in secret.

*Patrick Kingsley, an international correspondent, and Laetitia Vancon,
a photojournalist, are driving more than 3,700 miles to explore the
reopening of the European continent after coronavirus lockdowns.* [*Read

AMSTERDAM — The red lights still shone above the windows in De Wallen,
Amsterdam’s main red-light district, but the windows themselves were
empty.

The streets lining the canals, normally crammed with tourists, were
deserted.

The brothels were closed, the prostitution museum shut until further
notice.

“No photos of sex workers,” read the signs above the brothel windows.
“Fine: 95 euros.”

But there were no sex workers to photograph in the windows, and no
tourists to photograph them.

The Netherlands is reopening. Hairdressers, driving instructors and
beauticians have been back at work since May 11, without needing to wear
a mask. Restaurants reopened their outdoor seating areas at the
beginning of this month. Gyms and saunas are scheduled to restart in
early July.

In De Wallen, a locksmith is open, as are a few (mostly empty) bars, and
the shops selling sex toys, whips, handcuffs and the odd latex dress.

But sex workers have been told to wait until September, emptying the
area, and sending many sex workers into poverty — or secretly back to
work.

Charlotte de Vries, the professional name of an escort working in
Amsterdam, would normally meet up to seven clients a week. But the week
the lockdown began, all seven canceled, immediately costing her about
$1,500.

“And I stopped counting after that,” said Ms. de Vries, sitting at a
table on the edge of the red light district. “I thought, I just don’t
want to know.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As she spoke, the bells chimed across the street, at Amsterdam’s oldest
church. Now that the area was deserted, she said, you could hear the
sounds of the neighborhood for once.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For now, Ms. de Vries is able to rely on savings. But many of her
colleagues cannot. Over 400 sought assistance from [a new emergency fund
set up by volunteers](https://www.dutchemergencyfund.nl/), which offers
aid of about $45 to the most desperate applicants.

This assistance hasn’t been nearly enough. Ms. de Vries said she knows
seven sex workers who have been forced to work in secret, just to pay
their rent. Rosie Heart, the professional name of a second Dutch sex
worker, said she knew of at least
10.

“It’s a disaster, really,” said Ms. Heart, who usually provides escort
services in Amsterdam and London, in addition to working as a
representative of Proud, a labor union for Dutch sex workers.

Working in secret like this makes sex workers particularly vulnerable
because they are more at risk from abusive
clients.

Before the coronavirus crisis, if a client became violent, “you would go
to the police,” Ms. de Vries said. “But now you can’t do that because
what you’re doing is illegal.”

A neighbor walked past, nodding a hello. One of the few silver linings
to the crisis had been the opportunity to get to know the area’s
residents better, Ms. de Vries said.

Dutch sex workers now face such hardship because of patchy government
support. Like many governments at the start of the crisis, the Dutch
authorities created emergency income streams for people suddenly left
without work.

But in practice, many sex workers do not qualify for the new subsidies,
because of the way they were registered with the tax authorities before
the crisis. Or they are too scared to apply for it.

Though prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, many sex workers prefer
not to declare their profession to the government because the trade
still carries a social stigma — or because they work without all the
licenses needed for them to be completely compliant with the law.

In a survey of 108 sex workers in the Netherlands conducted online by
[SekswerkExpertise](https://sekswerkexpertise.nl/english/), a research
group in Amsterdam, 56 percent of the respondents said they had applied
for coronavirus support. Of those applicants, only 13 percent said they
had received
help.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Of those who did not apply, about one in three said they already knew
they would not qualify, and one in six said they were worried about
outing themselves as sex workers to government institutions, in case
their identities were
leaked.

And migrant sex workers, working without a permit, cannot even
contemplate applying for assistance.

Ms. Heart was one of the few successful applicants, receiving about
$1,500 a month since March, roughly half her usual earnings.

But she said she would not apply for help from July onward, since sex
workers would likely then be the only people out of work for reasons
directly related to the coronavirus restrictions.

She feared that would out her as a sex worker, and potentially prompt
local officials to evict her from her home, on the — mistaken —
assumption that she uses her apartment as an unlicensed brothel.

“One minute I could be applying” for state support, Ms. Heart said. “The
next minute I could be fighting to stay in my home.”

Some unemployed sex workers have turned to the internet to try to make a
living from online sex shows. Ten attended a recent online training
session at the Prostitution Information Center, a nonprofit that
provides support to sex workers and guided tours of De Wallen to
tourists.

But it can take months to build up a base of paying customers online,
and there are substantial costs to setting up an online business. Online
sex work needs a good camera, a microphone, a strong internet connection
— and a private space where you are not likely to be disturbed.

A new influx of internet sex workers could also make life more difficult
for those already in the online business. “There’s even more
competition, so it’s even more tricky,” said Ms.
Heart.

Sex workers said they do not understand why they are not allowed to go
back to work in at least some capacity in July, along with gyms and
saunas. Their work doesn’t have to involve kissing, and a lot of sex
work, even before the coronavirus crisis, did not involve full
intercourse, or face-to-face contact.

Hairdressers can now welcome clients again, “and hover in front of their
face to cut their bangs,” Ms. Heart said. So she wondered why sex
workers weren’t allowed to perform sex acts that stopped short of
intercourse.

“I’m absolutely not saying we should be allowed to go back to work as
normal, certainly not,” she added. “But if you’re saying that everyone
can go back to work, but not sex workers — there’s something wrong with
your thinking.”
