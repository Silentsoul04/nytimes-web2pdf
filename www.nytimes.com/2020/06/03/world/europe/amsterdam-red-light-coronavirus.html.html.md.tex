Many Dutch professions went back to work in May, and most will return by
July. But sex workers must wait until September --- sending hundreds
into poverty and forcing some to risk working in secret.

AMSTERDAM --- The red lights still shone above the windows in De Wallen,
Amsterdam's main red-light district, but the windows themselves were
empty.

The streets lining the canals, normally crammed with tourists, were
deserted.

The brothels were closed, the prostitution museum shut until further
notice.

``No photos of sex workers,'' read the signs above the brothel windows.
``Fine: 95 euros.''

But there were no sex workers to photograph in the windows, and no
tourists to photograph them.

The Netherlands is reopening. Hairdressers, driving instructors and
beauticians have been back at work since May 11, without needing to wear
a mask. Restaurants reopened their outdoor seating areas at the
beginning of this month. Gyms and saunas are scheduled to restart in
early July.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/03/world/03roadtrip-sexworker-dispatch2/merlin_173117979_85a042e7-3fd5-42bd-bcff-12e6528be37f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

In De Wallen, a locksmith is open, as are a few (mostly empty) bars, and
the shops selling sex toys, whips, handcuffs and the odd latex dress.

But sex workers have been told to wait until September, emptying the
area, and sending many sex workers into poverty --- or secretly back to
work.

Charlotte de Vries, the professional name of an escort working in
Amsterdam, would normally meet up to seven clients a week. But the week
the lockdown began, all seven canceled, immediately costing her about
\$1,500.

``And I stopped counting after that,'' said Ms. de Vries, sitting at a
table on the edge of the red light district. ``I thought, I just don't
want to know.''

As she spoke, the bells chimed across the street, at Amsterdam's oldest
church. Now that the area was deserted, she said, you could hear the
sounds of the neighborhood for once.

For now, Ms. de Vries is able to rely on savings. But many of her
colleagues cannot. Over 400 sought assistance from
\href{https://www.dutchemergencyfund.nl/}{a new emergency fund set up by
volunteers}, which offers aid of about \$45 to the most desperate
applicants.

This assistance hasn't been nearly enough. Ms. de Vries said she knows
seven sex workers who have been forced to work in secret, just to pay
their rent. Rosie Heart, the professional name of a second Dutch sex
worker, said she knew of at least 10.

``It's a disaster, really,'' said Ms. Heart, who usually provides escort
services in Amsterdam and London, in addition to working as a
representative of Proud, a labor union for Dutch sex workers.

Working in secret like this makes sex workers particularly vulnerable
because they are more at risk from abusive clients.

Image

A Dutch sex worker, who uses Rosie Heart as her professional name, has
been without work since March, when the Dutch government banned sex work
in response to the coronavirus crisis.~

Before the coronavirus crisis, if a client became violent, ``you would
go to the police,'' Ms. de Vries said. ``But now you can't do that
because what you're doing is illegal.''

A neighbor walked past, nodding a hello. One of the few silver linings
to the crisis had been the opportunity to get to know the area's
residents better, Ms. de Vries said.

Dutch sex workers now face such hardship because of patchy government
support. Like many governments at the start of the crisis, the Dutch
authorities created emergency income streams for people suddenly left
without work.

But in practice, many sex workers do not qualify for the new subsidies,
because of the way they were registered with the tax authorities before
the crisis. Or they are too scared to apply for it.

Though prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, many sex workers prefer
not to declare their profession to the government because the trade
still carries a social stigma --- or because they work without all the
licenses needed for them to be completely compliant with the law.

In a survey of 108 sex workers in the Netherlands conducted online by
\href{https://sekswerkexpertise.nl/english/}{SekswerkExpertise}, a
research group in Amsterdam, 56 percent of the respondents said they had
applied for coronavirus support. Of those applicants, only 13 percent
said they had received help.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for

Of those who did not apply, about one in three said they already knew
they would not qualify, and one in six said they were worried about
outing themselves as sex workers to government institutions, in case
their identities were leaked.

Image

A few revelers enjoying beers on a recent evening. Amsterdam restaurants
reopened their outdoor seating areas at the beginning of June.

And migrant sex workers, working without a permit, cannot even
contemplate applying for assistance.

Ms. Heart was one of the few successful applicants, receiving about
\$1,500 a month since March, roughly half her usual earnings.

But she said she would not apply for help from July onward, since sex
workers would likely then be the only people out of work for reasons
directly related to the coronavirus restrictions.

She feared that would out her as a sex worker, and potentially prompt
local officials to evict her from her home, on the --- mistaken ---
assumption that she uses her apartment as an unlicensed brothel.

``One minute I could be applying'' for state support, Ms. Heart said.
``The next minute I could be fighting to stay in my home.''

Some unemployed sex workers have turned to the internet to try to make a
living from online sex shows. Ten attended a recent online training
session at the Prostitution Information Center, a nonprofit that
provides support to sex workers and guided tours of De Wallen to
tourists.

But it can take months to build up a base of paying customers online,
and there are substantial costs to setting up an online business. Online
sex work needs a good camera, a microphone, a strong internet connection
--- and a private space where you are not likely to be disturbed.

A new influx of internet sex workers could also make life more difficult
for those already in the online business. ``There's even more
competition, so it's even more tricky,'' said Ms. Heart.

Image

De Wallen, Amsterdam's main red-light district, is usually crowded with
tourists and sex workers at all hours. But it is now almost deserted.~

Sex workers said they do not understand why they are not allowed to go
back to work in at least some capacity in July, along with gyms and
saunas. Their work doesn't have to involve kissing, and a lot of sex
work, even before the coronavirus crisis, did not involve full
intercourse, or face-to-face contact.

Hairdressers can now welcome clients again, ``and hover in front of
their face to cut their bangs,'' Ms. Heart said. So she wondered why sex
workers weren't allowed to perform sex acts that stopped short of
intercourse.

``I'm absolutely not saying we should be allowed to go back to work as
normal, certainly not,'' she added. ``But if you're saying that everyone
can go back to work, but not sex workers --- there's something wrong
with your thinking.''
