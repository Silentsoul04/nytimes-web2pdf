BERLIN — After more than a decade of inquiries in at least three
European countries, a German sex offender is under investigation on
suspicion of murder in the [2007 disappearance of Madeleine
McCann](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/world/europe/german-suspect-madeleine-mccann.html),
a British girl who went missing at age 3 from a hotel room in Portugal,
authorities in Germany said
Wednesday.

The 43-year-old man, whose identity was not released, lived in Portugal
off-and-on from 1995 to 2007.

He has a criminal record for sexual abuse of children, and is currently
in prison serving a sentence for an unrelated sexual crime and a drug
offense, Christian Hoppe, a criminal investigator at Germany’s Federal
Criminal Police, said on public television on Wednesday night.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On May 3, 2007, Madeleine, who was about to turn 4,
[disappeared](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/world/europe/08iht-08portugal.7428538.html?searchResultPosition=24)
while staying at a holiday resort with her family and a group of their
friends in Praia da Luz, a seaside town in the Algarve region of
Portugal. Her parents said they left her asleep with her siblings, twins
who were 2 at the time, while they ate in a nearby restaurant.

The girl’s disappearance dominated European headlines for years and
sparked an international manhunt. Millions of dollars were offered in
rewards to help find her abductor or abductors; her parents, Kate and
Gerry McCann, both Roman Catholics, appealed to Pope Benedict XVI for
help.

Celebrities, including the soccer star David Beckham, made appeals for
her to be found. The author J.K. Rowling later helped Ms. McCann write a
book about her daughter’s disappearance.

The Portuguese police were accused of bungling an initial investigation
that failed to produce concrete leads and instead added to the
controversy by including Madeleine’s parents as suspects.

For years, the couple kept their daughter’s name in headlines in the
hope of finding her alive. Their high-profile campaign crisscrossed
Europe and fueled dozens of reports of sightings and false alarms from
Spain to Belgium to Morocco.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in his appearance on Wednesday on a German unsolved crimes TV show,
Mr. Hoppe, of the German police, dashed any hopes that she might be
still be found, 13 years later.

The evidence discovered, he said, leads “to the assumption that
Madeleine was the victim of a homicide.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, even with a suspect identified, the crime is still being
investigated, and Mr. Hoppe appealed to viewers to call in with any
possible recollection or tip they had, in hopes of finally resolving the
case. “Even the most minor detail is of great meaning,” he said.

[A German police
statement](https://www.bka.de/DE/IhreSicherheit/Fahndungen/Personen/BekanntePersonen/43_Jaehriger_Deutscher_TV/Sachverhalt.html?nn=26874#detailinformationen132470)released
on Wednesday promised 10,000 euros, or $11,233, to anyone providing
information that helps to solve the case and provided [a
link](https://bka.hinweisportal.de/~portal/de/select) where photographs
or other possible evidence could be submitted.

In London, the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police,
Stuart Cundy, said, “We are committed to do everything we can to
establish what happened and to find Madeleine.”

Criminal investigators in Germany, Britain and Portugal had been working
the case for years, with no leads.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The current suspect was listed among hundreds of possible suspects back
in 2007, but there was not enough information to open an investigation,
Mr. Hoppe said. In 2013, a broadcast of the same German public
television show, “File Number XY Unresolved,” appealed to the public for
information about the case and the suspect’s name came up again.

Still, the information was insufficient to take action, Mr. Hoppe said.

But after the 10-year anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance,
Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell, who is leading the Met Police
investigation into the case in Britain, said his investigators received
more information about the German suspect.

Working off that tip, the German authorities returned to the man and
gathered enough evidence to allow prosecutors in the city of
Braunschweig — near the man’s last home in Germany before he moved to
Portugal — to open a preliminary investigation that could lead to
homicide charges.

“It’s more than 13 years since Madeleine went missing and none of us can
imagine what it must be like for her family, not knowing what happened
or where she is,” Detective Chief Inspector Cranwell said[in a
statement](http://news.met.police.uk/news/operation-grange-update-and-appeal-403826).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The German suspect, who would have been 30 at the time of Madeleine’s
disappearance, had worked in restaurants, but also had a record of
break-ins at hotels and dealing drugs in the region where Madeleine’s
family was on vacation.

The night she vanished, the suspect had a long telephone conversation
from the area near Praia da Luz with a person on a Portuguese cellphone,
who police are urging to come forward as a witness.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They are also appealing to anyone who might have noticed one of two
conspicuous vehicles the suspect used at the time. One was a maroon
Jaguar XJR 6, with a German license plate that was changed several
times, including the day after Madeleine disappeared.

The other was a white-and-yellow Volkswagen camper van with a Portuguese
license plate he is believed to occasionally have lived in but did not
own.

Investigators have ruled out the owner of the van as an accomplice. But
they said they believed the suspect may have been using the vehicle on
the day of Madeleine’s disappearance.

On the television show on Wednesday, Mr. Hoppe also showed images of a
living room with a brown leather sofa and a wooden beam in the center of
the room, as well as another of a low-slung whitewashed home in the
Algarve region where the authorities believe the suspect may have
stocked stolen goods.

By showing the pictures, they hoped to jog peoples’ memories about
places they believed to be critical to the investigation.

“We do not rule out that in addition to the perpetrator, there are
people who have knowledge about the course of events of the crime,” Mr.
Hoppe said. “Perhaps even about where the body was deposed, without
having been involved in the crime.”

In a statement distributed by the police in London, the McCanns said,
“All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring
those responsible to justice. We will never give up hope of finding
Madeleine alive but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know, as we
need to find peace.”

Melissa Eddy and Katrin Bennhold reported from Berlin, and Benjamin
Mueller from London. Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.
