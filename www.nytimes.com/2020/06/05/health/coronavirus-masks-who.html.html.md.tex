Transmission}\label{who-finally-endorses-masks-to-prevent-coronavirus-transmission}}

The agency had been opposed to public use of masks, even after
governments worldwide had recommended them.

Long after most nations urged their citizens to wear
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/face-shield-mask-california-coronavirus.html}{masks},
and after months of hand-wringing about the quality of the evidence
available, the World Health Organization on Friday endorsed the use of
face masks by the public to reduce transmission of the coronavirus.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, surprisingly, the W.H.O. had
refused to endorse masks. The announcement was long overdue, critics
said, as masks are an easy and inexpensive preventive measure.

Even in its latest guidance, the W.H.O. made its reluctance abundantly
clear, saying the usefulness of face masks is ``not yet supported by
high quality or direct scientific evidence,'' but that governments
should encourage mask wearing because of ``a growing compendium of
observational evidence.''

The W.H.O. also provided an exhaustive list of the potential
disadvantages of wearing a mask, including ``difficulty with
communicating clearly'' and ``potential discomfort.''

A study funded by the W.H.O. concluded this week that respirator masks,
like the N95, are
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/health/masks-surgical-N95-coronavirus.html}{better
than surgical masks} for health care workers. It also found that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/article/face-shield-mask-california-coronavirus.html}{face
shields}, goggles and glasses may offer additional protection from the
coronavirus.

But the W.H.O. did not budge from its previous recommendations for
medical workers, saying that respirator masks are only needed if such
workers are involved in procedures that generate virus-laden aerosols
--- droplets smaller than 5 microns.

Apart from those circumstances, transmission of the virus so far has
only been demonstrated for larger droplets and by contact, said Dr.
Benedetta Allegranzi, an infectious disease expert and technical lead
for the W.H.O.

While studies have shown that viral R.N.A. is present in the air in
certain health care settings, ``transmission is different, and it has
not been demonstrated,'' she said.

``It is disappointing that the W.H.O. is dismissing that latest evidence
that N95s are far more effective than surgical masks in protecting
health care workers from Covid-19 exposure,'' said David Michaels, an
epidemiologist at George Washington University who headed the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration during the Obama
administration.

``If the problem is the shortage of N95s, the W.H.O. should acknowledge
that and not pretend that medical masks are equally effective.''
