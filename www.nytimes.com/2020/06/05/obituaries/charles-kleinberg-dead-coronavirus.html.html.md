*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

Charles Kleinberg earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in
mathematics, which may explain why, in nearly 40 years as a federal
prosecutor, his examination of hostile witnesses and negotiations with
defense lawyers were meticulous and calculating.

Typically, his precision and professorial demeanor would prove to juries
and judges — and sometimes even to the opposing lawyers themselves —
that the government’s evidence added up perfectly.

Mr. Kleinberg died on May 22 in a Brooklyn hospital. He was 71. The
cause was the new coronavirus, his wife, Judith Adams Eschweiler, said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Charley’s trademark approach was prosecuting wrongdoers while
simultaneously or subsequently suing the stuffing out of their corporate
alter egos,” Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for the
Eastern District of New York, said in an email.

In one case, Mr. Kleinberg and several colleagues in the Eastern
District reached a $2 billion settlement in 2018 with Barclays Capital,
[which had been
accused](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/business/dealbook/justice-department-sues-barclays-mortgage-backed-securities.html)
of misleading investors in deals backed by overvalued subprime home
mortgages. He was also involved in the insider trading investigation of
Michael Lohan, the father of the actress Lindsay Lohan, and the
prosecution of Local 1 of the International Union of Elevator
Constructors for racketeering.

Perhaps Mr. Kleinberg’s most prominent court appearance came in 2012, in
the prosecution of Dr. Cecilia Chang, a dean at St. John’s University in
Queens, on charges involving fraud and embezzlement.

Dr. Chang was accused of exploiting her position to dispense honorary
degrees as patronage and to recruit scholarship students from overseas,
promising them a free education but then forcing them to clean her
seven-bedroom home in Jamaica Estates, Queens, hand-wash her laundry and
shuttle cases of liquor to her room at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in
Connecticut.

Against the advice of her lawyers, she testified in her own defense,
which exposed her to hours of withering cross-examination by Mr.
Kleinberg.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The case ended in a mistrial after Dr. Chang killed herself.

Charles Steven Kleinberg was born on Dec. 8, 1948, in Brooklyn to Sam
Kleinberg, a manager for the S. Klein department store, and Doris
(Cohen) Kleinberg.

After graduating from Samuel J. Tilden High School, he earned a
bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Brooklyn College in 1969 and a
master’s in math as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at Yale. But he realized he
was more interested in politics and government, so he enrolled in the
New York University School of Law and graduated first in his class in
1976.

He married Ms. Eschweiler in 1981. In addition to her, he is survived by
their daughter, Wendy April Kleinberg, and his sisters, Sharon Kleinberg
and Debbie Bancroft Kleinberg.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kleinberg worked for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
the New York State attorney general before he was named an assistant
United States attorney in 1980.

He kept up his scholarly side, earning a doctorate in philosophy from
Columbia University in 1994. After he retired in 2018, he re-enrolled in
Brooklyn College to study for a graduate degree in physics.

He tried more than 70 cases and argued more than 70 appeals during his
nearly 38 years in the civil and criminal divisions.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“His cross-examination style was to speak slowly and precisely and never
raise his voice, like an old professor,” said Kevan Cleary, the senior
trial lawyer in the office’s civil division. “He used logic against
witnesses and common sense, and he used his scientific mind to dissect a
case to the essential elements and destroy a witness’
credibility.”
