# Research Shows Students Falling Months Behind During Virus Disruptions

</div>

The abrupt switch to remote learning wiped out academic gains for many
students in America, and widened racial and economic gaps. Catching up
in the fall won’t be easy.

While a nation of burned-out, [involuntary home
schoolers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/coronavirus-schools-attendance-absent.html)
slogs to the finish line of a disrupted academic year, a picture is
emerging of the extent of the learning loss among children in America,
and the size of the gaps schools will be asked to fill when they reopen.

It is not pretty.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New research suggests that by September, most students will have fallen
behind where they would have been if they had stayed in classrooms, with
some losing the equivalent of a full school year’s worth of academic
gains. Racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps will most likely widen
[because of
disparities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/coronavirus-public-private-school.html)
in access to computers, home internet connections and direct instruction
from teachers.

And the crisis is far from over. The harm to students could grow if
schools continue to teach fully or partly online in the fall, or if they
reopen with significant budget cuts because of the economic downturn.
High school dropout rates could increase, researchers say, while younger
children could miss out on foundational concepts in phonics and
fractions that prepare them for a lifetime of learning and working.

In South Los Angeles, Danielle Gandy has spent countless difficult hours
guiding her energetic 6-year-old, Cadynce, through online meetings and
assignments provided by her charter school. Still, Ms. Gandy is under no
illusion that Cadynce has completed the normal kindergarten curriculum,
and is especially concerned about her progress in math.

“Looking at the work the teacher has done, I applaud her,” Ms. Gandy
said, “but it’s maybe a fraction of what they would be learning if they
were in an actual school setting. If they are transitioning into first
grade, will there be time to catch up and get them up to par?”

Teachers across the country share such worries. In Aurora, Colo.,
outside Denver, Clint Silva, a seventh-grade social studies teacher, was
planning to spend the spring working with his students on research
skills. For one remote assignment, he asked them to create a primary
source about [the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) that future
historians could
consult.

But a majority of his students have not consistently engaged with remote
assignments. They are [not receiving traditional
grades](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/coronavirus-high-school-grades.html),
and some have parents who are working outside the home or who are not

“We know this isn’t a good way to teach,” Mr. Silva said. “We want to
hold kids accountable. We want to see their progress, be in the
classroom with them and see them struggle and overcome that. Instead, we
are logging in for an hour a day, and kids are turning their cameras off
and staying quiet and not talking to us.”

Research can now estimate the size of the learning loss students have
experienced under such conditions. Because regular standardized testing
has been suspended, some of the research uses past disruptions to
learning — such as natural disasters or even summer break — to project
the potential impact of the current crisis. Other studies look at
schools that used online learning software before the coronavirus
shutdown, and check to see how students performed using the same
programs from home.

The average student could begin the next school year having lost as much
as a third of the expected progress from the previous year in reading
and half of the expected progress in math, according to a [working
paper](https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai20-226) from NWEA, a nonprofit
organization, and scholars at Brown University and the University of
Virginia.

A separate analysis of 800,000 students from [researchers at Brown and
Harvard](https://tracktherecovery.org/) looked at how Zearn, an online
math program, was used both before and after schools closed in March. It
found that through late April, student progress in math decreased by
about half in classrooms located in low-income ZIP codes, by a third in
classrooms in middle-income ZIP codes and not at all in classrooms in
high-income ZIP codes.

When all of the impacts are taken into account, the average student
could fall seven months behind academically, while black and Hispanic
students could experience even greater learning losses, equivalent to 10
months for black children and nine months for Latinos, according to [an
analysis from McKinsey &
Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-student-learning-in-the-united-states-the-hurt-could-last-a-lifetime),
the consulting group.

There are several reasons low-income, black and Hispanic students appear
to be suffering the most through the crisis. The Center on Reinventing
Public Education, a think tank, will release an analysis next week of
the pandemic learning policies of 477 school districts. It found that
only a fifth have required live teaching over video, and that wealthy
school districts were twice as likely to provide such teaching as
low-income districts.

Rural students have been especially cut off from their teachers. Only 27
percent of their districts required any instruction while schools were
closed, according to the center.

While almost every school has provided assignments for students to
complete independently, that does not necessarily mean that teachers
conducted remote lessons. Schools with many poor students sometimes
chose to relax instructional expectations on teachers because they knew
families did not have reliable access to home computers or internet
connections able to stream video.

The disparities in educational progress do not appear to be caused by
any lack of effort on the part of families. The poorest parents spent
about the same amount of time during school closures assisting their
children with learning — 13 hours per week — as those making over
$200,000 per year, according to a May [Census Bureau
survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp2.html) of
households with
children.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Administrators and teachers know they will need to catch students up in
the fall, perhaps through reviewing skills and content that would have
normally been covered this school year. But they face major hurdles and
competing priorities. Preparing school buildings to meet new state and
federal health guidelines — including smaller class sizes, temperature
checks and increased access to sinks, soap, personal protective
equipment and disinfectants — requires money and careful planning.

It is just as important to improve the quality of remote learning, given
the likelihood that schools in many parts of the country will face
[continued intermittent
closures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen.html)
to contain the virus, and that some parents will simply choose not to
send their children to classrooms before a vaccine is available.

Students are also expected to need a greatly increased level of social
and emotional support from counselors and therapists, in part because of
the impact of spending months in social isolation, often while families
experienced job loss, economic hardship and health distress.

All of this will need to happen as schools face significant budget cuts
that will not be offset by the federal infusion that has been promised
so far, according to Marguerite Roza, a school finance expert at
Georgetown University.

Schools could freeze hiring, especially for support roles like reading
specialists and counselors, and might cancel programs like pre-K and
after-school enrichment, she said.

as cities deal with the economic impact of the pandemic has emerged as a
major concern, and yet more evidence of racial inequality.

Already, New York City, the nation’s largest school district, [has

it would slow down the expansion of its universal pre-K program to
3-year-olds. California’s urban schools [have
warned](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6894024-2020-21StateBud-Urban-Let051820.html)
that budget cuts proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom could make it impossible
for them to reopen safely while simultaneously helping students catch up
academically.

In Broward County, Fla., north of Miami, Iman Cassells Alleyne, an
elementary school special education teacher, spent much of the spring
semester filming herself giving remote lessons on multiplication and
phonics, even as she home-schooled her own three sons. She wanted to
provide one-on-one tutoring and reached out to students numerous times,
but many were not able to regularly get online for remote learning
because of issues at home.

Her students have learning disabilities and behavioral disorders that
make school challenging under normal circumstances. Now, she is
concerned they will fall even further behind.

“If we continue doing things the way we do them,” she said, “we won’t be
able to fill those gaps.”
