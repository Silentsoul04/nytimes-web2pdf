The U.S. Marine Corps on Friday issued detailed directives about
removing and banning [public displays of the Confederate battle
flag](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/confederate-flags-monuments-statues)
at Marine installations — an order that extended to such items as [mugs,
posters and bumper
stickers](https://twitter.com/USMC/status/1269075089078784001?s=20).

“Current events are a stark reminder that it is not enough for us to
remove symbols that cause division — rather, we also must strive to
eliminate division itself,” the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen.
David H. Berger, [said in a statement on
Wednesday.](https://www.marines.mil/News/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Display/Article/2207572/message-from-the-commandant-of-the-marine-corps-and-the-sergeant-major-of-the-m/fbclid/IwAR12-WqkUEslW8WmtMiCk6CwitGjlg6xOg__tU5z7nUZH-2KD19eG4jCvBY/)

As protests across the United States have [erupted over police
brutality](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/30/us/george-floyd-protest-photos.html),
pressure has grown on officials to remove monuments and flags seen as
symbols of racism.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dozens of statues were removed after a white nationalist rally in
Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, and protesters demonstrating over the
death of [George Floyd, a black man who died in police
custody](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd.html)
in Minneapolis, are targeting some that remain.

In several states, anger has given way to the [damaging or defacing of
more than a dozen
symbols](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/confederate-statues-george-floyd.html)
of the Confederacy.

The mayor of Birmingham, Ala., this week [ordered the removal of a
contentious Confederate
statue](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/george-floyd-birmingham-confederate-statue.html)
from a public park a day after dozens demonstrated against it.

Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said this week he planned to order the
Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond to be removed. And the [city of
Philadelphia this week removed the statue of its former mayor, Frank
Rizzo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/frank-rizzo-statue-removal.html),
who took a confrontational approach to black and gay people as police
commissioner in the 1960s and ’70s.

[The Marine Corps said in a statement on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/USMC/status/1269075089078784001/photo/1)
that the [Confederate battle
flag](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-bubba-wallace-nascar.html)
had “all too often been co-opted by violent extremists and racist groups
whose divisive beliefs have no place in our Corps.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This presents a threat to our core values, unit cohesion, security, and
good order and discipline,” the statement said. “This must be
addressed.”

The move came after [an announcement in
April](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/marine-corps-confederate-flag.html)
by General Berger that the ban would be put in effect. At the time,
however, it was not clear how it would be applied and whether it would
extend to clothing and cars owned by Marines, for instance.

“I am mindful that many people believe that flag to be a symbol of
heritage and regional pride,” General Berger [said in a
letter](https://mca-marines.org/wp-content/uploads/CMC-Letter-R1.pdf) in
April to his fellow Marines. “But I am also mindful of the feelings of
pain and rejection of those who inherited the cultural memory and
present effects of the scourge of slavery in our country.”

The rule announced on Friday for the first time articulated in detail
what sorts of displays would be prohibited at office buildings, naval
vessels, hangars, ready rooms, conference rooms, individual offices,
cubicles, tool and equipment rooms, workshops, as well as other areas.

Among other items, the ban includes posters and flags depicting the
Confederate battle flag. The order allows for inspections to take place
and directs that any nonconforming displays be removed.

It was not immediately clear when the directive would be carried out. A
Marine Corps representative could not be reached on Saturday night.

The directive said that displays in which the Confederate battle flag
was depicted, but not the main focus of the display, were exempted from
the ban. This could apply to a presentation of the flag in a work of art
or an educational or historical display depicting a Civil War battle,
for instance.

Lecia Brooks, chief workplace transformation officer at the Southern
Poverty Law Center, said on Saturday that the Confederate battle flag
was a symbol of white supremacy and the enslavement of black people.

“We urge the other branches of the U.S. military to follow the U.S.
Marine Corps’ example, including the National Guard, state and local law
enforcement agencies, and other law enforcement branches of the federal
government and agencies governed by the Department of Homeland Security,
and remove all symbols of the Confederacy,” she said.
