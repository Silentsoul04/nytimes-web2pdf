\section{The U.S. Entered a Recession in
February}\label{the-us-entered-a-recession-in-february}}

The pandemic forced the economy to contract sharply, ending a record
expansion and prompting the group that dates U.S. business cycles to
formally declare a recession.

The sharp decline in economic activity in February marked the end of the
longest expansion in the U.S. since at least 1854, according to the
National Bureau of Economic Research. Here are expansions compared with
G.D.P since the end of WWII.

WASHINGTON --- The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/politics/mnuchin-powell-congress-economic-recovery.html}{United
States economy} officially entered a recession in February 2020, the
committee that calls downturns announced on Monday, bringing the longest
expansion on record to an end as the coronavirus pandemic caused
economic activity to slow sharply.

The economy hit its peak in February and has since fallen into a
downturn, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle
Dating Committee said. A recession begins when the economy reaches a
peak of activity and ends when it reaches its trough.

This downturn is the first since 2009, when the last recession ended,
and marks the end of the longest expansion --- 128 months --- in records
dating back to 1854. Most economists expect this recession to be both
particularly deep and exceptionally short, perhaps just a few months, as
states reopen and economic activity resumes.

The National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit group that tracks
economic cycles in the United States, noted the unusual circumstances
surrounding the slump in its announcement.

``The committee recognizes that the pandemic and the public health
response have resulted in a downturn with different characteristics and
dynamics than prior recessions,'' the group said. ``Nonetheless, it
concluded that the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment
and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants
the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to
be briefer than earlier contractions.''

Many economists believe the United States may already have exited the
recession --- or at least be on its way out.

Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist and a member of the
dating committee, said that he would bet a recovery started in April or
May, meaning that the recession would most likely last for only a couple
of months. Even so, he said, labeling it a downturn was not a hard
choice ``because of the extraordinary depth.''

``There's no way you can observe that happening and not call it a
recession,'' he said, while acknowledging that it was a very unusual
one. ``Nothing like it has ever happened.''

The National Bureau of Economic Research formally dates business cycles
based on a range of economic markers, importantly gross domestic product
and employment.

Economic activity in the United States began to contract sharply at the
very end of February and into early March as the coronavirus spread
across major metropolitan areas, like New York City, Chicago and
Atlanta. Shops closed, travelers canceled flights and diners began
avoiding restaurants, even before some states issued formal stay-at-home
orders.

Real-time economic gauges, like a series on
\href{https://markets.jpmorgan.com/research/open/latest/publication/9002054}{Chase
credit card spending} produced by J.P. Morgan, show that spending pulled
back sharply in early March and has gradually rebounded since late
April. Even so, spending remains well below pre-crisis levels.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/08/business/08DC-RECESSION-01/merlin_173121189_32d17e11-4c5c-4fcf-a370-99df150a7f52-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

The \href{https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE}{unemployment rate},
a crucial gauge of economic health and an important input to business
cycle dating, began to rise in March before jumping to 14.7 percent in
April. It eased slightly to 13.3 percent in May, data released last week
showed, but that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/business/economy/jobs-report.html}{is
higher} than the peak jobless rate in the Great Recession.

``We've already seen signs that the economy is past the trough and is in
the recovery phase,'' said Matthew Luzzetti, the chief U.S. economist at
Deutsche Bank Securities. But there are differences between the overall
level of output and the period-to-period change because the former is
likely to remain depressed for some time, even as the latter bounces
back.

Economists in a Bloomberg survey expect growth to contract by 9.7
percent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year,
followed by a 6.8 percent contraction in the third quarter relative to
the third quarter of 2019.

Looking at a commonly used annualized rate, which states the numbers so
that they are easily comparable from period to period, growth is
expected to contract by a 34 percent rate in the second quarter before
bouncing back at a 15 percent pace in the third.

``It's going to take longer to recover the level of activity, even
though the growth rate is strong,'' Mr. Luzzetti said.

The global economy as a whole will experience its deepest recession
since World War II this year, according to a World Bank
\href{https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects}{forecast
released} on Monday. Global output will shrink by 5.2 percent, the
institution said, warning that while growth is likely to rebound in
2021, a more protracted pandemic that leads to a breakdown in financial
markets and global trade could darken the outlook.
