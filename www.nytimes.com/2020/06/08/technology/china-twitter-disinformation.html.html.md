much
else.

As the Trump administration lashes out at China over a range of
grievances, Beijing’s top diplomats and representatives are using the
president’s favorite online megaphone — Twitter — to slap back with a
pugnaciousness that is best described as Trumpian.

Behind China’s combative new messengers, a murky hallelujah chorus of
sympathetic accounts has emerged to repost them and cheer them on. Many
are new to the platform. Some do little else but amplify the Beijing
line.

No doubt some of these accounts are run by patriotic, tech-savvy Chinese
people who get around their government’s ban on Twitter and other
Western platforms. But an analysis by The New York Times found that many
of the accounts behaved with a single-mindedness that could suggest a
coordinated campaign of the type that nation states have carried out on
Twitter in the past.

Of the roughly 4,600 accounts that reposted China’s leading envoys and
state-run news outlets during a recent week, many acted suspiciously,
The Times found. One in six tweeted with extremely high frequency
despite having few followers, as if they were being used as
loudspeakers, not as sharing platforms.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nearly one in seven tweeted almost nothing of their own, instead filling
their feeds with reposts of the official Chinese accounts and others.

In all, one third of the accounts had been created in the last three
months, as the war of words with the Trump administration heated up. One
in seven had zero followers.

The United States and China are battling to dominate the global
narrative. China was criticized for its [early
mishandling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
of the coronavirus outbreak, but it has regained confidence as other
countries have made their own stumbles. With [the United States in
turmoil](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/world/asia/china-george-floyd.html),
upended first by the epidemic and now by protests, Beijing sees a chance
to define itself as a global leader, one [unafraid to press its
interests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/world/asia/china-hong-kong-taiwan.html)
in Hong Kong and the region.

It is far from clear that the Chinese government is behind the swarms of
accounts helping to spread its gospel on Twitter. Online information
campaigns are becoming increasingly sophisticated as malicious actors
get better at disguising their digital activity, security experts say.
They now rarely make telltale mistakes such as using social media
accounts that were all created on the same day, follow one another and
post the same material.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Campaigns are often uncovered one small piece at a time. Twitter has
declared operations to be state-backed after identifying [as few as six
accounts](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/info-ops-disclosure-data-september-2019.html).

Much is unknown about China’s covert influence activities in particular.
[Twitter last year suspended more than 200,000
accounts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/18/world/asia/hk-twitter.html)
that it called a [Chinese state-backed
operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/hong-kong-protests-china-disinformation-facebook-twitter.html)
aimed at discrediting Hong Kong’s protesters, though it said little
about how it came to that
conclusion.

Still, The Times’s findings add to other recent evidence suggesting that
Twitter is being manipulated to amplify pro-Beijing messages. Next Dim,
a data firm in Israel, discovered two mundane-looking tweets praising
China’s coronavirus response that were liked and reposted hundreds of
thousands of times in March, possibly with the help of strategically
placed influencer accounts.

The U.S. State Department found inauthentic-seeming accounts that in
April cited [a Cambridge University
study](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/covid-19-genetic-network-analysis-provides-snapshot-of-pandemic-origins)
to raise doubts that the coronavirus originated in China. The most
active of these accounts referred to the study in scores of tweets, even
though the study’s lead author dismissed that interpretation of its
findings.

Neither Next Dim’s findings nor the State Department’s have been
previously reported.

“Improving the health of the public conversation is a priority for our
company,” Twitter said in a statement. “Platform manipulation, including
spam and other attempts to undermine the public conversation, is a
violation of the Twitter Rules.”

The State Department has [denounced China’s
efforts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/politics/china-russia-coronavirus-disinformation.html)
to burnish its image and drown out criticism during the pandemic,
comparing them to Russia’s disinformation campaigns. Both countries are
using a range of tools to “shape and tilt any given information
environment in their favor,” said Lea Gabrielle, coordinator of the
department’s Global Engagement Center.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“I think the Chinese Communist Party is still trying to define its
relationship with Twitter,” said [Kristine
Lee](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/dangerous-synergies), a
fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “But the Covid-19
pandemic has served as an important period of experimentation.”

The U.S.-China tongue-lashing adds to the questions vexing Twitter about
[how it treats inflammatory or misleading
remarks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/technology/twitter-trump-dorsey.html)
from world leaders. Mr. Trump has [accused the
company](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1266326065833824257)
of censoring him and other Republicans while ignoring questionable posts
by Democrats and the Chinese government.

Beijing’s Twitter brigade includes Hua Chunying, the head of the foreign
ministry’s information department. Since joining the platform in
October, Ms. Hua has attracted more than half a million followers with
her [feisty
put-downs](https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1266741986096107520)
of the United States.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In [a Communist Party
journal](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_3900567) last year,
Ms. Hua wrote that China had to find a voice in international affairs
that was commensurate with its economic strength. “We have walked closer
to the center of the world stage than ever before, but we still do not
grasp the microphone completely in our hands,” she wrote.

One reason, she wrote: a lack of “fighting spirit.”

Another foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, [became notorious after
tweeting](https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823) that
the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to China. Twitter
later added a [fact-checking
label](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/technology/trump-twitter-fact-check.html)
to Mr. Zhao’s post.

The Times analyzed all of the tweets that Ms. Hua, Mr. Zhao and 12 other
Twitter users linked to the Chinese government posted between May 18 and
May 25.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The other users included the foreign ministry’s main account, as well as
the accounts of China’s ambassadors to the United States and Britain.
They also included nine accounts run by state news outlets.

That week, Beijing moved to tighten its [control over Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/world/asia/hong-kong-china.html).
Mr. Trump threatened to cut off [funding to the World Health
Organization](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/health/coronavirus-who-china-trump.html).
American officials congratulated Taiwan’s president on the start of her
second term. China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, [was
furious](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/20/c_139072817.htm).

Ms. Hua mused about [whether the coronavirus actually originated in the
United
States](https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1263053023137263616):
“Scientists at the US NIH began developing a \#COVID19 vaccine on
January 11. There were reports of cases as early as November last year.
Any explanation or investigation?” Her post, which refers to the
National Institutes of Health, was liked 4,600 times.

The Times’s analysis found that hundreds of the 4,600 accounts that
reposted the Chinese government mouthpieces that week behaved
suspiciously. Many were incessant tweeters despite having limited
followings. After excluding accounts that had zero followers and had
tweeted five times or fewer, over a sixth of the accounts had posted 100
or more times for every follower.

A few accounts repeatedly retweeted at set lengths of time after the
original post — 9 hours and 49 minutes after, 19 hours and 34 minutes
after — suggesting that software had been used to schedule their tweets.
Twitter has since suspended some of the accounts for violating its
policies.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When contacted by The Times, several pro-China Twitter users denied
being part of a government campaign but acknowledged that they joined
the platform specifically to follow the foreign ministry
representatives. The ministry did not respond to a request for
comment.

Others said they were either curious about Mr. Trump’s tweets about
China or felt demonized by them.

“He has done so many shameless things for re-election,” one user,
@beautifullady76, said in a Twitter message. “Countless Chinese people
are angry and everyone has the right to the truth. We just want to say a
fair word for China\!”

Public records show that Beijing is trying to expand its influence on
the Western internet. China’s internet regulator has sought out
contractors to help it “make use of overseas social media platforms to
develop online propaganda on major themes,” procurement documents show.

Much of this kind of activity may not appear in official documents,
however. The regulator did not respond to a request for comment.

“There’s no reason to think that the parts of the Chinese government
that are formally in charge of conducting information operations are not
able to conduct operations that are as sophisticated as others’,” said
Camille François of the network analysis company Graphika. “They just
haven’t been publicly exposed and dissected yet.”

Researchers remain on the lookout. ProPublica tracked [10,000 fishy
accounts](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-china-built-a-twitter-propaganda-machine-then-let-it-loose-on-coronavirus)
that posted about the coronavirus and the Hong Kong protests. Alkemy, an
Italian digital marketing firm, [found that inauthentic-looking
users](https://formiche.net/2020/03/china-unleashed-twitter-bots-covid19-propaganda-italy/)
were behind many posts celebrating Chinese medical aid to Italy.

In March, two tweets lauding China’s handling of the outbreak were liked
and reposted hundreds of thousands of times. The posts were not
shocking, funny or newsworthy, and originated from users with modest
followings.

That caught the attention of Next Dim, an Israeli company that uses
network analytics to identify and prevent financial crime.

“While scanning Twitter, our systems automatically discovered a huge
irregularity,” said Next Dim’s chief executive, Netta Marrom. Too huge,
he believes, to be the result of chance.

On March 12, the first user,
[@manisha\_kataki](https://twitter.com/manisha_kataki/status/1238007207700180992),
posted a video showing workers disinfecting streets in China. “At this
rate, China will be back in action very soon, may be much faster than
the world expects,” the user wrote.

The next day, another user, @Ejiketion, retweeted the post, marveling at
how China had locked down cities and built coronavirus hospitals. In the
West, by contrast, “We washing our hands LOL,” @Ejiketion wrote. The
account has since been deleted.

The two posts together received more than 382,000 retweets and 1.1
million likes, many of them within the first two days. That made them
roughly as popular as [Elon Musk’s
tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1236029449042198528), also
from March, in which the head of Tesla called the coronavirus panic
“dumb.”

Two other posts that also retweeted @manisha\_kataki but translated
@Ejiketion’s comment into
[Spanish](https://twitter.com/andruklepe/status/1238573314534264838) and
[French](https://twitter.com/buenvcosv/status/1238927468041588737)
received a combined 67,000 retweets and 181,000 likes.

Next Dim identified around 20 Twitter users whose followers accounted
for thousands of the retweets of @manisha\_kataki’s and @Ejiketion’s
posts. Some of these users had immense followings but rarely tweeted
about
China.

Next Dim’s analysis uncovered other signs that the two tweets’
popularity may not have been organic. Few of the first users to retweet
@manisha\_kataki’s post were followers of the account, which means they
were unlikely to have seen the tweet in their timelines. Thousands of
accounts reposted both tweets, even though @Ejiketion’s tweet was itself
a repost of @manisha\_kataki’s.

Neither @manisha\_kataki nor @Ejiketion responded to requests for
comment.
