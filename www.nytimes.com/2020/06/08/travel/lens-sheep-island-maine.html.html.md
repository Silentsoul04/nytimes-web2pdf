# Shearing Sheep, and Hewing to Tradition, on an Island in Maine

</div>

In a remote area of Maine, the Wakeman family maintains the traditions
of island shepherding, the cycles of which have been largely unchanged
for centuries.

*With travel restrictions in place worldwide, we’ve launched a new
series,* [*The World Through a

shares a collection of photographs from a set of islands in Maine.*

Three miles off the coast of Maine, in a remote area northeast of Acadia
National Park, lies a cluster of islands — including Little Nash Island,
Big Nash Island and Flat Island — populated only by sheep.

The Wakeman family, who live on the nearby mainland, are the year-round
caretakers. Alfie Wakeman works full-time as a pediatric provider in the
local clinic. His wife, Eleni, works full-time as a speech-language
pathologist and the assistant fire chief for the local volunteer fire
department. Their three daughters — Wren, Lilly and Evie — are all
college-age or newly graduated.

Each spring, Alfie leaves his medical practice for three weeks to live
on Big Nash Island for the lambing season. (In his text messages, Alfie
includes smiley faces when he talks about going to the island, or about
new lambs; sad faces punctuate his texts when he discusses leaving the
island.) The sheep, wild and self-sufficient, are able to thrive off the
providence of the island. But every so often a sick lamb needs special
care.

About a century ago, a 10-year-old girl named Jenny Cirone — the

Alfie, Eleni and their daughters knew Jenny well. They lived next door

Jenny knew everything about the island and the ocean around it. She
hauled lobster traps with Alfie almost until the day she died, a month
shy of 92. She remembered each sheep, its lineage, how much wool it
made. She gave names to every lamb, and to each spot on the ocean floor
that was good for a lobster trap.

At the end of lambing season, a community gathers on Big Nash to help
round up and shear the sheep. (The other islands’ sheep will be sheared,
too, but those require smaller crews.) The volunteers — around 40 people
— include a handful of knitters and spinners; they often wear sweaters
made of [Nash Island wool](https://www.starcroftfiber.com/yarn/). Some
show up because they live down the road and are accustomed to pitching
in. Others are lured by an adoration of good wool. Still others come
because of the island itself — for the tradition, for the memory of
Jenny.

Before they’re sheared, the sheep must be rounded up — a process that
requires considerable patience. Around 20 people sweep the island
methodically; no animals can be left behind on the little hills or rocky
beaches, and the sheep shouldn’t be spooked. (Sheep are notoriously
skittish.) Everyone joins in — their arms outstretched, their hands
sometimes clasped together — as they funnel the sheep toward a corral
made of salvaged
driftwood.

When the corral is full, the crew works to pull lambs from underneath
the sheep, moving them to a separate pen; there, the rams are castrated
and the ewes’ tails are docked. Each lamb and sheep is carefully checked
and given any necessary care. Meanwhile, the shearers skim whirring
blades along the bodies of the sheep, their hands and the clippers
hidden under the thick wool. (Much of shearing is done blindly, by
feel.)

The work is physically demanding, but the shearers move quickly, often
without pausing for food or water. After hours of labor, and once the
last sheep’s wool has been removed, the shearers return their tools to
their cases, the blades slick with lanolin, and the group migrates to a
cabin — Big Nash’s lone building — for a potluck meal: baked beans, a
salad, turkey, rhubarb cakes. A simple rule is announced: “The shearers
eat
first.”

Maine was once a land of shepherds. Its islands and coastal communities
were dotted with the fleeced bodies of sheep, its shrubs and trees
grazed into oblivion. Historical photos show wide expanses of pasture
that have now become thick with forests and houses.

Back then, there were more families like the Wakemans, who raised their
own animals and grew their own food, who gathered people together to
share both their work and a meal, who used dark humor and whispered
their thanks on the days when animals gave up their wool or became
food.

Some of the sheep spend their entire lives on these islands, from birth
to death. They *become* the islands. Their sun-bleached bones are
entrenched in the earth, embedded in the grassy knolls and wetlands
where they once grazed, their bodies decomposing to nourish a new
generation.

Jenny Cirone is also here; her gravestone sits at the far end of Big
Nash, her ashes buried in the place with the best view of the
lighthouse. She, too, is a part of the island — the grass, the sea, the
sheep, the story.
