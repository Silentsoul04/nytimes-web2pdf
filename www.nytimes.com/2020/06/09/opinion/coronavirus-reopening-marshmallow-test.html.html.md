*This article is part of Paul Krugman’s free newsletter. You can* [*sign

The marshmallow test is a famous psychological experiment that tests
children’s willingness to delay gratification. Children are offered a
marshmallow, but told that they can have a second marshmallow if they’re
willing to wait 15 minutes before eating the first one. Claims that
children with the willpower to hold out do much better in life [haven’t
held up
well](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/marshmallow-test/561779/),
but the experiment is still a useful metaphor for many choices in life,
both by individuals and by larger groups.

One way to think about the Covid-19 pandemic is that it poses a kind of
marshmallow test for society.

At this point, there have been enough international success stories in
dealing with the coronavirus to leave us with a clear sense of what
beating the pandemic takes. First, you have to impose strict social
distancing long enough to reduce the number of infected people to a
small fraction of the population. Then you have to implement a regime of
testing, tracing and isolating: quickly identifying any new outbreak,
finding everyone exposed and quarantining them until the danger is past.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This strategy is workable. South Korea has done it. [New
Zealand](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/world/australia/new-zealand-coronavirus-ardern.html)
has done it.

But you have to be strict and you have to be patient, staying the course
until the pandemic is over, not giving in to the temptation to return to
normal life while the virus is still widespread. So it is, as I said, a
kind of marshmallow test.

And America is failing that test.

New U.S. cases and deaths have
[declined](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
since early April, but that’s almost entirely because the greater New
York area, after a horrific outbreak, has achieved huge progress. In
many parts of the country — including our most populous states,
California, Texas, and Florida — the disease is still spreading.
Overall, new cases are plateauing and may be starting to rise. Yet state
governments are moving to reopen anyway.

This is a very different story from what’s happening in [other advanced
countries](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-coronavirus-cases-world-map/?srnd=premium&sref=qzusa8bC#global-new-cases),
even hard-hit nations like Italy and Spain, where new cases have fallen
dramatically. It now looks likely that by late summer we’ll be the only
major wealthy nation where large numbers of people are still dying from
Covid-19.

Why are we failing the test? It’s easy to blame Donald Trump, a
man-child who would surely gobble down that first marshmallow, then try
to steal marshmallows from other kids. But America’s impatience, its
unwillingness to do what it takes to deal with a threat that can’t be
beaten with threats of violence, runs much deeper than one man.

It doesn’t help that Republicans are ideologically opposed to government
safety-net programs, which are what make the economic consequences of
social distancing tolerable; as I explain in [my recent
column](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/opinion/coronavirus-jobs-report.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage),
they seem determined to let crucial emergency relief expire far too
soon. Nor does it help that even low-cost measures to limit the spread
of Covid-19, above all wearing face masks (which mainly protect other
people), have been caught up in our culture wars.

America in 2020, it seems, is too disunited, with too many people in the
grip of ideology and partisanship, to deal effectively with a pandemic.
We have the knowledge, we have the resources, but we don’t have the
will.
