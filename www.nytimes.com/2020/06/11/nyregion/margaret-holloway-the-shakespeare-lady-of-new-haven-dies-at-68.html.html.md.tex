68}\label{margaret-holloway-the-shakespeare-lady-of-new-haven-dies-at-68}}

A once-promising director and actor who struggled with mental illness
and drug addiction, she performed for years on the city's streets. She
died of Covid-19.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

On the streets of New Haven, Conn., Margaret Holloway was known as the
``Shakespeare Lady,'' a tall, striking woman in ragged clothing who
recited dramatic monologues for spare change.

Her stage, often, was outside Willoughby's coffee shop, a hangout for
Yale students and professionals. Her repertoire included ``The
Tempest,'' ``Macbeth'' and the Greek alphabet, which she acted out
letter by letter.

Many regarded Ms. Holloway as an eccentric local fixture; in the view of
some business owners, however, she was
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/nyregion/a-resurgent-downtown-wearies-of-a-street-poets-antic-disposition.html}{an
aggressive panhandler and public nuisance}. But for those who knew her
personal history, her life had tragic dimensions not unlike the material
she performed.

Ms. Holloway was a 1980 graduate of the Yale School of Drama and a
once-promising director, playwright and actor. In the early 1970s she
was a drama major at Bennington College in Vermont.

``She was star of the theater department,'' Laura Spector, a college
friend, said in an interview. ``She was so talented, so powerful, so
magnetic.''

Ms. Holloway's career was cut short by mental illness and drug addiction
soon after she left Yale. But she never stopped seeking understanding,
human connection and, above all, artistic expression.

``She loved people --- she had relationships with everyone all over New
Haven,'' said \href{https://www.drama.yale.edu/bios/joan-channick/}{Joan
Channick}, a Yale drama school professor who struck up a friendship with
Ms. Holloway in the 1990s. ``She called herself a great thespian. She
had a lot of confidence in herself.''

Ms. Holloway died at 68 on May 30 at Yale New Haven Hospital. Gloria
Astarita, her court-appointed conservator, said the cause was the novel
coronavirus.

In ``\href{http://www.afterart.com/holloway.html}{God Didn't Give Me a
Week's Notice},'' a short documentary about Ms. Holloway released in
2001, Ms. Holloway said she began experiencing signs of mental illness
about 1983. She described her mental landscape this way: ``I'm being
raped. I'm being raped 24 hours a day, seven days a week.''

Living in a dingy rooming house or on the streets, Ms. Holloway
performed in the shadow of Yale's campus, clinging, in a way, to a time
in her life when she was healthy, successful and full of promise.
Through it all her aspirations remained high-minded.

``She would want to have a disquisition about directing some Shakespeare
play,'' Ms. Channick said. ``Having those conversations with someone who
was living on the streets, it was jarring. Here's this person so
connected to people, well-educated, with a love of art and theater,
whose life was destroyed by mental illness.''

Margaret Ann Holloway was born on Sept. 7, 1951, in Albany, Ga., to the
Rev. Walter Holloway, a minister, and Bertha (Prince) Holloway, a
homemaker. Ms. Holloway became estranged from her family as an adult.

Through a nonprofit group that provides scholarships to gifted minority
students, Ms. Holloway attended Northfield Mount Hermon, a prep school
in Massachusetts. She attended Carleton College in Minnesota for a year
before transferring to Bennington, where she came into her own as a
drama student.

Ms. Spector said she vividly remembered the one-woman autobiographical
play that Ms. Holloway wrote, directed and starred in for her senior
thesis, a work that dealt with her upbringing as a young black woman in
the rural South. ``She brought down the house,'' Ms. Spector said.

After decades out of touch, Ms. Spector reconnected with Ms. Holloway in
2005 after reading a newspaper article about her. She found the same
lively, gregarious, emotionally intelligent person she had known. ``I
knocked on the door and from the top of the stairs she called out,
`Laura, how the hell are you?''' Ms. Spector said. ``She didn't miss a
beat.''

Ms. Holloway, who stopped performing in the street about three years ago
because of failing health, found a measure of stability and calm in
recent times. Residing in a nursing home in New Haven, she had clean
clothes, regular meals, a shower and monthly visits from Ms. Channick
and other friends, who brought her money and the small luxuries she
asked for, like lipstick.

``We would talk about what was going on in the world,'' Ms. Channick
said. ``But mostly, we would talk about theater.''
