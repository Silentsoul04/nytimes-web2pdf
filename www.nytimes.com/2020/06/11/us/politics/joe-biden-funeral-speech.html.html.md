Joe Biden has delivered powerful eulogies since the 1970s. He’s
eulogized academics (Nasrollah Fatemi in 1990).

He’s eulogized senators (William Roth of Delaware in 2003).

And childhood friends (Pete McLaughlin in 1989).

No matter whom he honors, Biden’s words are personal (Representative Tom
Lantos in 2008).

June 11, 2020

An overstuffed binder sat in Joe Biden’s Senate office, holding the raw
materials of his grief.

It was a master collection, aides recalled, with remarks, notes and
drafts of eulogies Mr. Biden had given through 2008 — for childhood
friends, prominent senators, his own father. The table of contents was
long enough to use every letter of the alphabet. It included a section
of favored passages, often deployed in his remembrances, labeled
“Quotable Quotes: Death.”

“Death is part of this life,” one such axiom read, “and not of the
next.”

And it has been, in many ways, the defining part of Mr. Biden’s.

The compilation, never before detailed publicly, is the sort of trove
that few but Mr. Biden could amass, or even think to — a meticulous
testament to the mixture of mourning and resilience that has shaped
virtually every aspect of his personal and political history.

Mr. Biden has been linked to matters of death and recovery since [the
minute he was sworn in as a United States
senator](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/03/archives/biden-takes-oath-friday.html),
from the hospital where his two toddler sons were recovering after the
[1972 car
crash](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/19/archives/bidens-wife-child-killed-in-car-crash.html)
that killed his first wife, Neilia, and their daughter, Naomi. One of
those sons, Beau, died of cancer at 46, [five years
ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/us/politics/joseph-r-biden-iii-vice-presidents-son-beau-dies-at-46.html)
last month.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the scope of the personal losses Mr. Biden has endured, and his
fluency in discussing death — a subject many elected leaders hope to
avoid — go beyond what is commonly understood.

A Times review of nearly 60 eulogies Mr. Biden has delivered, as well as
interviews with more than two dozen friends, former staff members and
relatives of those he has eulogized, offer an intimate window into how
he sought to comfort those joining him in mourning, and how he would
seek to lead a nation grappling with death and devastation.

Throughout the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, as he
campaigned from his home in Wilmington, Del., he was [often
overshadowed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/us/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-2020.html)
by [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
and his bully pulpit. But even then, Mr. Biden’s most memorable
appearances tended to center on grief.

He marked 100,000 virus deaths with [a
video](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1265757168504049664?s=20)
that resembled an Oval Office address to the nation, empathizing with
grieving families and sharing advice about coping. His first [public
appearance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/us/politics/joe-biden-memorial-day.html)
after two months of virtual campaigning came on Memorial Day, when he
wore a black mask to pay respects to the war dead.

And in March, he nearly gave out his phone number on national
television, urging anyone struggling with grief to get in touch. “Not
that I’m an expert,” [he
said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/cnn-town-hall-takeaways-joe-biden/index.html).
“But just, having been there.”

In this age of staggering national loss, his admirers say, it is Mr.
Biden’s experience as a kind of emissary of bereavement — a man who has
been there and can speak with credibility about what comes next — that
illustrates his most powerful contrast with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Biden perhaps never sounds more forceful than when accusing the
president of having no “empathy.”

death. “It’s hard not to juxtapose someone who seems to get pleasure out

reaction is to try and make it

Taken together, the eulogies also supply a portrait of Mr. Biden in his
purest form: espousing a throwback value set premised on his own ideas
of “dignity,” “style” and “nobility,” three favored nouns across the
decades; revering the clubhouse norms of a bygone Washington; fixating
on what it means to be “a good man” (“the highest praise you can give”),
an Irishman (“I don’t think there’s any point in being Irish,” he said,
[borrowing from Daniel Patrick
Moynihan](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/26/obituaries/former-senator-daniel-patrick-moynihan-dead-at-76.html),
“if you don’t know that the world is going to break your heart
eventually”) — and what it means to be a *Biden*.

“We loved him because his instincts were good, because he was a man of
honor, because he was a Biden,” Mr. Biden wrote in his 2002 eulogy for
his father. “A dreamer burdened with reality, a sensitive spirit layered
in stoicism.”

This self-definition, accurate as any friend could conjure, may be
missing only one beat: a person who would say all this about himself in
public.

The eloquent, sometimes lyrical Mr. Biden who animated these pages over
the years was rarely glimpsed on the major stages of the 2020 primary
race, where he often meandered and
[misstepped](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/us/politics/biden-south-africa-arrest-mandela.html).
His gift for compassion more often served him in the hours Mr. Biden,
now 77, spent with voters afterward.

The [Biden of the rope
line](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/biden-new-hampshire-2020.html)
— by turns exuberant and empathetic, a backslapping, gregarious senator
at heart — is very much recognizable in his eulogies. He holds eye
contact with widowed spouses and children. He sands the rough edges in
the biographies of the deceased. He shouts out former colleagues
inclusively, the references landing now as heady signals of time’s
march, with Mr. Biden’s position at the microphone a rare constant
through the years.

“Lindsey, this one’s hard,” he said at Mr. McCain’s memorial, addressing
Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime friend who has more recently become a
Trump ally [pushing

“Fritz, he was one complex guy,” Mr. Biden said to Senator Fritz
Hollings in 2003, setting off on his most controversial eulogy, for
Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who was for decades an avowed
segregationist.

service. It was [time to eulogize Mr.

## Comforting the living

“Another funeral,” [Jill
Biden](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/us/politics/joe-jill-biden-2020.html)
wrote last April in the subject line of an email to her supervisor at
Northern Virginia Community College. [Mr. Hollings had
died](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/obituaries/ernest-hollings-dead.html)
that weekend and Dr. Biden, an English professor, was hoping for a day
off.

“Joe is the eulogist,” she said. “Is it a problem if I go on Tuesday,
April 16?”

It was a familiar request, and one quickly granted. Dr. Biden had raised
similar questions in recent months as her husband was tapped to offer
remarks for Mr. McCain and [John D. Dingell
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/john-dingell-dead-longest-congressman.html),
the longtime Michigan congressman.

Through the scores of eulogies he has delivered, Mr. Biden has developed
a grim expertise that, combined with his personal history, has produced
a kind of mission statement of mourning: “Funerals are for the living,”
he wrote in one of his memoirs.

Detailing the tics and triumphs of colleagues or loved ones, Mr. Biden
prioritizes acknowledging the children of the dead, warmly referring to
“your dad” or “your mom.” “You’ve got good blood,” he tells them. In
the compilation of eulogies through 2008 — a document provided by Mr.
Biden’s campaign and independently described by several former aides —
Mr. Biden often nodded to spouses by recounting their marriages with a
love poem from the 16th-century writer Christopher Marlowe.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Carol Balick was one of those spouses to hear a Biden eulogy — he [spoke
at](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/money/business/2017/06/21/sid-balick-giant-politics-and-law-remembered-thursday/413521001/)
a memorial service for her husband, Sid Balick, in 2017, decades after
Mr. Balick hired Mr. Biden as a [young
lawyer](https://www.balick.com/about-us/). The couple knew Mr. Biden
before the rest of the country did, back when he lost his first wife and
daughter.

“I think about Joe just enveloped in grief in his life, just enveloped
in grief, and how the privacy of grief was invaded by his public
responsibilities,” said Ms. Balick, 84, who attended Neilia and Naomi’s
memorial [in
December 1972](https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=49364802&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjE1NDk1NTQxNywiaWF0IjoxNTkwNTM0NDUzLCJleHAiOjE1OTA2MjA4NTN9.iIQiBIe9RoHDWxgnh9rPtdeADSC8mH9YJG80KC9J748).

Ms. Balick has retained an enduring image of that service: Mr. Biden at
the front door of the church afterward, a 30-year-old senator-elect
consoling his guests. “Hundreds and hundreds of people, many of them
just sobbing, grief-stricken,” Ms. Balick said. “And Joe comforted them
as they left the church.”

In the decades since, Mr. Biden — whose campaign declined to make him
available for an interview — has been quick to remind his audiences that
the healing process can be uneven, speaking of the “black hole” that can
linger long after a death.

Addressing grieving military families in 2012, Mr. Biden described
becoming furious with his God after the accident.

“You *can’t* be good,” he [recalled
thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwZ6UfXm410), through gritted
teeth. “*How* can you be good?” He came to understand, he said, how
someone could contemplate suicide.

He landed on a line for mourners that has become his signature grieving
advice, dispensed to [tearful
voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/joe-biden-beau-biden-death.html)
on the campaign trail and repeated [as recently as last
month](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1265757168504049664): the
idea that a memory of the person who died will one day bring a smile
before a tear. He offered a version of that message as he memorialized
Senator [Henry M. “Scoop”
Jackson](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/03/obituaries/senator-henry-m-jackson-is-dead-at-71.html)
of Washington in 1983, and has shared it many times over.

## Validating the dead

As he began speaking about Strom Thurmond in 2003, Mr. Biden wondered
aloud why he was there.

“I’ll never figure him out,” he said, joking that his speech was the
“last laugh” for the once-proud segregationist. “What else could
explain a Northeast liberal’s presence here as the only outsider
speaking today?”

One explanation was straightforward: The two had grown genuinely close
over Mr. Biden’s decades in the Senate.

Another was implicit: Mr. Biden had a habit of judging the dead as they
had hoped to be judged.

And so, Mr. Biden ruled, Mr. Thurmond was a “product of his time,” a
“brave man” who eventually “moved to the good side.”

He approximated a quote from William Hazlitt, an English writer: “Death
conceals everything but truth and strips a man of everything but genius
and virtue.”

“The truth and genius and virtue of Strom Thurmond,” Mr. Biden said, “is
what I choose, and we all choose, to remember today.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is that instinct that makes a Biden eulogy “the clearest expression
of his worldview,” said Jeff Nussbaum, a former speechwriter, defining
this outlook as: “Try to find that which is worth celebrating, or at
least recognizing, in others.”

Mr. Nussbaum recalled the “impolitic observation” about “Irish
Alzheimer’s,” an imagined condition where all is forgotten but the
grudges. “Joe Biden, when it comes to eulogies, is the opposite,” he
said. “He forgets the grudges and remembers only the positives.”

Of course, this approach carries risk in other settings. Last year, Mr.
Biden [attracted
criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-eastland.html)
for speaking warmly about his [working relationships with segregationist
senators](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html).

More broadly, some Democrats see Mr. Biden’s paeans to bipartisan
civility as dated and naïve amid the tribalism of the Trump age, even as
allies hope he will appeal to moderates disillusioned by the president.
Whatever the result, the eulogies affirm how central this bearing is to
Mr. Biden’s self-identity. Several include touches of performative
marvel that he, a Democrat, has come to compliment a Republican.

His preference for compromise over ideological rigidity has also seeped
perceptibly into his prose. “Our differences were profound,” Mr. Biden
said of Mr. Thurmond, “but I came to understand that as Archibald
MacLeish wrote: ‘It is not in the world of ideas that life is lived.
Life is lived, for better or worse, in life.’”

For those who have demonstrated “courage” or “loyalty,” in Mr. Biden’s
estimation, a special commendation tends to follow, particularly if a
subject has helped Mr. Biden at some political cost. In eulogies for
both Mr. Thurmond and Senator Ted Kennedy, Mr. Biden saluted them for
defending his integrity as [plagiarism

felled his 1988 presidential run.

Senator [Arlen
Specter](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/us/politics/arlen-specter-senator-dies-at-82.html)
of Pennsylvania, a Republican for most of his career, was recognized for
cutting an advertisement for Mr. Biden’s 1990 re-election. “Do you know
anyone who would do that in politics?” Mr. Biden asked at Mr. Specter’s
memorial in 2012.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“He gave a deeply personal eulogy,” Mr. Specter’s son Shanin said.
“Maybe a tad long — maybe a tad long — but that was OK.”

## Hallmarks of a Biden eulogy

In the summer of 1991, Mr. Biden scrawled out bullet points to
memorialize his first father-in-law, Robert N. Hunter.

He moved through the hallmarks of a Biden remembrance — Shakespeare,
Emerson, self-deprecation. After jotting down several pages of largely
handwritten notes, he looked to a eulogy he had given two years earlier
for a close friend, Pete McLaughlin, who died at 45.

“He did not choose his lot, but once it was drawn, he showed us how a
man should play it,” Mr. Biden had written, underlining the word “man.”
“That is Pete — and that is no ordinary man\!”

This time, Mr. Biden crossed out “Pete,” writing in “Mr. H.”

The echoes emphasized the layers of loss that have shaded his life — and
offered a glimpse of the vocabulary of grief he was assembling.

Over the years, Mr. Biden repurposed his own words for multiple
memorials, demonstrating a fondness for certain linguistic flourishes
that became trademarks of his eulogies.

His father, Representative [Tom
Lantos](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/12/washington/12lantos.html) of
California and Mr. McLaughlin were all “larger than life,” in Mr.
Biden’s telling. When you were with them, he said every time, “you
knew you could win” — a distinction shared with Dr. Biden’s grandmother
and at least two other friends.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though he recycled his most compelling lines without apparent
hesitation, there is no evidence that Mr. Biden sought to borrow from
others without attribution in his eulogies.

In fact, drawing on his own memory and a weakness for Irish poetry, Mr.
Biden has at times brought an almost academic seriousness to his task.

Sometimes, this has meant informal interviews with loved ones in a quest
for anecdotes. He once sent an aide to scour a bookstore for “A Man for
All Seasons,” remembering a line he found relevant to the life of a
friend he was
eulogizing.

And if his language has often repeated over the years when describing
the dead, Mr. Biden’s sketches of himself have rarely been generic.

Mr. Biden, as rendered by Mr. Biden, is a particularly vivid character,
unguarded and at times politically incautious.

He has offered snapshots of a rowdy adolescence, recalling a demolition
derby with Mr. McLaughlin on Route 202 or the story of a college friend,
Don Brunner, taking a fall with the campus police for a young Mr. Biden,
who was trying to visit a romantic interest.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Eulogizing Mr. Brunner in 2004, Mr. Biden remembered asking him to
become a roommate: “I said, ‘My name is Joe Biden, you know I like
you,’” he began, according to a transcript. “Thank God he didn’t
think I was gay.” (“He regrets this joke,” said Andrew Bates, a Biden
campaign spokesman, “and it does not in any way reflect his views about
advancing and protecting the rights of the L.G.B.T.Q. community.”)

Mr. Biden’s identity as a man of, by and for the Senate shone through in
eulogies for Washington colleagues and childhood friends alike. There
were the requests for “a point of personal privilege”; references to
powerful contacts (“my cellphone rang and it was Secretary of State
Powell”) and the mention of his own prestigious posts.

“I was one of those folks they call a ‘chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee,’” he once said, apparently seeking to add credibility to his
praise of several military
leaders.

More than occasionally, memorial services have coaxed arresting
self-reflection out of Mr. Biden.

Eulogizing his first wife in 1972, he suggested that she had shaped his
perspective on race as a young man. Before Neilia showed him the way,
Mr. Biden said, he was “probably one of those phony liberals” who would
“go out of their way to be nice to a minority.”

“She made me realize I was making a distinction,” [he
continued](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49364956/the-morning-news/)
at St. Mary Magdalen, a church in Delaware. “But in dealing with
minorities, she made no subtle condescending gestures.”

“I’m going to try to follow her example,” he promised.

Wilmington’s The Morning News
[reported](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49364956/the-morning-news/)
that Mr. Biden maintained his composure until the end of his speech,
when his “emotions enveloped him and he hurriedly left the altar.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was a pain beyond compare, friends say, until 43 years later, when
Mr. Biden returned to another Delaware church for another service.

Beau Biden was an emerging political star and his father’s protégé when
he [learned he
had](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/joe-biden-beau-biden-death.html)
glioblastoma — the same disease that killed Mr. McCain and Mr.

At the funeral, the elder Mr. Biden’s two surviving children spoke. The
Army chief of staff, Ray Odierno, spoke. President Barack Obama spoke.

Mr. Biden, for once, remained in the pews.

But from the vice president’s too-familiar perch — behind the lectern,
before an anguished audience — his boss supplied one small comfort: a
Biden-style eulogy.

Mr. Obama spoke directly to Beau Biden’s children.

The Obamas had “become part of the Biden clan,” he said.

And with that, he instructed, came the “Biden family rule.”

“We’re always here for you, we always will be,” the president said. “My
word as a Biden.”
