# Trump Will Give Convention Speech in Jacksonville, Capping a Dispute Over Safety

*\[****Update****:* [*Trump abruptly cancels Republican Convention in
Jacksonville*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/jacksonville-rnc.html)*.\]*

WASHINGTON — It’s official: President
[Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/rnc-masks-convention.html)
will deliver his Aug. 27 convention speech in
[Jacksonville](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/rnc-masks-convention.html),
Fla., inside an arena that holds 15,000 people, after his demands for an
event without social distancing rules led to a rift with Democratic
leaders in North Carolina, where the Republican convention was
originally planned.

Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee,
confirmed on Thursday that the speech would take place at the VyStar
Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, a diverse city where the mayor
and the governor are both Republican allies of Mr. Trump’s. An R.N.C.
official would not say what, if any, coronavirus safety precautions
would be put in place.

“Not only does Florida hold a special place in President Trump’s heart
as his home state, but it is crucial in the path to victory in 2020,”
Ms. McDaniel said in a statement. “We look forward to bringing this
great celebration and economic boon to the Sunshine State in just a few
short months.”

The event for Mr. Trump in Jacksonville, not in Charlotte, N.C., as
planned, coincides with one of the darkest days in the city’s history.
The president will address his supporters on the 60th anniversary of “Ax
Handle Saturday,” when a white mob organized by the Ku Klux Klan
attacked mostly black civil rights protesters sitting at the city’s
whites-only lunch counters. The attackers hid ax handles in the brush at
Hemming Park, said Alan Bliss, the executive director of the
Jacksonville Historical Society.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The city’s white mayor at the time, Haydon Burns, suppressed news about
the beatings, Dr. Bliss said, and it was not until 2001 that the day was
commemorated with a marker, paid for by the historical society, at the
park. The current mayor, Lenny Curry, a Republican, removed a bronze
Confederate soldier statue from the same park this
week.

It was not clear that the historical resonance of the date for the city,
which is about 30 percent African-American, was known to Republican
officials before its selection.

Republican officials on Friday declined to say whether they were aware
of the significance of the date for the city of Jacksonville ahead of
its selection. Paris Dennard, an R.N.C adviser for black media affairs,
said about the anniversary of “Ax Handle Saturday,” While we cannot
erase some of the darkest moments of our nation’s past, we can denounce
them, learn from them, fight for justice and a more perfect union for
every American.”

The announcement of the Jacksonville speech capped a furious scramble
set off after Mr. Trump and Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a
Democrat, reached a stalemate over how to pull off the convention as
originally planned in Charlotte. Mr. Cooper insisted on social
distancing measures and masks inside to protect attendees from the
spreading of the coronavirus. Mr. Trump rejected those measures out of
hand, insisting on a packed indoor arena with the look and feel of a
country that had returned to business as usual despite the continuing
health crisis.

Jacksonville, roughly a six-hour drive from Charlotte, was seen as the
top contender as Republican officials considered a range of last-minute
replacements. Former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),
the presumptive Democratic nominee, is leading Mr. Trump in Florida by
about three percentage points, according to polls. And Mr. Trump, who
[changed his
residence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/trump-new-york-florida-primary-residence.html)
from New York to Florida last year, is uniquely focused on winning his
adopted home state, which he won by a slim margin four years ago.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of the holdups on any official announcement earlier this week was a
question about whether Jacksonville had enough hotel rooms to
accommodate the gathering. Some of the hotel rooms that will be used for
the swarm of delegates, party officials, national news teams and other
attendees will be as far as 20 miles from the venue, according to people
involved in the
planning.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

On Thursday, Republican officials were careful not to refer to the
events that will take place in Jacksonville as a convention. Instead,
they referred to it as the city chosen “to celebrate the renomination of
President Donald J. Trump.” The official business of the convention,
they said, would still be held in Charlotte.

Ms. McDaniel also blamed Mr. Cooper for the change of plans, saying that
“the current North Carolina Covid-19 restrictions would not allow for
the celebration to occur in Charlotte, and Governor Cooper would not
work with the R.N.C. to offer guidelines.”

In a statement, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican who had
campaigned for the convention to be moved to his state, said that
“Jacksonville is a great city that will showcase Florida’s energy,
facilities, entrepreneurship and commitment to bring together the
delegates of the Republican Party at a historic time in our nation’s
history.”

Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Patricia Mazzei
from Miami.
