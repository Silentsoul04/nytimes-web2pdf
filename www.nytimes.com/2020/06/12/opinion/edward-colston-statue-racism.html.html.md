# A Statue Was Toppled. Can We Finally Talk About the British Empire?

The removal of a slave trader’s statue in England begins a conversation
about how we are shaped by our past and how it configures the present.

BRIGHTON, England — Tens of thousands of people protested in British
cities in solidarity with those rising up against police brutality
against black Americans in the past week. They highlighted similar
[injustices in
Britain](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history).
Protesters in the city of Bristol drew connections between a white
police officer’s killing of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis,
and the histories of colonialism and the slave trade. On Sunday, they
[toppled the statue of Edward
Colston](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston),
a 17th-century slave trader, trampled over it and rolled it into Bristol
Harbor.

Between 1672 and 1689, Colston’s Royal African Company shipped about
100,000 enslaved people from West Africa to the Americas and the
Caribbean, branding them on their chests with his corporation’s acronym,
RAC. Disease and dehydration killed more than 20,000 people taken onto
those ships by Colston’s company, and their bodies were thrown into the
ocean. Yet Colston’s bronze statue, which was erected in 1895 in
Bristol, was engraved with the inscription “ … one of the most virtuous
and wise sons” of the city.

Toppling statues is one way of unsettling accounts of the past that fail
to acknowledge the [broader truths of the British
Empire](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/10/how-colonial-violence-came-home-the-ugly-truth-of-the-first-world-war).
Attempts had been made through petitions and letters and engagements
with local authorities to change the inscription and to reconsider the
names of civic and public institutions that continued to honor him. But
to no avail. This week, people of all backgrounds joined together to
highlight the multiple injustices embodied in the statue and took
matters into their own hands.

The glorification of the British Empire despite its histories of
[colonization,
plunder](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/blighted-by-empire-what-the-british-did-to-india/)
and
[enslavement](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/slavery/pdf/britain-and-the-trade.pdf)is
evident in the plethora of statues to its architects. The toppling of
Colston’s statue begins a conversation about how we are shaped by our
past and that we are accountable for how it configures the present.

Dispossession, appropriation, [elimination and
enslavement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NXC4Q_4JVg) were central
to the British Empire and to the making of modern Britain. Its initial
expansion westward into the territories of the Americas was followed by
[commercial and colonial
initiatives](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/opinion/east-india-company.html)
in the East. This was compounded by Britain’s involvement in the
Europe-wide trade in human beings from Africa and [circuits of
indentured
labor](https://www.striking-women.org/module/map-major-south-asian-migration-flows/indentured-labour-south-asia-1834-1917)
from Asia.

These histories rarely make it into the standard narratives of how
Britain came to be. Instead, there is either [a glorification of the
empire](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/british-people-are-proud-of-colonialism-and-the-british-empire-poll-finds-a6821206.html)
or amnesiac histories that either ignore it or consider it benign. The
end of the empire is similarly elided.

The limited public understanding of the empire, through education,
popular histories and [television
shows](https://www.radiotimes.com/travel/2018-04-03/michael-portillo-rides-the-rails-in-india-for-once-i-felt-quite-understated-in-my-attire/),
is largely an exercise in forgetting or celebration. There is no
requirement to teach British students about it. Few Britons have an
adequate understanding of the [histories that produced
Britain](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/dunkirk-indians-world-war.html)
or why the unquestioning glorification of some aspects of that history
is [wholly
inappropriate](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/poll-shows-brits-are-proud-of-colonialism-clearly-they-havent-heard-of-these-colonial-crimes-a6823151.html).

Across the 20th century, decolonization movements — from Ireland to
India and across the African continent — began systematically to
dismantle the imperial state. Britain’s decline from an imperial global
power to a “small island” coincided with its entry into [the European
Economic
Community](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/fact-figures/when-did-britain-decide-to-join-the-european-union/).
This masked the loss of global power and status that came with the loss
of empire and enabled Britain to continue to exert disproportionate
influence upon the world stage.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is significant that it was when Britain sought to leave the European
Union that questions both of the “breakup” of Britain (previously united
by the imperial project) and unresolved issues of its imperial past
emerged center stage. The discourses around the Brexit referendum sought
[to reclaim national
sovereignty](https://discoversociety.org/2016/07/05/viewpoint-brexit-class-and-british-national-identity/)
with little recognition that Britain had never been a nation, but an
empire.

This inadequate historical understanding disfigured contemporary
arguments about who belongs and has rights, as was evident in the
[illegitimate deportations of Commonwealth
citizens](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/world/europe/britain-windrush-immigrants.html)
known as the Windrush scandal.

The parochiality of Brexit has been disrupted by two more immediate
contexts. The resurgence of the global Black Lives Matter movement in
light of the death of George Floyd and the [disproportionate
deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people)
of black, Asian and other minority ethnic citizens in Britain — mostly
people with origins in the former colonies — from Covid-19.

The inherited consequences of colonialism are evident across all British
ethnic minority populations. And their roles as front-line workers,
keeping the country going during this crisis, has shifted the public
sense of who constitutes the [social and political
community](https://discoversociety.org/2020/04/22/rethinking-brexit-in-the-light-of-covid-19/).
This conjunction provokes all of us to reconsider the nature of the
inequalities that structure our communities and the complicity of
particular forms of public representation in this.

The inequalities and injustices created by colonialism, enslavement and
empire are manifest in the public display of statues of men such as
Edward Colston, Cecil Rhodes, Henry Dundas and Robert Clive. They are
manifest in statues of King Leopold II in Belgium or any number of
Confederate statues in the United States. They represent and glorify
those histories and call us to agree to be defined by them, to be
represented by them.

It is only if you are unaffected by Colston’s trade in human beings that
it is possible to value his philanthropy separated from it. If it is
understood that his philanthropy is intimately connected to the slave
trade and the imperial project and that we continue to live the
hierarchies and inequalities established through such historical
processes, then a reckoning is necessary. This is particularly so when
we acknowledge the subjects of empire, and those who were subjected by
it, as also being who we, collectively, are today.

A mature political community addresses historical wrongs by recognizing
and acting upon the just claims of others. In the process, it tackles
the contemporary inequalities that flow from those histories and comes
to a more expansive self-understanding.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The toppling of Colston’s statue has made a public conversation about
our colonial past possible. Equality and freedom from domination is not
given; it has to be struggled for. Those who [condemn disruptive
actions](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/08/uk-coronavirus-johnson-says-anti-racist-protests-were-subverted-by-thuggery-live-news-covid19-updates)
that precipitate change should recognize the violence intrinsic to
previous acquiescence.

A statue topples and the veil of colonial ignorance is torn. This is not
a moment to reinscribe that ignorance. Rather, it is a moment to
acknowledge what has now become collectively visible and to represent
ourselves anew.
