# Trump’s Actions Rattle the Military World: ‘I Can’t Support the Man’

</div>

The president’s threat to use troops against largely peaceful
protesters, as well as other attempts to politicize the military, have
unsettled a number of current and former members and their families.

Erin Fangmann grew up in a military family, has been married to a
captain in the Air Force for 18 years and has voted Republican all her
life, including for [Donald J.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html).
But as with a number of other veterans, troops and military family
members who have watched the president with alarm, her support has
evaporated.

“He has hurt the military,” said Ms. Fangmann, who lives in Arizona, one
of several states in play this November with a high percentage of
veterans and active-duty service members. “Bringing in active-duty
members to the streets was a test to desensitize people to his future
use of the military for his personal benefit. I think the silent
majority among us is going to swing away.”

Since 2016, Mr. Trump has viewed veterans as a core slice of his base;
in that year’s presidential election, about [60
percent](https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls/national/president)
voted for him, according to exit polls, and swing-state counties with
especially high numbers of veterans [helped him
win](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/11/10/how-swing-state-veterans-played-a-key-role-in-donald-trump-winning-the-white-house/).
Many veterans and members of the military stuck with him even as he
attacked the Vietnam War record of Senator John McCain, disparaged
families of those killed in combat and denigrated generals whom he fired
or drove from government service. Some conservative rank-and-file
enlisted members silently agreed with Mr. Trump.

But the president’s threat last week to [use active-duty troops on
American
streets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/us/politics/trump-military-protests.html)
against largely peaceful protesters, and his flirtation with [invoking
the 1807 Insurrection
Act](https://www.nytimes.com/article/insurrection-act.html), have
rattled the military world, from its top leaders to its youngest
veterans. If they break in significant numbers, they could carry
political weight in key battleground states like Arizona, North Carolina
and Ohio.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I have always been a swing voter,” said Amy Rutkowske, an Army veteran
and spouse who lives in North Carolina and is volunteering on a House
race, the first time she has ever volunteered in politics. “My
fundamental understanding is that the president is the commander in
chief and that the office demands respect. But I have never wanted a
different commander in chief more.”

Some members of the military — who are not permitted to speak about
politics publicly — and their families have been posting critically on
social media about the president and policies of his that they once
supported. Others, who have never been excited about Mr. Trump as their
commander in chief, have begun to speak out, join protests and volunteer
for progressive causes.

They say that Mr. Trump has politicized the armed forces — which pride
themselves as being above politics and discourage partisan discourse in
their ranks — and has threatened the Constitution, both of which they
deem as last
straws.

Of course, many veterans and military personnel still support Mr. Trump.
Quality recent polling on their views is scant, but some have embraced
his America-first campaign message, his focus on military spending and
his creation of a new Space Force that has been unexpectedly
well-received after initial scoffing.

In the 2018 congressional elections, when support for Democrats surged,
58 percent of military voters continued to vote for members of Mr.
Trump’s party, according to [exit
polls](https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/exit-polls). And those who do
turn away from the president now will not automatically support his
Democratic opponent, [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Martin Sepulveda, a former commander in the United States Navy Reserve
who lives in Arizona, said of Mr. Trump, “I can’t support the man.” But
he added: “Am I a Biden guy? No. I don’t know what I will do. I have
been a registered Republican for years.”

But the recent
[condemnations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/jim-mattis-trump-protests.html)
of Mr. Trump from high-level military veterans like [Jim
Mattis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/us/politics/murkowski-mattis-trump.html),
the former defense secretary and a retired four-star Marine Corps
general, have in some cases fortified the shifting views among military
members. “The Mattis statement has changed people in some amazing ways,”
said Chelsea Mark, a Marine veteran in Florida who works for a veteran
service organization. “I went on a veteran hike recently, and I saw
someone wearing a Donald Trump T-shirt, and that same person this week
was posting anti-police-brutality things on her Instagram.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On June 5, the same day [the
Marines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/us/marines-confederate-flag-ban.html)
issued a ban on displays of the Confederate battle flag at its
installations, a retired Marine in dress uniform [stood

in front of the Utah State Capitol in support of the Black Lives Matter
movement, with black duct tape across his mouth that read, “I can’t
breathe.”

Mr. Trump’s moves to use the military against American protesters and
looters came after several months of other highly unorthodox moves by
his administration involving the military, including the
[clearing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/trump-pardons.html) of
three members of the armed services accused of war crimes; the firing of
[Capt. Brett E.
Crozier](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/politics/coronavirus-carrier-roosevelt.html)
after he raised alarms about the coronavirus on the [aircraft
carrier](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/politics/coronavirus-carrier-roosevelt.html)
he commanded; the calling back of West Point students during a pandemic
so the president could address them for a graduation, [which he is set
to do on
Saturday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-west-point.html);
and the [diversion of funds from military
projects](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/us/politics/pentagon-border-wall.html)
to pay for a border wall, a move that followed [the deployment of troops
to the
border](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/us/politics/border-security-troops-trump.html)
just before the 2018 midterm elections.

“This is the culmination of all those metronomic choices that have
intruded into the military chain of command and culture,” said Kori N.
Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the
American Enterprise Institute, who served as a foreign policy adviser on
Mr. McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “I do think it is likely to
chip away among veterans, just as I believe it will chip away at support
with Republicans more broadly.”

Mr. Trump’s ordering of the killing of a top Iranian general, which
briefly appeared to [bring the United States to the edge of war with
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/world/middleeast/us-iran-war.html)
early this year, was a
[disappointment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/us/politics/veterans-trump-iran.html)
to the many veterans and service members who had supported him in part
for his promise to end American involvement in overseas conflicts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The news of wanting to deploy the military domestically has caused a
huge sense of outrage among most families I know,” said Sarah Streyder,
the director of the Secure Families Initiative, which advocates
diplomacy-first foreign policy and works on behalf of military families.
“A lot of military families live on Facebook. Social media is very
important for this transient community.”

Numerous military spouses concurred. **** “From what I see from my
friends communicating online, spouses have grown much more vocal in
opposition to policies,” said Kate Marsh Lord, a Democrat who is married
to a member of the Air Force and lives in Virginia but votes in Ohio. “I
have seen more spouses speak out on issues of race and lack of
leadership than in my entire 15 years as a military spouse.”

Roughly [40
percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/13/6-facts-about-the-u-s-military-and-its-changing-demographics/)
of active-duty service people and reserves are people of color,
underlining how the current moment has affected military families.

“People took offense that they were using the military to calm peaceful
protests by people of color who were out on the streets,” said Jerry
Green, who served in the Army until 1998 and now lives in Tampa. “When I
saw that whole thing unfold, for me, personally, it was awful. I was
really distraught.” Mr. Green, who is black, will not be supporting Mr.
Trump, whom he once found interesting, he said.

In North Carolina, Cal Cunningham, a Democrat and a lieutenant colonel
in the United States Army Reserve who is challenging Senator Thom
Tillis, a Republican, is working to capitalize on the military and
veteran vote in his state, where Mr. Trump recently diverted millions of
dollars for [military
installments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/us/politics/border-wall-funding.html)
to pay for a wall at the Mexican border after Congress blocked its
funding.

“Cal’s profile as a military veteran is quite powerful in a state with
so many veterans and military members,” said Rachel Petri, a spokeswoman
for Mr. Cunningham. “Not only in communicating with them, but also with
independent and swing voters who see the military and veterans as part
of the state’s DNA.”

Other Democratic groups around the nation are also seeking leverage with
the military vote. “We believe that Trump’s support within the military,
with military families and with veterans, is soft and receding,” said
Jon Soltz, a founder of VoteVets, which has been increasingly successful
in electing Democratic veterans. “Our plan for the fall is simple: We’re
putting together the most comprehensive data-driven veteran and military
family get-out-the-vote operation the Democratic Party has ever seen,
and we will deploy it to ensure Donald Trump is a one-term president.”
