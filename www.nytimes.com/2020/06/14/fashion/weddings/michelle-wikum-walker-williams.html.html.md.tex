Michelle Joy Wikum and Walker Samuel Williams were married June 13 at
the home of the bride's parents in Santa Ana, Calif. The Rev. Dr. Dena
L. Williams, a Lutheran minister and the groom's mother, officiated.

The couple had planned to marry on April 18 at the Ponte Vineyard Inn in
Temecula, Calif., but changed their plans because of the coronavirus
pandemic. They now plan to have a wedding celebration at that venue in
November.

Mrs. Williams, 35, is the educational research and innovation director,
working from a home office, at the iEducation Group, which operates
private schools and has its headquarters in Grand Rapids, Mich. She
graduated from Hollins University in Hollins, Va., and received a
master's degree in education from Pepperdine University. She is now a
doctoral student in learning technologies at Pepperdine, at the graduate
campus in Los Angeles.

She is a daughter of Darlene J. Wikum and Jay N. Wikum. The bride's
father is a partner in HMWC CPAs and Business Advisors in Tustin, Calif.
Her mother was a stay-at-home parent.

Mr. Williams, 34, is the learning and development manager at Common
Thread Collective, a digital marketing agency in Santa Ana. He graduated
and received a law degree from the University of Colorado.

He is also the son of Dr. John M. Williams, who lives with the groom's
mother in Denver. The groom's mother, who is retired, was the pastor of
Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Denver. His father, an allergy
immunologist, retired from the Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics
in Denver.

The couple met through Tinder in 2018 in New York, where Ms. Wikum then
lived, and where Mr. Williams was visiting on a business trip.

Upon his return to Colorado, where he then lived, Mr. Williams
immediately booked a return trip to New York. ``We had spent a lot of
time together so, you know, I thought it was going somewhere,'' he said.
