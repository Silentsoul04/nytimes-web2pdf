The Food and Drug Administration said on Monday that it was [revoking
emergency authorization](https://www.fda.gov/media/138945/download) of
two malaria drugs to treat Covid-19 in hospitalized patients, saying
that they are “unlikely to be effective” and could carry potential
risks.

The drugs, [hydroxychloroquine and
chloroquine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trial.html),
were heavily promoted by President Trump after a handful of small,
poorly controlled studies suggested that they could work against the
disease caused by the coronavirus. Mr. Trump said he [took
hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-physical-hydroxychloroquine.html)
after he had been exposed to two people who tested positive for the
coronavirus.

The agency said that after reviewing some data, it determined that the
drugs, particularly hydroxychloroquine, did not demonstrate potential
benefits that outweighed their risks. Earlier this spring, the F.D.A.
had also issued a [warning that the drugs could cause dangerous heart
arrhythmias in Covid-19
patients.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html)

The review that led to the revocation found more than 100 cases of
serious heart disorders in Covid-19 patients taking the drugs, including
25 that were fatal. Other problems were linked to the drugs as well.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lawmakers and some public health experts have criticized the Trump
administration for politicizing the government’s medical and science
arms during the pandemic, and of pressuring agencies like the F.D.A. to
relax its standards for drugs and medical devices, to get them on the
market faster.

“The F.D.A. withdrew an emergency use authorization that never should
have been issued in the first place,” Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of
Oregon, said in a statement. “By ignoring science and caving to
political pressure from the White House, the F.D.A. stoked false hope
and put American lives in danger, while damaging the agency’s reputation
in the process.”

On Monday, Mr. Trump stood by his support of the drugs, saying at a
White House round table, “All I know is that we’ve had some tremendous
reports.” He added: “It certainly didn’t hurt me. I feel good.”

Dr. Peter Lurie, the president of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, said the F.D.A.’s move showed “how, in the end, science can
triumph over celebrity and unscientific pronouncements from the White
House. In the end, the truth comes out.”

Dr. Lurie said that while some clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine
were still underway, so far the evidence “keeps going in the same
direction” — that the drug is not effective to treat Covid-19.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In March, the F.D.A. authorized hospitals to use stockpiles of the
drugs, which pharmaceutical companies had donated, to treat patients
with the virus. Doctors have always been able to prescribe the drugs to
individual patients as they see
fit.

But in a letter on Monday revoking the authorization, the agency said
that further studies had shown that the two drugs were unlikely to be
effective in stopping the virus, and that national treatment guidelines
didn’t recommend using them outside of clinical trials.

According to the letter, written by Denise M. Hinton, the F.D.A.’s chief
scientist, the request to revoke the authorization came from the
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the unit of the
Department of Health and Human Services that had initially asked for the
authorization.

In April, the head of that unit, Dr. Rick Bright, [said he was removed
from his
post](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/rick-bright-trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html)
after he pushed for rigorous vetting of hydroxychloroquine, even as Mr.
Trump and his allies were enthusiastically promoting it.

The use of hydroxychloroquine [spiked after Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/coronavirus-trump-chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine.html)
continuously praised its potential, calling it a possible “game changer”
and [saying, “What the hell do you have to
lose?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-chloroquine-trump.html)”
His repeated promotions during daily briefings at the White House
prompted runs on pharmacies, threatening supplies for the drugs, which
are also taken by people with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said at the
round table Monday that the F.D.A.’s action only ended the authorization
for hospitals to use federal stockpiles of the drugs on hospitalized
patients and noted that doctors could still prescribe the drugs to
patients.

“In fact the F.D.A. removal of the emergency use authorization takes
away what had been a significant misunderstanding by many that had made
people think it could only be used in a hospital setting,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Interest in hydroxychloroquine has waned in recent weeks as further
studies showed that the drug did not appear to be effective in treating
or preventing Covid-19. Earlier this month, [a study of 821
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html)
who had been exposed to patients infected with the virus showed that the
drug did not prevent infection.

In May, an article in The Lancet about another study concluded that
hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine did not help patients and might have
harmed them — [but that study was later
retracted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/health/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine.html)
after the authors could not verify the database of medical records on
which the article was based.

As of May 6, there were 347 adverse events in Covid-19 patients taking
hydroxychloroquine, and 38 in those taking chloroquine (which is used
less often), the F.D.A. said, based on a search of its own database and
reports to poison-control centers. The majority of cases, 69 percent,
involved men with a median age in the early 60s.

The total included 109 serious heart problems, including 80 cases of a
serious heart rhythm disorder called QT prolongation. Other patients had
different rhythm abnormalities. Over all, 25 of the 109 died. Many who
had cardiac effects had been given other drugs at the same time, like
the antibiotic azithromycin, that can also cause QT prolongation.

There were also serious adverse events not affecting the heart in 113
cases, including liver abnormalities, which are listed on the drugs’
labeling as a possible problem. Some patients had severe kidney
problems, but renal disease has been linked to the coronavirus
itself.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Four patients developed a blood disorder called methemoglobinemia, and
two died. That condition is not mentioned in the drugs’ labeling, but
had been known as a rare side effect of some medications.

It was not possible to calculate rates of the adverse events, because
the total number of patients given the drugs was not known, the F.D.A.
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The agency [also issued a warning
Monday](https://www.fda.gov/media/137566/download?utm_campaign=FDA%20Warns%20of%20Newly%20Discovered%20Potential%20Drug%20Interaction%20That%20May%20Reduce%20Effectiveness&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua)
about combining hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with remdesivir, a
recently authorized treatment for patients with Covid-19. The F.DA. said
the malaria drugs could interfere with remdesivir’s ability to fight the
virus.

Several trials of hydroxychloroquine are still underway, including
additional studies of whether it can be used to prevent coronavirus
infection. The World Health Organization resumed a study of the drug
after briefly halting it in the wake of the Lancet article.

Two arms of the National Institutes of Health — the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute and the National Institute for Allergy and
Infectious Diseases — are conducting clinical trials of
hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Francis Collins, the N.I.H. director, said those
studies would continue.

“I think that would be unfortunate not to,” Dr. Collins said. “What’s
been missing here are really well-designed, randomized
placebo-controlled trials for hospitalized patients.”

Hydroxychloroquine is still being embraced elsewhere, [including in
Brazil,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/world/americas/virus-brazil-bolsonaro-chloroquine.html)
which is battling an explosive outbreak.

Members of Congress [have
questioned](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.05.06%20Letter%20to%20FDA%20re%20data%20tracking.pdf)
increases in the F.D.A.’s granting of emergency use authorizations
during the pandemic for certain drugs as potential treatments. They have
also questioned authorizations for antibody and diagnostic tests whose
data had not been thoroughly vetted before approval, and for certain
types of masks and other devices.

Some Democratic lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration for
pressuring the agency into issuing too many emergency approvals.

In some cases, the F.D.A. has recently rescinded emergency approvals[for
use or reuse of some
masks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/science/masks-china-coronavirus.html)
and told companies that [did not meet a deadline for submitting
data](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/fda-antibody-tests-coronavirus.html)
on antibody tests that they should not be selling them. The Government
Accountability Office recently testified that it planned to look into
the F.D.A.’s emergency authorizations.

On Monday, Democrats framed the news as further evidence that Mr. Trump
cannot be relied upon in the coronavirus pandemic. Senator Chuck
Schumer, the minority leader from New York, said on Twitter, “On medical
issues like on so much else, he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”
