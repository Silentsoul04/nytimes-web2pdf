crack addiction and robbed 18 banks in three months, earning the name
the ``Zombie Bandit.'' He died of Covid-19.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

During the early decades of his adult life, Alan Hurwitz was an educator
in Detroit with a passion for social justice. But in 1992 he became
known as something else: the Zombie Bandit.

Over nine weeks that year, Mr. Hurwitz robbed 18 banks in Michigan,
Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. His blank expression when he demanded cash
from tellers led the F.B.I. to give him his nickname.

After the television series ``America's Most Wanted'' aired video of Mr.
Hurwitz's heists, tips led the F.B.I. to arrest him in Fowlerville,
Mich., northwest of Detroit. He pleaded guilty to 13 of the robberies
and spent 12 years in prison.

But he was not finished. In late 2008, he pulled another string of armed
robberies, one in Medford, Ore., and three in Northern California, while
living in Orleans, Calif., with his daughter Laura Hurwitz. He was
captured in Wyoming and
\href{https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/portland/press-releases/2010/pd011910.htm}{sentenced
to 17 ½ years} in prison.

On May 20, he was granted a compassionate release from the
\href{https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/buf/}{Federal
Correctional Complex in Butner, N.C.,} where Covid-19 was spreading
rapidly among inmates;
\href{https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article242837511.html}{eight
prisoners there had died}of the disease by the time Mr. Hurwitz was
freed. His daughter Karen Hurwitz Hoene said he had not been tested in
prison.

Mr. Hurwitz flew from North Carolina to Chicago and became ill after a
second flight to Denver en route to Orleans. He was taken to a hospital
there and died on June 6 of Covid-19, Ms. Hurwitz Hoene said. He was 79.

Alan David Hurwitz was born on Jan. 18, 1941, in Detroit. His mother,
Minnie (Cohen) Hurwitz, was a secretary; his father, Theodor, was a
customs worker. ``I was raised in the liberal Jewish tradition of
justice, learning and equality,''
\href{https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/back-to-life/Content?oid=2181608}{he
told the Detroit Metro Times in 2005}.

After flunking out of Wayne State University, Mr. Hurwitz served in the
Marine Corps Reserve. He returned to Wayne State to earn a bachelor's
degree in education.

He began teaching English and social studies in a middle school, then
held positions that included adviser on desegregation to Detroit's
public schools. He was a member of a state task force on school violence
and education director of a civic group called New Detroit.

His spiral into robbery came on the heels of an addiction to crack. For
a while, he later said, he had been growing increasingly angry that his
three decades of effort to reform education and combat racism had
failed.

Mr. Hurwitz's criminal life provided him with a chance to educate
prisoners.

``He found his place in prison,'' Ms. Hurwitz Hoene said. ``He taught
inmates to read and write; he taught them history. ''

In addition to his daughters, Mr. Hurwitz is survived by his sons,
Michael Hurwitz and Sean Case; eight grandchildren; two
great-grandchildren, and a brother, Larry. Mr. Hurwitz's two marriages
ended in divorce.

Mr. Hurwitz felt no guilt about the money he stole --- ``He hated
bankers and they were federally insured,'' Ms. Hurwitz Hoene said ---
but was sorry about any trauma he caused the tellers, who believed he
had a handgun tucked in his waistband.

``But his biggest regret was that his father died while he was
incarcerated,'' Ms. Hurwitz Hoene said. (Theodor Hurwitz died in 1996.)
``My grandfather was loyal to him and forgave him.''
