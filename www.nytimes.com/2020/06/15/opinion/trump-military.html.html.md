The first time I saw President Trump referred to as “[Cadet Bone
Spurs](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/06/politics/tammy-duckworth-cadet-bone-spurs/index.html)”
I laughed, the second time I smiled and the third time I cringed. It’s
an apt slur, but it lumps him together with all the other politicians
whose military huzzahs contradict their personal histories and whose
insult to our men and women in uniform can be reduced to dodging the
draft.

Trump’s twisted and utterly transactional relationship with America’s
armed forces is a bigger insult than that. For all his lip service to
military service, his actions reveal a crude take on those who perform
it.

And they have led now to a remarkable and remarkably public reappraisal
— even repudiation — of him by people in the armed services, their
leaders and veterans.

Some are finally coming around to a cleareyed view of a corrupt
president. Others are venting a distaste for Trump that they’d
previously downplayed or kept to themselves.

Even the most dutiful soldier has a breaking point, and even a culture
of deference finds [its moment of
defiance](https://time.com/5849362/military-leaders-denounce-trump/).

Late last week Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, issued an extraordinary apology for his participation in that
awful presidential photo op made possible by the use of tear gas against
peaceful protesters. But as Helene Cooper
[noted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/trump-milley-military-protests-lafayette-square.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
in a story in The Times, that’s just one example of an intensifying
friction between the president and military leaders. Many of them don’t
share his opposition to renaming bases that honor Confederate officers
and disagreed with his push to have armed forces quell demonstrations.

“Trump’s Actions Rattle the Military World” was the headline on [a
separate
story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-polls-military-approval.html?smid=tw-share)
in The Times by Jennifer Steinhauer. Her conversations with members of
the military, their families and veterans made clear that they might not
back Trump to the extent that they did in 2016.

Then there are the generals and admirals, silent by custom but [silent
no
more](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/politics/military-leaders-trump-floyd-protests/index.html).
What we’ve seen and heard from them over the past two weeks is
unprecedented in my adult lifetime, a jolting departure from their norm
of mutely supporting a sitting president, no matter their differences
with him.

Trump has been [denounced by Marine Corps Gen. James
Mattis](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/)
and reprimanded by Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, both of whom held top
jobs in his administration. “I think we need to look harder at who we
elect,” [Kelly said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zAu3cZdQVQ) in an
interview for the online platform SALT Talks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Trump has been upbraided by Navy Adm. Mike Mullen and Air Force Gen.
Richard Myers, each of whom served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff under President George W. Bush. “I’m glad I don’t have to
advise this president,” [Myers
said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/politics/trump-protests-former-joint-chiefs-chairman-cnntv/index.html)
in a CNN interview.

Together these admonishments amount to a metaphoric court-martial of the
commander in chief.

Trump campaigned by arguing that presidents before him had abused the
military by deploying troops to places — Iraq, Afghanistan — where the
justification was suspect, the mission ill-fated and the end point
invisible. He promised to avoid such costly entanglements while
nonetheless spending more on military equipment. He wanted lots of it
and he wanted it to gleam, just like his casinos. He told members of the
armed forces that they’d never known a friend like him in the White
House.

But what a nasty tongue and temper this friend has. At the start of his
candidacy, he grossly mocked John McCain, who had been tortured for
years in North Vietnam, by saying that he preferred war heroes who
didn’t get captured.

He praised generals, sure, but only to assert his superiority to them.
“I know more about ISIS than the generals do — believe me,” he said at
one point in his candidacy, a cockamamie coda to his earlier boast that
“there’s nobody bigger or better at the military than I am.”

He [attacked Gold Star
families](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/23/559558075/trump-call-controversy-renews-spotlight-on-gold-star-families),
rage-tweeting against the father of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was
killed in Iraq, and the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was
killed in Niger. They had dared to criticize him, and he put his vanity
over their grief.

There’s no reverence in Trump, only convenience and expedience. Nearly
two years and a hell of a lot of golf passed between his inauguration
and the first time he could rouse himself [to visit
troops](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-iraq-troops-visit.html)
in a foreign combat zone.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

During an earlier trip abroad in late 2018, he [abruptly
canceled](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-rain-world-war-1-castigated-for-missing-event-paris-armistice/)
his participation in an event at an American cemetery and World War I
memorial in France when rain meant that he’d have to drive instead of
taking a quicker helicopter flight.

The following year, again in France, he used the commemoration of the
75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion in [Normandy as the
backdrop](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/world/europe/trump-france-dday.html)
for an interview in which he called Robert Mueller “a fool” and Nancy
Pelosi “a disaster.” Everything to Trump is show business, and the
graves of warriors are fitting props for a tirade on Fox News.

Trump approaches and appraises the military as he does all else: *What’s
in it for me?* He needlessly sent troops to our southern border in the
fall of 2018 because it advanced a narrative, which he contrived to help
the Republican Party in the midterms, that America was being threatened
by an invasion of migrants.

“My military,” [he has
said](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-my-generals-my-military-2017-10),
and it’s no slip of the tongue. He sees the military as a vessel for his
own glorification, to which end he openly yearned for a military parade
in Washington, a titanic tribute to all the metal and munitions under
*his* control.

“My generals,” he has also said, referring to the bevy of them — Mattis,
his first defense secretary; Kelly, his second chief of staff; Army Lt.
Gen. Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser; Army Lt. Gen.
H.R. McMaster, his second — with which he stocked his administration.
The phrase is the giveaway that, to him, they were trophies, their stars
and medals merely ornaments on his ego.

And they were meant to defer, lest there be doubt of his own dominance.
So he lied not only about firing Mattis, who in fact resigned, but also
about having given him the nickname “Mad Dog.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Trump the military is a commercial enterprise and commodity. His
complaints about N.A.T.O. boil down to balance sheets, focusing on the
*financial* disparity between the United States’s military contribution
and other countries’, as if our servicemen and servicewomen are service
providers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They rightly see themselves as more than that — and as more than the
brutes of Trump’s childish imagination. Last November he [cleared three
members](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/trump-pardons.html) of
the armed forces who had been accused or convicted of war crimes. He did
so *against* the wishes of Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army
Secretary Ryan McCarthy, who worried about the military code of justice
being undermined.

Code? Justice? Trump thinks and speaks in the language of wins, losses,
brawn and bloodshed. He only pantomimes principle. His supposed
reluctance to send troops into foreign lands gave way over recent weeks
to his readiness to have them occupy our own land and engage in combat
with their fellow Americans.

That he didn’t expect them to push back proves how little he understands
them and how far short he sells them. They bring more than muscle to
what they do. They bring heart, soul and intellect. Which is more than
can be said for their commander in chief.
