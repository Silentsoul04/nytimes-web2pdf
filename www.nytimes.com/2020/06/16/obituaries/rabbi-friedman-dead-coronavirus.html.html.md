*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

A young student under the charge of Yisroel Friedman once left a Talmud
study session to do his laundry. The boy’s action so distressed Rabbi
Friedman that he fretted aloud to the other students for half an hour.

Rabbi Friedman, the longtime dean of [Oholei
Torah](https://www.oholeitorah.com/), a leading yeshiva of the
Chabad-Lubavitch sect of Orthodox Judaism in Brooklyn, rarely let
worldly matters intrude on his service to God. He was pious and sincere;
even sugar in his coffee was a frivolity.

“It was one consistent life of devotion,” said D. Maimon Kirschenbaum, a
former student of Rabbi Friedman’s and an employment lawyer in
Manhattan. “He studied intensely. He prayed intensely. He didn’t let
up.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another former pupil, Mendel Rubin, called Rabbi Friedman “an
internist,” adding: “He wanted us to internalize our learning, make it
part of our life. Not close the book at the end of the day, but make it
shape your perspective.”

Rabbi Friedman died on April 1 at N.Y.U. Langone Health in Manhattan. He
was 83. Nosson Blumes, director of development for Oholei Torah, said
the cause was the novel coronavirus.

Rabbi Friedman had a razor-sharp intellect and an argumentative teaching
style. He would call out students in class for one knowledge lapse or
another. Yet he also had a “soft underbelly,” said Rabbi Rubin, and was
known to display humor and a paternal sensitivity.

“When I was a student, I didn’t pay attention to my appearance because I
was so immersed in my studies,” said Rabbi Rubin, who is now co-director
of [Shabbos House](https://www.shabboshouse.org/), a Chabad student
center in Albany. “He asked my study partner if I could use money for
clothes.”

Such purchases came out of a fund that Reb Yisroel, as his students
called him, kept for students in need, whether the need was for shoes or
tuition. Not that Rabbi Friedman cared much about material things. One
acquaintance speculated that he might have worn the same coat for 30
years.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yisroel Friedman was born on Nov. 28, 1936, in Beshenkovichi, a town in
what is now Belarus but was then Byelorussia, a part of the Soviet
Union. His mother, Gittel Friedman, was a seamstress. His father, Yaakov
Friedman, was a graveyard worker and unofficial rabbi for the local
Jewish community. He was conscripted into the Russian Army during World
War II and killed in action.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to
[Chabad.org](https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/4703093/jewish/Rabbi-Yisroel-Friedman-84-Talmudic-Genius-and-Fiery-Chassid.htm),
Rabbi Friedman’s mother fled her homeland with her three sons, going
first to the Central Asian city of Samarkand and then to Germany and
France before settling in Israel.

He moved to New York in 1956 and three years later began teaching at a
Chabad yeshiva in Newark. He took up a position at Oholei Torah in 1965.
His home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn was a few blocks from
the school.

Rabbi Friedman’s wife, Chana Luba (Gurkov) Friedman, died in 2014. He is
survived by a daughter, Rochel Friedman.

After his death, former students and others gathered on a Zoom call for
a virtual remembrance that lasted nine hours. Another online memorial
took place through Chabad.org. Mr. Kirschenbaum, the Manhattan lawyer,
was one of the mourners there.

“He would read a text 100 times and think about it,” Mr. Kirschenbaum
said in an interview. “He would see things in a way that most of us
didn’t perceive. You’d see his face, he’d stroke his beard, and he’d
be in the
zone.”
