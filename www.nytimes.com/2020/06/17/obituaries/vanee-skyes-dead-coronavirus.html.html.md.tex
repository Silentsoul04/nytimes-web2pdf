\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Vanee Sykes was at a crossroads in 2014. She was 47 and had just been
released from a federal prison after serving a term for her involvement
in a scheme to steal food stamps.

During her time in prison, her husband of 20 years, James Sykes, a
social worker, died of an unexpected illness. Her three children were
making the transition from childhood to adolescence without a parent.

But Ms. Sykes was thankful for a family to go home to. Many of her
fellow prisoners, she knew, had to face the stark challenges of re-entry
on their own. She decided to help.

She and Topeka K. Sam, a friend she had met in jail, received a gift
from a generous donor to open a halfway house in the Bronx for single
women who were newly released from prison. They called
it\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/nyregion/a-house-for-women-leaving-prison-sits-empty.html}{Hope
House}, with space for five women, and it provided Ms. Sykes with a new
career helping others.

She died on May 24 at a hospital in Oceanside, N.Y., on Long Island. She
was 53. Family members said the cause was Covid-19.

Vanee Sykes was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 17, 1967, to Aron and Ethel
Abrams. Her mother was a schoolteacher, her father a dental technician.
Ms. Sykes earned a bachelor's degree from the American College of
Applied Arts in Atlanta, where she studied marketing and fashion.

After graduation she found a job at New York City's Department of Human
Resources, which administers antipoverty programs.

In 2010, while she was an administrator at the agency, the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/nyregion/09hra.html}{federal
authorities accused her} and three others of running an operation that
converted food stamps into cash, reaping \$8 million. Ms. Sykes pleaded
guilty. She was sentenced to 63 months in prison and ordered to pay
\$6.6 million in restitution; court officials said she had repaid
\$6,530,980.

Ms. Sykes had remained involved in the lives of her children from inside
the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn., speaking to all
three of them daily, her mother said.

In addition to her mother, Ms. Sykes is survived by two sons, Jeffrey,
who is in the real estate business, and James IV, a teacher working with
special-needs children; and a daughter, Alexis, who won a basketball
scholarship to the University of South Alabama before transferring to
Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C.

After her experience with Hope House, Ms. Sykes was hired as the
director of outreach for a prison reform organization, Witness to Mass
Incarceration.

Part of her job was working on the Suitcase Project, which provides
women and gay and transgender people newly released from prison with a
suitcase of essentials: clothing, shoes, a cellphone with a year's
service, hygiene and beauty products, and a laptop computer.

At her death Ms. Sykes was working with others on plans to create
another halfway house, this one big enough for a dozen women, in
Brooklyn.

Evie Litwok, who founded the Witness to Mass Incarceration project,
estimated that Ms. Sykes had helped 100 former prisoners find lodging
and support.

Michelle Miles, a former inmate mentored by Ms. Sykes, remembered her
with emotion. ``When she came into your presence,'' she said, ``you felt
her compassion.''
