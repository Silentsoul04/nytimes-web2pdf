*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

Yupadee Kobkulboonsiri made fantastical jewelry — neck cuffs with silver
springs ending in pearls that looked like asteroids, necklaces that
looped over a shoulder and erupted in diamonds and pearls. She won
awards at every trade competition she entered.

She transformed everyday objects into artworks, too. She would buy
sandals and weave shells into them. She would crochet flowers with
saffron yellow yarn for the Buddhist temples she frequented (and knit
tissue-box covers for the monks there).

She could peel an apple in one stroke with her eyes closed.

Ms. Kobkulboonsiri was 51 when she died on April 27 at Woodhull Medical
Center in Brooklyn. Steven Fishman, her husband, said the cause was the
novel coronavirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Kobkulboonsiri was a couture [jewelry
designer](http://www.yupadeedesign.com) whose whimsical pieces made her
stand out at the Fashion Institute of Technology, where she learned her
craft and later taught.

In the late 1990s, James Grunberger, the third-generation owner of a
jewelry company in Stamford, Conn., called the school to ask for its
most creative graduate. “I was tired of boring designers, and I asked
them for their savant,” Mr. Grunberger said.

The professors recommended Ms. Kobkulboonsiri.

She remained at Mr. Grunberger’s for two decades, introducing him to one
of her favorite rock bands, the Velvet Underground, and challenging his
fabricator, Rupert Scheufler, a master jeweler who was classically
trained in Vienna, to make ever more complex and beautiful pieces from
her designs.

Ms. Kobkulboonsiri was born on Aug. 10, 1968, in Bangkok. Her mother,
Pornthip Sae Wong, was a homemaker, and her father, Manus
Kobkulboonsiri, worked in finance.

She earned a B.F.A. in decorative and visual communication design from
Silpakorn University in Bangkok in 1986, after which she was an art
director at [Grey/Thailand](https://www.grey.com/en/thailand), the
global advertising agency’s Bangkok headquarters. (Nice for the résumé,
she felt, but her heart wasn’t in it.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She came to New York City to study at the Fashion Institute, where in
1999 she earned an associate of applied science degree in jewelry
design.

For nearly a decade she lived at [the Jeanne d’Arc
Residence](https://jdaresidence.com/the-residence) on West 24th Street,
women’s housing run by the Sisters of Divine Providence of Kentucky. Her
room was spare: a bed, a desk, an office chair, a Buddhist shrine, with
the drawings she was working on tacked to the wall.

The residence was a cost-saving measure so that she could send money
home to her family, which she did every month until her death. The nuns
were strict, and male visitors were allowed only for brief visits and
only in the dimly lit waiting room.

Mr. Fishman, who is also an artist, was teaching sculpture at the School
of Visual Arts in Manhattan and, in the years before she moved into his
Brooklyn loft in Williamsburg, he would dash over for lunch or to steal
a kiss.

In addition to her husband, Ms. Kobkulboonsiri is survived by her
parents; her brothers, P’Yuth Kobkulboonsiri and Satta Kobkulboonsiri;
and her sister, P’Jim Dusdi Pinpradup.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent years she had been eager to design less rarefied work, and she
and Mr. Fishman had been making furniture together — mosaic tables and
brass lamps etched with whorls and spirals.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even Ms. Kobkulboonsiri’s hair was gallery ready, cut in an asymmetrical
bob. It was as strong as steel, Mr. Fishman said. Either he or she cut
it, because she didn’t trust anyone else to get it right. As a Buddhist,
she was practiced in letting things go, Mr. Fishman said, but she was
also a perfectionist.

“That’s good, but can you try to make it straighter?” she would urge
him.
