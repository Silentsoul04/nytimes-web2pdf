# 8 Minutes, 46 Seconds Became a Symbol in George Floyd’s Death. The Exact Time Is Less Clear.

</div>

Prosecutors said they were wrong by a minute when they described, in
court papers, how long a police officer pinned Mr. Floyd to the ground.
Videos show it was at least eight minutes and 15 seconds.

MINNEAPOLIS — After prosecutors said that a Minneapolis police officer
pressed his knee on George Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46
seconds, that number became a grim symbol of police brutality. At
[memorials for Mr.
Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/us/floyd-memorial-funeral.html),
mourners stood in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Activists
have walked and run [8.46
miles](https://www.vfpress.news/articles/communities/an-8-46-mile-george-floyd-justice-walk-recognizes-martyrs-suffering/)
in Mr. Floyd’s memory, and lawmakers [knelt for eight minutes and 46
seconds](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-congressional-democrats-hold-moment-of-silence-to-honor-george-floyd).

The precise length of time that Mr. Floyd was pinned beneath the
officer’s knee, however, is no longer as exact.

This week, prosecutors in Hennepin County said they had misstated by one
minute the amount of time that had passed as the officer, Derek Chauvin,
held his knee to the neck of Mr. Floyd. The misstatement had come in as
part of the criminal complaint against Mr. Chauvin, who has been fired;
the actual time, a spokesman for the prosecutor said, was seven minutes
and 46 seconds.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet the revised time provided by prosecutors conflicts with videotapes
obtained by The New York Times after the May 25 killing along a
Minneapolis street. The videos show Mr. Chauvin’s knee on Mr. Floyd’s
neck for at least eight minutes and 15 seconds.

The precise time element, activists said, is irrelevant; the act was
horrific.

“It makes no difference,” said Jamar Nelson, who works with the families
of crime victims in Minneapolis. “The bottom line is, it was long enough
to kill him, long enough to execute him.”

Chuck Laszewski, a spokesman for the Hennepin County attorney’s office,
said on Thursday that prosecutors did not intend to again address the
timing question. “It’s not something that affects the case,” he said.
“We’ve got bigger fish to fry.”

Mr. Laszewski stressed that the revised timing would have no effect on
the prosecution of Mr. Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree
murder, or of three other officers at the scene, who are accused of
aiding and abetting in the killing.

The prosecution’s interpretation of timing has [been
based](http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12646/AmendedComplaint06032020.pdf)
in part, documents show, on an assertion that Mr. Chauvin no longer was
pinning Mr. Floyd after the time at which an ambulance arrived at the
scene. But video from a witness shows that the former officer continued
to hold his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than a minute after the
ambulance arrived.

Evan Hill and Haley Willis contributed reporting from New York.
