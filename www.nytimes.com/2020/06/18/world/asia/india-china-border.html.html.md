# Anger Surges in India Over Deadly Border Brawl With China

Protests and boycotts are the talk of the day as Indians grapple with
the deaths of 20 soldiers in chaotic clashes with Chinese troops.

NEW DELHI — An Indian government minister has called for Chinese
restaurants to be closed. Other Indian officials have suddenly put
contracts to Chinese companies under review. And crowds of men are now
smashing Chinese-made televisions in the street.

A wave of anti-Chinese anger is cresting across
[India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html)
as the nation struggles to absorb the [loss of 20 Indian soldiers beaten
to
death](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/indian-china-border-clash.html)
this week by Chinese troops in a high-altitude brawl along India’s
disputed border with China.

“We should bleed
[China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html)
with a thousand cuts,” said Ranjit Singh, a retired army major who is
calling for a boycott of Chinese goods. “We need to hit them where it
hurts most, and that is economically.”

And the tensions are hardly easing. Sonam Joldan, a teacher in the
[Ladakh
region](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/world/asia/india-china-border-ladakh.html)
near the India-China border, reported on Thursday seeing a line of 100
Indian Army trucks heading toward the front line, wending its way up the
Himalayan mountains “like a caravan of ants.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

How did he feel watching the forces go by?

“Patriotic, of course,” Mr. Joldan said. “India can’t watch the Chinese
aggression go on forever. They have to be stopped at some point.”

The killing of the Indian soldiers, he said, was unforgivable.

erupted, officials said. But military analysts and satellite imagery
indicated that Chinese troops had yet to pull
back.

By some accounts, in recent weeks they have taken about 23 square miles
of territory claimed by India and show no signs of leaving.

Western intelligence officials said that India would not accept this and
that the chances of more fighting remained high, especially with
thousands of opposing troops eyeball-to-eyeball along a remote front
line that has erupted in violence several times, including [a major war
between India and China
in 1962](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/india-china-border-clashes.html).

Troops from both sides have been instructed not to use firearms during
faceoffs along the border, but that did not stop a vicious hand-to-hand
battle from raging for several hours Monday night. One Indian military
analyst posted a picture on Twitter of [steel clubs studded with
nails](https://twitter.com/ajaishukla/status/1273478468919951361) that
he said had been used by the Chinese troops.

On Thursday, several of the Indian soldiers killed were given last
rites, including Col. Bikkumalla Santosh Babu, whose body was driven
through the streets of Suryapet, in central India, in an army truck
draped with marigolds. As the cortege passed, people stood on their
balconies, stiff right hands to their temples in a final salute.

Some officers in India’s army now want to change the rules of engagement
along the border and abandon the de facto code that calls for neither
side to use guns during confrontations. Military analysts worry that
doing so could set off an arms race that would turn the frequent
faceoffs and fistfights between opposing border patrols into much
deadlier
events.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to walk a fine line. Although he
seems reluctant to escalate a major conflict with China — which has a
mightier military — much of his political brand has been tied up in
projecting an image of a forceful, increasingly powerful India, and he
has signaled that he will not back down.

“India wants peace,” he said in a televised address on Wednesday. “But
if provoked, India is capable of giving a befitting reply.”

Whenever he has been in a pinch, Mr. Modi has been able to count on a
wave of Indian nationalism. Such sentiment helped in the early stage of
the coronavirus pandemic when he asked India’s entire population of 1.3
billion to stay indoors for the sake of the nation and [many diligently
obeyed](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/in-lockdown-delhi-is-frozen-in-fear-and-the-present-tense/articleshow/75512122.cms).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And last year, when Indian paramilitary forces were attacked in a
suicide bombing linked to a terrorist group in Pakistan, Mr. Modi
ordered airstrikes on Pakistan. The brinkmanship set off a jolt of
jingoism that, a few months later, helped propel him to a crushing
re-election
victory.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have

across India to boycott Chinese goods, a move that will not be easy. The
phones in most Indians’ hands are made in China, as are countless other
products. India-China trade has grown enormously, from $3 billion in
2000 to more than $95 billion in 2018. And as of last year, a trade
deficit between the two nations had reached [nearly $60 billion in

Mr. Modi can count on [a friendly media
landscape](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/world/asia/modi-india-press-media.html),
