# Lynika Strozier, Who Researched Early Plant DNA, Dies at 35

She overcame a severe learning disability to become a scientist with
“golden hands” and most recently a college instructor. She died of

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

For the last 15 years of her short life,[Lynika
Strozier](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2012-02-06-ct-met-trice-hard-life-0206-20120206-story.html)
dedicated herself with increasing fervor to a career in science, much of
it as a researcher at the [Field Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/)in
Chicago, where she delicately extracted
[DNA](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/coronavirus-neanderthals.html)
from early land plants.

“The plants we deal with are often old and fragile; some are as small as
an eyelash,” Matt von Konrat, the museum’s head of botanical
collections, said in a phone interview. “Others threw up their hands and
gave up on these experiments. But Lynika persevered.”

He added, “She had golden hands.”

During her time at the museum, Ms. Strozier discovered another passion —
mentoring young people — and in January left to teach ecology and
evolution at Malcolm X College in Chicago.

She died of complications of Covid-19 on June 7, the museum said. She
was 35.

[A GoFundMe
campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/552b3q-lynika039s-funeral-expenses)has
raised more than $52,000 for her medical and funeral expenses and to
establish a scholarship to support young scientists.

Lynika Sharlice Strozier was born on Aug. 28, 1984, in Birmingham, Ala.,
and moved to Chicago with her mother, Angela Strozier, when she was a
baby. But her mother’s drug addiction meant that she had to live mainly
with her grandmother Sharon Wright; Lynika was 9 when Ms. Wright became
her legal guardian. Angela Strozier died of an overdose in 2005, Ms.
Wright said.

Lynika had a severe learning disability that made math and reading — to
herself and aloud — difficult.

“People would tell me she’s got a learning disability, go get a Social
Security check for her,” Ms. Wright said in an interview. “I said:
‘She’s not getting a check. She’s going to *learn*.’*”*

At Ms. Wright’s urging, Lynika worked with a reading instructor and took
summer classes.

She turned to science in about 2005 at the suggestion of an
administrator at Truman College in Chicago, where she was a student; she
was soon working in a lab tending to a hamster ovary cell line. Research
and experiments, she found, built her confidence as nothing else had.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It took a while for her to grasp science, but once she did, Whoa\!” Ms.
Wright said.

In addition to her grandmother, Ms. Strozier, who was profiled by [The
Chicago
Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-lynika-strozier-field-museum-dies-covid19-20200618-sek3n2c3u5bwzjdqxalox4vvsy-story.html)
after her death, is survived by a brother, Marcus.

She started at the Field Museum in 2009 with a summer internship in
which she sequenced the DNA of lichens; she later did research on the
DNA of ants and birds.

“She was an incredible role model for minority students and women
scientists,” Dr. von Konrat said.

Ms. Strozier graduated from Dominican University, outside Chicago, with
a bachelor’s degree in biology. She then earned two master’s degrees in
2018, one in biology from Loyola University Chicago (her thesis was
about the connection between biodiversity and the geographical
distribution of birds in Madagascar) and another in science education
from the University of Illinois, Chicago.

“I went from this third grader who could barely read,” she said in an
interview with Dr. von Konrat in 2018 at an event celebrating the 125th
anniversary of the Field, “to taking apart science journals, writing a
90-page master’s thesis and defending and passing my thesis
defense.”
