# David Sedaris, Dressed Up With Nowhere to Go

With two books in the works but all plans on hold, the writer is pacing
New York City and destroying his Fitbit friends.

When New York went into lockdown, David Sedaris settled into his
apartment on the Upper East Side and canceled his 45-city book tour.

“I had bought all these outfits, and I was so looking forward to wearing
them,” he said, mentioning with particular wistfulness a lavishly
ruffled black Comme de Garçons jacket — “a cross between when Mammy was
in mourning after the baby died in ‘[Gone With the
Wind](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/movies/gone-with-the-wind-battle.html),’
and something that P.T. Barnum would wear” — now hanging in his closet,
an artifact from an alternative reality.

But Sedaris’s realization that it’s no fun dressing up in semi-satirical
garments when there is no one to see you is of course not the only thing
he has had to contend with. The author of 10 books of autobiographical
essays and short fictional pieces, Sedaris, 63, is a keen anatomist of
the skewed intricacies of human behavior, and there has been a lot of
behavior to sort through at the moment.

First, his own. He has two books coming out: “The Best of Me,” a
collection of his favorite essays, in the fall, and “Carnival of
Snackeries,” a second volume of diaries, tentatively scheduled for next
year. But his life, like everyone else’s, is more or less on hold.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I figured out early on that there’s absolutely nothing I can do about
this,” he said. “That should be obvious, and for some reason it wasn’t.
I kept thinking, ‘I should be able to fix this or control it.’ Whenever
I feel sorry for myself, I think, ‘Everyone in the world is going
through this.’ That makes it much easier.”

As he spoke, Sedaris sounded short of breath, a worrisome symptom in the
current climate. In fact, he said, it was because he has not let the
pandemic thwart his efforts to [rack up miles on
Fitbit](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/30/stepping-out-3),
the physical-activity-recording device.

“I’m walking in my apartment,” he said into the phone. “Right now.”

He considers it a competitive
sport.

“I destroy everyone I’m a Fitbit friend of,” Sedaris said. “Like, I
might be walking 130 miles a week, and they’re walking 30 miles a week.”
But recently he has made a new Fitbit friend, someone whose
determination to see and raise him mile for mile has forced Sedaris to
increase his own efforts. Some days he walks nearly 20 miles.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At home, this involves pacing the floor like Gus, the neurotic polar
bear who compulsively trudged back and forth in his enclosure at the
Central Park Zoo. But throughout the pandemic Sedaris has also been
walking, masked, to the far ends of New York City.

“The other week I walked all the way to Astoria,” he said. “Everywhere I
go it smells the same, and it smells like my breath.” He generally has
two outdoor shifts, the second after midnight, so that he (or Fitbit)
can apply those miles to the next day’s tally.

“I like to start the next day with six miles under my belt,” Sedaris
said. Although he is a compulsive collector of trash in the English
countryside, where he lives much of the time, he has resisted the
temptation to clean up the streets of New York. “I’m not against it,” he
said, “but everything changes once you start doing that — you can’t
stop.”

These excursions have showed him the city at its best. He is constantly
amazed, he said, at the high caliber of New Yorkers’ discourse.

“You’ll be in the park, and suddenly you’ll hear some very articulate
person talking about what a horrible person Donald Trump is,” Sedaris
said. “They’re so articulate and thoughtful, and they’re not
regurgitating what they’ve already heard. Usually people who come up
with that stuff are writing for newspapers, or they’re on TV.”

He has also seen the city at its most vulnerable, its late-night streets
dotted with the homeless and destitute; and occasionally at its
weirdest.

“I was at Times Square at 1:30 in the morning and there was a guy in a
wheelchair who was pushing himself along and he said, ‘Look at that
clown,’” Sedaris related. “I thought he was talking about me. But then I
followed his eyes and there was a clown, with purple hair and a red
nose.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More recently, he has walked city streets crowded with people, finding
camaraderie and shared humanity in the Black Lives Matter protests.

“The people are kind and thoughtful — always distributing snacks and
water,” Sedaris said. “‘Do you need sunblock? Hand sanitizer? It’s nice
to be part of a group, and I like walking down the center of the street.
Over time I came to think of the marches the way I think of buses and
subways. ‘I’ll just take this BLM down to 23rd,’ I’d tell myself. Later
I’d maybe get a crosstown BLM to Second Avenue, then walk home from
there.”

Those who follow Sedaris’s autobiographical writing, which has softened
and become more emotional and self-reflective in recent years, will
recall that the author and his father have long had a contentious
relationship. They made a kind of peace last year, Sedaris [wrote in
March](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/02/unbuttoned), as his
father lay dying in a hospice.

In a quintessentially Sedaris move, though, his father did not die. He
rallied, left the hospice and is now in an assisted-living facility, in
good health considering that he is 97 and a global pandemic is
underway.

“I’m pretty sure my father wants a crowd at his funeral,” Sedaris said,
of his father’s ability to hang on until crowded funerals are possible
again. “In a lot of ways I feel fortunate to have had him. I wouldn’t
have changed anything, because I needed somebody to sort of push
against.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Many authors have taken this opportunity to connect to audiences
virtually. But don’t look for Sedaris online anytime soon.

“My goal is to get through this without ever going on Zoom or FaceTime
or Skype,” he said. “People are like, Can you record a message of hope
for all the people who were going to come to your show?’ and I’m like,
‘No, because it’s not like there aren’t things to watch already.’”

Sedaris himself subscribed to Netflix in January. “I was the last person
on Earth to get it,” he said. “Literally the last person. I thought we’d
spend a lot of time watching things, but Hugh” — that would be his
boyfriend, Hugh Hamrick, an artist and a familiar character in the
Sedaris oeuvre — “falls asleep, so you can’t watch anything with him.”

In normal times, Sedaris travels so frequently that the two are rarely
in one place together for long.

“For the past 20 years I’ve been gone every fall and every spring, and
people said, ‘It must be horrible to be away from Hugh for so long,’ and
I’ve always thought, ‘No, it’s actually kind of great,’” Sedaris said.
“You’ve been with someone for 30 years, and it’s great not to see them
for a few months.”

But lockdown a deux has been a revelation.

“The thing is,” Sedaris added, “I mean, I’ve talked to people who said,
‘We’ve been home trapped together and we’re at each other’s throats.’
But in our case, we’ve never gotten along better. How am I supposed to
write about that? I said to him the other day, ‘I hope you die of
coronavirus, so I can write about it.’”

(He was kidding. In any case, both he and Hamrick fell ill with and then
recovered from Covid-like symptoms early in the spring, though they have
not been tested for the virus.)

“It’s been fantastic, it really has,” Sedaris went on, in an unexpected
burst of straight-up emotional enthusiasm. “I was really afraid he’d get
tired of me. Like this morning, I got up at 10 and at 10:30 Hugh said to
me, ‘I’m tired of you already.’ So I said, ‘OK, can we start over?’ And
we just started the day again.”
