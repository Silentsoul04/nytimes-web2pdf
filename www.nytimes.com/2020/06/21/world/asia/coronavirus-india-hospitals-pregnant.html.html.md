NEW DELHI — Neelam Kumari Gautam woke up at 5 a.m. with shooting labor
pains. Her husband put her gently in the back of a rickshaw and motored
with her to a hospital. Then another. Then another. Her pain was so
intense she could barely breathe, but none would take her.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Why are the doctors not taking me in?” she asked her husband, Bijendra
Singh, over and over again. “What’s the matter? I will die.”

Mr. Singh began to panic. He knew what he was up against. As [India’s
coronavirus
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/world/asia/india-coronavirus-wedding-groom.html)
has accelerated — India is now reporting more infections a day than any
other nation except the United States or Brazil — the country’s already
strained and underfunded health care system has begun to buckle.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A database of recent deaths reveals that scores of people have died in
the streets or in the back of ambulances, denied critical care. Ms.
Gautam’s odyssey through eight different hospitals in 15 hours in
India’s biggest metropolitan area serves as a devastating window into
what is really happening here.

Indian government rules explicitly call for emergency services to be
rendered, but still people in desperate need of treatment keep getting
turned away, especially in New Delhi, the capital. Infections are rising
quickly, Delhi’s hospitals are overloaded and many health care workers
are afraid of treating new patients in case they have coronavirus, which
has killed more than 13,000 people in India.

“There is currently little or no chance of admission to hospitals for
people with Covid-19, but also for people with other intensive care
needs,” read a warning just issued by the German Embassy in New Delhi.

After watching reports on Indian television showing dead bodies in the
lobby of a government hospital and crying patients being ignored, a
panel of judges on India’s Supreme Court said, [“The situation in Delhi

The bigger picture is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is
struggling with overlapping crises. Last week, [Chinese troops beat 20
Indian soldiers to
death](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/indian-china-border-clash.html)
along their disputed border in the Himalayas, triggering the most
dangerous showdown between the two nuclear powers in decades.

At the same time, India’s economy is nose-diving, and the coronavirus
pandemic has cost this country more than 100 million jobs. Desperate to
turn the economy around, Mr. Modi has rejected health experts’ counsel
to put the country back under lockdown, saying that India must “unlock,
unlock,
unlock.”

When things got better, Mr. Singh and his wife had hoped to buy an
apartment in a gated community in Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi
crammed with tall glass buildings, many malls and many hospitals. She
worked on an assembly line producing electrical wire. He serviced
machines at a printing press.

Together, Mr. Singh, 31, and Ms. Gautam, 30, earned a respectable $8,000
a year, putting them solidly in India’s rising middle class. “Two wheels
of a well-oiled machine, making our family go around,” Mr. Singh said.

Their son, Rudraksh, turned 6 just before their new baby was
due.

As Ms. Gautam entered her ninth month, she ran into some health problems
and spent five days, in late May and early June, in the hospital for
pregnancy-related high blood pressure, bleeding and possibly typhoid.

On June 5, as she began to go into labor, the first hospital they tried
was the ESIC Model Hospital, a sprawling government facility in Noida.
Mr. Singh said that the first thing the doctor said to her was, “I’ll
slap you if you take off your mask.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They were shocked, Mr. Singh said. But Ms. Gautam was having trouble
breathing. They didn’t argue. She begged for oxygen, which the hospital
had, along with ventilators. But instead of helping, the doctor told
them to go to another government hospital, on the other side of town.
There, too, she was turned away.

An administrator at the first hospital declined to comment, and a doctor
at the second hospital said Ms. Gautam needed intensive care, which the
hospital couldn’t provide.

Even before Covid-19 arrived, Indian hospitals were beleaguered. [The
Indian government spends less than 2,000
rupees](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-s-economy-needs-big-dose-of-health-spending-11586365603651.html)
(about $26) per person per year on health care. The hope during India’s
lockdown, which began in late March but was mostly lifted by early June,
was that the restrictions would slow the spread of the virus and give
cities time to scale up hospital capacity before the worst hit.

That didn’t happen, or not nearly enough, and Delhi now finds itself
thousands of beds short — the central government just repurposed
[hundreds of railway cars to be used as sick
bays](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-in-india-delhi-cases-surge-train-cars-and-hotels-converted-emergency-hospital-2020-06-17/).
And still there is great confusion about admitting patients who don’t
have
coronavirus.

Some hospitals say they need to test every patient before treating them.
Others simply perform a quick temperature check.

Several Indian doctors said that private, profit-driven hospitals were
terrified to accept new patients — particularly those with breathing
problems — because they didn’t want to risk getting shut down, which has
happened to private clinics if one of their patients tested positive for
the coronavirus.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Government policy has created this chaos,” said Rajesh Kumar Prajapati,
an orthopedic surgeon and former medical school professor.

As complaints began to pile up that hospitals were turning away sick
people, the powerful home ministry issued [a
directive](https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/PR_HSLettertoStatesUTsonMovementofMedicalProfeesionals_11052020.pdf)
re-emphasizing that all hospitals should remain open for “all patients,
Covid and non-Covid emergencies.”

But clearly not everyone has been listening. A 13-year-old boy in Agra
died of a stomach ailment in April after being turned away from six
hospitals, his distraught family said. Another boy, in Punjab, with an
obstructed airway, was rejected from seven hospitals and died in the
arms of a family friend, who happened to be a doctor but was not given
any help to save him.

“This is inhuman,” said Dheeraj Singh, the doctor in
Punjab.

Cases like these caught the eye of Thejesh G. N., an electronics
engineer in India’s tech hub, Bangalore. He helped build a database
tracking publicly reported deaths and found that at least 63 people have
died in recent weeks from being denied critical care. Most health
experts believe that the number is far higher.

The third hospital that Ms. Gautam went to, Shivalik Hospital, was the
one that had treated her for her prenatal troubles. This time, doctors
gave her a little oxygen, but Mr. Singh said they feared she might have
coronavirus and abruptly ordered her to
leave.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The couple hobbled back to the rickshaw. Ms. Gautam was fading. She
stopped talking and began heavily sweating. She clung to her husband’s
hand.

It wasn’t simply that the doctors couldn’t help her, Mr. Singh said. It
was as if they didn’t want to help her.

“They didn’t care if she was dead or alive,” he said.

At a fourth hospital, a branch of
[Fortis](https://www.fortishealthcare.com/), an Indian health care
giant, Mr. Singh pleaded for a ventilator. Mr. Singh said the doctor’s
response was: “She’s going to die. Take her wherever you wish.”

In a statement, the hospital said that it had no space for her, tried to
stabilize her and then offered to take her by ambulance to another
hospital. Mr. Singh said that the hospital’s efforts were cursory and
that there was no offer of an
ambulance.

They tried three other hospitals, hurrying from one to the other, losing
precious time. When all refused, Mr. Singh called the police.

He said that two officers met him at the entrance of the Government
Institute of Medical Sciences, a large public hospital, and tried to
persuade the doctors to admit his wife. But the doctors wouldn’t listen
to the police officers, either.

Administrators at that hospital declined to comment.

After that failed, they raced in an ambulance to Max Super Specialty
Hospital in Ghaziabad, more than 25 miles away. It was now late
afternoon, still bright, around 100 degrees outside. More than eight
hours had passed since Ms. Gautam and her husband had set off from their
home, eager to meet their new baby soon.

But the Max hospital — their eighth that day — gave them the same
heartbreaking answer: no beds.

Ms. Gautam closed her eyes and whispered: “Save me.”

Mr. Singh told the ambulance to rush back to the Government Institute of
Medical Sciences.

He hunched in the back, leaning over his wife, pleading with her not to
give up. He looked down at her face. She reached up and clutched his
shirt. Her hands tightly clenched the
fabric.

As they finally pulled into the hospital, she stopped breathing. Her
neck slumped. Mr. Singh jumped out of the ambulance, grabbed a
wheelchair and frantically wheeled her into the emergency room.

At 8:05 p.m., after 8 different hospitals and 15 hours, Neelam Kumari
Gautam was pronounced dead. The baby also died.

A preliminary government investigation said: “Hospital administration
and staff have been found guilty of carelessness.”

She has not been the only pregnant woman to die in labor after being
turned away. The same thing happened to [a young mother in
Hyderabad](https://www.thehansindia.com/telangana/telangana-denial-of-medical-aid-to-a-pregnant-woman-high-court-seeks-details-on-criminal-cases-filed-against-doctors-624837?infinitescroll=1https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/6-women-docs-held-liable-for-death-of-gadwal-mother-baby/articleshow/76016968.cms)
and another in Kashmir. In that case, the family said, the hospital
staff were so uncaring that they didn’t even help with an ambulance to
take the body home. The woman’s family had to wheel her body down the
road, in a stretcher, for several miles.

As the authorities consider criminal charges in Ms. Gautam’s case, her
husband spends his days at home looking after his son, Rudraksh. The boy
asked him to throw away all of his mother’s clothes.

“They remind me of her,” he said.

The spark has gone out of Rudraksh’s eye, Mr. Singh said.

A few days ago, he told his dad that when he grows up, he wants to be a
doctor, so “I can make dead people come alive.”
