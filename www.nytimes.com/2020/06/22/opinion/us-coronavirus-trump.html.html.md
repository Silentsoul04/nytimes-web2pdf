Graphs of the coronavirus curves in Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy
look like mountains, with steep climbs up and then back down. The one
for America shows a fast climb up to a plateau. For a while, the number
of new cases in the U.S. was at least slowly declining. Now, according
to The Times, it’s up a terrifying 22 percent over the last 14 days.

As Politico [reported on
Monday](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/22/united-states-italy-traded-places-coronavirus-333122),
Italy’s coronavirus catastrophe once looked to Americans like a
worst-case scenario. Today, it said, “America’s new per capita cases
remain on par with Italy’s worst day — and show signs of rising
further.”

This is what American exceptionalism looks like under Donald Trump. It’s
not just that the United States has the highest number of coronavirus
cases and deaths of any country in the world. Republican political
dysfunction has made a coherent campaign to fight the pandemic
impossible.

At the federal level as well as in many states, we’re seeing a
combination of the blustering contempt for science that marks the
conservative approach to climate change and the [high tolerance for
carnage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/opinion/coronavirus-deaths.html)
that makes American gun culture unique.

The rot starts at the top. At the beginning of the crisis Trump acted as
if he could wish the coronavirus away, and after an interval when he at
least pretended to take it seriously, his administration has resumed a
posture of blithe denial.

The task force led by Mike Pence has [been
sidelined](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-task-force/index.html),
its members meeting only twice a week. Last Tuesday, the vice president
wrote an [op-ed essay in The Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/there-isnt-a-coronavirus-second-wave-11592327890)
about how well things are going: “We are winning the fight against the
invisible enemy,” he claimed.

In an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity last week, Trump said the
virus is “[fading
away](https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-hannity-coronavirus-fading-away-tulsa-rally).”
Speaking to [The
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-talks-juneteenth-john-bolton-economy-in-wsj-interview-11592493771),
he said that some people might be wearing masks only to show their
disapproval of him and suggested, contrary to all credible public health
guidance, that mask-wearing might increase people’s risk of infection.
It’s not surprising, then, that many people at his sad Saturday rally in
Tulsa, Okla. — where coronavirus cases are spiking — went maskless.

Just a few weeks ago, panicked about occupying my kids through the
summer in a shut-down New York City, I thought about taking them to stay
with my retired parents in Arizona. Now, as New York gingerly reopens,
Arizona has become a hot spot — which isn’t stopping Trump from holding
a rally at a Phoenix megachurch on Tuesday. Cases are also soaring in
Texas, Florida and several other states. An epidemic that was once
concentrated in blue states is increasingly raging in red ones.

When coronavirus cases started exploding on the East Coast in March,
there were devastating failures by Democratic leaders. New York’s
governor, Andrew Cuomo, not only forced nursing homes to take back
residents who’d been hospitalized for the coronavirus, he barred them
from testing the residents to see if they were still infected.

As [ProPublica
reported](https://www.propublica.org/article/fire-through-dry-grass-andrew-cuomo-saw-covid-19-threat-to-nursing-homes-then-he-risked-adding-to-it),
following Cuomo’s order, “Covid-19 tore through New York state’s nursing
facilities, killing more than 6,000 people — about 6 percent of its more
than 100,000 nursing home residents.” In Florida, which prohibited such
transfers, the virus has so far killed only 1.6 percent of nursing home
residents.

Given how Cuomo’s errors contributed to New York’s catastrophe, it’s
hard to say how much credit he deserves for eventually rising to the
occasion. Still, by the time New York’s cases got to where Arizona’s are
now, he at least understood that the state faced calamity and imposed
the lockdown that helped bring it back from the abyss.

Arizona, Florida and Texas, by contrast, aren’t even doing simple things
like mandating mask-wearing. Worse, until last week, the governors of
Arizona and Texas prevented cities from instituting their own such
requirements.

So far, evidence about the role mass protests over police violence
played in [coronavirus
spikes](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-22/for-third-day-in-a-week-l-a-county-reports-more-than-2-000-new-coronavirus-cases)
is
[mixed](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/protests-covid-outdoor-masks.html),
but liberal support for the demonstrations solidified the conviction
among many conservatives that strict social distancing rules are a
hypocritical tool of social control. The paranoia and resentment that
have long been part of the culture of the modern right are now directed
at those warning about the ongoing dangers of the pandemic.

Across the country, public health workers have faced [death
threats](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/CA-health-directors-quit-amid-death-threats-15343863.php),
harassment and [armed protesters at their
homes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/amid-threats-and-political-pushback-public-health-officials-leaving-posts/2020/06/22/6075f7a2-b0cf-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html).
No matter how bad things get in red America, it’s hard to imagine where
the political will to contain the virus will come from.

So while countries with competent leadership haltingly return to normal,
ours will continue to be pummeled. In mid-May, when America’s
coronavirus death toll was around 85,000, Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham
said that as long as [fatalities didn’t go much
beyond 120,000](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/14/white-house-coronavirus-success-259792),
“I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.”

By The Times’s count, [we just hit that
number](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#states).
The war goes on, but Trump has already lost it.
