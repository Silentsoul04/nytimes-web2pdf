The president threatened ``serious force'' if protesters tried to set up
an autonomous zone in Washington, D.C., as they have in Seattle.

OAKLAND, Calif. --- Twitter added a label to another post by President
Trump on Tuesday, the fifth time it has said he violated its policies
and further escalating the company's battle with the president over his
often incendiary tweets.

In an early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump threatened ``serious force''
against any protesters who tried to establish an autonomous zone in
Washington, D.C., as they have in Seattle. Twitter hid his message
behind a warning label saying the president violated the company's
policies forbidding abusive behavior.

After years of taking a hands-off approach, Twitter began to moderate
Mr. Trump's posts more aggressively last month. It added fact-checking
messages to some of his tweets about mail-in ballots and appended a
warning label to a tweet in which he suggested that protesters would be
shot. Last week, the company put an explanatory label on a tweet from
Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/technology/trump-tweet-baby-manipulated.html}{that
included a doctored video about a ``racist baby.''}

In response, Mr. Trump accused Twitter of working to stifle conservative
voices and harm his re-election campaign. Last month, he signed an
executive order intended to roll back legal protections for Twitter and
other internet companies. A
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/technology/trump-twitter-free-speech-lawsuit.html}{lawsuit}
has been filed to block the order.

Despite pushback from the president, Twitter has continued its efforts
to moderate his tweets, setting it apart from social media companies
that have avoided taking action on the president's posts. While Mr.
Trump often posts identical content on his Twitter and Facebook
accounts, Facebook has left most of them untouched. Facebook did remove
the ``racist baby'' video after receiving a complaint from the copyright
holder.

\href{https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1275500569940176897}{Twitter
said} Mr. Trump's tweet about the autonomous zone included ``the
presence of a threat of harm against an identifiable group.'' Such a
tweet would be removed if a regular user posted it, but Twitter provides
an exception to this policy for Mr. Trump and other government
officials, allowing their messages to remain online behind a warning
label.

``This Tweet will remain on the service given its relevance to ongoing
public conversation,'' Twitter said.
