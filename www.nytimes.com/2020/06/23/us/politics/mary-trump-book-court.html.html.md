# Trump Family Asks Court to Stop Publication of Tell-All by President’s Niece

President Trump’s family is seeking a temporary restraining order to try
to block publication of a tell-all [book by the president’s niece, Mary
L.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/us/politics/mary-trump-book.html).

</div>

Ms. Trump is the daughter of the president’s late brother, Fred Trump
Jr., and her book, “[Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created
the World’s Most Dangerous
Man](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/mary-trump-book-lawsuit.html),”
is scheduled to be published by Simon & Schuster on July 28.

Mr. Trump’s younger brother, Robert S. Trump, requested the restraining
order on Tuesday in a filing in Queens County Surrogate’s Court, where
the estate of the president’s father, Fred Trump Sr., was settled.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The filing names [Ms.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review/mary-trump-book-takeaways.html)
and Simon & Schuster, and it seeks to stop publication on the grounds
that Ms. Trump is violating a nondisclosure agreement related to the
settlement of the estate of Fred Trump Sr., the father of Donald and
Robert Trump and Mary Trump’s grandfather.

Officials at the Trump Organization declined to comment on the legal
efforts to stop the book, which is described by the publisher [on its
website](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Too-Much-and-Never-Enough/Mary-L-Trump/9781982141462)
as a “revelatory, authoritative portrait of Donald J. Trump and the
toxic family that made him.”

Ms. Trump, the website says, will show the “dark history of their family
in order to explain how her uncle became the man who now threatens the
world’s health, economic security and social fabric.”

In the book, Ms. Trump, 55, is expected to say she was a chief source
for The New York Times’s coverage of the president’s finances, and that
she provided the newspaper with confidential tax documents. A
spokeswoman for The Times declined to comment.

Robert Trump said in a statement that he was “deeply disappointed” in
his niece’s decision.

“Her attempt to sensationalize and mischaracterize our family
relationship after all of these years for her own financial gain is both
a travesty and injustice to the memory of my late brother, Fred, and our
beloved parents,” he said. “I and the rest of my entire family are so
proud of my wonderful brother, the president, and feel that Mary’s
actions are truly a disgrace.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Ms. Trump, said in a statement
that the president and his family were trying “to suppress a book that
will discuss matters of utmost public importance.”

“They are pursuing this unlawful prior restraint because they do not
want the public to know the truth,” he said. “The courts will not
tolerate this brazen violation of the First Amendment.”

Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, said the attempt to
prevent the book’s publication would fail.

“As the plaintiff and his attorney well know, the courts take a dim view
of prior restraint, and this attempt to block publication will meet the
same fate as those that have gone before,” he said.

But the book itself and the attempt to prevent it from appearing are
only the latest chapter in family tensions that have divided the Trumps
for years.

Mary Trump’s father, Fred Trump Jr., turned his back on his own father’s
real-estate business, becoming permanently estranged from him, to work
for Trans World Airlines. He suffered from alcoholism and died in 1981
at age 42.

When Fred Trump Sr. died in 1999, he all but cut out Fred Trump Jr.’s
two children, Mary and her brother, Fred Trump III, from his will,
leaving them only a small cash bequest. Ms. Trump and her brother
contested the will and sued Donald Trump and his siblings, arguing that
they poisoned Fred Trump Sr. against them and coerced him to change how
he left his fortune.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was a nasty court battle, and at one point Donald Trump and his
brother and sister cut off the medical benefits to Fred Trump III’s
infant child, who was born with severe medical issues requiring
expensive and intense care.

In 2001, Mary Trump and her brother settled the lawsuit. The exact terms
are not known, but the settlement did include a financial payment to
them both. In his court filing on Tuesday, Robert Trump wrote that the
settlement also included a confidentiality agreement barring Ms. Trump
from writing the type of book she seems to have written.

President Trump was apparently referring to that agreement in an
[interview last week with
Axios](https://www.axios.com/mary-trump-niece-nondisclosure-f16c90cb-1e75-4d43-bc92-0b6dc589802f.html)
after the imminent publication of Mary Trump’s book was first reported.

“She’s not allowed to write a book,” he said, referring to his niece.

“You know, when we settled with her and her brother, who I do have a
good relationship with — she’s got a brother, Fred, who I do have a good
relationship with — but when we settled,” Mr. Trump said, she “signed a
nondisclosure.”

The Trump family appears to be trying to block publication of the book
before it is printed and shipped to stores and warehouses. When the
[Justice Department tried and
failed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/politics/john-bolton-book-ruling.html)
in court to stop publication of a tell-all account of his time in the
White House by the former national security adviser John R. Bolton, the
book had already shipped and was set to go on sale a few days later.
