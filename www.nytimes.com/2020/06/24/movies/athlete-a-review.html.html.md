“Athlete A” was a moniker given to the anonymous athlete who first
reported Larry Nassar, [the Olympic doctor convicted of multiple sex
crimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/sports/larry-nassar-gymnastics-abuse.html),
to U.S.A. Gymnastics. That gymnast, who has since revealed her identity,
is Maggie Nichols, one of the brave subjects in Bonni Cohen and Jon
Shenk’s latest documentary ([out now on
Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81034185)), about the
organization’s long history of abuse and cover-ups. Though it focuses on
one main perpetrator, the film adeptly juggles various moving parts,
such as the ruthless nature of training and the aftermath of speaking
out.

One of these parts involves The Indianapolis Star, [the newspaper that
first ran an
article](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2016/08/04/usa-gymnastics-sex-abuse-protected-coaches/85829732/)
in 2016 about the institutional abuse within U.S.A. Gymnastics. After
that piece ran, the reporters started receiving responses from former
gymnasts about Nassar, who, under the guise of medical practice,
sexually abused hundreds of girls and young women. The doctor seemed
“nice” or “quirky,” according to interviewees, especially compared to
their militant coaches, notably Bela and Martha Karolyi, who many
athletes have said perpetuated an oppressive environment ripe for all
kinds of other abuse, including weight-shaming.

Cohen and Shenk amplify the voices of the survivors while recognizing
that Nassar’s arrest doesn’t dissipate the pain or deep-rooted
exploitation. [Steve
Penny](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/sports/steve-penny-gymnastics-arrest-tampering.html),
the former president and chief executive of U.S.A. Gymnastics ([who has
since been
charged](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/sports/steve-penny-usa-gymnastics-fbi.html)),
and Rhonda Faehn, the organization’s former vice president, turned a
blind eye for years, numerous survivors have said. The athletes endured
cyberbullying for speaking out and invasive investigations into their
sexual history to discredit their claims.

These women get some form of belated justice, but there’s a lot more
work to be done — which becomes shatteringly clear when it is revealed
that, all in all, roughly 500 women came forward about Nassar.

**Athlete A**  
Rated PG-13 for mature thematic content. Running time: 1 hour 43
minutes. Watch on [Netflix.](https://www.netflix.com/title/81034185)
