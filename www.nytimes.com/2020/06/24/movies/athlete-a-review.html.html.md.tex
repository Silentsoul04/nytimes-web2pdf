``Athlete A'' was a moniker given to the anonymous athlete who first
reported Larry Nassar,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/sports/larry-nassar-gymnastics-abuse.html}{the
Olympic doctor convicted of multiple sex crimes}, to U.S.A. Gymnastics.
That gymnast, who has since revealed her identity, is Maggie Nichols,
one of the brave subjects in Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk's latest
documentary (\href{https://www.netflix.com/title/81034185}{out now on
Netflix}), about the organization's long history of abuse and cover-ups.
Though it focuses on one main perpetrator, the film adeptly juggles
various moving parts, such as the ruthless nature of training and the
aftermath of speaking out.

One of these parts involves The Indianapolis Star,
\href{https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2016/08/04/usa-gymnastics-sex-abuse-protected-coaches/85829732/}{the
newspaper that first ran an article} in 2016 about the institutional
abuse within U.S.A. Gymnastics. After that piece ran, the reporters
started receiving responses from former gymnasts about Nassar, who,
under the guise of medical practice, sexually abused hundreds of girls
and young women. The doctor seemed ``nice'' or ``quirky,'' according to
interviewees, especially compared to their militant coaches, notably
Bela and Martha Karolyi, who many athletes have said perpetuated an
oppressive environment ripe for all kinds of other abuse, including
weight-shaming.

Cohen and Shenk amplify the voices of the survivors while recognizing
that Nassar's arrest doesn't dissipate the pain or deep-rooted
exploitation.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/sports/steve-penny-gymnastics-arrest-tampering.html}{Steve
Penny}, the former president and chief executive of U.S.A. Gymnastics
(\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/sports/steve-penny-usa-gymnastics-fbi.html}{who
has since been charged}), and Rhonda Faehn, the organization's former
vice president, turned a blind eye for years, numerous survivors have
said. The athletes endured cyberbullying for speaking out and invasive
investigations into their sexual history to discredit their claims.

These women get some form of belated justice, but there's a lot more
work to be done --- which becomes shatteringly clear when it is revealed
that, all in all, roughly 500 women came forward about Nassar.

\textbf{Athlete A}\\
Rated PG-13 for mature thematic content. Running time: 1 hour 43
minutes. Watch on
