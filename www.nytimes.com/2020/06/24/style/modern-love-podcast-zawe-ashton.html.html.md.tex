This week, the actress Zawe Ashton reads Lilian Oben's essay
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/style/modern-love-race-religion-boyfriend-breakup.html}{Confronting
Race, Religion and Her Heart}.''

In her 2017 essay, Ms. Oben wrote about the experience of being broken
up with because she was black and not Jewish. The pain and anger Ms.
Oben felt after the breakup was complicated. Not only was she angry at
her ex-boyfriend --- she was also ashamed of the ways she had devalued
herself in trying to win his acceptance.

Ms. Oben is an \href{https://www.lilianoben.com/}{actress and writer}
living in New York City. Ms. Ashton is an actress who most recently
starred in the movie ``Velvet Buzzsaw'' and the Broadway play
``Betrayal.'' Stay tuned after the reading to hear Ms. Oben's thoughts
about the current moment as well as commentary from Ms. Ashton and the
Modern Love editor Daniel Jones.

This episode also marks the end of our four-and-a-half-year producing
partnership with \href{https://www.wbur.org/}{WBUR}, a successful
collaboration that's been responsible for more than 250 episodes that
have been downloaded nearly 100 million times after debuting at the top
of the iTunes chart back in 2016. We have also produced live shows
together in the U.S. and internationally, and moved listeners to tears
from Sydney to Mumbai. The Modern Love podcast will continue at The New
York Times. Stay tuned for information about the relaunch.
