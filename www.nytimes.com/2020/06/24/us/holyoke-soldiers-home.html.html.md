BOSTON — An investigation of 76 deaths linked to the coronavirus at [a
state-run veterans’
home](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/us/they-survived-the-worst-battles-of-world-war-ii-and-died-of-the-virus.html)
in Massachusetts paints a picture of a facility in chaos, as traumatized
nurses carried out orders to combine wards of infected and uninfected
men, knowing that the move would prove deadly to many of their patients.

Workers at the facility, the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home, remembered the days
in late March as “total pandemonium” and a “nightmare.”

One social worker told investigators, [in a report released on
Wednesday](https://www.mass.gov/doc/report-to-governor-baker-re-holyoke-soldiers-home/download),
that she “felt like it was moving the concentration camp, we were moving
these unknowing veterans off to die.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another recalled sitting in a makeshift ward that was crowded with sick
and dying patients, some unclothed or without masks, and trying to
distract a man who was “alert and oriented,” chattering about the
Swedish meatballs his wife used to make.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It was surreal,” she said. “I don’t know how the staff over in that
unit, how many of us will ever recover from those images.”

Nursing home deaths have accounted for [more than 60
percent](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/27/metro/first-time-state-divulges-death-toll-by-nursing-home-more-than-80-have-20-or-more-covid-19-deaths/)
of the fatalities from the coronavirus in Massachusetts, a state that
prides itself on its health care system. None of those deaths have
received more attention than the cluster at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home,
which housed frail veterans of World War II and other
conflicts.

The 174-page independent report, led by the former federal prosecutor
Mark Pearlstein, blasts decisions made by the facility’s superintendent,
Bennett Walsh, as “utterly baffling from an infection-control
perspective.”

The report was especially scathing on the decision to combine crowded
wards. But it catalogs a series of other errors, including failure to
isolate infected veterans, failure to test veterans who had symptoms,
and the rotation of staff members between wards, accelerating the spread
of the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“In short, this was the opposite of infection control: Mr. Walsh and his
team created close to an optimal environment for the spread of
Covid-19,” the report said.

Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts said on Wednesday that the accounts
in the report were “one of the most depressing and utterly shameful
descriptions of what was supposed to be a care system that I have ever
heard of.”

The state is acting to fire Mr. Walsh, [a retired Marine Corps
lieutenant
colonel](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/02/metro/holyoke-soldiers-home-has-been-overlooked-understaffed-led-by-inexperience/)
with no previous nursing home experience, the governor said. A lawyer
for Mr. Walsh was not immediately available for comment.

Mr. Walsh’s supervisor, Francisco Urena, resigned from his post as the
state’s secretary of veterans’ services on Tuesday in anticipation of
the report. Mr. Baker said the secretary was asked to step down.

“Our administration did not do the job we should have done overseeing
Bennett Walsh and the Soldiers’ Home,” Mr. Baker said.

“I’m very sorry,” Mr. Urena told a reporter for WCVB, a local television
station. “I tried my best.”

The report suggests that Mr. Walsh, who left the military after a
distinguished 24-year career, was selected by the home’s Board of
Trustees in part because his family is politically powerful in western
Massachusetts, and that state officials were not happy with his
management, which was marked by a high rate of staff turnover.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Walsh, through his lawyer, disputed many elements of the report. He
said it “contains many baseless accusations that are immaterial to the
issues under considerations,” and that he would review legal actions.

“It is clear that Mr. Walsh reached out for help when the crisis
erupted,” said a statement from the lawyer, William Bennett. “The
failure of the Commonwealth to affirmatively respond to that request
contributed to many of the problems outlined in the
report.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Staff members told investigators that they were initially discouraged
from wearing protective equipment, in an effort to conserve a limited
supply, and that they felt “annoyed, paranoid and fearful for their
lives because they could not find masks,” the report said.

The most troubling portions of the report describe the weekend of March
28 and 29, when staffing was so short at the home that two wards were
hurriedly combined, a decision one employee described as “the most
insane thing I ever saw in my entire life.”

A social worker described listening to the chief nursing officer say
“something to the effect that this room will be dead by Sunday, so we
will have more room here.” Another social worker recalled seeing a
supervisor point to a room and say, “All this room will be dead by
tomorrow.”

Several staff members told investigators that, in the confusion, some of
the dying men did not receive adequate pain relief medication.

None of the facility’s top administrators acknowledged taking part in
the decision to combine the two wards, and its medical director, David
Clinton, told investigators he was not consulted.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We find this not to be credible, and at the very least, that Dr.
Clinton was aware (or should have been aware) of the move and did
nothing to stop it,” the report said.

Val Liptak, the interim administrator brought in to manage the crisis,
told investigators that, though she and her team had a “collective
90-plus years of nursing” among them, “none of us have ever seen
anything like this.” The overcrowded ward, she said, “looked like a war
zone.”

Among the disturbing revelations in the report was that supervisors had
instructed social workers to call the families of sick veterans and try
to persuade them to change their end-of-life health care preferences, so
that the veterans would not be transferred to a hospital.

One social worker said she stopped making those calls because “it felt
wrong,” as she put it, “in the pit of my belly and heart.”
