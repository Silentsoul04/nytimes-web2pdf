# Senate Democrats Block G.O.P. Police Bill, Calling It Inadequate

</div>

The vote reflected the waning likelihood that Congress would be able to
reach an election-year compromise on legislation to address racial bias
in policing.

WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats on Wednesday blocked a narrow Republican
bill to incentivize police departments to change their tactics, refusing
even to open debate on a measure they denounced as an insufficient and
irredeemably flawed answer to the problem of [systemic racism in law
enforcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd.html).

The vote, 55 to 45, was a setback in the effort to pass legislation this
year to address excessive use of force and racial discrimination by the
police, amid a [groundswell of public
sentiment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/30/us/george-floyd-protest-photos.html)
in favor of overhauling law enforcement. The Democratic-led House is set
on Thursday to pass its own sprawling legislation, but Senate Republican
leaders have said they will not take up that measure, setting the stage
for a bitter stalemate on the issue.

Expressing their deep opposition to the bill, Democrats demanded on
Tuesday that Republicans negotiate a more expansive package that both
parties could support, citing the opposition of dozens of civil rights
groups to the measure as drafted and arguing that it was an unacceptable
starting point for discussion.

Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, told reporters that
Democrats’ decision to block the bill was an effort “to not take crumbs
on the table when there is a hunger that America has for real solutions
to a very real problem.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This movement will not accept anything less than real, real
substantial, substantive solutions, which are the solutions we have
offered,” Ms. Harris said.

Republicans were livid at Democrats’ refusal to even allow the measure
to reach the floor for a debate and accused them of deliberately sinking
the bill for political purposes. It would have needed 60 votes to
advance in the Senate, where a three-fifths supermajority is necessary
for most major action. But only two Democrats, Senators Doug Jones of
Alabama and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, as well as Senator Angus
King, independent of Maine, joined Republicans in supporting moving it
forward.

“If you don’t think we’re right, make it better. Don’t walk away,”
Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who [spearheaded the
legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/us/politics/tim-scott-police-protests.html),
said before the vote. He urged Democrats to support advancing the bill
“so that we have an opportunity to deal with this very real threat to
the America that is civil, that is balanced.”

“This is an opportunity to say yes,” he said.

After the measure failed, a visibly frustrated Mr. Scott returned and
delivered extended remarks, saying that he had offered to give Democrats
as many as 20 votes on proposed modifications to his bill that they were
demanding, but that they had refused to accept. Privately, Democrats
noted that revising the bill would have also required the approval of 60
senators, a threshold they feared they would not be able to meet.

“Instead of going forward and getting what you want now, they’ve decided
to punt this ball until the election,” Mr. Scott said of Democrats. “You
know why? Because they believe the polls reflect a 15-point deficit on
our side, therefore they can get the bill they want in November.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The actual problem is not what is being offered, it is who is offering
it,” he continued.

As Mr. Scott left the floor, senators who had gathered there to hear him
speak stood to applaud him. One of them, Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of
Virginia, who said he had come to listen to Mr. Scott in appreciation of
his work, launched into his own impassioned speech, denying that the
outcome had been politically driven.

“That is a stiff charge,” Mr. Kaine said. “I voted not on the ‘what’ and
not on the ‘who.’ I voted on the ‘how.’ We tried it the wrong way. Let’s
try it the right way.”

The Republican bill would encourage state and local police departments
to change their practices, including penalizing departments that do not
require the use of body cameras and limiting the use of chokeholds. It
would not alter the [qualified immunity
doctrine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/qualified-immunity.html)
that shields officers from lawsuits or place new federal restrictions on
the use of lethal force.

The measure that the House will consider on Thursday, [the most
aggressive intervention into
policing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/politics/democrats-police-misconduct-bill-protests.html)
that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory, would in effect eliminate
qualified immunity, make it easier to track and prosecute police
misconduct, restrict the use of lethal force and aim to force
departments to eliminate the use of chokeholds.

Wednesday’s vote did not foreclose the possibility of reviving the
policing measure. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and
the majority leader, used a procedural maneuver that would allow him to
bring it up again in the future, changing his vote from “yes” to “no” so
he could later call for its reconsideration. But a flurry of private
bipartisan talks to strike a deal on the issue had not borne fruit.
