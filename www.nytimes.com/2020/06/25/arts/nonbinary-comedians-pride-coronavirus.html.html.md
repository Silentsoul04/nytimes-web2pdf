# Five Nonbinary Comics on This Moment: ‘I’m Not Some New Buzzword’

These comedians talk about their experiences in the industry, and
wanting audiences to look beyond their gender identity.

The stand-up comedian Jes Tom has a go-to pronoun joke: “I like when
people call me ‘they.’ It makes me feel less lonely.”

Tom is part of a small but growing group of comedians that doesn’t
exclusively identify with the gender labels of “male” and “female,” and
before the pandemic were regularly performing stand-up sets around New
York City.

Over several months, we spoke with five of these comedians about the
joys and frustrations of explaining their gender onstage and the
entertainment industry’s newfound interest in nonbinary performers. They
also talked about the challenges of working in a field embroiled in a
continuing discussion about [what is](https://nyti.ms/31tBFrA) and
[isn’t](https://nyti.ms/2V4Xy0p) off limits in comedy.

All this coincides with a greater awareness of [gender diversity in the
culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/magazine/gender-nonbinary.html)
at large. In 2019, [Merriam-Webster’s word of the
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/merriam-webster-they-word-year.html)
was the singular pronoun “they,” and both the singer Sam Smith and
Jonathan Van Ness of “Queer Eye” came out as nonbinary. The Supreme
Court recently ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [protects gay and
transgender
workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/gay-transgender-workers-supreme-court.html)
from workplace discrimination. And on the state and federal level there
are proposals that would allow a third gender option on passports and
[drivers’
licenses](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/nonbinary-drivers-licenses.html).

Comedy clubs remain closed, but these comedians were largely in good
spirits when we reconnected with them recently to find out how they were
managing as the city slowly emerges from its shutdown.

[Jes Tom](https://www.jestomdotcom.com/), 29, has a swagger that is at
once preening, arch, acidic and world-weary. When I said I found them
surprisingly menacing onstage, they clapped in delight and responded,
“That is the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me.”

An Asian-American comedian who also hosts a weekly cooking show on
Instagram Live called “[Iron
Jes](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBjfafOjRAR/),” Tom is aware of
Hollywood’s growing appetite for people who look like them. “For better
or worse, I think that the embodiment of nonbinary that I am is really
hot in the mainstream world right now. By which I mean specifically a
thin, of-color but still a relatively light-skinned person, East Asian
but still perfect English-speaking, assigned female at birth but still
kind of masculine leaning.” Indeed, Tom fits this prototype perfectly.

Tom acknowledged that their identity has helped land jobs, including
commercial work that has helped sustain them during the pandemic. “As a
[nonbinary trans queer Asian-American stand-up
comedian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htU38RhRmto), I probably get a
lot more paying gigs than white straight \[male\] comedians do,” they
said. “Which is not to say I have it any easier systemically.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is like the marginalized artist double-edged sword, right?” Tom
added. “On the one hand, I look forward to the day when my whole career
is not about this identity part of myself. On the other hand, I feel
very grateful that this marginalized identity part of myself gets me
working, gets me attention.”

Being able to work in such a niche is a far cry from when they started
doing comedy in 2013. Back then they were usually the only gender
nonconforming person in the room. “There was, as far as I know, no queer
comedy open mic,” Tom recalled. “By which I mean I Googled it and
nothing came up.”

“If you don’t know, the open mic scene in New York can be shockingly
transphobic, misogynistic, racist,” [James
Tison](https://www.jamestison.com/) chirped from the stage at Club
Cumming last fall.

It was the third installment of the monthly showcase “The Snowflake
Mic,” and Tison was explaining the ethos of the open mic night.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“You’re welcome to say whatever you want. But free speech is fortunately
a two-way street,” Tison cautioned the participating comics. “So if you
come onto this stage and you rattle off some hack premise about how
trans women aren’t women or if you think you found some clever new way
to say the ‘N-word’ into a microphone and you’re a white person, this
audience is allowed to boo you, they’re allowed to come up to you after
and say ‘Hey, I didn’t like that,’ and you have to take it.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a stand-up, Tison, 33, has performed at open mics in New York City
for years and regularly encountered heckling and harassment both onstage
and off. In response, they curated a list of “[nontoxic open
mics](https://www.jamestison.com/faq)” on their website and created “The
Snowflake Mic,” reclaiming the word that is used to describe an overly
sensitive person.

Not everyone appreciated the joke. A few comedians took to Twitter
extolling the virtue of tough rooms and hostile crowds as important
preparation for a nasty and difficult industry.

But Tison bristled at the idea that a comedy night by and for L.G.B.T.Q.
comedians represents a radical departure from comedy at large or a
softening of jokes. “I don’t think anybody has neutral material,” they
said. “It’s a made-up concept. There’s just a lot of straight men in the
business and we call that neutral.”

“The Snowflake Mic” has been on hold since March, but Tison plans to
restart it as soon as possible. For Tison, hosting the mic is about
labor as much as it is about comedy.

“Open mics are the entry point for the entire field,” Tison wrote in an
email. “They’re the only way to actually get better at stand-up, but
they’re also where you build professional relationships with like-minded
folks that lead to future gigs. We’re talking about job opportunities in
a job market.”

Of course, that job market and the open mics that feed it are largely
gone right now. Over the past few months, Tison has spent the time they
would normally have spent onstage working on a podcast for the [abortion
rights group NARAL](https://shop.naral.org/products/book), writing a
pilot, and uploading videos to
[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@james.tison?lang=en), which they
describe as “methadone” to the heroin of live comedy performance.

They’ve also turned their attention and anxieties to their own home. “I
built a desk,” Tison told me. “I repainted my bathroom twice.”

For anyone concerned that nonbinary comedians represent politically
correct or sanitized comedy, Lorelei Ramirez, 30, might ease their
worries. At their [MoMA PS1](https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/5931)
show last fall, Ramirez told a joke about getting caught masturbating in
a public library and mused about how a choir of pedophiles might sound.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ramirez’s PS1 show also included a musical performance using their voice
and a looping pedal, a live projection of a digital drawing, and a
circus-themed art installation, complete with a stilt walker, popcorn,
and framed portraits of clowns painted by Ramirez. “Nonbinary” applies
not only to Ramirez’s gender, but to their entire approach to
performance and art.

While they do tell jokes about their gender identity (“I’m nonbinary, so
I’m not like other girls. Because I’m a person.”), Ramirez often veers
into absurdist body horror monologues delivered in voices that can test
the line between **** cutesy and creepy.

“I like to jokingly rip apart the reality that we’re in,” Ramirez
explained over Zoom. “I just like to have people imagine the craziest
thing that they can.” Which, in the case of Lorelei’s comedy can include
a long non sequitur about being followed home and killed by a
one-foot-tall imp with a giant head.

Ramirez’s performances during the lockdown have mostly been limited to a
weekly live drawing show called “[Art Is
Easy](https://www.twitch.tv/lramirez8095),” on Twitch. They’ve also been
working with friends to provide food and wellness services to community
organizers and activists.

Though not performing regularly, Ramirez said they’re still using their
“comedy brain and production brain” amid the current political
climate. “We created an alternative scene in an industry that didn’t
have space for us,” Ramirez said. “So now we’re doing that but in actual
life, not just this small scene. And it still applies.”

In an elegiac solo performance at Ars Nova, Peter Smith, 29, portrayed
Princess Diana in a work that featured original songs and monologues
scattered among a virtuosic lip sync of Diana’s 1995 BBC interview with
the journalist Martin Bashir. It was tragic and disorienting, and
occasionally hilarious.

[Smith](http://ptrsmth.com/)’s performance in “Diana” had more in common
with esoteric theatrical performers like [Dickie

than your average stand-up comedian, but Smith still sees value in being
an openly trans comedian playing for mainstream comedy audiences.

“If you are free from something, it’s your duty to free other people,”
Smith told me. “Just seeing someone exist and have fun is liberating.”

They also hosted two variety shows in New York City with their frequent

In 2020, Smith starred in the new musical “XY” at the Village Theater in
Seattle, appeared alongside Honig in Adult Swim’s “Three Busy Debras,”
and delivered a powerhouse rendition of the Beach Boys’ “God Only Knows”
in an episode of Hulu’s “Shrill.”

Since March, Smith has eschewed traditional comedy in favor of
songwriting and community organizing, sometimes collaborating with
Lorelei Ramirez. Does Smith miss live performance? Of course.

“But my desire to get back on the stage does not come close to my desire
for getting people together and activating them,” they said. “Everything
that’s happening now is very live.”

A summer camp talent show was Spike Einbinder’s first brush with
performing comedy. They pantomimed picking tomatoes off a hamburger
while Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” played on a tape
recorder. “I was never like, ‘I’m doing just one thing,’” Einbinder
said. “I always wanted to do it all.”

Einbinder, who insisted in our conversations that their age was 5,412,
fuses elements of theater, drag and performance art in their comedy
sets. They have appeared onstage as demons, golems, or in the case of
their alter-ego, [Candy Dish](https://youtu.be/pxg8rkB5qMM), a
green-skinned swamp creature who cut her teeth as a comedian working
“the Bog Belt.”

During their more traditional stand-up sets, Einbinder sometimes uses
their trans identity to toy with their audience. “I’ll say ‘Who here
thinks I’m a girl?’” Einbinder said. “And usually people are too afraid
to answer that.”

Einbinder’s eclectic performances made them a favorite at alternative
and queer comedy nights, and they’ve also appeared on HBO’s “[High
Maintenance](https://www.hbo.com/high-maintenance/season-3/5-payday)”
and “[Los Espookys](https://www.hbo.com/los-espookys),” which was
written by their best friend, Julio Torres.

“I would like to think that the reason that I get roles and the reason
that I get booked is because I’m a singular, unique person who is funny
and not because I’m some new buzzword,” they said. “I’ve always been
this way.”
