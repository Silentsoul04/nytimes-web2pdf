Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu touted a rare public opening between
the two countries. Apparently, the Emirates was not ready for it.

TEL AVIV, Israel --- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
announced a new partnership with the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/science/mars-united-arab-emirates.html}{United
Arab Emirates} on Thursday to cooperate in the fight against the
coronavirus, portraying it as the latest advance in the Jewish state's
efforts to build stronger ties with Arab states.

But Mr. Netanyahu's ebullient description was contradicted a few hours
later when the Emirates issued a much more muted statement, announcing
what it described as an agreement between two private Emirati companies
and two Israeli companies to develop technology to fight the virus.

The Emirati statement took the wind out of what Mr. Netanyahu had touted
as a diplomatic coup, suggesting that despite the deepening ties, the
two countries were still at odds over Mr. Netanyahu's vow to annex parts
of the occupied West Bank.

Addressing graduates at an air force base near Tel Aviv, Mr. Netanyahu
spoke in grand terms of what he described as a new partnership that
could benefit the broader Middle East.

``Our ability to work against the corona pandemic can also serve the
entire region,'' he said. ``It creates opportunities for us for open
cooperation that we have not known so far with certain countries.''

The partnership would include cooperation in research and development
between the Israeli and Emirati health ministries in medical projects
related to the coronavirus, he said.

To seal the deal, he said, the two ministries would announce the
agreement ``in a few moments.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/world/25israel-uae4/merlin_173793810_20c23493-7344-4b0d-8522-148e5b0a1f70-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

But it was unclear why the Emirates would agree to take such a public
step at a time when Israel was drawing up plans to annex parts of the
West Bank, a move that Arab countries, including the Emirates, have
repeatedly denounced.

And four hours later, as Israeli officials stewed, the answer came in a
Twitter posting from an Emirati Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.

``In light of strengthening international cooperation in the fields of
research, development \& technology in service of humanity, two private
companies in U.A.E. sign an agreement with two companies in Israel to
develop research technology to fight Covid-19,''
\href{https://twitter.com/hend_mana/status/1276231716030513152}{wrote}
Hend al-Otaiba, the spokeswoman.

There was no mention of a state-to-state partnership between the two
countries, which do not have diplomatic relations but whose ties have
improved in recent years, and nothing about their health ministries.

It was unclear on Thursday whether the two countries had privately
reached an agreement that came apart as it was coming to light, or what
caused the daylight between the two announcements. But it seemed that
Mr. Netanyahu's annexation plans had made Emirati officials
uncomfortable with such a public step toward Israel.

Barbara A. Leaf, a former United States ambassador to the Emirates and a
fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said it
appeared that Mr. Netanyahu's statement had pushed the Emirates into
making a statement it was not ready to make.

If stronger state-to-state contacts were in the works, it was clear that
the Emirates did not want to make them public.

``They are not on the same page at a point in time when the Israeli
government is openly discussing not whether but how much of the West
Bank to annex,'' Ms. Leaf said.

Mr. Netanyahu has vowed to annex up to 30 percent of the West Bank as
soon as July 1, a move that much of the world views as a violation of
international law and a new barrier to the establishment of a future
Palestinian state.

Just two weeks ago, the Emirates' ambassador to the United States,
Yousef al-Otaiba,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/world/middleeast/west-bank-annexation-israel-uae.html}{wrote
a landmark article} in a leading Israeli newspaper warning Israelis
directly that ``annexation will definitely, and immediately, reverse all
of the Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural
ties with the Arab world and the United Arab Emirates.''

``It's Either Annexation or Normalization,'' the headline said.

Mr. al-Otaiba did not respond to a request for comment.

A public partnership with the Emirates would have been a political
windfall for Mr. Netanyahu, who has sought to build ties with Arab
countries without making progress on a peace accord with the
Palestinians. While some Arab leaders reject the possibility of any ties
with Israel, others have long considered an Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement a prerequisite for any warming of ties.

In recent years, Persian Gulf monarchies have shifted away from seeing
Israel as the oppressor in its conflict with the Palestinians and
instead view it as a valuable partner in trade, security and their
rivalry with Iran.

Shimrit Meir, an Israeli analyst of the Arab world, said that the
announcements on Thursday were still significant, despite the apparent
miscues.

``Saying we have two private companies cooperating with Israeli
companies on Covid: In the language of the Middle East, this is almost
unheard-of,'' she said.

Noting that the two countries had previously worked together secretly,
she said, ``I think the outing of this is both important and bold.''

announced.Credit...Mahmoud Khaled/EPA, via Shutterstock

The two countries had collaborated covertly on combating the virus
recently, when the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/world/middleeast/coronavirus-israel-mossad.html}{quietly
acquired some equipment Israel needed to fight the coronavirus} from
Gulf states, according to European news media reports.

While Israel remains deeply unpopular across much of the Arab world, the
Palestinian cause has diminished in importance to the region as Arab
states have turned inward to deal with economic crises, popular
uprisings and the rise of terrorist groups such as the Islamic State.

Persian Gulf countries such as the Emirates and Saudi Arabia have come
to see Iran as a primary threat to regional stability and recognized
Israel as a potential partner in confronting it.

``The U.A.E. has changed its approach to relations with Israel only in
light of the Iranian danger, which they also perceived as threatening to
them,'' said Eli Avidar, who ran an Israeli mission in Qatar in
1999-2001 is now a member of the Israeli parliament.

That led to a gradual ramping up of covert dealings with Israel among
Gulf States on issues including security, technology, agriculture and
most recently health.

Lebanon. David M. Halbfinger contributed reporting from Jerusalem.
