Sister Angela was a teacher, secretary and, in her late decades, a whiz
on the computer. She died of the coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

When Sister Angela Marie Rooney was 98 years old, she moved out of the
Roman Catholic Convent of Mary the Queen in Yonkers, N.Y., and into an
assisted living facility run by Jewish Home Lifecare in the Bronx. Isn't
that the way faith goes in New York?

The moves by Sister Angela and 22 other Sisters of Charity into the home
that year were inevitable. Fewer young women were becoming nuns, meaning
there was not enough money in the order to maintain the convent; the
existing nuns were aging into advanced care; and the Jewish Home was one
of the few places that could accommodate so many new residents at once.

But it was a leap for the nuns. ``I wanted my convent, my great big
chapel, my Stations of the Cross,'' Sister Angela told The
\href{https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/aging-catholic-nuns-find-care-at-jewish-nursing-home/1336427/}{Associated
Press}in 2015, describing her first impressions. ``The very name `Jewish
Home' turned me off.'' She added, ``I don't think anyone came here with
a heavier heart than me.''

But nuns adapt; facilities, likewise. The home offered daily Mass for
the new residents. And Sister Angela took to attending both Jewish and
Protestant services as well, on the logic that all were serving ``one
God, worshiped in different ways,'' her cousin Susan Hearty said.

At her 100th-birthday party there, in 2017, Sister Angela recorded a
message of gratitude to the home, saying, ``It should be spread abroad
and all over the world: The Jewish Home could not have been more loving
and caring.''

Sister Angela, proud of her digital skills, designed the party program
and place cards herself on a computer.

The oldest member of the Sisters of Charity of New York, she celebrated
her 103rd birthday in February, before the coronavirus --- which hit
hard at facilities for older adults --- caught up with her. She died on
May 27 at St. Vincent de Paul Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center
in the Bronx, where she had moved after contracting the virus, the order
said.

``She was grateful that her health was as good as it was for as long as
it was,'' Ms. Hearty said, ``but she was prepared, mentally and
spiritually, to meet her Lord, and she looked forward to it.''

Catherine Cecilia Rooney was born on Feb. 22, 1917, in Manhattan, the
oldest of three children of Hugh and Bridget Rooney. Her father, from
County Donegal in Ireland, was a firefighter; her mother, from County
Armagh, kept the household.

She entered the Sisters of Charity in 1939, receiving the name Sister
Angela Marie, and took her final vows in 1945.

One of her aunts was a Carmelite nun, and two first cousins were Sisters
of Charity. Her brother, Msgr. Hugh Rooney, was a priest. Her brother
and her sister, Ann T. Rooney, died before her.

Sister Angela taught first through eighth grade at several Catholic
schools from 1939 to 1979, then worked another 31 years at the Sisters
of Charity Center in the Bronx, first as a secretary and then as a
volunteer.

Sister Ann Costello, for whom she worked at the center, remembered
Sister Angela hopping the bus to the subway to the B. Altman department
store in Manhattan, returning with sharp outfits. ``She was a spiffy
dresser,'' Sister Ann said. ``She always looked very nice and precise.''

She made a point of knowing the names of everyone who worked at Jewish
Home Lifecare, now the New Jewish Home. Ms. Hearty recalled giving her a
shawl there as a present.

``The next time I saw her,'' Ms. Hearty said, ``she thanked me for it
and said how lovely it was, and she hoped I didn't mind, but she gave it
to one of the ladies who worked in the home, because she had been so
kind to her.''
