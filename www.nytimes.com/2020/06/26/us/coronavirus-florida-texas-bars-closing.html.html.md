MIAMI — As coronavirus cases surge across much of the United States,
leaders are urgently rethinking their strategies to curb the spread,
which the nation’s top infectious disease expert said on Friday were
“not working.”

For the first time, some governors are backtracking on reopening their
states, issuing new restrictions for parts of the economy that had
resumed.

Leaders in Texas and Florida abruptly set new restrictions on bars, a
reversal that appeared unthinkable just days ago. And Gov. Gavin Newsom
of California told rural Imperial County, where hospitals have been
overwhelmed with patients, that it must reinstate a stay-at-home order,
the most restrictive of requirements.

More than 45,000 new cases were reported on Friday in the United States,
according to a New York Times database. It was the third day in a row
that the country set a daily record during the pandemic. At least six
states — Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Oregon, South Carolina and Utah — hit
daily highs on Friday, but even leaders outside of the new hot zones in
the South and West expressed mounting anxiety.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is a very dangerous time,” Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said in an
interview on Friday, as cases were trending steadily upward in his state
after appearing to be under control for more than a month. “I think what
is happening in Texas and Florida and several other states should be a
warning to everyone.”

“We have to be very careful,” he said.

The stock market responded badly, with the S\&P 500 dropping 2.4
percent. Losses accelerated after the Texas announcement, adding to
investors’ concerns that the virus continued to be a threat to the
economy.

The shifting assessments of the nation’s handling of the virus stretched
to the highest levels of the federal government, where Dr. Anthony S.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, made clear that the standard approach to controlling
infectious diseases — testing sick people, isolating them and tracing
their contacts — was not working. The failure, he said, was in part
because some infected Americans are asymptomatic and unknowingly
spreading the virus but also because some people exposed to the virus
are reluctant to self-quarantine or have no place to do so.

In a brief interview on Friday, he said officials were having “intense
discussions” about a possible shift to “pool testing,” in which samples
from many people are tested at once in an effort to quickly find and
isolate the infected.

Dr. Fauci also issued an urgent warning that while coronavirus
infections were spiking mostly in the South, those outbreaks could
spread to other regions.

Even in the face of the alarming news, the White House continued to
praise its own efforts.

“We have made truly remarkable progress in moving our nation forward,”
Vice President Mike Pence said at what has become a rare public briefing
by the coronavirus task force in Washington. “We’ve all seen the
encouraging news as we open
up.”

The renewed sense of urgency comes as the United States confronts a new,
treacherous phase of the pandemic, no longer defined by a crisis
concentrated in New York City, but by rising cases in many cities and
states. Alabama, Alaska, California, Georgia, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma
and Texas also reported their highest single-day totals of new known
cases this week, and the United States set records for daily new cases
on both Wednesday and Thursday. By Friday, new daily cases were rising
in 29 states.

From Miami to Los Angeles, mayors were contemplating slowing or
reversing their plans to return cities to public life. On Friday, San
Francisco announced it was delaying plans to reopen zoos, museums, hair
salons, tattoo parlors and other businesses on Monday, citing a spike in
new cases. “Our numbers are still low but rising rapidly,” Mayor London
Breed [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/LondonBreed/status/1276596917770715136),
adding, “I know people are anxious to reopen — I am too. But we can’t
jeopardize the progress we’ve made.”

Mayor Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade County said late Friday that he would
sign an emergency order closing beaches from July 3 to July 7, citing
the surge of cases and fears about mass gatherings during the holiday
weekend. Parks and beaches will be closed to fireworks displays, and
gatherings of more than 50 people, including parades, will be banned.

“The closure may be extended if conditions do not improve,” he said in a
statement, adding, “I have decided that the only prudent thing to do to
tamp down this recent uptick is to crack down on recreational activities
that put our overall community at higher risk.”

The decisions in Texas and Florida to revert to stronger restrictions
represented the strongest acknowledgment yet that reopening had not gone
as planned in two of the nation’s most populous states, where only days
ago their Republican governors were adamantly resisting calls to close
back down.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Thursday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas placed [the state’s reopening on
pause](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/texas-coronavirus-cases-reopening-Greg-Abbott.html),
while remaining firm that going “backward” and closing down businesses
was “the last thing we want to do.”

But by Friday, he did just that, ordering bars closed and telling
restaurants to limit themselves to 50 percent capacity rather than 75
percent.

“If I could go back and redo anything, it probably would have been to
slow down the opening of bars,” Mr. Abbott said in an interview with
KVIA-TV in El Paso on Friday evening.

“People go to bars to get close and to drink and to socialize,” he said.
“And that’s the kind of thing that stokes the spread of the coronavirus.
So sure, in hindsight, it may have been better to slow the opening of
the bar setting.”

Eight weeks ago, Mr. Abbott started a phased-in reopening of Texas, when
the state had reported about 29,000 cases and more than 800 deaths. Bars
had been allowed to open since late May.

New cases and hospitalizations have increased significantly in recent
days in Houston, San Antonio and other large cities. By Friday, Texas
had more than 130,000 known coronavirus cases and more than 2,300
deaths, and the leader of the third-largest county in America — Harris
County, which is home to Houston — had deemed the region to be on a
code-red coronavirus threat level.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We find ourselves careening toward a catastrophic and unsustainable
situation,” the top elected official in Harris County, Lina Hidalgo,
said at a news conference. She said the current hospitalization rate was
on pace to overwhelm the hospital system “in the near
future.”

In Florida, the speed of the virus’s growth was dizzying: State
officials reported 8,942 new coronavirus cases on Friday, by far
outpacing its earlier single-day record of 5,508 cases, which had been
set on Wednesday.

Officials announced limits on bars, immediately banning alcohol
consumption on the premises. Bars can still sell food if they are
licensed to do so, but their facilities must remain at 50 percent
capacity.

The return to stricter limits left local officials worried whether
residents would follow the rules, especially now, months into the
crisis.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is

        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“People are tired of being in a stay-at-home environment, and they’re
not going to be compliant,” said Carlos Migoya, president and chief
executive of the public Jackson Health System in Miami. “You can’t put
the genie back in the bottle. We’ve got to deal with it being in the
environment.”

Pete Boland, who co-owns the Galley, a restaurant and bar in St.
Petersburg, Fla., was sorting through the details of Florida’s latest
order on Friday to determine what the rules will be for establishments
that also serve food.

He had just reopened on Wednesday, following a professional deep
cleaning after some employees fell ill with the virus.

“I don’t know if we can continue to do this: open, closing, open,
closing,” he said. “You have people who desire to socialize and to earn
and to live and to have some fun in this crazy world.”

In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey has held out on setting new limits in his
state, even as cases there surged past 66,000, with an average of 2,750
new cases per day. He warned this week that hospitals were likely to hit
surge capacity soon but he has remained opposed to backtracking on
reopening.

“This is not another executive order to enforce, and it’s not about
closing businesses,” he said this week. “This is about public education
and personal
responsibility.”

Still, shutting down businesses again in Arizona is not out of the
question, Daniel Ruiz, the state’s chief operating officer, said in an
interview on Friday.

“We want to treat that like a last resort,” Mr. Ruiz said. “It’s a tool
in the toolbox, but it’s something that we’re going to use very
judiciously.”

California, which had the first stay-at-home order in the nation this
spring, has surpassed 200,000 cases, and on Friday, Mr. Newsom announced
new restrictions on Imperial County, which has the state’s [highest rate
of
infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/corona-virus-latinos.html).
The county has exceeded its hospital capacity so severely that some 500
patients have had to be moved to beds elsewhere, and hospitals as far
away as the Bay Area have been seeing Imperial County patients.

“This disease does not take a summer vacation,” said Mr. Newsom, noting
that at least 15 of California’s 58 counties were being monitored
closely as the virus surges.

In Los Angeles County, health officials estimate that every 400th person
may currently be infected. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said he
planned to wait three to five days before deciding whether to pull back
on the city’s reopening.

“We’re not in the red zone but we’re in the yellow zone,” the mayor said
in an interview on Friday.

From case counts to hospitalizations, he said, the city’s metrics are
moving in the wrong direction, in part because of a patchwork of
responses in neighboring areas.

Mr. Garcetti said he would like health officials in the state, the
county and the surrounding region to come to a consensus strategy.

“If you don’t move together, there’s no point in being the lone
holdout,” he said. “If you don’t have an entire region working
together, who cares if you keep your gyms closed?”
