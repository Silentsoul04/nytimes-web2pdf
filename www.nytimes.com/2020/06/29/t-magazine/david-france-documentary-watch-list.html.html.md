# Five Essential Documentaries, Recommended by David France

The connective thread running through the journalist and documentarian
[David
France](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/act-up-aids.html)’s
work may be queer activism, and yet he doesn’t see himself as an
activist. “I didn’t have what it took to be a leader through difficult
times, to find answers and bring people along with me,” he told me
earlier this month during a call from his apartment in New York’s East
Village. “That was not my skill set.”

His strength, it turned out, was as an observer, someone who functioned
as a megaphone for those on the front line. France chronicled [ACT
UP](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/act-up-aids.html)
and other groups that demanded more expansive medical research during
the escalating AIDS crisis of the ’80s and ’90s, first for alternative
queer publications and later for mainstream ones including **** Newsweek
and New York magazine, before moving into filmmaking in 2012 with “[How
to Survive a
Plague](https://www.nytimes.com/watching/recommendations/watching-film-how-to-survive-a-plague),”
his account, told using archival footage, of the protest-led battle
against H.I.V. “I’ve always been interested in studying the people who
are able to step up and launch transformative activism from the
outside,” he says.

His latest film, “[Welcome to
Chechnya](https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/welcome-to-chechnya/about),”
premiering June 30 on HBO, builds on this theme. It follows an
underground group of activists who risk their lives to provide sanctuary
and safe passage for L.G.B.T.Q. citizens of the Russian republic, where
gay people are routinely tortured and **** killed as part of a campaign
to supposedly cleanse the nation’s bloodline — violence that the
government has largely shrugged off. It’s the conclusion to what France
considers his trilogy, starting with “How to Survive a Plague,” which
was nominated for the Academy Award for best documentary, and his 2017
film “[The Death and Life of Marsha P.
Johnson](https://www.nytimes.com/watching/titles/the-death-and-life-of-marsha-p-johnson),”
about the mysterious passing of the prominent black trans activist.

“Welcome to Chechnya” uses a version of [deepfake
technology](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/technology/tech-companies-deepfakes.html)
to disguise the faces and voices of France’s subjects in order to
preserve both their anonymity and humanity — a technique he developed
after workshopping various ideas (including a Snapchat-like filter) and
asking multiple Hollywood visual-effects experts for advice. The digital
process, a first of its kind, allows us to empathize with the
protagonists — all of whom are running away from the stability of family
and home toward safety and the unknown — while keeping their identities
shrouded. “There’s a very specific ask of the audience,” France says.
“Witness this. Don’t let Putin and \[the Chechnyan leader Ramzan\]
Kadyrov get away with this. There are still 70 countries around the
world where it’s illegal to be gay, and eight where being so is
punishable by death.” (In the film’s chilling final moments, France
notes that the Trump administration has refused these L.G.B.T.Q.
Chechnyan refugees entry to America.)

France, who is currently at work on a film about the novel coronavirus,
shared with T his five essential documentaries, all of which deal with
humanity in its most harrowing and transcendent extremes.

“The Syrian filmmaker Feras Fayyad is one of the most soulful
documentary filmmakers working today,” says France about the director of
this movie, which profiles a female doctor, [Amani
Ballour](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/world/middleeast/her-dream-of-becoming-a-doctor-turned-into-a-nightmare-and-a-movie.html),
**** working in dire conditions throughout **** the Syrian civil war in
a makeshift medical facility that gives the film its name. “It’s shot
inside an underground hospital targeted by Russian airstrikes, and
Fayyad **** finds generosity, love and beauty where it is least
expected,” he says.

“[Emad

is a West Bank farmer who bought a camera to capture his growing family,
but his gaze turned outward when Israelis destroyed his olive trees to
make room for a barrier wall,” France says. The resulting film documents
the ensuing protests, reflecting upon how the personal and political
collide and **** giving a human face to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. “Five times his cameras were shot or smashed, but the
documentary evidence nonetheless survived.”

“This film was shot inside Folsom Prison, but that’s not its point,”
says France. “It’s about the very hard work we all need to undertake if
we hope to reconcile with our past, and with the difficult truths of the
world we inherited.” In following the San Francisco-based **** nonprofit
group [Inside Circle](https://insidecircle.org/about-us/), which
provides therapy-like sessions to inmates — the titular “work” — this
searing study, directed by Jairus McLeary, shows how the prison system
can look beyond punishment toward the true roots of criminal activity.
“It’s about how to find a way, together, to create a better future,”
France adds.

As voters’ rights are set to become even more of a flashpoint during
this year’s elections, this documentary, directed by Marilyn Mulford and
Connie Field, about the 1964 push to sign up black voters in Mississippi
— during what was known as Freedom Summer — feels newly relevant. “We
should all go back and watch this Oscar-nominated film about the brutal
voter registration campaign in Mississippi and the dogged activists who
weathered that war,” France says. “These are the shoulders we stand on
as we take on the unfinished work of racial justice in America.”

“There is no more beautiful film about the need for finding harmony with
the natural world,” France says of this 2019 Academy Award contender,
which doubles as a fable of sorts. Directed by [Tamara Kotevska and
Ljubomir
Stefanov](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/movies/honeyland-oscars.html),
it tells the story of a Macedonian beekeeper, Hatidze Muratova, focusing
on the ways her routine — and nature’s delicate balance — is upended
when new neighbors descend. “Stunningly shot in isolated North
Macedonia,” says France, “it chronicles one woman who lives a life fit
for a long-ago era when the disaster of the modern world arrives.”
