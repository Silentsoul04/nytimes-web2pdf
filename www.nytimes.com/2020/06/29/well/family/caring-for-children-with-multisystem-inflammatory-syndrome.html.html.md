<div class="css-53u6y8">

When doctors began to recognize a [serious inflammatory
syndrome](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/nyregion/children-Kawasaki-syndrome-coronavirus.html)
affecting children, apparently related in some way to Covid-19
infections, it was scary news for parents and pediatricians alike.
Everyone had taken some comfort in the idea that this terrible and
terrifying pandemic was in large part sparing the young.

Nobody could tell how common this new syndrome would turn out to be, and
people worried that the surges of coronavirus infections and deaths
among adults might be trailed by increasing numbers of children who had
perhaps had mild or asymptomatic infections, but would later develop
this mysterious illness.

Now, nearly two months after the first cases were reported, doctors can
reassure parents that the syndrome remains rare, while continuing to
urge vigilance. We do need to identify these rare children, because
while they may start out with very common symptoms, they can become very
sick — and also because we have therapies which seem to be working —
which is the other cautiously positive news.

In the United States, we call the new pediatric inflammatory syndrome
related to Covid-19 infection MIS-C, for multisystem inflammatory
syndrome in children, while in Britain, it’s called PIMS-TS, for
pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, temporally associated with
SARS-CoV-2. The hallmarks of the syndrome include prolonged fever,
without any clear cause, and a variety of symptoms of inflammation,
including rash. Laboratory tests show marked inflammation.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The doctors taking care of these children around the world, pediatric
hospitalists and intensivists, rheumatologists, infectious disease
specialists, cardiologists, immunologists, are absorbed in the unusual
experience of managing and figuring out a new syndrome, a new entity, a
new disease. And as with other aspects of the current pandemic, clinical
cooperation and medical research are happening on an unprecedented
level.

Dr. Gail Shust, an associate professor in the division of pediatric
infectious diseases at New York University School of Medicine, said that
different specialties within the same hospital, and different hospitals
across the city and around the world, are connecting on daily calls to
discuss patients and therapies.

In New York City, Dr. Shust said, doctors are seeing a decline in these
cases, though everyone is worried about what is going to happen in other
states, as the pandemic flares.

The symptoms are common in any pediatric practice: fever, rash, upset
stomachs. “When I get calls about kids with fever and rash, my thought
process has changed, and I worry about things I didn’t worry about
before,” said Dr. Leora Mogilner, an associate professor of pediatrics
at Mount Sinai who sees patients at their pediatric associates practice.

Back in March or April, if a child had vomiting and diarrhea, doctors
sought to counsel parents on how to manage it at home. “Now we’re
looking at it through a different lens,” Dr. Mogilner said. “We’re
asking, did the child have Covid, or more usually a family member?”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If there’s any concern that a child is not looking well, she said, that
child needs to come in, get vital signs checked, and get lab work done.
“It’s very anxiety-provoking for pediatricians in primary care, and
also for very seasoned parents,” she said.

Dr. Philip Kahn, a pediatric rheumatologist at New York University
School of Medicine, said some need intensive care, and others have
relatively mild disease and may not get treated at all. But even most of
the sick ones do well, he said: “The vast majority need treatment,
they’re treated, they go home,” he said.

More detailed reports are appearing, detailing the clinical presentation
and the clinical course of these children. An
[article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767209)
published this month in JAMA looked at 58 children hospitalized in
England. The median age was 9 years old. All of the children had
persistent fevers, ranging from 3 to 19 days, and 45 of them had
evidence of current or past Covid-19 infection.

Dr. Michael Levin, who is professor of international child health at
Imperial College London, who was the senior author on the study, said
that the children fall into three groups. Most concerning are the group
with critical illness, with shock and multi-organ failure, particularly
affecting the heart muscle.

Then there is a group of children who don’t require intensive care, but
meet criteria for Kawasaki disease, a different illness with a
constellation of similar clinical features, including fever, rash,
conjunctivitis, red swollen hands and feet, and swollen lymph nodes.

And finally, he said, there is a much larger group of children with
persistent fever who may have one or two of those features, but whose
laboratory results indicate a high degree of inflammation.

Gastrointestinal symptoms were common, with half of the children in the
study having abdominal pain, and many with vomiting and diarrhea. Thirty
of the 58 had rashes, 26 had conjunctivitis. Some had sore throats,
headaches, red swollen hands and feet, swollen lymph nodes. And their
blood tests showed elevated markers of inflammation.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Shust in New York was also struck, she said, by how many of the
children there were coming in with gastrointestinal symptoms. “It’s
really pretty severe and prolonged abdominal pain,” she said, “not just,
‘I have a tummy ache after I ate dinner,’” she said.

Some children with heart problems may complain of chest pain, Dr. Shust
said, or they may have cardiac dysfunction discovered as they are
checked for other symptoms. In Kawasaki disease, cardiac complications
tend to come late, after the acute illness, but in MIS-C, she said,
there may be problems early on.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

Depending on their clinical appearance and the severity of their
illness, these children are being treated in a variety of ways. The
sickest ones require intensive care support and ventilators. Many
receive IV immunoglobulin, which is the treatment for Kawasaki disease,
and others are getting immunomodulating drugs which affect the so-called
“cytokine storm,” the severe immune reaction that causes many of the
symptoms.

“The good news is that even the children who have had pretty severe
dysfunction seem to be turning around pretty quickly,” Dr. Shust said.
“We’re following those kids really closely with EKGs and serial
echocardiograms; we don’t know what the natural history of this syndrome
will be.”

Of the 58 children in the British study, 29 developed shock and needed
I.C.U. care, and 23 of those ended up needing time on a ventilator.
Eight developed abnormalities of their coronary arteries. Many of them
got immunoglobulin and corticosteroids, and a few got the immune
modulator drugs.

Another
[article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.26224),
published last week by researchers at Mount Sinai, looked at 15 children
in New York City, and noted a disproportionate burden of disease in
Hispanic and African-American children.

Dr. Usha Ramachandran, an associate professor of pediatrics at Rutgers
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, who provides primary care to
patients at Eric B. Chandler Health Center in New Brunswick, said that
parents ask her, “‘You don’t think it’s that bad thing we’re hearing
about on TV that kids are getting?’”

If children aren’t sick enough to get blood tests done, she has been
following up closely with phone calls and telehealth visits. “Luckily,
I’ve been able to say, I don’t think so, he doesn’t have the fever,
but we’re going to watch him closely, and if things take a turn for the
worse, call me right back, take him to the emergency room.”

“Hospitals and E.R.s are set up to look for this and pick up on this
diagnosis and triage the kids appropriately,” Dr. Kahn said, “Everyone’s
on heightened alert.”

Dr. Levin said, “While it is a serious disease, it is very rare.” He
said that the many children in New York City who have contracted the
coronavirus, most will have had very mild or asymptomatic infections and
only a small proportion will end up with multisystem inflammatory
syndrome.

“Don’t panic, but if your child has a prolonged fever and these
symptoms, it’s worth calling your pediatrician,” Dr. Shust said.
“Parents know better than anyone else if a kid is not acting right.”
