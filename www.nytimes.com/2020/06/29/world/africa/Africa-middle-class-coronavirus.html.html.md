# Coronavirus Is Battering Africa’s Growing Middle Class

</div>

From Kenya to Nigeria, South Africa to Rwanda, the pandemic is
decimating the livelihoods of the once-stable workers who were helping
to drive Africa’s economic expansion.

NAIROBI, Kenya — James Gichina started out 15 years ago as a driver
shuttling travelers from the airport, worked his way up to safari guide,
and with the help of some bank loans, bought two minivans of his own to
ferry vacationers around.

His clients were, as he is, members of Africa’s growing middle class —
bankers from Nigeria, tech entrepreneurs from South Africa, and fellow
Kenyans who could finally afford trips to enjoy their own country’s
beaches and wildlife preserves.

But when the coronavirus pandemic cratered the tourist industry and the
economy, Mr. Gichina removed the seats from his minibus and started
using it to hawk eggs and vegetables. With what he now earns, he said,
he can barely afford to pay rent, buy food or send his 9-year-old son to
school.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“We have been working hard to build better lives,” Mr. Gichina, 35, said
of his colleagues in the tourist sector. Now, he said, “We have
nothing.”

As the [coronavirus surges in many countries in
Africa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/africa/coronavirus-africa.html),
it is threatening to push as many as 58 million people in the region
into extreme poverty, [experts at the World Bank
say](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/607011589560173878/pdf/How-Much-Will-Poverty-Rise-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-in-2020.pdf).
But beyond the devastating consequences for the continent’s most
vulnerable people, the pandemic is also whittling away at one of
Africa’s signature achievements: the growth of its middle class.

For the last decade, Africa’s middle class has been pivotal to the
educational, political and economic development across the continent.
New business owners and entrepreneurs have created jobs that, in turn,
gave others a leg up as well.

Educated, tech-savvy families and young people with money to spare have
fed the demand for consumer goods, called for [democratic
reforms](https://afrobarometer.org/sites/default/files/publications/Working%20paper/Afropaperno150.pdf),
expanded the talent pool at all levels of society, and pushed for
high-quality schools and health care.

About 170 million out of Africa’s 1.3 billion people are now classified
as middle class. But about eight million of them could be thrust into
poverty because of the coronavirus and its economic fallout, according
to World Data Lab, a research organization.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s a setback that may be felt for years to come.

“The tragedy is that because Africa is not growing fast, this collapse
of the middle class could take several years to recover,” said Homi
Kharas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the co-founder
of the World Data Lab.

Africa’s middle class [tripled over the past 30
years](https://www.afdb.org/fr/news-and-events/africas-middle-class-triples-to-more-than-310m-over-past-30-years-due-to-economic-growth-and-rising-job-culture-reports-afdb-7986),
by some estimates, spurred by job opportunities in sectors like
technology, tourism and manufacturing. But now that the region is facing
its [first recession in 25
years](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2020/04/21/africas-pulse-covid-19-coronavirus-causes-first-recession-in-25-years),
millions of educated people living in urban centers could fall victim to
the extreme income inequality that has defined Africa for
decades.

The rising middle class has been “critical for the future prospects of
African economies as they stimulate long-term growth, social progress,
an inclusive and prosperous society and effective and accountable
governance,” said Landry Signé, author of “Unlocking Africa’s Business
Potential.” The coronavirus “will drastically delay wages and hold back
the dreams of Africa’s middle class,” he
said.

Governments across Africa[responded
differently](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus.html)
to the coronavirus, but Kenya was among those that closed borders,
imposed curfews and restricted movement between counties. In Nairobi,
the capital, malls were once touted as a symbol of a rising middle
class. Now their owners are furloughing employees, shuttering stores and
desperately trying to survive the crisis.

When Kenya first announced lockdown restrictions in March, there was
almost no foot traffic at the Junction mall, where Nairobi’s middle
class had once gravitated to dine and shop in more than 100 stores.

Eastleigh, a bustling area with dozens of malls, hotels, lodges and
banks, was also put under a total lockdown in early May after a jump in
reported coronavirus cases.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Maryan Bashir, who owns three stores in Eastleigh that sell mattresses
and curtains, said traders like her were already worried about whether
they could still get supplies from China as the pandemic began to affect
imports. But the lockdown left them reeling from lack of customers.

It also cut employment. Out of 12 of her co-workers, only three lived
within the locked-down area and could report to work.

The authorities lifted the curfew from Eastleigh in early June, but Ms.
Bashir said it will be a long time before shop owners like her are able
to make the same profits they made before the pandemic.

“The landlords are still asking for rent,” she said, “but if we are not
earning anything, how do we even
pay?”

In Zimbabwe, which has been [in economic free

for years, the pandemic and the ensuing restrictions are threatening the
solvency of those who have built a bridge into the middle class.

For years, Madeline Chiveso’s restaurant in downtown Harare, Zimbabwe,
served professionals such as bankers, journalists and engineers flocking
to work. But as infections rose and the restrictions tightened, there
were no customers to serve. She was forced to close the restaurant.

She used to make $350 a day, and now makes nothing. She is using her
savings to pay bills, she said, jeopardizing her dream of one day owning
her own home.

“The future looks surely uncertain because nobody knows how this would
end,” said Ms. Chiveso, who is 46 and a single mother of two daughters,
both in college.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

What distinguishes the middle class from the poor, said Razia Khan, the
chief economist for Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered
bank, is the ability to earn a steady income. But because of the
pandemic, many more people across Africa are at risk of being “knocked
back into poverty” because of lack of jobs, unemployment benefits or any
social safety net, she said.

The pandemic is also posing a threat to nascent industries supported by
governments in Africa in recent years to boost the number of
middle-income earners.

Rwanda, which announced aspirations to become a middle-income nation by
2035, [supported the local textile and fashion
industries](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/world/africa/east-africa-rwanda-used-clothing.html)
to limit imports of used clothing from the United States, and boost
manufacturing.

Matthew Rugamba, 30, created House of Tayo in 2011, building it into one
of the leading brands in [Rwanda’s burgeoning fashion
scene](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/travel/kigali-rwanda-fashion-designers.html).
Mr. Rugamba gained enough notice for his designs to be worn in
Hollywood, [at the premiere of the movie “Black
Panther.”](https://www.instagram.com/p/BevpsRVjGWH/?utm_source=ig_embed)

But as Rwanda enforced one of the toughest lockdowns in Africa, Mr.
Rugamba’s store shut its doors, only to open several weeks later to
almost no customers. Even though he’s pivoted to making masks and
introduced a delivery service, business has not been the same.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“We were at a point where people value the work that we do,” Mr. Rugamba
said. But with the pandemic, he said, “you go through periods where you
are worried that this is something that I have invested nine years of my
life in, and is it going to be there tomorrow?”

More governments are offering financial support and tax breaks to
businesses, and urging proprietors to hold onto their employees even if
they reduce production or services, said Mr. Kharas, of the World Data
Lab.

Economists like Ms. Khan said that emerging markets in Africa, no
strangers to economic shocks, have proven resilient in the past, and
could come out stronger when the pandemic is over.

But that hope is likely a long way off for Mr. Gichina, the safari guide
now selling eggs to survive. He works for the tour company Bonfire
Adventures, which was founded in 2008 by an entrepreneur named Simon
Kabu, specifically to serve Africa’s growing middle class.

Once a milk delivery guy and conductor on the matatu minibuses used for
transit in Kenya, Mr. Kabu grew up in Kenya’s central highlands to a
mother who was a farmer and a father who was a retired civil
servant.

But by starting a business that served the ever-growing travel needs of
the middle class, he grew Bonfire Adventures into an award-winning tours
company with 10 offices, 200 permanent staff and 300 drivers and guides.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The coronavirus has gutted all that, pushing Mr. Kabu, 45, to lay off
his employees en masse. The only staff members currently working, he
said, are accountants who are processing refunds for customers unable to
travel.

Mr. Gichina hopes business will resume soon — especially as he dreads
losing out on the peak wildebeest migration starting in late June, which
usually draws tourists from across the world.

“The banks are pressuring us a lot,” he said of the urgency to settle
his loans. “They are saying you have to pay,” but, he asked, “where
should we get the money?”
