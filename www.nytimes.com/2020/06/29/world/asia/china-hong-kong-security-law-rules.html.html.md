# New Security Law Gives China Sweeping Powers Over Hong Kong

</div>

The law, approved in Beijing with speed and secrecy and signed off by Xi
Jinping, will tighten the Communist Party’s grip on Hong Kong after last
year’s protests.

China unveiled a [contentious new law for Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/business/hong-kong-security-law-tech.html)
late Tuesday that grants the authorities sweeping powers to crack down
on opposition to Beijing at home and abroad with heavy prison sentences
for vaguely defined political crimes.

The law’s swift approval in Beijing signaled the urgency that the
Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, has [given to expanding his control
over Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/economy/coronavirus-china-economy.html)
to quash pro-democracy protests that evolved last year into an
increasingly confrontational challenge to Chinese rule.

The Hong Kong government issued the text of the legislation at 11 p.m.
on Tuesday, after weeks of unusual secrecy surrounding the drafting of
the law in Beijing. The law took effect immediately, even though the
public was seeing it in full only for the first time.

The text provided a far-reaching blueprint for the authorities and the
courts to suppress the city’s protest movement and for China’s national
security apparatus to pervade many layers of Hong Kong’s society.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Ambiguously worded offenses of separatism, subversion, terrorism and
collusion with foreign countries carry maximum penalties of life
imprisonment. Inducing residents to hate the government in Beijing or
Hong Kong is defined as a serious crime.

A new Committee for Safeguarding National Security will be authorized to
operate in total secrecy and be shielded from legal challenges. Its
officials will be given the task of scrutinizing schools, corporations,
nongovernmental organizations, news companies, and foreigners living in
Hong Kong and abroad.

“It’s meant to suppress and oppress, and to frighten and intimidate Hong
Kongers,” Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said. “And they just
might succeed in that.”

Other key details in the law include:

  - The law takes direct aim at the antigovernment protesters’ strategy
    of disruption. Last year, demonstrators [paralyzed the
    airport](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/business/hong-kong-economy-airport-protests.html)
    briefly, [vandalized the subway
    system](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/world/asia/hong-kong-protesters-masks-violence.html)
    and attacked police stations and surrounded government buildings.
    The law describes activities such as damaging government buildings
    and sabotaging public transportation as acts of subversion and
    terrorism, punishable with lengthy jail terms.

  - It allows Beijing to seize broad control in security cases,
    especially during crises. Suspects in security cases will mostly be
    held without bail. Trials involving state secrets could be closed to
    the media and the public, with few rights to trial by jury and with
    only the verdicts announced. Suspects in important cases can be sent
    to face trial in mainland China, where courts are opaque and often
    harsh.

  - The law focuses heavily on the perceived role of foreigners in Hong
    Kong’s unrest. It will impose harsh penalties on anyone who urges
    foreign countries to criticize or impose sanctions on the
    government. It targets former Hong Kong residents who have acquired
    foreign passports and are outspoken against
    the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>government, empowering
    officials to freeze their assets and impose fines.

The Chinese legislature approved the law a day before July 1, the
politically charged anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China in
1997, which regularly draws pro-democracy protests. On the anniversary
last year, a huge, peaceful demonstration gave way to violence when a
small group of activists [broke into Hong Kong’s
legislature](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/world/asia/china-hong-kong-protest.html),
smashing glass walls and spray-painting slogans on walls.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Those who have stirred up trouble and broken this type of law in the
past will hopefully watch themselves in the future,” Tam Yiu-chung, Hong
Kong’s representative to the legislative group in China that reviewed
the law,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>said in a television
interview. “If they continue to defy the law, they will bear the
consequences.”

The unanimous vote on Tuesday by the National People’s Congress Standing
Committee, an elite arm of China’s party-controlled legislature, came
less than two weeks after the lawmakers [first formally considered the
legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law.html)

Breaking from normal procedure, the committee did not release a draft of
the law for public comment. Hong Kong’s activists, legal scholars and
officials were left to debate or defend the bill based on details
released by China’s state news media earlier this month.

“The fact that the Chinese authorities have now passed this law without
the people of Hong Kong being able to see it tells you a lot about their
intentions,” said Joshua Rosenzweig, the head of Amnesty International’s
China team. “Their aim is to govern Hong Kong through fear from this
point forward.”

At least two groups that have called for Hong Kong to become an
independent state said they would stop operating in the city. Such
groups remain in the minority in Hong Kong, but [have drawn government
scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/world/asia/hong-kong-party-ban-andy-chan.html).
Activists are also worried that the law could target those who
peacefully [call for true autonomy for the
territory](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-communist-party.html),
as opposed to independence.

“They are doing whatever it takes to crack down on dissent and
opposition here. It’s just unthinkable in the year 2020,” said Ms. Mo,
the pro-democracy lawmaker. “This is a huge departure from
civilization.”

Four senior members of Demosisto, a political organization in Hong Kong
that has drawn disaffected young people, announced that they were
quitting the group. They included [Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014
pro-democracy
demonstrations](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/world/asia/joshua-wong-hong-kong-protests.html)
known as the Umbrella Movement. The group later [said it would
disband](https://www.facebook.com/demosisto/posts/1464823310393153).

“From now on,
[\#Hongkong](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hongkong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1277794270393643008%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fscoop.nyt.net%2Fui%2Foakarticle%2F100000007213051%2Fweb%2FdqV1egMG0LchnIJbEkRn&src=hashtag_click)
enters a new era of reign of terror,” Mr. Wong [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1277794270393643008).<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Announcing his decision to leave Demosisto in a post on Facebook,
he said: “I will continue to hold fast to my home — Hong Kong, until
they silence and obliterate me from this land.”

Administrators of chat groups used by protesters on Telegram, a popular
app, sent messages urging users not to panic but also said that they
should purge their devices of data, contacts and photos should they join
any future protests.

The chill spread even to some businesses that have [openly supported the
democracy
movement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-yellow-blue.html).
The Lung Mun Cafe, a well-known Cantonese diner that provided free meals
to student protesters last year, said on Tuesday that it would no longer
be affiliated with the yellow economy, so named because of the color of
umbrellas that demonstrators once used to defend themselves against
streams of tear gas.

“Lung Mun Cafe has more or less accompanied the people of Hong Kong on

The city’s police force has moved quickly to stop peaceful protests
against the security law in recent days, arresting dozens of people,
including [53 demonstrators on
Sunday](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1534552-20200628.htm).
On Tuesday, a small group of protesters gathered in a luxury mall in
Central, the main downtown district, and chanted: “We will fight till
our last breath\!”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

A few dozen pro-Beijing supporters wearing white shirts and blue caps
gathered in a park to celebrate the passage of the law. They celebrated
by waving large Chinese flags as they uncorked bottles of sparkling wine
and drank from plastic cups.

The police have [denied
applications](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1534408-20200627.htm)
from three groups to hold protest marches on Wednesday, the anniversary
of the handover, making it the first time the authorities have refused
to allow a demonstration on that date. Some opposition lawmakers and
democracy advocates have urged people to take to the streets despite the
ban.

“The July 1 march tomorrow will show that we will absolutely not accept
this evil national security law,” Wu Chi-wai, a pro-democracy lawmaker,
said on Tuesday. “Even if they try to crush us, we will use all kinds of
ways and methods to ensure that Hong Kong people’s voices and opinions
can be expressed.”
