# Australia Spending Nearly $1 Billion on Cyberdefense as China Tensions Rise

Officials promised to recruit at least 500 cyberspies and build on the
country’s offensive capabilities to take the online battle overseas.

SYDNEY, Australia — Confronting a surge of cyberattacks attributed to
the Chinese government, Australia moved to bolster its defenses on
Tuesday, promising to recruit at least 500 cyberspies and build on its
ability to take the battle overseas.

The investment of 1.35 billion Australian dollars ($930 million) over
the next decade is the largest the country has ever made in cyberweapons
and defenses.

It follows what Prime Minister Scott Morrison has described as a sharp
increase in the frequency, scale and sophistication of online attacks —
and, more broadly, a [steady deterioration in
relations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/world/australia/politician-home-raid-china-influence.html)
between Australia and China.

“The federal government’s top priority is protecting our nation’s
economy, national security and sovereignty,” Mr. Morrison said Tuesday.
“Malicious cyberactivity undermines that.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new initiative points to growing frustration in Australia with what
current and former intelligence officials have described as a
relentless, increasingly [aggressive campaign by
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/world/australia/australia-china.html)
to spy on, disrupt and threaten the country’s government, vital
infrastructure and most important industries.

The full details of attacks that appear to have come from China are
still mostly hidden — Australian officials remain wary of provoking
Beijing by naming and shaming culprits — but the public record now
includes several examples of elaborate hacking that has less to do with
theft for profit than growing aggression against a rival government.

In January of last year, for example, hackers [found their way into the
computer
systems](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/world/australia/cyberattack-parliament-hack.html)
of the Australian Parliament. A year before that, security experts said
that tools commonly used by Chinese hackers had been deployed in attacks
on [Australia’s Defense
Department](https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/tens-of-thousands-of-australian-firms-could-be-affected-by-chinese-hack-top-official-20181221-p50nl0.html)
and [the Australian National
University](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/chinese-hackers-breach-anu-putting-national-security-at-risk-20180706-p4zq0q.html).

Two weeks ago, Australian officials said a wide range of political and
private-sector organizations had come under attack by a “sophisticated
state-based cyberactor” — a reference that most cybersecurity experts
took to mean China.

And there are hints that the tools being deployed are increasingly
ambitious and dangerous.

In one attack earlier this year, hackers used a compromised email
account from the Indonesian Embassy in Australia to send a Word document
to a staff member in the office of the top leader in the state of
Western Australia.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The attachment contained an invisible cyberattack tool called Aria-body,
which had never been detected before and had alarming new capabilities.
It allowed hackers to remotely take over a computer, to copy, delete or
create files, and to carry out extensive searches of the device.

A cybersecurity company in Israel [later
linked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/world/asia/china-hacking-military-aria.html)
Aria-body to a group of hackers, called Naikon, that has been traced to
the Chinese military.

Peter Jennings, a former defense and intelligence official who heads the
Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said Beijing had leapfrogged
other countries in its cyberabilities and the frequency of its attacks.

“It’s just reaching unprecedented heights of activity,” he said. “Yes,
it’s true countries do spy on each other; the problem here is the
all-pervasive nature of what China is doing. In many ways, big and
small, there are hints of bullying and coercion.”

The attacks, while constant, have become more troublesome since
Australia angered China by [calling for an international
inquiry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/world/australia/coronavirus-china-inquiry.html)
into the roots of the coronavirus outbreak. In Beijing, any questioning
of [the official
narrative](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/world/asia/coronavirus-china-narrative.html)
that China defeated the virus as quickly as possible is seen as an
insult.

The rising tensions between the two countries have already affected
trade — with China cutting imports of barley and beef — and neither
country has made a public effort to reconcile. China has also tried to
turn the cyberspying accusations [back on
Australia](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-29/chinese-state-media-says-australia-is-stepping-up-spy-activities/12402032?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_content=&utm_campaign=%5bnews_sfmc_newsmail_pm_df_!n1%5d%3a8935&user_id=fd273ea9ec95db56c7d3affcb610d4d0e8fcb4982c0e24bcb107bc2167382d75&WT.tsrc=email&WT.mc_id=Email%7c%5bnews_sfmc_newsmail_pm_df_!n1%5d%7c8935ABCNewsmail_topstories_articlelink),
with its state media claiming that Beijing disrupted an Australian
operation two years ago.

The response on the cyberfront that Australia outlined on Tuesday starts
with personnel. Roughly a third of the funding will go toward hiring
hundreds of cybersecurity experts to study and share information about
the evolution of emerging threats, and to create countermeasures of
their own.

The Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Cyber Security
Center will build up their capacity to defend against attacks and their
connections with the companies that run the country’s digital networks.

The defense minister, Senator Linda Reynolds, said in a statement that
the investment aimed to create a rapid-response process that would
“prevent malicious cyberactivity from reaching millions of Australians
by blocking known malicious websites and computer viruses at speed.”

Mr. Jennings said the investment was substantial and needed. He added
that it would most likely be a down payment.

“The need for more investment in cybersecurity, both defense and
offense, will keep growing,” he said. “This won’t be the last
investment, I’m sure.”
