# Refusing to Wear a Mask Is Like Driving Drunk

Republicans talk a good game about “personal responsibility.” It’s time
for President Trump’s supporters to actually display some.

As the coronavirus rages out of control across much of the United
States, Americans are acting curiously helpless.

If we had been this passive in 1776, we would still be part of Britain.
Yet even as we prepare to celebrate the Fourth of July, we don’t seem
willing to assert independence from a virus that in four months has
killed more Americans than the Korean, Vietnam, Gulf, Afghanistan and
Iraq wars did over 70 years.

Here’s the simplest of steps we could take: Wear a [face
mask](https://www.nytimes.com/article/which-stores-require-masks.html).

In the United States, mask-wearing lags, particularly [among
men](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-face-masks-surveys.html),
compared with some other countries. A poll
[finds](https://psyarxiv.com/tg7vz) that many American men regard the
wearing of face masks as “a sign of weakness,” and President Trump’s
refusal to wear them has suggested that he perceives that masks are for
wimps.

[Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html)
may now be switching gears, for he
[told](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2020/07/01/im-all-for-masks-trump-says-in-change-of-tune/#2751da3c2122)
Fox Business on Wednesday that he’s “all for
[masks](https://www.nytimes.com/article/which-stores-require-masks.html)”
and would wear one if he were “in a tight situation with people.” He
shouldn’t waste time: He should tweet a photo of himself in a mask and
call on supporters to wear masks as well. Refusing to cover one’s face
is reckless, selfish behavior that imperils the economy and can kill or
endanger innocent people.

[A
review](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31142-9/fulltext#%20)
of 172 studies in The Lancet medical journal found that “face mask use
could result in a large reduction in risk of infection.” [An
article](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818)
in Health Affairs found that state mask mandates, which cover about half
the population, may have averted more than 230,000 coronavirus
infections.

For one study this year,
[reported](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341779100_Surgical_mask_partition_reduces_the_risk_of_non-contact_transmission_in_a_golden_Syrian_hamster_model_for_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19)
in Clinical Infectious Diseases, researchers placed hamsters with the
coronavirus in cages next to those without the virus, and found that
when surgical masks were used as a barrier between the cages infections
plunged by more than half.

Or take a lesson from East Asian countries, where mask-wearing is more
common as a sign of courtesy, that have managed to contain the virus.
[Dr. Kwok-Yung
Yuen](http://www.microbiology.hku.hk/02_HKU_Staff_Prof_KY_Yuen.html), an
infectious diseases specialist at the University of Hong Kong, told me
that a crucial reason for Hong Kong’s success against Covid-19 (less
than [one death per
million](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china-hong-kong-sar/)
inhabitants, compared with [385 per
million](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-covid-deaths-per-million)
in the United States) is that 97 percent of Hong Kong residents wear
masks.

“Masking is a sign of responsible civility,” Yuen told me.

Hong Kong, like some Asian countries, distributes masks free. The United
States should do the same, for the cost is negligible compared with
hospitalization.

A University of Washington computer model
[suggests](http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/new-ihme-covid-19-model-projects-nearly-180000-us-deaths)
that 33,000 American lives could be saved from Covid-19 between now and
Oct. 1 if more people wore masks. The implication is that inconsiderate
Americans unwilling to wear them could in the next few months kill
thousands of their neighbors.

“We need to do everything we can to increase mask usage,” said [Kate
Grabowski](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3094/mary-kathryn-grabowski),
an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. But she added: “People
shouldn’t see masks as a silver bullet. They’re not going to be 100
percent effective at preventing transmission.”

So even with masks, we also need distancing, hand-washing, contact
tracing and bans on large assemblies. I’m also a big believer in more
widespread sewage testing to provide an early warning that the virus is
in the neighborhood.

To be sure, we need more research, and masks vary in effectiveness. N95
respirators work very well — so much so that they make breathing
difficult. Disposable surgical masks are more comfortable though less
protective, and cloth masks are reusable but less effective.

Masks protect your neighbors, but a new Goldman Sachs report finds that
expanding mask mandates could also help the American economy.

“A national face-mask mandate could potentially substitute for renewed
lockdowns that would otherwise subtract nearly 5 percent from G.D.P.,”
Goldman Sachs said. “The economic benefit from a face-mask mandate and
increased face-mask usage could be sizable.”

Republicans seem to be coming around. Vice President Mike Pence earlier
eschewed masks but now
[says](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mandatory-mask-rulestrump-insists-personal-choice/story?id=71519019)
that wearing them “is just a good idea.” Senator Marco Rubio urged,
“Just wear a damn mask.” Representative Liz Cheney tweeted a photo of
her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, wearing one, with the
hashtag \#realmenwearmasks. Good for them\!

But Trump has resisted. Republicans talk a good game about “personal
responsibility,” so it’s time for Trump to display some — and to call on
his supporters to wear masks as well. As we celebrate our independence,
this is how they can show patriotism, protect the economy and save the
lives of their neighbors.

The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, deflects questions
about Trump and masks by insisting that mask-wearing is simply a
“personal choice.”

No, it’s not. Refusing to wear a mask is no more a “personal choice”
than is drinking all evening and then stumbling into your car and
heading down the road. In a time of plague, shunning a face mask is like
driving drunk, putting everyone in your path in danger.
