# Amid Virus Surge, Republicans Abruptly Urge Masks Despite Trump’s Resistance

Masks became a political cause for some in the early months of the
pandemic. A growing set of Republican leaders are suddenly pushing
Americans to wear them.

CHICAGO — Protesters marched on the State Capitol in Texas, holding
signs declaring that masks equal “medical tyranny.” Lawsuits filed in
Florida courts argue that
[mask](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/politics/louie-gohmert-positive-coronavirus-mask.html)
laws violate constitutional rights. President Trump mocked former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for wearing a mask and has rarely worn one
himself.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But even as some conservatives and libertarians have made opposition to
masks a political cause, Republican governors and others in their party
are suddenly trying to send a different message as the pandemic has hit
hard in their home states, ending any notion that the coronavirus is not
a real menace.

Vice President [Mike
Pence](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/pence-covid.html)
has abruptly begun regularly wearing and recommending a mask. Gov. Doug
Ducey of Arizona, facing an uncontrolled outbreak of the coronavirus in
his state, [made a plea this
week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdDE5AhXlV8): “Arm yourself with a
mask.” And Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming [tweeted a
photograph](https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1276591702321647616?s=20)
of her father, the former vice president, wearing a fleece vest, cowboy
hat and pale blue surgical mask covering his face. “Dick Cheney says
WEAR A MASK,” she wrote, adding the hashtag “\#realmenwearmasks.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Tuesday, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican
chairman of the Senate Health Committee, appealed to the president
himself: Wear a mask, Mr. Alexander implored, and end a dangerous
partisan divide over the practice, with some Republicans shunning masks
because Mr. Trump has declined to wear them.

“The stakes are too high,” Mr. Alexander said at a hearing, “for this
political debate about pro-Trump, anti-Trump to continue.”

The sudden overtures have followed a surge in coronavirus outbreaks in
several states, a spike in hospitalizations among younger people and a
growing realization that the virus is once again out of control. But
unlike in the earliest months of the pandemic, some of the hardest-hit
areas are in the South and West.

The new entreaties follow months of misinformation, debate and confusion
about the question of wearing a mask. Early in the pandemic, government
officials instructed Americans not to buy or wear masks. In April, [they
revised that
guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprevent-getting-sick%2Fcloth-face-cover.html),
advising that cloth face coverings were recommended.

“Aristotle always said, a long time ago, that when you put a message on
a blank slate, that first message is critical,” Dr. Robert Redfield, the
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an
interview on Tuesday. “When you want to rechannel a message, it’s always
a problem.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

State and local officials have carved out their own rules along the way,
making masks mandatory in some places and a mere suggestion in others.

Resistance to masks began with Mr. Trump, who, as the C.D.C. urged
Americans to wear face coverings, stressed that the measure was
voluntary, and said, “[I don’t think I’m going to be doing
it](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007070943/trump-mask-coronavirus.html).”

The president has continued to resist wearing a mask and views it as a
“personal choice,” [his spokeswoman
said](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mandatory-mask-rulestrump-insists-personal-choice/story?id=71519019)
on Monday, a stance that has led many of his supporters to refuse to
wear one, even in cities and businesses where they are required. Mr.
Trump has repeatedly downplayed the severity and danger of the virus,
and some of his supporters have responded with similar doubts. On
Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed to change his position amid the shifting
public messages from Republicans. “I’m all for masks. I think masks are
good,” he told Fox Business in an interview.

“The problem there is that the issue has become a political issue and
people have lost sight of the fact that the enemy is the virus,” said
Dr. David Persse, the health authority at the Houston Health Department.
“People have decided that the enemy is some sort of a political
agenda.”

Initially, many Republicans had followed Mr. Trump’s lead. But the
recent chorus of encouragement on mask-wearing has come from all
directions: on the Senate floor and on social media, from Republicans
who are no longer in office and from those whose states are experiencing
an alarming uptick in coronavirus cases.

On Monday, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia posted a selfie wearing a mask
decorated with the University of Georgia’s bulldog mascot. “Wear your
mask, Georgia — and go Dawgs\!” he wrote.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who regularly wears a mask in
public, said in Washington this week that there must be “no stigma”
about wearing masks. “Wearing simple face coverings is not about
protecting ourselves, it is about protecting everyone we encounter,” he
said.

Dennis Bonnen, the Republican speaker of the Texas House of
Representatives, has been outspoken on the necessity of mask-wearing in
order to reopen the state’s economy.

“It’s time to stand up to the mask naysayers who speak loudly but act
irresponsibly,” [he said in a
statement](https://twitter.com/RepDennisBonnen/status/1275186700306853889)
last week.

They have echoed messages from some other Republicans, including Gov.
Larry Hogan of Maryland and Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, who routinely wear
them and urge their constituents to do the same. Democratic officials
have overwhelmingly endorsed face masks, arguing for months that they
are a valuable tool in slowing the spread of the virus, particularly
indoors and in crowded places where social distancing is impossible.

“We have been trying to work against the headwinds of partisanship on
face masks,” Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, said in an
interview on Wednesday.

Most of the public does not appear to have an aversion to masks. [In a
New York Times/Siena College
poll](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/trump-biden-poll-nyt-upshot-siena-college.html)
published last week, 54 percent of people said they always wear a mask
when they expect to be in proximity to other people, while another 22
percent said they usually wear a mask. Just 22 percent said they rarely
or never wear a mask.

But pleas to wear masks have not always been received warmly by
constituents. Mr. DeWine said he had struggled to convince the public of
the usefulness of masks in fighting the spread of a highly contagious
virus — in part because the C.D.C. has been inconsistent in its
guidance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We certainly were hindered by some of the health messages coming out
from C.D.C. and others,” Mr. DeWine said. “We had mixed messages that
were not helpful.”

In the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, the directive from
administration officials, governors and mayors was clear: There is no
need for most people to wear masks.

By the start of February, the C.D.C. issued its first formal guidance on
its website, saying that the agency “does not currently recommend the
use of face masks among the general public.”

“Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS\!” Jerome M. Adams, the U.S.
surgeon general, [tweeted later that
month](https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160?s=20).

At that time, the mask-wearing guidance rested on several points: that
medical masks needed to be reserved for medical workers, that they may
offer a false sense of security, that they are often improperly worn
and, most important, that they likely would not offer much protection
from the virus.

But evidence grew in February and March that the virus was [being spread
by asymptomatic
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/health/coronavirus-symptoms-germany.html),
and in April, the C.D.C. changed course, advising that cloth face
coverings were recommended.

“The reality was that it was based on data and science,” Dr. Redfield
said on Tuesday, adding that as soon as the agency had “significant”
evidence that asymptomatic transmission was occurring, it moved to
recommend face coverings.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We believe that wearing a face covering is a critically important
tool,” he said. “It’s our best weapon to intervene with human-to-human
transmission right
now.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

At the same time, a small but vocal opposition to masks was emerging.

Groups that fiercely opposed restrictions, including stay-at-home orders
and closures of businesses and schools, began holding rallies in state
capitals in April, organizing on Facebook and flouting directives from
health officials to observe social distancing and wear masks.

One group, passing itself off as a government entity called the Freedom
to Breathe Agency, [sold fraudulent cards on the
internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/fake-face-mask-exemption-card-coronavirus.html)
that allowed users to claim a medical exemption to masks.

Some of the anti-mask fury was directed at businesses that required
masks to enter. Bystanders captured cellphone videos of angry mask
skeptics hurling produce in the aisles of grocery stores before storming
out. Employees wearily endured verbal harangues from customers.

Some businesses have lost patience.

Hugo’s Tacos, a taqueria in Los Angeles, said this week that it was
temporarily closing its two locations after a barrage of attacks from
customers who refused to wear masks.

“Staff have been harassed, called names, and had objects and liquids
thrown at them,” [a message on its website
says](https://www.hugostacos.com/). “A mask isn’t symbolic of anything
other than our desire to keep our staff healthy.”

The message adds, “Thank you to the majority of our guests who are
always respectful and
kind.”

In recent days, as new coronavirus cases climbed, state and local
officials have anxiously looked for ways to tamp down outbreaks. They
have frequently turned to the same tool: face masks.

Governor Newsom, eyeing an explosion of cases in California, instituted
mandatory masking statewide on June 18. In Jacksonville, Fla., where the
Republican convention is expected to be held in August, [city officials
issued an
order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/rnc-masks-convention.html)
on Monday making masks mandatory indoors, joining scores of cities
across the country.

Face masks will soon be mandated in at least 19 states, including New
York, Illinois, Massachusetts and Kansas, whose Democratic governor,
Laura Kelly, on Monday said she would [issue an executive
order](https://governor.kansas.gov/governor-laura-kelly-announces-masks-must-be-worn-statewide/)
requiring their use in public.

Ms. Kelly said that as cases continue to rise in that state, a mask
mandate offered the best route to maintaining public safety while
allowing businesses to remain open.

“I do expect that there will be some who will be outraged by this
order,” she acknowledged at a news conference.

Some Republicans in Kansas immediately registered opposition, arguing
against a uniform policy for a state with both urban and suburban areas
as well as vast rural expanses, even though the virus is highly
contagious and has affected both densely and sparsely populated
communities.

“A lot of people take their liberty quite seriously — they prefer to
have education and make informed decisions, as opposed to a mandate,”
said Mike Kuckelman, the chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. “This
just seems heavy-handed and unnecessary for large portions of our
state.”

In Texas churches last weekend, the tension among conservatives was
evident. At a Sunday service in Dallas, Mr. Pence said masks were “a
good idea” and pointedly wore one.

But the night before, at a megachurch in Houston, a well-known pastor,
Ed Young, received applause from the socially distanced congregation
after declaring that masks should be voluntary.

“You can wear a mask, or you can not wear a mask,” he said. “Oh my
goodness, tell everybody, you have to wear a mask? We don’t do business
that
way.”

In Palm Beach County, Fla., local officials debated last week whether to
adopt an indoor mask mandate and heard testimony from residents who were
deeply opposed to the measure.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Commissioner Melissa McKinlay said the commenters, even as their
[speeches ricocheted around social
media](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/06/24/mask-mandate-florida-anger-erupts-coronavirus-vpx.cnn),
did not reflect the opinion of most residents. The mandate unanimously
passed.

“The fact that we were spending time — so much time — debating whether
or not to wear a mask takes away time from when we should be debating
getting grants to our small businesses or getting testing done,” she
said. “Geez, pick your battle. My battle is to keep people safe. I
shouldn’t have to argue about whether or not to put a mask on.”
