Judging when to tighten, or loosen, the local economy has become the
world’s most consequential guessing game, and each policymaker has his
or her own instincts and benchmarks. The point when hospitals reach 70
percent capacity is a red flag, for instance; so are upticks in
coronavirus case counts and deaths.

But as the governors of states like Florida, California and Texas have
learned in recent days, such benchmarks make for a poor alarm system.
Once the coronavirus finds an opening in the population, it gains a
two-week head start on health officials, circulating and multiplying
swiftly before its re-emergence becomes apparent at hospitals, testing
clinics and elsewhere.

Now, an international team of scientists has developed a model — or, at
minimum, the template for a model — that could predict outbreaks about
two weeks before they occur, in time to put effective containment
measures in place.

In [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00756) posted on Thursday on
arXiv.org, the team, led by Mauricio Santillana and Nicole Kogan of
Harvard, presented an algorithm that registered danger 14 days or more
before case counts begin to increase. The system uses real-time
monitoring of Twitter, Google searches and mobility data from
smartphones, among other data streams.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The algorithm, the researchers write, could function “as a thermostat,
in a cooling or heating system, to guide intermittent activation or
relaxation of public health interventions” — that is, a smoother, safer
reopening.

“In most infectious-disease modeling, you project different scenarios
based on assumptions made up front,” said Dr. Santillana, director of
the Machine Intelligence Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital and an
assistant professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Harvard. “What
we’re doing here is observing, without making assumptions. The
difference is that our methods are responsive to immediate changes in
behavior and we can incorporate those.”

Outside experts who were shown the new analysis, which has not yet been
peer reviewed, said it demonstrated the increasing value of real-time
data, like social media, in improving existing
models.

The study shows “that alternative, next-gen data sources may provide
early signals of rising Covid-19 prevalence,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers,
a biologist and statistician at the University of Texas, Austin.
“Particularly if confirmed case counts are lagged by delays in seeking
treatment and obtaining test results.”

The use of real-time data analysis to gauge disease progression goes
back at least to 2008, when engineers at Google began estimating doctor
visits for the flu by tracking search trends for words like “feeling
exhausted,” “joints aching,” “Tamiflu dosage” and many others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Google Flu Trends algorithm, as it is known, performed poorly. For
instance, it continually overestimated doctor visits, later evaluations
found, because of limitations of the data and the influence of outside
factors such as media attention, which can [drive up
searches](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12016837/ssrn-id2408560_2.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
that are unrelated to actual illness.

Since then, researchers have made multiple adjustments to this approach,
combining Google searches with other kinds of data. Teams at
Carnegie-Mellon University, University College London and the University
of Texas, among others, have models incorporating some real-time data
analysis.

“We know that no single data stream is useful in isolation,” said Madhav
Marathe, a computer scientist at the University of Virginia. “The
contribution of this new paper is that they have a good, wide variety of
streams.”

In the new paper, the team analyzed real-time data from four sources, in
addition to Google: Covid-related Twitter posts, geotagged for location;
doctors’ searches on a physician platform called UpToDate; anonymous
mobility data from smartphones; and readings from the Kinsa Smart
Thermometer, which uploads to an app. It integrated those data streams
with a sophisticated prediction model developed at Northeastern
University, based on how people move and interact in communities.

The team tested the predictive value of trends in the data stream by
looking at how each correlated with case counts and deaths over March
and April, in each state.

In New York, for instance, a sharp uptrend in Covid-related Twitter
posts began more than a week before case counts exploded in mid-March;
relevant Google searches and Kinsa measures spiked several days
beforehand.

The team combined all its data sources, in effect weighting each
according to how strongly it was correlated to a coming increase in
cases. This “harmonized” algorithm anticipated outbreaks by 21 days, on
average, the researchers found.

Looking ahead, it predicts that Nebraska and New Hampshire are likely to
see cases increase in the coming weeks if no further measures are taken,
despite case counts being currently
flat.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“I think we can expect to see at least a week or more of advanced
warning, conservatively, taking into account that the epidemic is
continually changing,” Dr. Santillana said. His co-authors included
scientists from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Stanford
University; and the University of Salzburg, as well as Northeastern.

He added: “And we don’t see this data as replacing traditional
surveillance but confirming it. It’s the kind of information that can
enable decision makers to say, ‘Let’s not wait one more week, let’s act
now.’”

For all its appeal, big-data analytics cannot anticipate sudden changes
in mass behavior any better than other, traditional models can, experts
said. There is no algorithm that might have predicted the nationwide
protests in the wake of George Floyd’s killing, for instance — mass
gatherings that may have seeded new outbreaks, despite precautions taken
by protesters.

Social media and search engines also can become less sensitive with
time; the more familiar with a pathogen people become, the less they
will search with selected key words.

Public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which also consults real-time data from social media and
other sources, have not made such algorithms central to their forecasts.

“This is extremely valuable data for us to have,” said Shweta Bansal, a
biologist at Georgetown University. “But I wouldn’t want to go into the
forecasting business on this; the harm that can be done is quite severe.
We need to see such models verified and validated over time.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Given the persistent and repeating challenges of the coronavirus and the
inadequacy of the current public health infrastructure, that seems
likely to happen, most experts said. There is an urgent need, and there
is no lack of data.

“What we’ve looked at is what we think are the best available data
streams,” Dr. Santillana said. “We’d be eager to see what Amazon could
give us, or Netflix.”
