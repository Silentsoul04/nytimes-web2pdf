He helped build his hometown for four decades. He also enjoyed fixing
things and taking care of loved ones. He had tested positive for the
coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}

A confident-looking young man with a grin and a hard hat stands astride
a steel beam on the 45th floor of a skyscraper overlooking Chicago ---
without a tether.

It was Gregori V. Armstrong's favorite photograph of himself. ``Real
ironwork before harnesses and bucket lifts,'' he said proudly in a
Facebook posting of the picture.

Mr. Armstrong was an ironworker who helped build the city's
infrastructure for four decades. When he started out in the 1970s, his
daughter, Leslie Armstrong, said in an interview, ``They didn't have all
this fancy equipment, and he went up willy-nilly.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/09/obituaries/04Armstrong4-print/merlin_174153492_bcb05f1a-7b5c-4d11-b45f-9fbeb532346a-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Once, while working on a bridge, he fell into the Chicago River and
broke his arms.

``We always joked that he had nine lives,'' Ms. Armstrong said. ``He was
around all this machinery all the time, so it was easy to put himself in
danger.''

One of his less dangerous jobs was helping to raise Chicago's Christmas
tree in Daley Plaza, where it used to be displayed. When he needed to
ease off physically demanding work, he became a building inspector for
the city.

The
\href{https://graphics.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus-lives-lost/blurb.html}{Chicago
Tribune, in an obituary, described him as having impeccable style},
always wearing a hat and shoes that matched his suits.

Mr. Armstrong died on June 3. He was 66. He had asthma, and after
falling ill and testing positive for the coronavirus, went to the
hospital where he suffered a stroke, his daughter said. A few days later
he was removed from life support and died almost immediately.

Gregori Vaughn Armstrong was born on Feb. 25, 1954, in Chicago. His
father, Leslie, worked at the post office, and his mother, Betty, helped
manage a bus company before later becoming a nurse.

On May 30, when his health was failing, Mr. Armstrong went to a downtown
Chicago hospital. But he had to wait several hours before being
admitted, his daughter said, because doctors were inundated with police
officers and demonstrators seeking treatment after
\href{https://news.wttw.com/2020/06/29/371-complaints-lodged-about-chicago-police-response-protests}{unrest
in Chicago} following the May 25
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007159353/george-floyd-arrest-death-video.html}{killing
of George Floyd in police custody} in Minneapolis.

Mr. Armstrong had closely followed the Floyd case, posting numerous
references to its nationwide ramifications on his Facebook page.

``He was just trying to support being Black in America,'' his daughter
said.

When he was growing up, she said, ``Chicago was very segregated, and
there were certain neighborhoods he couldn't go to.'' He once got off at
the wrong bus stop and, when he realized he was where he wasn't wanted,
ran home rather than wait for the next bus.

He devoted most of his time to working and fixing things and to taking
care of the people he loved. He was a single father to his daughter and
raised two young men, Nichrien Banks and Leonard Burton, who had lost
their own fathers.

In addition to them and his daughter, his survivors include his sisters,
Twumwa Grant and Olabisi and Kemba OlaKolade, and nine grandchildren.

Every summer he took his extended family, usually about 40 people, to a
White Sox game. He liked watching the Bears and the Bulls, listening to
the 5,000 jazz albums he inherited from his father (Coltrane was a
favorite) and singing in his church choir.

And he loved family occasions.

``He didn't miss any important events in anyone's life,'' his daughter
said. ``He would always show up at graduations, birthdays and everything
else. Everyone says they can't remember when he wasn't there.''
