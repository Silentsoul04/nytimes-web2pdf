NEW DELHI --- The groom felt ill at the wedding. Days later, he was
dead, and soon more than 100 guests had tested positive for the
coronavirus.

Now, Indian officials have
\href{https://thewire.in/health/patna-how-a-wedding-led-to-a-funeral-and-100-covid-19-positive-cases}{opened
an investigation} into the wedding gathering, which some experts are
calling a superspreader event.

The event was in mid-June, and was attended by more than 300 guests in
the city of Patna, in the northeastern state of Bihar, according to
relatives who were there.

The groom, a software engineer living near New Delhi, had returned to
his home state to prepare for the ceremony, telling friends it would be
``remembered forever'' as a ``corona marriage.''

But a few days before the ceremony, the groom started to vomit and
complained of a headache, according to a relative who spoke on condition
of anonymity because she feared being ostracized.

The relative said the groom's family took him to a hospital in Patna,
but that his parents insisted on continuing with the wedding. He was not
tested for the coronavirus, according to the relative.

But a few days after the ceremony ended, Sri Kumar Ravi, the district
magistrate in Patna, said he received an anonymous call: The groom had
died, possibly from Covid-19, and his parents had cremated the body.

Through an intermediary, the groom's parents declined to comment. The
Wire, an Indian news outlet, quoted the groom's father as denying that
his son had been sick before the wedding. But he said members of his
family, including him, had recently tested positive for the coronavirus.

Mr. Ravi said **** the bride, whose identity has not been disclosed,
tested negative. But he said that more than 100 other guests have tested
positive.

He likened the wedding to ``forcing your guests into mass suicide,''
noting that there was evidence to suggest the groom knew he was sick
before the ceremony but proceeded anyway without informing most people
who attended.

No charges have been filed yet, he said.

infections} and around 18,000 deaths as of Thursday.

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-india-migrants.html}{nationwide
lockdown in late March}, businesses shut and millions of Indians
traveled from cities back to their villages.

Many of those who returned home unknowingly spread the coronavirus to
the countryside,

to fresh outbreaks} in states like Bihar that were initially spared high
case loads.
