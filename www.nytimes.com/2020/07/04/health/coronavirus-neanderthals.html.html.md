A stretch of DNA [linked to
Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/coronavirus-blood-type-genetics.html)
was passed down from Neanderthals 60,000 years ago, according to a new
study.

Scientists don’t yet know why this particular segment increases the
[risk](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/health/coronavirus-risk-factors.html)
of severe illness from the coronavirus. But the [new
findings](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.186296v1.full.pdf+html),
which were posted online on Friday and have not yet been published in a
scientific journal, show how some clues to modern health stem from
ancient history.

“This interbreeding effect that happened 60,000 years ago is still
having an impact today,” said Joshua Akey, a geneticist at Princeton
University who was not involved in the new study.

This piece of the genome, which spans six genes on Chromosome 3, has had
a puzzling journey through human history, the study found. The variant
is now common in Bangladesh, where 63 percent of people carry at least
one copy. Across all of South Asia, almost one-third of people have
inherited the segment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Elsewhere, however, the segment is far less common. Only 8 percent of
Europeans carry it, and just 4 percent have it in East Asia. It is
almost completely absent in Africa.

It’s not clear what evolutionary pattern produced this distribution over
the past 60,000 years. “That’s the $10,000 question,” said Hugo Zeberg,
a geneticist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who was one of the
authors of the new study.

One possibility is that the Neanderthal version is harmful and has been
getting rarer over all. It’s also possible that the segment improved
people’s health in South Asia, perhaps providing a strong immune
response to viruses in the
region.

“One should stress that at this point this is pure speculation,” said
Dr. Zeberg’s co-author, Svante Paabo, the director of the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

Researchers are only beginning to understand why Covid-19 is more
dangerous for some people than others. Older people are more likely to
become severely ill than younger ones. Men are at more risk than women.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Social inequality matters, too. In the United States, Black people are
[far more
likely](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html)
than white people to become severely ill from the coronavirus, for
example, most likely due in part to the country’s history of [systemic
racism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/magazine/racial-disparities-covid-19.html).
It has left Black people with a high rate of chronic diseases such as
diabetes, as well as living conditions and jobs that may increase
exposure to the virus.

Genes play a role as well. Last month, researchers compared people in
Italy and Spain who became very sick with
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/health/coronavirus-risk-factors.html)
to those who had only mild infections. They found two places in the
genome [associated with a greater
risk](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/coronavirus-blood-type-genetics.html).
One is on Chromosome 9 and includes ABO, a gene that determines blood
type. The other is the Neanderthal segment on Chromosome 3.

But these genetic findings are being rapidly updated as more people
infected with the coronavirus are studied. Just last week, an
international group of scientists called the [Covid-19 Host Genetics
Initiative](https://www.covid19hg.org/) released a new set of data
downplaying the risk of blood type. “The jury is still out on ABO,” said
Mark Daly, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School who is a member of the
initiative.

The new data showed an even stronger link between the disease and the
Chromosome 3 segment. People who carry two copies of the variant are
three times more likely to suffer from severe illness than people who do
not.

After the new batch of data came out on Monday, Dr. Zeberg decided to
find out if the Chromosome 3 segment was passed down from Neanderthals.

About 60,000 years ago, some ancestors of modern humans [expanded out of
Africa](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/science/neanderthal-dna-africa.html)
and swept across Europe, Asia and Australia. These people encountered
Neanderthals and interbred. Once Neanderthal DNA entered our gene pool,
it spread down through the generations, long after Neanderthals became
extinct.

Most Neanderthal genes turned out to be harmful to modern humans. They
may have been a burden on people’s health or made it harder to have
children. As a result, Neanderthal genes became rarer, and many
disappeared from our gene pool.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But some genes appear to have provided an evolutionary edge and have
become quite common. In May, Dr. Zeberg, Dr. Paabo and Dr. Janet Kelso,
also of the Max Planck Institute, discovered that one-third of European
women have a [Neanderthal hormone
receptor](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msaa119/5841671).
It is associated with increased fertility and fewer
miscarriages.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Dr. Zeberg knew that other Neanderthal genes that are common today even
[help us fight
viruses](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/science/neanderthal-genes-viruses.html).
When modern humans expanded into Asia and Europe, they may have
encountered new viruses against which Neanderthals had already evolved
defenses. We have held onto those genes ever since.

Dr. Zeberg looked at Chromosome 3 in an online database of Neanderthal
genomes. He found that the version that raises people’s risk of severe
Covid-19 is the same version found in a Neanderthal who lived in Croatia
50,000 years ago. “I texted Svante immediately,” Dr. Zeberg said in an
interview, referring to Dr. Paabo.

Dr. Paabo was on vacation in a cottage in the remote Swedish
countryside. Dr. Zeberg showed up the next day, and they worked day and
night until they posted the study online on Friday.

“It’s the most crazy vacation I’ve ever had in this cottage,” Dr. Paabo
said.

Tony Capra, a geneticist at Vanderbilt University who was not involved
in the study, thought it was plausible that the Neanderthal chunk of DNA
originally provided a benefit — perhaps even against other viruses. “But
that was 40,000 years ago, and here we are now,” he said.

It’s possible that an immune response that worked against ancient
viruses has ended up overreacting against the new coronavirus. People
who develop severe cases of Covid-19 typically do so because their
immune systems launch uncontrolled attacks that end up scarring their
lungs and causing inflammation.

Dr. Paabo said the DNA segment may account in part for why people of
Bangladeshi descent are [dying at a high
rate](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/19/south-asians-in-uk-most-likely-to-die-of-covid-19-study-finds)

It’s an open question whether this Neanderthal segment continues to keep
a strong link to Covid-19 as Dr. Zeberg and other researchers study more
patients. And it may take discoveries of the segment in ancient fossils
of modern humans to understand why it became so common in some places
but not others.

But Dr. Zeberg said that the 60,000-year journey of this chunk of DNA in
our species might help explain why it’s so dangerous today.

“Its evolutionary history may give us some clues,” Dr. Zeberg said.
