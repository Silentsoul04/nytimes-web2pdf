The stretch of six genes seems to increase the risk of severe illness
from the coronavirus.

A stretch of DNA
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/coronavirus-blood-type-genetics.html}{linked
to Covid-19} was passed down from Neanderthals 60,000 years ago,
according to a new study.

Scientists don't yet know why this particular segment increases the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/health/coronavirus-risk-factors.html}{risk}
of severe illness from the coronavirus. But the
\href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.186296v1.full.pdf+html}{new
findings}, which were posted online on Friday and have not yet been
published in a scientific journal, show how some clues to modern health
stem from ancient history.

``This interbreeding effect that happened 60,000 years ago is still
having an impact today,'' said Joshua Akey, a geneticist at Princeton
University who was not involved in the new study.

This piece of the genome, which spans six genes on Chromosome 3, has had
a puzzling journey through human history, the study found. The variant
is now common in Bangladesh, where 63 percent of people carry at least
one copy. Across all of South Asia, almost one-third of people have
inherited the segment.

Elsewhere, however, the segment is far less common. Only 8 percent of
Europeans carry it, and just 4 percent have it in East Asia. It is
almost completely absent in Africa.

It's not clear what evolutionary pattern produced this distribution over
the past 60,000 years. ``That's the \$10,000 question,'' said Hugo
Zeberg, a geneticist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who was one
of the authors of the new study.

One possibility is that the Neanderthal version is harmful and has been
getting rarer over all. It's also possible that the segment improved
people's health in South Asia, perhaps providing a strong immune
response to viruses in the region.

``One should stress that at this point this is pure speculation,'' said
Dr. Zeberg's co-author, Svante Paabo, the director of the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

Researchers are only beginning to understand why Covid-19 is more
dangerous for some people than others. Older people are more likely to
become severely ill than younger ones. Men are at more risk than women.

Social inequality matters, too. In the United States, Black people are
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html}{far
more likely} than white people to become severely ill from the
coronavirus, for example, most likely due in part to the country's
history of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/magazine/racial-disparities-covid-19.html}{systemic
racism}. It has left Black people with a high rate of chronic diseases
such as diabetes, as well as living conditions and jobs that may
increase exposure to the virus.

Genes play a role as well. Last month, researchers compared people in
Italy and Spain who became very sick with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/health/coronavirus-risk-factors.html}{Covid-19}
to those who had only mild infections. They found two places in the
genome
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/coronavirus-blood-type-genetics.html}{associated
with a greater risk}. One is on Chromosome 9 and includes ABO, a gene
that determines blood type. The other is the Neanderthal segment on
Chromosome 3.

But these genetic findings are being rapidly updated as more people
infected with the coronavirus are studied. Just last week, an
international group of scientists called the
\href{https://www.covid19hg.org/}{Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative}
released a new set of data downplaying the risk of blood type. ``The
jury is still out on ABO,'' said Mark Daly, a geneticist at Harvard
Medical School who is a member of the initiative.

The new data showed an even stronger link between the disease and the
Chromosome 3 segment. People who carry two copies of the variant are
three times more likely to suffer from severe illness than people who do
not.

After the new batch of data came out on Monday, Dr. Zeberg decided to
find out if the Chromosome 3 segment was passed down from Neanderthals.

About 60,000 years ago, some ancestors of modern humans
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/science/neanderthal-dna-africa.html}{expanded
out of Africa} and swept across Europe, Asia and Australia. These people
encountered Neanderthals and interbred. Once Neanderthal DNA entered our
gene pool, it spread down through the generations, long after
Neanderthals became extinct.

Most Neanderthal genes turned out to be harmful to modern humans. They
may have been a burden on people's health or made it harder to have
children. As a result, Neanderthal genes became rarer, and many
disappeared from our gene pool.

But some genes appear to have provided an evolutionary edge and have
become quite common. In May, Dr. Zeberg, Dr. Paabo and Dr. Janet Kelso,
also of the Max Planck Institute, discovered that one-third of European
women have a
\href{https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msaa119/5841671}{Neanderthal
hormone receptor}. It is associated with increased fertility and fewer
miscarriages.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but
    she later walked back that statement.}

Dr. Zeberg knew that other Neanderthal genes that are common today even
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/science/neanderthal-genes-viruses.html}{help
us fight viruses}. When modern humans expanded into Asia and Europe,
they may have encountered new viruses against which Neanderthals had
already evolved defenses. We have held onto those genes ever since.

Dr. Zeberg looked at Chromosome 3 in an online database of Neanderthal
genomes. He found that the version that raises people's risk of severe
Covid-19 is the same version found in a Neanderthal who lived in Croatia
50,000 years ago. ``I texted Svante immediately,'' Dr. Zeberg said in an
interview, referring to Dr. Paabo.

Dr. Paabo was on vacation in a cottage in the remote Swedish
countryside. Dr. Zeberg showed up the next day, and they worked day and
night until they posted the study online on Friday.

``It's the most crazy vacation I've ever had in this cottage,'' Dr.
Paabo said.

Tony Capra, a geneticist at Vanderbilt University who was not involved
in the study, thought it was plausible that the Neanderthal chunk of DNA
originally provided a benefit --- perhaps even against other viruses.
``But that was 40,000 years ago, and here we are now,'' he said.

It's possible that an immune response that worked against ancient
viruses has ended up overreacting against the new coronavirus. People
who develop severe cases of Covid-19 typically do so because their
immune systems launch uncontrolled attacks that end up scarring their
lungs and causing inflammation.

Dr. Paabo said the DNA segment may account in part for why people of
Bangladeshi descent are
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/19/south-asians-in-uk-most-likely-to-die-of-covid-19-study-finds}{dying
at a high rate} of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

It's an open question whether this Neanderthal segment continues to keep
a strong link to Covid-19 as Dr. Zeberg and other researchers study more
patients. And it may take discoveries of the segment in ancient fossils
of modern humans to understand why it became so common in some places
but not others.

But Dr. Zeberg said that the 60,000-year journey of this chunk of DNA in
our species might help explain why it's so dangerous today.

``Its evolutionary history may give us some clues,'' Dr. Zeberg said.
