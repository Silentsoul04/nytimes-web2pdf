# Trump Adds to Playbook of Stoking White Fear and Resentment

</div>

With a defense of Confederate flags and a false accusation against a
Black NASCAR driver, Bubba Wallace, President Trump is focusing on
racial and cultural flash points to appeal to his base.

[President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
mounted an explicit defense of the [Confederate
flag](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/politics/pentagon-trump-confederate-symbols.html)
on Monday, suggesting that NASCAR had made a mistake in banning it from
its auto racing events, while falsely accusing a top Black driver,
Darrell Wallace Jr., of perpetrating a hoax involving a noose found in
his garage.

The remarks are part of a pattern. Almost every day in the last two
weeks, Mr. Trump has sought to stoke white fear and resentment,
portraying himself as a protector of an old order that polls show much
of America believes perpetuates entrenched racism and wants to move
beyond.

Two weeks ago, the president [retweeted a
video](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/trump-white-power-video-racism.html)
of a supporter shouting “white power” at a retirement community filled
with older people whom he wants to win over. Last week, [he wrote that
he was
reviewing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/trump-obama-housing-discrimination.html)
a fair housing regulation that is aimed at eliminating racial housing
disparities in the suburbs, but that he said would have a “devastating
impact” on those communities — a play to white suburbanites whose votes
would be crucial to his re-election.

On Monday, he also tweeted his displeasure with sports teams that are
reviewing the appropriateness of nicknames that are offensive to Native
Americans, seeking to curry favor with Americans who believe political
correctness has gone too far. He has invoked fear of crime with tweets
about sanctuary cities and crime rates in New York and Chicago, and has
spoken of preserving “our heritage,” picking up the language of those
who want to honor the Confederacy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For many Republicans who are watching [the president’s impact on Senate
races](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/trump-senate-republicans-poll.html)
with alarm, his focus on racial and cultural flash points — and not on
the [surge of the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/world/coronavirus-updates.html)
in many states — is distressing.

“This is part of the same selfish, divide-and-conquer strategy that
helped the president get elected in 2016,” said Carlos Curbelo, a former
Republican congressman from Florida who has been critical of Mr. Trump.
“Of course that strategy worked for much of the president’s base, and
it certainly benefited him in the past, but it’s selfish in the sense
that it is extremely damaging for Republicans in swing states, in swing
districts.”

Mr. Curbelo added, “It’s always been clear, but this is a reminder that
the president looks out for himself first, second and
third.”

Mr. Trump’s inflammatory behavior shows how out of step he is with
[shifting national sentiment on racial
justice](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/10/upshot/black-lives-matter-attitudes.html),
as big corporations, sports leagues and cultural institutions express
greater solidarity with Black Americans protesting systemic racism. Even
some Republicans have been open to discussions about removing
Confederate statues.

While NASCAR and other organizations have moved to retire symbols of the
Confederacy, and [lawmakers in Mississippi
voted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/mississippi-flag-confederacy.html?searchResultPosition=4)
to bring down the state flag featuring the Confederate battle emblem,
Mr. Trump continues to cast himself as a defender of the history of the
American South, despite its stains of slavery and oppression. He has
called the phrase “Black Lives Matter” a “symbol of hate,” and he has
repeatedly tried to depict pockets of violence during protests against
entrenched racism as representative of the protest movement as a whole.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump also [delivered official
speeches](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/us/politics/trump-mt-rushmore.html)
over the weekend that emphasized defending American historical figures
like George Washington and some abolitionists, though he avoided
explicit references to totems of the Confederacy.

But on Monday he was back invoking the Confederacy, with his reference
to NASCAR’s ban on Confederate flags, while also attacking Mr. Wallace,
the only Black driver on NASCAR’s top circuit.

Mr. Wallace, nicknamed “Bubba,” had called for NASCAR to ban the flag
from its events, and the sport agreed to prohibit it from its races and
its properties. At the start of race week at the Talladega Superspeedway
in Alabama last month, a member of Mr. Wallace’s racing team [found a
noose](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/sports/autoracing/nascar-noose-bubba-wallace.html)
hanging in the driver’s garage stall and reported it to NASCAR.

“Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers &
officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to
sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was
just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings
EVER\!” Mr. Trump
[posted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280117571874951170)
on Twitter on Monday.

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, offered a contorted
defense of Mr. Trump’s tweet about the Confederate flag and Mr. Wallace
during an early afternoon briefing.

She insisted Mr. Trump was being taken out of context, and invoked
Jussie Smollet, the Black television actor known for his role on the TV
series “Empire,” who is facing charges that he lied to the authorities
about a hate crime attack that detectives said he had staged last year
in Chicago.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

No one has credibly suggested Mr. Wallace manufactured the noose that
was discovered in his garage stall by a colleague. F.B.I. officials
[later
found](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/sports/autoracing/bubba-wallace-noose-nascar.html)
that the knot had been tied into the rope as early as October 2019, well
before anyone would have known that Mr. Wallace would be assigned that
stall [for the
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/sports/autoracing/bubba-wallace-noose-nascar.html).

Ms. McEnany claimed that the original reports about the incident painted
NASCAR members as “racist individuals who were roaming around and
engaging in a crime.”

But Mr. Trump received pushback from Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican
of South Carolina and an informal adviser to the president, who said
Monday that he disagreed with Mr. Trump’s tweet.

“They’re trying to grow the sport,” Mr. Graham said, [according to the
CNN reporter Manu
Raju](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1280165407740104709), referring
to NASCAR’s ban on Confederate flags, [which it announced last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/sports/autoracing/nascar-confederate-flags.html?searchResultPosition=1).
“And I’ve lived in South Carolina all my life and if you’re in business,
the Confederate flag is not a good way to grow your business.”

Mr. Graham, who is facing a strong challenge from Jaime Harrison, a
Black Democrat, in his re-election bid, said that “one way you grow the
sport is you take images that divide us and ask that they not be brought
into the venue. That makes sense to me.” He said that Mr. Wallace did
not have “anything to apologize for,” and that his fellow drivers should
be applauded for supporting him.

“I would be looking to celebrate that kind of attitude more than being
worried about it being a hoax,” Mr. Graham said, according to Mr. Raju.

(Mr. Trump was also wrong in his tweet in characterizing NASCAR’s
television audience as having fallen to its “lowest ratings EVER\!” The
broadcast of Sunday’s Brickyard 400 was seen by about 4.3 million
viewers, a 39 percent increase from the average NASCAR race that aired
on NBC last year, according to Nielsen.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Later on Monday, Mr. Trump added another inflammatory tweet, weighing in
on recent announcements [by the Washington
Redskins](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/sports/football/washington-redskins-nickname-nfl.html)
of the N.F.L. and [the Cleveland
Indians](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/sports/baseball/cleveland-indians-name-change.html)
of Major League Baseball that the teams would review their names. While
many Native Americans and other advocates for change consider the names
deeply offensive, Mr. Trump baselessly claimed that Native Americans
would be “very angry” about the potential changes.

“They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington
Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like
they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically
correct,” Mr. Trump
[tweeted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/sports/football/washington-team-name-change.html).
He added a jab at a favorite target, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who [has
apologized](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-native-american.html)
for her past claims of Native ancestry. “Indians, like Elizabeth Warren,
must be very angry right now,” the president wrote.

Eleven minutes later, Mr. Trump again referred to the coronavirus as the
“China Virus,” a phrase that [critics say is racist, xenophobic and
harmful to
Asian-Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html).

Mr. Trump’s tweets came just days after he delivered [a divisive speech
at Mount
Rushmore](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mount-rushmore.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
in South Dakota as part of the July 4 holiday, in which he denounced
Democrats as radical anarchists and said that children are taught in
schools to “hate” the United States. In that address he avoided
specifically mentioning anything related to Confederate monuments.

He talked more generally about efforts to take down statues across the
country, conflating what is primarily an attempt to remove statues of
Confederate generals with others questioning monuments to people like
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.

“Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our
most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our
cities,” Mr. Trump said in the speech. “Many of these people have no
idea why they are doing this, but some know exactly what they are
doing.”

Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers have tried to persuade him to focus less
explicitly on statues of Confederate generals, given that he is taking
an unpopular position. But after sticking to the script in his Friday
night speech, he was clear about his support for the Confederate flag in
his tweet on Monday.

York.
