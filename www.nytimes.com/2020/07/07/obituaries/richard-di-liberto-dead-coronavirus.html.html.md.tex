Covid-19.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

As the chief of photography at \href{https://www.frick.org/}{the Frick
Collection} on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Richard di Liberto was
one of the ``upstairs'' employees --- the curators, conservators and
administrators who run the museum.

But Mr. di Liberto, the son of an Italian immigrant bricklayer, liked to
hang out downstairs --- in the basement billiards room, with the
custodians, gardeners, guards, art movers and maintenance workers who
shot pool in the afternoons.

A musician since his teens, he used lunch breaks to play drums at
\href{https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/jazz-at-noon-is-closing-out-a-46-year-run/}{Jazz
at Noon}, a long-running weekly jam session in Manhattan.

And when his granddaughter visited him at work, Mr. di Liberto would
lift the velvet rope and whisk her upstairs to show off the opulent
rooms forbidden to museumgoers.

Mr. di Liberto photographed the Frick's collection of paintings,
drawings, sculpture, decorative objects and furniture from 1974 until
his retirement in 2004. He also shot interior and exterior architectural
images of the museum, and any traveling exhibits that came there. His
photographs illustrate many of the Frick's books,
\href{https://www.frick.org/shop/art_frick_collection/catalogue_volumes_v_and_vi}{catalogs}
and press materials.

Mr. di Liberto died on April 1 at North Shore University Hospital in
Manhasset, N.Y., on Long Island. He was 82. His granddaughter, Nika
Sabasteanski, said the cause was Covid-19.

Richard Peter di Liberto was born on Feb. 7, 1938, in Manhattan to
Gaetano di Liberto, who had emigrated from Sicily, and Mildred
(Macaluso) di Liberto. The family soon moved from a tenement on the
Lower East Side to Corona, Queens.

Mr. di Liberto dropped out of high school at 17 and enlisted in the Air
Force. After his discharge, he returned to the city and finished his
G.E.D., working a series of humdrum jobs before pursuing photography. He
took courses at
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/14/archives/rca-school-here-plans-to-close-institute-cites-rise-in-costs-and.html}{RCA
Institutes} in Manhattan and the Rochester Institute of Technology,
apprenticed himself to the fine-art
photographer\href{https://www.mocp.org/detail.php?t=objects\&type=browse\&f=maker\&s=Hyde\%2C+Scott\&record=9}{Scott
Hyde} and began shooting art and architecture for corporate clients,
galleries
\href{nytimes.com/1971/05/09/archives/suffolk-buildings-1659-to-1971-are-shown-in-photos.html}{and
museums}.

The Brooklyn Museum hired him as its chief of photography in 1971. But
two years later, when
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/27/archives/brooklyn-museum-split-over-policies-of-director-brooklyn-museum.html}{a
dispute broke out} between museum staff members and a new director, Mr.
di Liberto sided with the staff, resigned and went to work for the
Frick.

Photographing art is a specialty, requiring the technical skill to show
a variety of objects and surfaces in their best light. Using a
medium-format film camera, Mr. di Liberto captured the subtle veining of
a marble bust, the patterns of an 18th-century Flemish tapestry, the
craquelure of a Goya canvas. He printed the images in a darkroom on
site.

Outside of work, Mr. di Liberto restored old sports cars. He and Galen
Lee, the Frick's horticulturist, rented a garage in Queens with other
gearheads.

``Richard had an obsession with cars and convertibles,'' Mr. Lee said.
``We'd go out there and figure out why they never ran right.''

Mr. di Liberto spent his retirement at home in Beechhurst, Queens, with
his wife, Irene di Liberto, and at their rural cabin west of Albany. The
couple met as teenagers when he was stationed at Mitchel Air Force Base
on Long Island.

``We would have been married 62 years,'' Ms. di Liberto said. ``If you
want to call it love at first sight, sure, that's what it was. We always
made a good partnership.''

In addition to his granddaughter and his wife, Mr. di Liberto is
survived by two daughters, Lisa di Liberto and Carolyn di Liberto, and a
grandson, Harper di Liberto-Bell.
