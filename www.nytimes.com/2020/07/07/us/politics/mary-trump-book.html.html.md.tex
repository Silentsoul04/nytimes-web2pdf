as a Way of
Life'}\label{mary-trumps-book-accuses-the-president-of-embracing-cheating-as-a-way-of-life}}

The president's niece, Mary L. Trump, is the first to break ranks with
the family and release a tell-all memoir.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/mary-trump-book.html}{Mary
L. Trump}, President Trump's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review-too-much-never-enough-mary-trump.html}{niece},
plans to publish a tell-all family memoir next week, describing how a
decades long history of darkness, dysfunction and brutality turned her
uncle into a reckless leader who, according to her publisher, Simon \&
Schuster, ``now threatens the world's health, economic security and
social fabric.''

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review/mary-trump-book-takeaways.html}{The
book}, ``Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's
Most Dangerous Man,'' depicts a multigenerational saga of greed,
betrayal and internecine tension and seeks to explain how President
Trump's position in one of New York's wealthiest and most infamous
real-estate empires helped him acquire what Ms. Trump has referred to as
``twisted behaviors'' --- attributes like seeing other people in
``monetary terms'' and practicing ``cheating as a way of life.''

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review/mary-trump-book-takeaways.html}{Ms.
Trump}, who at 55 has long been estranged from President Trump, is the
first member of the Trump clan to break ranks with her relatives by
writing a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review-too-much-never-enough-mary-trump.html}{book}
about their secrets. Since late June, her family --- led by the
president's younger brother, Robert S. Trump
---\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/mary-trump-book-court.html}{has
been trying to stop the publication of the book}, citing a
confidentiality agreement that she signed nearly 20 years ago during a
dispute over the will of the family patriarch, Fred Trump Sr., the
president's father. But a judge in New York
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/mary-trump-book-lawsuit.html}{has
refused to enjoin Simon \& Schuster} from releasing the memoir and is
expected to soon rule on whether Ms. Trump herself violated the
confidentiality agreement.

Here are some of the highlights from her manuscript:

\hypertarget{cheating-on-a-college-entrance-test}{%
\subsubsection{Cheating on a College Entrance
Test}\label{cheating-on-a-college-entrance-test}}

As a high school student in Queens, Ms. Trump writes, Donald Trump paid
someone to take a precollegiate test, the SAT, on his behalf. The high
score the proxy earned for him, Ms. Trump adds, helped the young Mr.
Trump to later gain admittance when he transferred as an undergraduate
to the University of Pennsylvania's prestigious Wharton business school.

Mr. Trump has often boasted about attending Wharton, which he has
referred to as ``the best school in the world'' and ``super genius
stuff.''

\subsubsection{Sending a Brother to the Hospital
Alone}\label{sending-a-brother-to-the-hospital-alone}}

It has long been part of the Trump family's lore that the eldest child
of Fred Trump Sr., Fred Trump Jr., who was better known as Freddy, was
the black sheep of the dynasty. Freddy Trump was a handsome, garrulous
man and a heavy drinker who, after a miserable experience working for
his father, left his job in real estate to pursue a passion for flying,
becoming a pilot for Trans World Airlines.

Donald Trump has often remarked that his brother's departure from the
family business opened space for him to move into and succeed. ``For me,
it worked very well,'' Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/us/politics/for-donald-trump-lessons-from-a-brothers-suffering.html}{told
The New York Times during his presidential campaign} about serving under
his father. ``For Fred, it wasn't something that was going to work.''

Fred Trump Sr. could be brutal to his namesake, shouting at him once as
a group of employees looked on, ``Donald is worth ten of you,'' Ms.
Trump writes.

Freddy Trump died in 1981 from an alcohol-induced heart attack when he
was 42, and Ms. Trump tells the story in her book about how his family
sent him to the hospital alone on the night of his death. No one went
with him, Ms. Trump writes.

Donald Trump, she added, went to see a movie.

\hypertarget{no-principles-a-sister-says}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{``No Principles,'' a Sister
Says}}{``No Principles,'' a Sister Says}}\label{no-principles-a-sister-says}}

Even at the start of Mr. Trump's campaign, his sister, Maryanne Trump
Barry, a retired federal appeals court judge, had deep reservations
about his fitness for office, Ms. Trump writes.

``He's a clown --- this will never happen,'' she quotes her aunt as
saying during one of their regular lunches in 2015, just after Mr. Trump
announced that he was running for president.

Maryanne Trump was particularly baffled by support for her brother among
evangelical Christians, according to the book.

``The only time Donald went to church was when the cameras were there,''
Ms. Trump quotes her aunt as saying. ``It's mind boggling. But that's
all about his base. He has no principles. None!''

\hypertarget{donald-trump-narcissist}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Donald Trump,
Narcissist}}{Donald Trump, Narcissist}}\label{donald-trump-narcissist}}

Ms. Trump, a clinical psychologist, asserts that her uncle has all nine
clinical criteria for being a narcissist. And yet, she notes, even that
label does not capture the full array of the president's psychological
troubles.

``The fact is,'' she writes, ``Donald's pathologies are so complex and
his behaviors so often inexplicable that coming up with an accurate and
comprehensive diagnosis would require a full battery of psychological
and neurophysical tests that he'll never sit for.''

At another point she says: ``Donald has been institutionalized for most
of his adult life, so there is no way to know how he would thrive, or
even survive, on his own in the real world.''

Like other critics of the president, Ms. Trump takes issue in the book
with the notion that Mr. Trump is a strategic thinker who operates
according to specific agendas or organizing principles.

``He doesn't,'' she writes. ``Donald's ego has been and is a fragile and
inadequate barrier between him and the real world, which, thanks to his
father's money and power, he never had to negotiate by himself.''
