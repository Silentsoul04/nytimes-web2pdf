# 7 Takeaways From Mary Trump’s Book About Her Uncle Donald

</div>

Growing up Trump wasn’t easy. There were feuds, grudges and spanking
with a wooden spoon. Now, there’s the burden of the name.

In the prologue of “Too Much and Never Enough,” [Mary
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/mary-trump-book.html)
writes: “The media failed to notice that not one member of Donald’s
family, apart from his children, his son-in-law and his current wife,
said a word in support of him during the entire campaign.” That doesn’t
mean they had no opinions. The daughter of the president’s older
brother, Freddy, who died in 1981, now shares some of hers — not just by
airing the family’s dirty laundry, but by washing and folding it, too.
(Mary Trump is a clinical psychologist whose diagnoses for her uncle are
as varied and extensive as the fast food buffet he offered the Clemson
Tigers [when they visited the White House
in 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/trump-burgers-fast-food.html).)

\[ *Read* [*Jennifer Szalai’s
review*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review-too-much-never-enough-mary-trump.html)
*of “Too Much and Never Enough.”* \]

Here are seven insights gleaned from reading the first
niece.

### Nothing Donald Trump said during his campaign deviated from Mary Trump’s expectations of him.

“I was reminded of every family meal I’d ever attended during which
Donald had talked about all of the women he considered ugly fat slobs or
the men, usually more accomplished or powerful, he called losers,” she
writes. “That kind of casual dehumanization of people was commonplace at
the Trump dinner
table.”

### The author declined an invitation to an election night party in New York City.

Her reason: “I wouldn’t be able to contain my euphoria when Clinton’s
victory was announced, and I didn’t want to be rude.” In the months
following her uncle’s inauguration, “the smallest thing — seeing
Donald’s face or hearing my own name, both of which happened dozens of
times a day — took me back to the time when my father had withered and
died beneath the cruelty and contempt of my grandfather. I had lost him
when he was only 42 and I was 16. The horror of Donald’s cruelty was
being magnified by the fact that his acts were now official U.S. policy,
affecting millions of
people.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### But, in April 2017, she did accept an invite to a White House celebration for her aunts’ birthdays.

At Trump International Hotel, the extended family “piled haphazardly
into the two White House vans like a J.V. lacrosse team.” Upon arrival
at their destination, Vice President Pence lurked “with a half-dead
smile on his face, like the chaperone everybody wanted to avoid,” and
guests were treated to a tour, during which Mary Trump “was surprised to
see a half-eaten apple on the bedside table” in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Dinner was brief, as Trump dinners usually are. Mashed potatoes were on
the menu, prompting the president’s sister Maryanne to tell a favorite
family story about “that night when Freddy dumped a bowl of mashed
potatoes on Donald’s head because he was being such a brat.” When it was
the author’s turn to take a picture with her uncle, she could “see the
exhaustion behind the smile. It seemed that keeping up the cheerful
facade was wearing on
him.”

### ‘For Donald, lying was primarily a mode of self-aggrandizement meant to convince other people he was better than he actually was.’

According to Mary Trump, her father’s siblings were raised with a few
core beliefs: lying was OK — in fact, it was “a way of life”; apologies
and displays of emotion or vulnerability were verboten; and bullying was
perfectly acceptable, if not encouraged. She tells a story about a young
Donald Trump threatening to dismantle his younger brother’s favorite toy
trucks: “Desperate to save them, Robert ran to his mother. Mary’s
solution was to hide the trucks in the attic, effectively punishing
Robert, who’d done nothing wrong, and leaving Donald feeling invincible.
He wasn’t yet being rewarded for selfishness, obstinacy or cruelty, but
he wasn’t being punished for those flaws, either.”

### You do not want to be on the bad side of the Trump family.

Donald Trump’s father, Fred, never cared for Mary Trump’s mother, Linda,
a former flight attendant from Florida whom he considered a gold digger.
He turned a blind eye when his eldest son was sick and living with his
young family in a frigid Trump-owned apartment with plastic sheeting
over its rotting walls. Years later, after his son died, Fred would
disinherit Mary and her brother; their uncle, Robert (of the toy
trucks), explained: “Your grandfather didn’t want you or Fritz, or
especially your mother, to get anything.” When the siblings threatened
to sue for 20 percent of their grandfather’s estate, the family cut off
the medical insurance that had been provided by Trump Management since
they were born. “My brother depended upon this insurance to pay for my
nephew’s crushing medical expenses,” Mary Trump
writes.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“William was out of the
hospital by then, but he was still susceptible to seizures, which more
than once had put him in a state of cardiac arrest so severe that he
would not have survived without CPR. He still required round-the-clock
nursing care.” The response from the lawyer representing Fred Trump’s
estate: William’s parents should learn CPR.

### The Trumps have a way with words.

Donald Trump, upon seeing his niece in a bathing suit: “You’re stacked.”
Fred Trump’s advice to his son Freddy, who was suffering from
alcoholism: “Just give it a quarter of a turn on the mental carburetor.”
Fred Trump’s advice to his wife, who was frequently ill: “Everything’s
great. Right, Toots? You just have to think
positive.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

### Mary Trump has a simple reason for writing this book.

“Donald, following the lead of my grandfather and with the complicity,
silence and inaction of his siblings, destroyed my father. I can’t let
him destroy my country.”
