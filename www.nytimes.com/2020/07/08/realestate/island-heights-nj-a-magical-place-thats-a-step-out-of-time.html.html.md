# Island Heights, N.J.: A ‘Magical Place’ That’s a Step Out of Time

</div>

Founded in the 19th century as a Methodist camp meeting site, this Ocean
County borough retains an old-fashioned feeling, even as newcomers move
in.

Residents and visitors are back on the boardwalk for sunset strolls, the
pickleball courts are open and white sails have been dotting the
shoreline of [Island Heights, N.J.](http://islandheightsboro.com/), for
some time. But it wasn’t until this week, when the Island Heights Yacht
Club’s junior sailing program started up again, that something of a
sense of normalcy would return to this Ocean County borough on the banks
of Toms River.

“I look forward to this every summer,” said Brian Hull, 44, a high
school social studies teacher who has taught sailing here for the last
28 years. “All over town, you see kids riding their bikes, wearing their
helmets and life jackets, heading down the hill to the yacht club.”

Despite the late start, Mr. Hull expects to squeeze most of the
eight-week sailing lesson season in before Labor Day, although many of
the boat races, along with other large public events, have been
canceled. Still, for many of the borough’s 1,673 residents, life has not
been dramatically altered throughout the months of a state-mandated
coronavirus
shutdown.

“When I’m in Island Heights, I feel like I’m in a different part of the
country,” said Michael DellaRocca, 67, a broker with Crossroads Realty
who moved to Island Heights three years ago. “We’re not being stupid,
but people have been running and biking, families have been getting
together. If you didn’t leave town, you wouldn’t know anything was going
on.”

With no commercial district, limited highway access and a public school
system that serves just over 120 students, Island Heights has long
seemed a step out of time, particularly in comparison with bustling
areas like Seaside Heights, a short causeway ride away. Social
activities center on the water in this 0.9-square-mile borough (a third
of which is in the water). The yacht club and three other marinas are
home to many boats from across Barnegat Bay, where numerous sailing
regattas are normally held throughout the summer.

An abbreviated racing season will begin in early August, said Mayor
Steve Doyle, commodore of the Island Heights Yacht Club. Other popular
Island Heights events — including the fire department’s Summerbrew
fund-raiser in late June and the Rotary Club’s Sailfest in September —
were canceled because of a 250-person cap on public gatherings imposed
by Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey.

“We’re adapting to the new normal,” said Mr. Doyle, 60, noting that
borough council meetings are now being held outdoors. “Some families
were hard hit by the Covid shutdown, dealing with job loss or financial
issues. But everybody is supporting everybody else in town.” (As of late
June, Island Heights had 14 Covid-19 positive cases and one
Covid-related death, the mayor said.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Doyle, who has summered here each year since he was a boy, moved to
his family’s Victorian house full time upon retiring in 2016, a
transition many of the borough’s residents have made.

Founded in 1878 as a Methodist camp meeting site, Island Heights has
long served as a summer retreat, especially for those from the
Philadelphia area. And while full-timers now outnumber summer-only
residents, occasional rifts arise among the various constituent groups,
said Harry Bower, who bought an 1890s farmhouse here for $175,000 in
1987.

“You have the townies, who want no change, and the yachties, who are
just here for the summer, so they don’t care,” said Mr. Bower, 68, an
art teacher and curator of the John F. Peto Studio Museum. “But in the
last 10 years, we’ve seen new people, younger families moving here, who
really appreciate the town’s charm.”

One of those appreciative newcomers is Therese Heimbold, 52, a
commercial director at the US Pharmaceutical Corporation, who remembered
her father talking about “this magical place” where he used to spend his
summers. In 2017, she sold her house in Haddonfield, N.J., and bought
one of Island Heights’ original camp meeting houses, a two-bedroom
cottage, for $225,000.

Returning from her job in Philadelphia in the evening, Ms. Heimbold
said, she finds her stress dissipates upon arrival: “I drive into town
along River Road, and I see all the sailboats, and it’s pure
serenity.”

## What You’ll Find

Surrounded by water on three sides, Island Heights offers many homes
with water views, nearly all a short walk from Toms River or Dillon’s
Creek. While it technically sits on a peninsula rather than an island,
the borough does have one of the highest shore points along the Eastern
Seaboard, with a bluff that rises 60 feet above sea level. Atop this
bluff is a mix of newer waterfront homes with long staircases down to
private river docks and smaller houses, including a handful of
turn-of-the-last-century cottages surrounding the camp meeting site
grounds on West Camp Walk. About a dozen newer homes have been built
throughout the town.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the lower altitude, River Avenue hugs the curve of the river, where
some of the borough’s grand Victorian and Queen Anne homes sit facing
the water, complete with bright colors, ornate trim and the occasional
widow’s walk. (Island Heights was once home to a number of ship
captains.) About a third of the borough’s houses are within the Island
Heights Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, although the designation doesn’t restrict renovations.

“It was enacted without teeth,” Mr. Doyle said. “But most people follow
the rules in keeping up with the style. You’re buying into that
culture.”

There are two small riverfront beaches in town, but many opt to cross
the Route 37 causeway to the ocean beaches along Barnegat Peninsula,
like Seaside Heights, Seaside Park and Island Beach State
Park.

## What You’ll Pay

As of early July, there were 23 properties on the market in Island
Heights, Mr. DellaRocca said, including nine vacant developer lots along
Dillon’s Creek. The most expensive house was a 1985 four-bedroom
waterfront home with a 200-foot dock, listed for $1.275 million; the
least expensive was a 1990 two-bedroom, two-bathroom house for $262,000.
The development lots range from $650,000 to $1.1 million. Rental
properties are almost nonexistent.

The average price of the 13 houses sold in the first six months of this
year was $480,000; during the same time period in 2019, 28 homes sold at
an average price of $411,000, according to the Monmouth Ocean Regional
Multiple Listing Service. Elizabeth Hull, an agent with Re/Max and the
wife of Mr. Hull, the sailing instructor, said the waterfront Victorians
rarely come on the market, but when they do, they are priced at $600,000
or more, depending on the shape they are
in.

## The Vibe

The Hulls live in a rented house on “the bluff,” where Ms. Hull said she
makes sure to keep cheese, wine and beer in her refrigerator, because
“people are always dropping by to hang out.” More organized gatherings
take place at the yacht club, which holds regular Friday night B.Y.O.B.
catered dinners that are open to members and nonmembers. (Island Heights
is a dry borough.)

Beyond the boating scene, Island Heights supports an active arts
community, housing three art institutions (currently closed) within its
borders: a cultural heritage museum, the Ocean County Artists’ Guild and
the John F. Peto Studio Museum, in a building where Mr. Peto, a
world-renowned trompe l’oeil artist, lived and painted in his final
years.

While many events have been canceled, the Island Heights fire department
is hoping to hold its Labor Day Races, a more than century-old tradition
that concludes with squad members shoveling a dump truck full of peanuts
onto the field for everyone to scramble and
collect.

## The Schools

The [Island Heights School
District](http://www.islandheights.k12.nj.us/ihsd/), one of the smallest
in the state, serves around 120 students from kindergarten through sixth
grade. The elementary school provides Chromebooks to all its students
and offers extracurricular clubs for chess, robotics, art, music and
broadcasting.

Beyond sixth grade, students attend Central Regional Middle School and
Central Regional High School, along with students from Berkeley
Township, Ocean Gate, Seaside Heights and Seaside Park. The regional
high school has about 1,400 students. In 2018-19, average SAT scores
were 529 in English and 535 in math, compared with state averages of 539
and 541.

Among the private school choices are St. Joseph Grade School for
prekindergarten through eighth grade and Donovan Catholic High School,
both in neighboring Toms River.

## The Commute

Island Heights is about 75 miles south of New York City and is served by
buses only, out of Toms River. New Jersey Transit Bus No. 137 travels
from the Toms River park-and-ride station (about a seven-minute drive
from Island Heights) to Port Authority in Manhattan, in a little over an
hour and a half. Tickets are $21.25 one way or $496 for a monthly pass.
Academy Bus Lines runs a Parkway Express bus from the Toms River
park-and-ride station to the Wall Street area; the trip takes about an
hour and 45 minutes and costs $21 one way or $490 a
month.

## The History

In the early 1900s, the department store magnate John Wanamaker
established Camp Wanamaker, a quasi-military encampment in the
northeastern part of Island Heights, where young employees were sent for
two weeks during the summer to take part in drills, drum and bugle corps
training, field competition and swimming. The site was taken over by the
U.S. Army during World War II and is where the borough’s municipal
buildings and post office are now.
