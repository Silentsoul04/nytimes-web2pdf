Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sued
the Trump administration in federal court on Wednesday, seeking to block
a directive that would [strip foreign college students of their
visas](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/world/international-students-visa-reaction.html)
if the courses they take this fall are entirely online.

University leaders and immigrant advocates called the new policy cruel
and reckless, with several education groups saying they planned to join
the legal battle. The Massachusetts attorney general vowed to support
Harvard and M.I.T.’s efforts to block the rules, which were announced
Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Massachusetts is home to thousands of international students who should
not fear deportation or be forced to put their health and safety at risk
in order to advance their education,” Maura Healey, the attorney
general, said in a statement. “This decision from ICE is cruel, it’s
illegal, and we will sue to stop it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The universities argued that the policy was politically motivated and
would throw higher education into chaos. It was widely seen as an effort
by the White House to pressure colleges and universities into reopening
and abandoning the cautious approaches that many have adopted to reduce
coronavirus transmission.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The political intent cannot be clearer,” said Miriam Feldblum,
executive director of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and
Immigration, which includes the leaders of about 450 public and private
universities. “They want to force campuses into the position they have
to declare themselves open, or at least in a hybrid model.”

Harvard is planning to teach its classes entirely online over the next
year, and many other universities are planning a hybrid model, with some
in-person instruction but mostly remote classes. M.I.T. will have a
small selection of in-person classes, but said that most will be
online.

Harvard’s president, Lawrence S. Bacow, called the administration’s
action reckless and [said in a
statement](https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2020/supporting-international-students?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=hu-twitter-general&utm_medium=social)
that it appeared to have been designed to pressure universities to hold
in-person classes “without regard to concerns for the health and safety
of students, instructors and others.”

The two universities said that the new directive would prevent many of
their 9,000 combined international students — and hundreds of thousands
of students at other universities across the country — from staying in
the United States. Their suit, [filed in federal court in
Boston](https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/sevp_filing.pdf),
seeks a temporary restraining order preventing the government from
enforcing the policy because it violates the Administrative Procedure
Act.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The American Council on Education, an industry group, said it planned to
file a brief in support of the lawsuit, and some 25 higher education
associations, including the American Association of Community Colleges,
the Association of American Universities and the Association of Land
Grant Universities, were expected to join.

“We have heard from many of our members, and they all share the same
concerns about the nature of the guidance,” said Pedro Ribeiro, a
spokesman for the Association of American Universities, which represents
65 research institutions.

ICE said it would not comment on pending litigation.

Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of the Department
of Homeland Security, defended the agency’s order in an interview
Tuesday on CNN, saying that the agency was providing more flexibility
for international students than in the past, when in order to qualify
for a visa, they could take no more than one of their courses online.
Now they can take more, as long as at least some of their instruction is
in person.

“If they’re not going to be a student or they’re going to be 100 percent
online, then they don’t have a basis to be here,” Mr. Cuccinelli said,
adding, “They should go home, and then they can return when the school
opens.”

The Harvard and M.I.T. suit says that the government recognized that the
pandemic posed a unique crisis on March 13, when it suspended a rule
that students in the country on F-1 student visas had to attend most
classes in person. “The government made clear that this arrangement was
in effect for the duration of the emergency,” the lawsuit says.

In reversing that earlier guidance on Monday, the universities say, the
government has put the ability of international students to continue
studying and working in the U.S. in jeopardy, and it has disrupted the
careful planning process that many universities have used to restart
higher education in the fall, after shutting down campuses in mid-March.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The effect — and perhaps even the goal — is to create as much chaos for
universities and international students as possible,” the universities
said in the
lawsuit.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

International students, many of whom pay full tuition, are a major
source of revenue for American universities, and losing them would be a
huge blow to the finances of many public and private schools, which are
already suffering losses because of the pandemic.

“The financial repercussions to institutions are potentially very
traumatic,” said Daniel J. Hurley, chief executive of the Michigan
Association of State Universities, which represents the state’s public
universities. He cited studies showing that 33,236 international
students [contributed $1.2
billion](https://www.nafsa.org/isev/reports/state?year=2018&state=MI) to
Michigan’s economy in 2018.

The leaders of many universities, including the [University of
California Los
Angeles](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/standing-international-students/),
[Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/07/08/president-eisgruber-princeton-stands-firmly-international-students-face-ice)
and
[Cornell](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/07/pollack-sends-message-support-international-students),
issued statements this week supporting their foreign students and
criticizing the administration’s directive.
