Students}\label{harvard-and-mit-sue-to-stop-trump-visa-rules-for-foreign-students}}

Universities opposed a policy that would require students to take at
least one in-person class or be denied permission to study in the United
States.

Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sued
the Trump administration in federal court on Wednesday, seeking to block
a directive that would
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/world/international-students-visa-reaction.html}{strip
foreign college students of their visas} if the courses they take this
fall are entirely online.

University leaders and immigrant advocates called the new policy cruel
and reckless, with several education groups saying they planned to join
the legal battle. The Massachusetts attorney general vowed to support
Harvard and M.I.T.'s efforts to block the rules, which were announced
Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

``Massachusetts is home to thousands of international students who
should not fear deportation or be forced to put their health and safety
at risk in order to advance their education,'' Maura Healey, the
attorney general, said in a statement. ``This decision from ICE is
cruel, it's illegal, and we will sue to stop it.''

The universities argued that the policy was politically motivated and
would throw higher education into chaos. It was widely seen as an effort
by the White House to pressure colleges and universities into reopening
and abandoning the cautious approaches that many have adopted to reduce
coronavirus transmission.

``The political intent cannot be clearer,'' said Miriam Feldblum,
executive director of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and
Immigration, which includes the leaders of about 450 public and private
universities. ``They want to force campuses into the position they have
to declare themselves open, or at least in a hybrid model.''

Harvard is planning to teach its classes entirely online over the next
year, and many other universities are planning a hybrid model, with some
in-person instruction but mostly remote classes. M.I.T. will have a
small selection of in-person classes, but said that most will be online.

Harvard's president, Lawrence S. Bacow, called the administration's
action reckless and
\href{https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2020/supporting-international-students?utm_source=twitter\&utm_campaign=hu-twitter-general\&utm_medium=social}{said
in a statement} that it appeared to have been designed to pressure
universities to hold in-person classes ``without regard to concerns for
the health and safety of students, instructors and others.''

The two universities said that the new directive would prevent many of
their 9,000 combined international students --- and hundreds of
thousands of students at other universities across the country --- from
staying in the United States. Their suit,
\href{https://www.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/sevp_filing.pdf}{filed
in federal court in Boston}, seeks a temporary restraining order
preventing the government from enforcing the policy because it violates
the Administrative Procedure Act.

The American Council on Education, an industry group, said it planned to
file a brief in support of the lawsuit, and some 25 higher education
associations, including the American Association of Community Colleges,
the Association of American Universities and the Association of Land
Grant Universities, were expected to join.

``We have heard from many of our members, and they all share the same
concerns about the nature of the guidance,'' said Pedro Ribeiro, a
spokesman for the Association of American Universities, which represents
65 research institutions.

ICE said it would not comment on pending litigation.

Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of the Department
of Homeland Security, defended the agency's order in an interview
Tuesday on CNN, saying that the agency was providing more flexibility
for international students than in the past, when in order to qualify
for a visa, they could take no more than one of their courses online.
Now they can take more, as long as at least some of their instruction is
in person.

``If they're not going to be a student or they're going to be 100
percent online, then they don't have a basis to be here,'' Mr.
Cuccinelli said, adding, ``They should go home, and then they can return
when the school opens.''

The Harvard and M.I.T. suit says that the government recognized that the
pandemic posed a unique crisis on March 13, when it suspended a rule
that students in the country on F-1 student visas had to attend most
classes in person. ``The government made clear that this arrangement was
in effect for the duration of the emergency,'' the lawsuit says.

In reversing that earlier guidance on Monday, the universities say, the
government has put the ability of international students to continue
studying and working in the U.S. in jeopardy, and it has disrupted the
careful planning process that many universities have used to restart
higher education in the fall, after shutting down campuses in mid-March.

``The effect --- and perhaps even the goal --- is to create as much
chaos for universities and international students as possible,'' the
universities said in the lawsuit.

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

International students, many of whom pay full tuition, are a major
source of revenue for American universities, and losing them would be a
huge blow to the finances of many public and private schools, which are
already suffering losses because of the pandemic.

``The financial repercussions to institutions are potentially very
traumatic,'' said Daniel J. Hurley, chief executive of the Michigan
Association of State Universities, which represents the state's public
universities. He cited studies showing that 33,236 international
students
\href{https://www.nafsa.org/isev/reports/state?year=2018\&state=MI}{contributed
\$1.2 billion} to Michigan's economy in 2018.

The leaders of many universities, including the
\href{https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/standing-international-students/}{University
of California Los Angeles},
\href{https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/07/08/president-eisgruber-princeton-stands-firmly-international-students-face-ice}{Princeton}
and
\href{https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/07/pollack-sends-message-support-international-students}{Cornell},
issued statements this week supporting their foreign students and
criticizing the administration's directive.

``The impact will be devastating --- on the lives of international
students, on the ability of America's top research universities to
recruit the world's best and brightest, and on our economy,''
\href{https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/07/07/vanderbilt-statement-on-ice-guidance-regarding-international-students-and-online-course-this-fall/}{wrote}
Daniel Diermeier, the chancellor of Vanderbilt University in Nashville,
and Susan R. Wente, the school's provost.

Ayantu Temesgen, a student at Harvard Medical School, is one of the
students who would be forced to leave the country under the new
directive as the school moves all of its courses online. She is from
Ethiopia, where the government shut down the internet in the country
last week during an outbreak of deadly civil unrest.

She might defer attending for a year, she said, though her M.D.-Ph.D.
program already requires about eight years of study.

``If I go, I will be concerned for my own safety because of the
political chaos,'' she said. ``But also, I won't be able to continue my
education as planned.''
