The governor, a Republican, isn't attending. It isn't clear how many
other G.O.P. elected officials will come. The turnout could be low, or
expansive. And fears of the virus hang over the event.

Three days before
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-nh-rally-postponed.html}{President
Trump's latest rally}, in a state that Hillary Clinton narrowly won in
2016, the only thing that seems clear is that the president's team has
no idea what to expect.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-nh-rally-postponed.html}{Mr.
Trump's} campaign is planning an event at an airport hangar in
Portsmouth, N.H. But the state's governor, Chris Sununu, a Republican,
has said he will not be attending. It isn't clear how many other
Republican elected officials will come. The number of attendees could be
low, or it could be expansive. There could be lots of people drifting in
from Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts.

Campaign officials believe they will be able to prevent
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/us/politics/trump-tulsa-rally.html}{the
kind of ticket prank} that helped turn Mr. Trump's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-nh-rally-postponed.html}{rally}
last month in Tulsa, Okla., into a far smaller event than expected ---
but they still cannot say for sure. And most significantly, there is the
looming threat of the coronavirus spreading in a crowd where attendees
will be in relatively close quarters, despite being mostly outdoors.

``It's not what we need right now in terms of Covid,'' said Tom Rath, a
Republican former New Hampshire attorney general. ``We have been very,
very fortunate --- our number of deaths are quite small.''

Mr. Sununu, in particular, is threading a needle in a year when he is up
for re-election in a swing state, and has gotten praise for how he has
handled the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Rath said.

In an interview with CNN on Tuesday night, Mr. Sununu said he might have
a chance to see Mr. Trump during his swing through the state, but it
would not be at the rally on Saturday.

``I'm not going to put myself in the middle of a crowd of thousands of
people, if that's your question specifically,'' Mr. Sununu said.

The Trump campaign is attempting
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html}{a
reboot of the reboot} that fizzled out just a few weeks ago --- the June
20 rally in Tulsa that the president and his team bragged had spurred
nearly one million ticket requests. In the end, it drew only about
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-rally-coronavirus.html}{6,200
people} to the 19,000-seat arena.

Since then, campaign officials and the White House have discussed ways
to allow Mr. Trump to hit the stump the way he wants to --- at big
rallies --- without endangering people. On Wednesday, a leading
\href{https://apnews.com/ad96548245e186382225818d8dc416eb}{health
official in Tulsa said} that Mr. Trump's rally probably contributed to a
drastic increase in coronavirus cases there.

Also on Wednesday, Max Miller, the head of the advance team at the White
House, was announced as the deputy campaign manager for presidential
operations. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Miller to assume the role after Brad
Parscale, the campaign manager, suggested that Mr. Trump choose a person
with whom he has a personal relationship to help oversee the rallies.

For now, the campaign is treating the Saturday evening rally as a
potential prototype for future events. Some requests from the president
have not yet come to pass, according to a person familiar with the
planning, such as his interest in adorning his rally with statues of
founding fathers. Preserving statues of historical figures, including
from the Confederacy, has become a cause for the president in recent
weeks.

And Trump campaign officials dismissed the impact of the teenage TikTok
users who claimed responsibility for sabotaging the president's rally in
Tulsa last month. Those ticket requests were counted when Mr. Parscale
hyped the rally online, officials said. But they weeded out those
requests and still thought that they could fill an arena as well as a
space reserved for an overflow crowd with the president's supporters in
a red state that he won by more than 36 points four years ago.

Still, contact information from ticket registration for the New
Hampshire rally was being cross-referenced with data in previous lists
of supporters, in an effort to better protect themselves from online
tricksters.

The more visible problem with the Tulsa event, officials conceded, was
that they grossly underestimated how frightened their own supporters
would be to attend an indoor rally at all. It was not clear whether they
would face the same problem for the event at an airfield in New
Hampshire.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/08/us/politics/08trump-rally2/merlin_171536526_278e8724-5db9-4ada-9298-bf985fd8ac7f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

The campaign this time selected a mostly outdoor venue, and has been
``strongly'' encouraging attendees to wear face masks, all in the hopes
of easing health concerns as officials try to stage large social
gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. But officials say they are
aware that they cannot force people out of their homes and into the
venue --- and there was a chance that the rally crowd would be thinner
than expected, again.

Mr. Parscale, chastened by last month's experience, was not hyping any
crowd numbers ahead of the weekend rally.

The difficulty in giving Mr. Trump the kind of adoring rallies that he
seeks has been growing more and more apparent to White House officials
and campaign advisers. The campaign last month canceled a planned rally
in Mobile, Ala., where the president was expected to campaign for Tommy
Tuberville in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/magazine/jeff-sessions.html}{his
Senate runoff on Tuesday} against Jeff Sessions.

In the past, when Mr. Trump has held rallies in Mobile, he has had to
move his event to the Ladd-Peebles Stadium, which seats 43,000 people,
because of high demand. But officials say the days of filling stadiums
with that kind of capacity were behind them, for now.

Tulsa was not the first time the Trump campaign had been flooded with
bogus ticket sign-ups online. Officials say they comb through all of the
sign-ups and look to see whether the person requesting a ticket is a
registered Republican, or has any history of voting for a Republican
candidate at all. If they don't, those requests are often discarded.

``Registering for a rally means you've RSVP'd with a cellphone number
and we constantly weed out bogus numbers,'' Tim Murtaugh, a campaign
spokesman, said in a statement. ``These phony ticket requests never
factor into our thinking. What makes this lame attempt at hacking our
events even more foolish is the fact that every rally is general
admission --- entry is on a first-come-first-served basis and prior
registration is not required.''
