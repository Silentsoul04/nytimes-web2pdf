\section{Tammy Duckworth Confronts Nativist Smears From Tucker
Carlson}\label{tammy-duckworth-confronts-nativist-smears-from-tucker-carlson}}

Ms. Duckworth, an Illinois senator who is Thai-American and lost both
legs fighting in Iraq, has been the target of two nights of attacks from
the Fox News host; some were amplified by President Trump.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-vice-president-joe-biden.html}{Senator
Tammy Duckworth} of Illinois, a Thai-American Democrat who lost both of
her legs fighting in the Iraq war and is now a potential
vice-presidential nominee, was targeted with nativist smears for the
second night in a row on Tuesday by Fox News's Tucker Carlson.

Mr. Carlson, whose broadsides have been amplified on Twitter by
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html}{President
Trump}, attacked Ms. Duckworth in his monologue for suggesting during a
Sunday interview on CNN's ``State of the Union'' that it was worth
discussing the value of removing monuments of George Washington, the
nation's slave-owning first president.

On Tuesday night Mr. Carlson labeled both Ms. Duckworth,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-vice-president-joe-biden.html}{who
was born in Thailand to a Thai mother of Chinese descent and a white
American veteran father}, and the Somali-born Representative Ilhan Omar
of Minnesota, ``vandals'' who hate the United States because they have
called attention to its historical racism and inequities.

``There are many of us here who do like this country,'' Mr. Carlson
said, as a graphic on the screen read, ``We have to fight to preserve
our nation \& heritage.''

``We live here,'' he said. Then,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/sunday-review/coronavirus-asian-racism.html}{adopting
language used for a century by those aiming to restrict the country} to
people of Northern and Western European ancestry, he added: ``We don't
want to destroy it. We have every right to fight to preserve our nation
and our heritage and our culture.

``And when vandals like Tammy Duckworth and Ilhan Omar tell us that
we're not allowed to question their patriotism, even as they scream
about how horrible America is, we have every right to laugh in their
faces, and we should,'' Mr. Carlson said.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/07/us/politics/07carlson-01/merlin_152789664_de42ac24-b3a6-4d32-8c6f-105d59cf555e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Mr. Carlson also called Ms. Duckworth a ``moron'' on Tuesday night,
saying that to people like her, ``Washington is just some old white guy
who needs to be erased.''

He added: ``Let's tear down our statues, rename our capital city
Sharpton or Mandela and let the revolution continue. Tammy Duckworth is
not a child, at least not technically; she is a sitting United States
senator.''

Ms. Duckworth's ancestors served in the military as far back as the
American Revolution, a fact that is
\href{https://www.propublica.org/article/the-dig-tammy-duckworths-family-has-served-in-the-military-for-centuries}{supported
by genealogical records} and that
\href{https://twitter.com/TammyforIL/status/1280595475079598085}{she
pointed out in a tweet} responding to the Trump campaign, which had
echoed Mr. Carlson's attacks in a statement.

``My family fought for our nation's independence alongside George
Washington \& I'm a proud member of
\href{https://twitter.com/TodaysDAR}{@TodaysDAR},'' she said, referring
to the Daughters of the American Revolution. She urged the president to
``focus on ending
\href{https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hashtag_click}{\#COVID19}
\& standing up to Putin instead of wasting time trying to distract
people from your failures.''

And VoteVets, the liberal veterans organization that has pushed for Mr.
Biden to choose Ms. Duckworth as his running mate, on Wednesday morning
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rml8P9pXmXw}{posted a video}
calling Ms. Duckworth ``tough as hell'' and accusing Mr. Trump of being
scared to run against her.

``He sicced Tucker Carlson on a suicide mission to take her down,'' the
video's narrator says.

Mr. Carlson's comments in recent months have drawn growing criticism
even as his ratings have remained strong --- the best on his network in
June. Advertisers, under pressure to disassociate themselves from his
show,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/business/media/tucker-carlson-advertisers-ratings.html}{have
fled to other Fox News programming}.

Nativist attacks on Democratic women of color in Congress are hardly new
for Mr. Carlson and Mr. Trump. Ms. Omar was one of four Democratic women
who were the target of
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/trump-send-her-back-ilhan-omar.html}{send
her back}'' chants at a Trump rally in North Carolina nearly a year ago.
She is also, along with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New
York, featured in scores of Republican television ads and political
mailers as examples of what the party's candidates are fighting against.

Former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}, who is weighing adding Ms. Duckworth to his presidential
ticket, defended her during an online fund-raising event with her
Tuesday night.

Apparently referring to Mr. Trump's sharing the clip of Mr. Carlson's
Monday night monologue, Mr. Biden said: ``I can't tell you how I felt
today when I heard the president of the United States, Donald Trump,
questioning your patriotism. I found it virtually disgusting,
sickening.''

He added, ``It's a reflection of the depravity of what's going on in the
White House right now.''

Ms. Duckworth did not address Mr. Carlson during the Biden fund-raiser,
but on Twitter on Monday night
\href{https://twitter.com/SenDuckworth/status/1280313123887603712}{she
invited him} to ``walk a mile in my legs and then tell me whether or not
I love America.''
