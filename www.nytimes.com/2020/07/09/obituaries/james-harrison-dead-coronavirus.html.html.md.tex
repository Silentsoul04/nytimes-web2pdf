The piano was at the center of James Harrison's life.

For his classes in music theory at Hunter College in Manhattan, he did a
great deal of teaching while sitting at it, playing musical excerpts as
he explained the inner workings of harmony and counterpoint.

A Steinway grand piano was the centerpiece of Mr. Harrison's home in
Palisades, N.J. He turned a commodious room with strikingly tall
ceilings into an inviting, acoustically lively space. He hosted regular
informal performances there, inviting instrumentalists and singers to
make music for gatherings of 20 or so friends.

Mr. Harrison
\href{https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=james-harrison\&pid=196277434\&fhid=17032}{died
on May 24} at a rehabilitation facility in Cresskill, N.J., of
complications of Covid-19, his daughter, Laura Harrison, said. He was
84.

James Stanley Harrison was born on Aug. 29, 1935, in St. Louis to
Stanley Leonard Harrison, a physician, and Garnet (Toalson) Harrison, an
administrative assistant in her husband's practice.

An exceptional student who excelled at football and soccer at John
Burroughs School in St. Louis, he then attended Harvard College,
graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in music in 1957. He continued
his training under the renowned musical pedagogue
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/23/archives/nadia-boulanger-teacher-of-top-composers-dies-onewoman-graduate.html\#:~:text=Nadia\%20Boulanger\%2C\%20the\%20French\%20teacher,in\%20coma\%20for\%20three\%20weeks.}{Nadia
Boulanger} at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France. There
he met Marina Biaggi de Blasys, a gifted Italian pianist and another
Boulanger student. They married in 1961.

Mr. Harrison was invited to teach at Fontainebleau, and he and his wife
lived for several years in France and in Switzerland, where Mr. Harrison
was an apprentice to the influential German conductor Hermann Scherchen.

Mr. Harrison had originally intended to become an orchestra conductor.
But, encouraged by Boulanger, he followed her path and became a teacher
of music theory and counterpoint. His time at Hunter College began in
1969 and lasted nearly three decades; it included stints as chair of the
music department and dean of arts and humanities.

In addition to his daughter, Mr. Harrison is survived by his wife; a
son, Phil; a sister, Sue Rodgers; and three grandchildren.

Mrs. Harrison grew up near Genoa, Italy, in her family's splendid villa,
which has been turned into the grounds of a residential fellowship
program for the arts and humanities run by the
\href{https://www.bfny.org/}{Bogliasco Foundation}, which Mr. Harrison
co-founded in 1991. He became its director after retiring from Hunter
College. His daughter now runs it.

In a 2011 interview with RAI, the Italian broadcaster, Mr. Harrison
spoke of the foundation's role. ``If, for example, a philosopher from
Israel and an Australian composer can become friends through a daily
exchange of ideas,'' he said, ``we feel we are doing something important
for global culture.''

At an awards ceremony for the foundation in 2007, Mr. Harrison described
the study center as a paradise ``where time seems to stand still, and
the creativity of our fellows is boundless.''
