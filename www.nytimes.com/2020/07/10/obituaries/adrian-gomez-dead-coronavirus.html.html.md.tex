52}\label{adrian-gomez-who-cared-for-migrant-youth-is-dead-at-52}}

He worked at a shelter in Texas and as a juvenile probation officer; he
wanted, his daughter said, to make a difference. He died of
complications of the novel coronavirus.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

The Trump administration's practice of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/family-separation-trump.html}{separating
parents from children} in families crossing the border illegally from
Mexico has received plenty of attention in recent years. So have the
shelters to which those children and unaccompanied migrant teenagers are
sent, like the one operated by the nonprofit
\href{https://southwestkey.org/}{Southwest Key Programs} in a former
Walmart superstore in Brownsville, Texas.

Less notice goes to the people employed by those shelters, like Adrian
Gomez, who worked for Southwest Key for 18 years. He was an assistant
program director at a smaller shelter run by Southwest Key in
Brownsville.

Mr. Gomez died on June 26 in a Brownsville hospital. He was 52. The
cause was complications of the novel coronavirus, his daughter, Alysha
Lynn Harrington, said.

His death prompted an outpouring of online condolences from friends and
colleagues who recalled his commitment as an elementary-school coach, as
a Cameron County juvenile probation officer, as a personal trainer at a
gym and as a shelter employee.

His job at the shelter, a relatively small one, was to make sure the
young people he supervised were properly housed and educated while they
were seeking asylum or until they were reunited with their families, and
also to help find more permanent homes for migrant youth who were
granted asylum after crossing the border by themselves through a program
of the Texas Council of Child Welfare Boards.

``He chose his profession because he wanted to make a difference in
others' lives,'' Ms. Harrington said. ``He cared about his clients and
helped them by getting them on the right path to a bright future. He
wanted them to have a good education and to live happily. He loved
everyone and had a huge heart.''

Mr. Gomez was born on April 13, 1968, in Brownsville and rarely ventured
much beyond the city, which abuts the border next to Matamoros, Mexico.
He remained closest to his mother, Maria de Gomez, who along with his
daughter survives him, as do his brother John Gomez; his sister,
Marisela Erwin; and two grandchildren.

He earned a bachelor of science degree in criminal justice at the
University of Texas in Brownsville and worked for Southwest Key for 18
years.

``He had no underlying health issues,'' Ms. Harrington said. ``He was 52
and could have had many more years ahead of him.''
