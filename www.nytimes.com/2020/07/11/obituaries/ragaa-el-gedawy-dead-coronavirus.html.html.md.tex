\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in

CAIRO --- Ragaa el-Gedawy was rarely the leading lady of the movies she
starred in, but that did little to diminish her standing as one of
Egypt's most beloved actors.

In a prolific career that spanned six decades, from the golden age of
Egyptian cinema in the 1950s until a few months ago, Ms. el-Gedawy had
roles in more than 300 plays, films and television series. Her
combination of grace, naturalism and comic skill, honed by a relentless
work ethic, made her a cherished favorite of successive generations.

``She was the quaint actress everyone loved,'' said Joseph Fahim, an
Egyptian film critic. ``And she was super funny. She would steal the
screen from other actors with her lightness.''

Ms. el-Gedawy died on July 5 at an isolation hospital in her hometown,
Ismailia, on the Suez Canal, after a six-week battle with Covid-19, her
daughter, Amira Mokhtar, said. She was 85.

Among those mourning her death was the Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van
Damme, who had met her a few months earlier. ``She was so full of life,
cheerful and majestic,''
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CCSrVanFNwJ/?utm_source=ig_embed}{he
wrote} in a tribute on Instagram that circulated widely in the Arab
world, where Ms. el-Gedawy was recognized as a stalwart of Egypt's
once-dominant movie industry.

She was born Nagaat Aly Hassan el-Gedawy (she changed her first name
when she began her acting career) on Sept. 6, 1934, the youngest of
five, at a time when Egypt was under indirect British colonial rule. Her
parents --- Aly el-Gedawy, a lawyer, and Noon-Fatma el-Gamil ---
divorced when she was young, and she and her sister were sent to Cairo
to live with their aunt,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/22/arts/tahia-carioca-79-dies-a-renowned-belly-dancer.html}{Tahia
Carioca}, one of the most celebrated belly dancers of the age.

Ms. el-Gedawy was educated by Franciscan nuns at a prestigious boarding
school, where she learned English, Italian and French. To support her
mother, she worked first at a public parking lot, then as a translator.
In 1958, she entered a beauty pageant and was crowned Miss Cotton Egypt.
Show business beckoned.

In 1959 she had a role in the movie ``The Nightingale's Prayer,'' which
Egypt nominated as its entry in the foreign-language category at the
Academy Awards that year. She worked briefly as a model in France before
returning home to star alongside Omar Sharif and Soad Hosny in the
comedy ``A Rumor of Love'' (1960).

In 1970 she married Hassan Mokhtar, the goalkeeper of the Ismailia
soccer team, who later helped coach the national team. He died in 2016.
In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a granddaughter.

The second stage of Ms. el-Gedawy's career started in the 1990s after
she appeared in several plays with Adel Imam, one of Egypt's most
celebrated comic actors.

A flood of roles came her way, often as mothers, aristocrats or elegant
businesswomen. In recent years, her work came mostly on the TV series
that air during the holy month of Ramadan, when families gather around
screens to gorge on their favorite shows after a meal to break the daily
fast.

She had a reputation as a lively, unpretentious and hard-working actor,
sometimes appearing in up to six TV series in one year.

She fell ill in late May, the day after she finished shooting her last
series, ``Game of Oblivion,'' and tested positive for the novel
coronavirus. When health officials rushed her to the hospital,
accusations surfaced that she was receiving preferential treatment at a
time when many ordinary Egyptians were struggling to get help.

Yet for her many fans, it was the start of a worrisome vigil.
