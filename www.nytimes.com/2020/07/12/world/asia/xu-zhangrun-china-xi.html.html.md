An outspoken Chinese law professor who has denounced the Communist
Party’s harsh policies under Xi Jinping was released from detention on
Sunday, a week after [the police took him
away](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/world/asia/china-detains-xu-zhangrun-critic.html),
two people familiar with the professor said.

The professor, Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University in Beijing, has been
one of the few Chinese academics willing to openly and bluntly criticize
the Chinese government. In two [essays this
year](https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/viral-alarm-when-fury-overcomes-fear),
he said that official delay and prevarication had stoked the coronavirus
outbreak that emerged in China late last year.

“When decisions lead to policy failure, not only should the course be
corrected, those responsible must acknowledge their mistakes, appeal in
all humility for public forgiveness and be held accountable,” Professor
Xu wrote in [an
essay](https://www.chinese-future.org/articles/6j3ywr3swgp3flagdlbk3xd2wkmjcj)
in May, [according to a
translation](http://chinaheritage.net/journal/remonstrating-with-beijing-xu-zhangruns-advice-to-chinas-national-peoples-congress-21-may-2020/)
by Geremie R. Barmé, an Australian Sinologist.

Professor Xu, 57, first attracted widespread notice in 2018 for a [long
essay](http://chinaheritage.net/journal/imminent-fears-immediate-hopes-a-beijing-jeremiad/)
that lamented China’s increasingly authoritarian turn under Mr. Xi, the
Communist Party leader. Soon after taking power, Mr. Xi [launched a
drive to
discredit](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/world/asia/chinas-new-leadership-takes-hard-line-in-secret-memo.html)
liberal ideas such as universal human rights and constitutional limits
on party power.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Professor Xu was [barred from teaching and
research](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/world/asia/chinese-law-professor-xi.html)
by Tsinghua University last year, sharply reducing his income, and he
has been warned about his criticisms of the Chinese government. Even so,
he has continued to write trenchant essays that have been published
abroad, and told friends that he accepted the possibility of detention.

The police took Professor Xu from his home in north Beijing on Monday,
and friends said that officers accused him of using prostitutes while
traveling in southwest China, an accusation the friends called a
malicious slur. The detention prompted widespread criticism abroad,
including from the Trump administration and the [European
Union](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/82435/china-statement-spokesperson-5th-anniversary-%E2%80%9C709-crackdown%E2%80%9D-human-rights-lawyers-and_en).

“We are deeply concerned by the PRC’s detention of Professor Xu Zhangrun
for criticizing Chinese leaders amid tightening ideological controls on
university campuses in China,” Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. State Department, [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/statedeptspox/status/1280529327826837504),
referring to the People’s Republic of China.

Two people familiar with the professor and his family said that he
returned to his home on Sunday morning. Both people asked that their
names not be used, citing fear of recrimination by the Chinese
authorities.

The police in Changping, the northern district of Beijing where the
professor lives, did not confirm his release, just as they did not
confirm his detention last week.
