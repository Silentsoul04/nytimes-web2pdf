But the Texas Supreme Court said the state Republican Party could not
force a Houston venue to host its convention. A new poll in Texas,
meanwhile, showed Joe Biden leading President Trump.

And spikes in Covid-19 cases in G.O.P.-led states from [southeast to
southwest](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).

Republicans are facing major decisions this week across the Sun Belt as
the party tries to chart a course through a political moment defined not
just by health and economic crises but also the unsteady and
increasingly unpopular leadership of Mr. Trump.

The landscape for the president is so tough right now that Democrats are
even encouraging Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump’s opponent, to press his advantage
and [compete
aggressively](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/us/politics/trump-biden-2020-election.html)

With 16 weeks to go until the general election on Nov. 3, The Times is
expanding its live coverage of the campaigns for president, House and
Senate, and governor, as well as coverage of voters, politics and policy
across the nation.

Our reporters will be delivering daily updates, news and analysis on all
the major races and political dimensions, including voting rights and
mail-in voting, the protests against systemic racism and social
injustice, and the repercussions of the virus and the devastated economy
on the nation’s politics.

The Sun Belt is drawing particular attention this week, with [Alabama
Republicans deciding a Senate
runoff](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/politics/alabama-senate-jeff-sessions-tommy-tuberville.html)
on Tuesday between Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump’s former attorney general,
and Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump has endorsed Mr. Tuberville against his onetime ally, Mr.
Sessions, whom the president came to despise for recusing himself from
the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Most
polls in Alabama close at 8 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.

Texas also has primary runoffs on Tuesday for several key House seats,
as well as a Democratic Senate primary runoff between M.J. Hegar and
State Senator Royce West; the winner will face Senator John Cornyn in
November. In Maine, Democrats will choose a nominee on Tuesday [to face
Senator Susan
Collins](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/us/politics/susan-collins-maine-sara-gideon.html),
with Sara Gideon, the speaker of the Maine House, widely seen as the
likely winner.

In Florida, state officials on Sunday reported [the highest single-day
total](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/florida-coronavirus-covid-cases.html)
of new coronavirus cases by any state since the start of the pandemic,
with more than 15,000 new infections. (New York had recorded the
previous high of 12,274 on April 4.) New cases are increasing across the
Sun Belt, [as this map
shows](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
and Republican governors like Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of
Texas face criticism for their decisions to begin reopening their states
weeks
ago.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than a dozen Republican National Committee members from across the
country told The Times in interviews that they were still planning to
attend the party’s convention next month in Florida, despite the surge
in cases.

President Trump last month moved the convention from Charlotte, N.C., to
Jacksonville, Florida’s largest city, because Gov. Roy Cooper of North
Carolina refused to guarantee a late-August arena party free of social
distancing. Several of the R.N.C. members interviewed are planning to
first go to Charlotte, where the party’s delegates will conduct much of
their official business, before relocating to Jacksonville for the big
party so desired by Mr. Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s a risk you have to take,” said Morton Blackwell, 80, an R.N.C.
member from Virginia who has attended every party convention since he
was the youngest elected delegate backing Barry Goldwater in 1964. “You
take risks every day. You drive down the street and a cement truck could
crash into you. You can’t not do what you have to do because of some
possibility of a bad result.”

Art Wittich, 62, an R.N.C. member from Montana, said he had a “duty” to
travel to Charlotte and Jacksonville to nominate and support Mr. Trump.

“It is not only my duty, but also my honor go to Charlotte and
Jacksonville to re-elect President Trump,” he said. “As such, I am
willing to assume any risk to do so.”

While a handful of Republican senators who are occasionally skeptical of
Mr. Trump — Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan
Collins of Maine, to name three — have announced they won’t go to
Jacksonville, there is very little appetite among party regulars to slim
the festivities to less than the planned three nights or switch to a
virtual convention, [as Democrats have for their event in
Milwaukee](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/democratic-convention-milwaukee-coronavirus.html),
which was originally slated to start this week. It is now scheduled to
take place in mid-August without delegates present.

The conditions that led Mr. Trump [to move the convention out of North
Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/trump-jacksonville-rnc-speech.html)
now apply equally to Florida. [Jacksonville officials late last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/rnc-masks-convention.html)
said they would require convention attendees to wear face masks, though
there has been no word yet on restricting how many people can fit inside
the city’s VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena. Republican officials are also
considering hosting some of the convention outdoors at the city’s
football or minor-league baseball stadiums.

Of course, it does tend to get hot and humid in Florida in late August.

R.N.C. members interviewed said they had little hesitancy about joining
what, as of now, is still planned as an arena full of Trump supporters
cheering his nomination.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If I can safely go to Walmart or a restaurant, I am confident we can
safely gather to conduct the important business of the Republican Party
renominating the president and vice president,” said Henry Barbour, an
R.N.C. member from Mississippi. “We were prepared to work with folks in
North Carolina to make it safe, and that is exactly what the R.N.C. is
doing in
Jacksonville.”

There has been little public polling in the race, but by several
indications, Mr. Sessions faces an uphill battle. He finished behind Mr.
Tuberville by about 12,000 votes in March, when voters first went to the
polls.

In both public and private polling conducted for the Sessions campaign
since, Mr. Sessions has been consistently down, apparently unable to
repair the damage that President Trump has inflicted on his reputation
with repeated attacks over how Mr. Sessions recused himself from the
Justice Department investigation into Russia’s election interference.

The latest public poll in the race, conducted during the first and
second week of July by Auburn University at Montgomery, showed Mr.
Sessions trailing by double digits, even as Mr. Tuberville faced new
questions about [his
involvement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/us/politics/tommy-tuberville-senate-hedge-fund.html)
in a hedge fund that turned out to be a fraud.

The
[poll](http://aum.edu/new-aum-poll-shows-tuberville-leading-sessions-senate-runoff-election)
found Mr. Tuberville ahead 47 percent to 31 percent. Still, a
considerable portion of the people surveyed — 22 percent — said they had
not made up their minds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Sessions said in a brief interview on Monday afternoon that his
recent appearance on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” had “electrified” his
campaign. He appeared last Tuesday [on Mr. Carlson’s Fox News
show,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORR2obSy_yM) where the host
praised the Republican as “one of the very few politicians I do
respect.”

“We had $30,000 — small-dollar contributions — come in right after
that,” Mr. Sessions said in between conversations with voters at a
Cracker Barrel in Mobile.

.

Mr. Sessions declined to answer directly whether he would support Mr.
Tuberville in the general election in the event that he does not win the
runoff race against him. But he criticized his opponent for his regular
refusal to engage with the news media.

“I’d like for y’all to ask Tommy Tuberville of that,” Mr. Sessions told
reporters. “What’s he going to — who’s he going to support after the
runoff if he loses? Where is he? He’s not available. He’s been hiding
out now for two weeks.”

“Look, I’m a strong Republican,” Mr. Sessions added. “We need to win
this seat.”

## Trump embraces law enforcement, seeking a contrast with Biden.

President Trump on Monday assailed a broad movement to defund police
departments, invoking the kind of pro-police language that won him
support with the law enforcement community in 2016 and ignoring the
calls for reform that have helped shape this election.

Democrats “want to defund, and they want to abolish,” Mr. Trump told a
panel at the White House composed of people who have had positive
interactions with the police.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With Mr. Trump facing an outcry over the threats he has made to
protesters calling for racial equality and police reform efforts, his
remarks on Monday were part of an effort to embrace law enforcement —
and to move away from more explicitly racist language — as polls show
him lagging behind Joseph R. Biden Jr., his presumptive Democratic
challenger.

That has meant targeting police reform efforts supported by Democrats,
such as [shifting
funding](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/politics/house-police-reform-legislation-vote/index.html)
from police departments to social services like mental health and
substance abuse counseling. Mr. Trump has called the defunding efforts
[a
fad](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/10/trump-defund-the-police-fad-356442),
but last month, [he

The president also painted a dark picture of the United States should
Mr. Biden win.

“The radical politicians are waging war on innocent Americans,” Mr.
Trump said. “If that’s what you want for a country, you probably have to
vote for Sleepy Joe Biden because he doesn’t know what’s happening, but
you are not going to have that with me.”

of defunding police departments.

[Mr. Trump and his campaign](https://apnews.com/afs:Content:9083703494)

police, but Mr. Biden has actually opposed them. The former vice
president’s spokesman has said he supported the need for an “urgent”
overhaul after several police killings of Black men and

## R.N.C. official tweets, and then deletes, a photo of Biden and his young son at a Redskins game.

A spokesman for the Republican National Committee on Monday tweeted and
then deleted a photograph showing one of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s sons,
then a young child, wearing a Washington Redskins hat, in the latest
example of [disjointed Republican efforts to
define](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/biden-trump.html) the
presumptive Democratic nominee.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Hey Joe Biden, are you still a Redskins fan?” wrote Steve Guest, the
R.N.C. official, before deleting the tweet amid online backlash.

His remark came on the same day that the football team announced it
would retire its name, which is [considered a racial
slur](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/football/washington-redskins-new-name.html).
President Trump has expressed support for the moniker [and
complained](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/sports/football/washington-team-name-change.html)
that the name change was being considered “in order to be politically
correct.”

The moment highlighted how Republicans have careened between seeking to
tie Mr. Biden, 77, to the most progressive elements of his party, and
seizing on his age and lengthy political record to cast him as
out-of-touch with his party’s zeitgeist.

Mr. Guest did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Several Twitter users posted screenshots of his tweet after he had
deleted it.

remind many of Mr. Biden’s [history of family
tragedy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/joe-biden-funeral-speech.html),
a subject that Mr. Biden has often used to [connect with grieving
voters.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/joe-biden-beau-biden-death.html)

In the photograph, Mr. Biden holds one young son, who wears the
team-logo hat, with his head turned toward another son. A Biden campaign
official estimated that the photograph was taken around 1974, and did
not say which son was wearing the hat.

In 1972, Mr. Biden lost his first wife and a baby daughter in a car
crash, while his two sons, Beau and Hunter, suffered injuries. Mr. Biden
was sworn in to the Senate a few months after the accident at the
hospital as they recovered.

Decades later, Beau Biden died of brain cancer.

## The D.N.C.’s ‘war room’ is the tip of the spear to attack Trump.

Democrats are expanding their attacks against President Trump, adding
new firepower to their offensive operation as the campaign barrels into
the final fall stretch.

At the direction of the Biden campaign, the party is expanding the
Democratic National Committee “war room,” a 35-person operation that was
started in 2017. The group will become the central Democratic
clearinghouse for attacking the incumbent president, a challenge
Democrats last faced in 2004.

Led by Adrienne Watson and Nick Bauer, two operatives who’ve been
focused on attacking Mr. Trump since the fall of 2015, the war room is
planning to expand its advertising effort and bring in aides who worked
for some of this year’s Democratic presidential candidates.

Biden staffers say the decision to run a key campaign operation out of
the party committee reflects the remote nature of campaigning during a
pandemic, a desire to conserve campaign dollars and the expertise built
up at the committee over the past four years.

The D.N.C.’s ads and messaging portray Mr. Trump as undone by his own
narcissism, prioritizing his political interests and ego over the kind
of expertise needed to battle a deadly pandemic.

In recent weeks, Mr. Trump seems to be sustaining the most [damage from
self-inflicted
wounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/trump-2020-campaign-problems.html).
But Ms. Watson said Democrats could not count on Mr. Trump defeating
himself, pointing to plenty of other examples — like the [release of the
“Access Hollywood”
tape](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/politics/donald-trump-access-hollywood.html)
in 2016 — when Democrats began writing his political obituary.

In Texas, where the number of [infections and deaths have
spiked](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html)
in recent weeks, the State Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit on Monday
that had been filed by Republicans over the cancellation of their state
party convention.

The court, an elected body made up entirely of Republicans, [ruled 7
to 1](https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1448816/200525.pdf) that while the
Republican Party of Texas had a constitutional right to hold a
convention in person, it did not extend to forcing a convention center
to host the gathering during a pandemic.

“The Party argues it has constitutional rights to hold a convention and
engage in electoral activities, and that is unquestionably true,” the
court’s majority wrote. “But those rights do not allow it to simply
commandeer use of the Center.”

The convention had been scheduled to start on Monday at the George R.
Brown Convention Center in Houston and run until Saturday.

But the Houston First Corporation, directed by the city’s mayor,
Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, [terminated a licensing agreement last
week for the use of the convention center by the state Republican
Party](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/coronavirus-texas-republican-convention-gop.html).
The corporation, a government entity that manages several city-owned
buildings, cited “the unprecedented scope and severity of the Covid-19
epidemic in Houston.”

to blunt the progress of the pandemic.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The state Republican Party sued the Houston First Corporation,
contending that the city-run convention center had breached the terms of
its agreement. Later on Monday, the state Republican Party announced
that it would vote on whether to [hold its convention

that the cancellation was politically motivated.

“We believe that Mayor Turner used his control of city-owned property to
disenfranchise Republicans and attempt to deny them the opportunity to
cast their votes for national delegates and electors in-person in
Houston,” he
said.

Could Texas really be in play for Joseph R. Biden Jr.? It’s a question
political observers — and even the Biden campaign — are intensely
debating.

On Sunday, a [Dallas Morning News
poll](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2020/07/12/joe-biden-builds-lead-over-donald-trump-in-reliably-red-texas-as-voters-sour-on-handling-of-virus/)
showed Mr. Biden had the support of 46 percent of the state’s registered
voters, compared with 41 percent for President Trump.

Other recent polls have suggested a close race in Texas, but this was
the first public survey to show Mr. Biden leading outside the margin of
error.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As Mr. Trump’s poll numbers sag, [Mr. Biden’s campaign is seriously
considering
investments](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/us/politics/trump-biden-2020-election.html)
in states that just months ago Democrats considered out of reach — the
biggest prize being Texas, with its 38 electoral votes.

The state has voted Republican in every presidential election since
Jimmy Carter won it in 1976, but Democrats see an opportunity to turn
that around, driven by Texas’ growing Hispanic population and increasing
frustration with Mr. Trump among independent voters.

The Morning News poll also found that M.J. Hegar, the Democratic
establishment’s choice to challenge Senator John Cornyn in November, was
on track to win Tuesday’s primary runoff.

In addition to the presidential and Senate races, Texas presents
Democrats with numerous realistic opportunities to pick up House seats
this year. A strong showing in November could also help Democrats
capture a majority in the Texas State House and on the State Supreme
Court. Both bodies could play a crucial role in the redistricting
battles that are sure to follow the 2020
census.

Even in California, where an already robust mail-in voting program will
be expanded to the entire electorate this fall, the obstacles of
conducting elections through the postal system during a pandemic are now
quantifiable.

More than 100,000 ballots cast by mail for the March 3 primary elections
were voided by election officials, who determined in most cases that
voters had missed a deadline for sending them in, data released by the
California Secretary of State’s office showed on Monday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to the office, 70,330 of the 102,428 rejected mail-in ballots
did not arrive within a three-day grace period after the primary. The
ballots had to be postmarked on or before March 3.

The accounting of rejected ballots followed Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signing
of a bill last month that will [require mail-in ballots to be sent to
all of the nearly 21 million registered voters in the
state](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article243636972.html)
for the November election.

The second leading cause for the ballots to be rejected was that they
were unsigned or the voter’s signature did not match the name on the
election rolls, according to the data, which was [first reported by The
Associated Press](https://apnews.com/a45421048cd89938df7c882891a97db5).

In Los Angeles County, the state’s most populous county, 17,743 mail-in
ballots were rejected.

Nearly seven million mail-in ballots were accepted for the primary,
which was headlined by the Democratic presidential nominating contest.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont [won the
state](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/03/us/elections/results-california-president-democrat-primary-election.html),
though Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s dominance in other Super Tuesday races
helped him establish a lead in the delegate count.

In November, election officials must accept mail-in ballots for up to 17
days after Election Day under the bill signed by Mr. Newsom. The ballots
must be postmarked by Nov. 3.

A “Where’s My Ballot?” vote-by-mail tracking tool that uses text message
notifications will also be expanded statewide, Sam Mahood, a spokesman
for the secretary of state’s office, wrote in an
email.

## George Soros’s foundation is making a major donation toward racial justice efforts.

The Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic group founded by the
billionaire George Soros, will announce on Monday that it is investing
$220 million in efforts to achieve racial equality in the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The investment, a huge financial undertaking that comes during an
extraordinary protest movement, will immediately reshape the landscape
of Black political and civil rights organizations and support several of
them for years to come.

“There is this call for justice in Black and brown communities, an
explosion of not just sympathy but solidarity across the board,” said
Patrick Gaspard, the president of Open Society. “So it’s time to double
down.”

Of the $220 million, the foundation will invest $150 million in
five-year grants for selected groups, including progressive and emerging
organizations like the Black Voters Matter Fund and Repairers of the
Breach, a group founded by the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II of the Poor
People’s Campaign.

The money will also support more established Black political
organizations like the Equal Justice Initiative, which was founded by
the civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson and depicted in the 2019 movie
“Just Mercy.”

The Open Society Foundations will invest an additional $70 million in
local grants supporting changes to policing and criminal justice. This
money will also be used for civic engagement opportunities.

Even before Monday’s announcement, progressive groups, Democratic
candidates and racial justice organizations had been flooded with
small-dollar donations, breaking giving records and allowing [Joseph R.

After President Trump [canceled his planned outdoor rally
Saturday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-nh-rally-postponed.html)
because his campaign said there were concerns about a looming tropical
storm, the rain never came, leaving Portsmouth, N.H., with a lovely New
England summer day (and reporters with [no news to
cover](https://twitter.com/DJJudd/status/1281660158951788545?s=20)).

The schedule change — technically a postponement — left local Trump
supporters eager for the president to appear.

“The worst job in the world could be the weatherman because they’re
always wrong,” said Chris Ager, a Republican national committeeman from
New Hampshire. “There was initial disappointment that it was postponed
because there was so much excitement and enthusiasm. Then with the
weather, Monday morning quarterbacking is always great.”

Mr. Trump’s planned Portsmouth rally was to be his return to the
campaign trail after he filled just one-third of an arena in Tulsa last
month, a major embarrassment after his campaign manager bragged that
more than one million supporters had requested tickets. The event was to
take place outside and under a hangar at the Portsmouth International
Airport.

Mr. Ager and Juliana Bergeron, New Hampshire’s other R.N.C. member, both
said they believed the president would have drawn a large enough crowd
to fill the airport space had the event taken place.

“I’m over in the southwest corner of the state and I received tons of
calls” for tickets, Ms. Bergeron said. “If it had been a terrible storm
everybody would have said he should have canceled it.”

Howie Hawkins, the Syracuse activist who is a perpetual candidate for
state and local office in New York and who won the Green Party’s 2020
presidential nomination, said his party owed a debt of gratitude to Jill
Stein, who remains widely blamed by Democrats for siphoning votes away
from Hillary Clinton in her narrow loss to President Trump.

“The Green Party moves forward, standing on the shoulders of Jill Stein,
and her running mates, Cheri Honkala and Ajamu Baraka,” Mr. Hawkins
[said in his nomination acceptance speech
Saturday](https://howiehawkins.us/hawkins-nomination-speech/?utm_source=Press+and+Media&utm_campaign=2dae87db3a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_07_11_09_39&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_79662d9b1d-2dae87db3a-25987978&mc_cid=2dae87db3a&mc_eid=ff2e4bed0d).
“They brought the Green Party to another level in 2012 and again in
2016.”

Ms. Stein, who was the party’s presidential nominee in both of those
elections and [who has declined to seek the nomination this
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/green-party-midterm-elections.html),
argued during her campaigns that there was little difference between the
major-party candidates. The Senate Intelligence Committee in 2017 [said
it was investigating links between Ms. Stein’s
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/jill-stein-russian-election-interference-senate-intelligence.html)
and Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Mr. Hawkins credited Ms. Stein for the Green New Deal, which the Green
Party touted for years but didn’t become a Democratic Party staple until
after the 2018 midterm elections, when Representative Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez arrived in Congress.

“Jill Stein put the Green New Deal, the signature issue of the Green
Party in the 2010s, onto the national agenda,” Mr. Hawkins said. “But
the Democrats have taken the slogan and watered down the content.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Hawkins also joined many Democrats in criticizing former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for conducting his campaign largely from
his Delaware home because of coronavirus concerns.

“Where the hell is Joe Biden?” Mr. Hawkins said. “He lives within
commuter distance of the White House press corps. He can command their
attention. He should be holding news conferences and pounding away at
what we need now — a test, trace, and isolate program to suppress the
virus, like most other organized countries around the world.”
