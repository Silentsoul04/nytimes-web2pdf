\section{New York Judge Clears Publication of Trump
Tell-All}\label{new-york-judge-clears-publication-of-trump-tell-all}}

In his ruling, Judge Hal B. Greenwald dismissed the argument by the
Trump family that a 2001 confidentiality agreement applied to the book,
which goes on sale on Tuesday.

A New York judge ruled on Monday that Mary L. Trump, the niece of
President Trump, could legally go ahead with the publication of her
explosive tell-all memoir about her famous family, ending a whirlwind of
last-minute litigation to try to stop the book.

The decision by the judge, Hal B. Greenwald of State Supreme Court in
Dutchess County, was largely a symbolic victory, given that it came on
the eve of the official release of the book, ``Too Much and Never
Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man,'' which is
already in print and has
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/us/politics/mary-trump-book.html}{received
enormous public attention}.

The memoir reveals what Ms. Trump has described as a number of family
secrets, including an allegation that as a young man Donald J. Trump
paid someone to take his college entrance exams on his behalf. It also
describes how Mr. Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a former federal
judge, considered him ``a clown'' who had ``no principles.''

Last week, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said the
book was filled with ``falsehoods.''

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/mary-trump-book-court.html}{The
fight over the book} began last month, when the Trump family, led by
Robert S. Trump, the president's younger brother, sought to enjoin Ms.
Trump and her publisher, Simon \& Schuster, from releasing it, arguing
that a confidentiality agreement she signed nearly 20 years ago forbade
her from revealing family secrets. The secrecy pact was agreed to as
part of a settlement of a group of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/nyregion/mary-trump-book.html}{long-simmering
disputes} concerning the will of the family patriarch, Fred Trump Sr.,
the president's father and Ms. Trump's grandfather.

In his ruling on Monday night, Judge Greenwald said that the
confidentiality agreement could not be used to stop Ms. Trump or Simon
\& Schuster from publishing the book because the secrecy provision was
narrowly tailored to the disagreements about the will, not about any
subject related to the Trumps.

``Why would a 2001 settlement of two estate matters and a local Supreme
Court case contain a clause prohibiting the parties to these actions to
ever speak again about their relationships?'' Judge Greenwald wrote.

He also noted that since the book was already in print and would go on
sale Tuesday morning, Simon \& Schuster would face ``immense costs'' if
publication were to be stopped. Judge Greenwald said the public had a
right to hear Ms. Trump's stories about what she called her
dysfunctional family.

``The Trumps were local in 2001,'' Judge Greenwald wrote, referring to
the year when the confidentiality agreement was reached. ``The leader of
the Trump family in 2020 is global.''

Charles Harder, a lawyer for Robert Trump, did not immediately respond
to an email seeking comment.

But in a statement released on Monday night, a spokesman for Ms. Trump
said, ``The White House and America are looking forward to finally
hearing what Mary has to say.''

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., Ms. Trump's lawyer, also issued a statement,
saying that Judge Greenwald had ruled correctly in the case.

``The First Amendment forbids prior restraints because they are
intolerable infringements on the right to participate in democracy,''
Mr. Boutrous said. ``Tomorrow, the American public will be able to read
Mary's important words for themselves.''

Simon \& Schuster also praised Judge Greenwald's ruling.

``The unfettered right to publish is a sacred American freedom and a
founding principle of our republic,'' the publisher wrote in a
statement. ``We applaud the court for affirming well-established
precedents against prior restraint and pre-publication injunctions.''
