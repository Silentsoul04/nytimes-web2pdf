Researchers on Tuesday reported strong evidence that the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/health/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html)
can be transmitted [from a pregnant woman to a
fetus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17436-6).

A baby born in a Paris hospital in March to a mother with Covid-19
tested positive for the virus and developed symptoms of inflammation in
his brain, said Dr. Daniele De Luca, who led the research team and is
chief of the division of pediatrics and neonatal critical care at
Paris-Saclay University Hospitals. The baby, now more than 3 months old,
recovered without treatment and is “very much improved, almost
clinically normal,” Dr. De Luca said, adding that the mother, who needed
oxygen during the delivery, is healthy.

Dr. De Luca said the virus appeared to have been transmitted through the
placenta of the 23-year-old mother.

Since the pandemic began, there have been isolated cases of newborns who
have tested positive for the coronavirus, but there has not been enough
evidence to rule out the possibility that the infants became infected by
the mother after they were born, experts said. A recently published
[case in
Texas](https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/9000/INTRAUTERINE_TRANSMISSION_OF_SARS_COV_2_INFECTION.96099.aspx),
of a newborn who tested positive for Covid-19 and had mild respiratory
symptoms, provided more convincing evidence that transmission of the
virus during pregnancy can occur.

In the Paris case, Dr. De Luca said, the team was able to test the

blood.

The testing indicated that “the virus reaches the placenta and
replicates there,” Dr. De Luca said. It can then be transmitted to a
fetus, which “can get infected and have symptoms similar to adult
Covid-19 patients.”

A study of the case was published on Tuesday in the journal Nature
Communications.

Dr. Yoel Sadovsky, executive director of Magee-Womens Research Institute
at the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study, said
he thought the claim of placental transmission was “fairly convincing.”
He said the relatively high levels of the coronavirus found in the
placenta and the rising levels of virus in the baby and the evidence of
placental inflammation, along with the baby’s symptoms, “are all
consistent with SARS-CoV-2
[infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/health/coronavirus-schools-reopening.html).”

Still, Dr. Sadovsky said, it is important to note that cases of possible
coronavirus transmission in utero appear to be extremely rare. With
other viruses, including Zika and rubella, placental infection and
transmission is much more common, he said. With the coronavirus, he
said, “we are trying to understand the opposite — what underlies the
relative protection of the fetus and the placenta?”

[Another study](https://elifesciences.org/articles/58716) published on
Tuesday in eLife, an online research journal, may help answer that
question. It found that while cells in the placenta had many of the
receptor proteins that allow viruses to propagate, there was evidence of
only “negligible” amounts of a key cell surface receptor and an enzyme
that are known to be involved in allowing the coronavirus to enter cells
and replicate. The study was led by Dr. Robert Romero, chief of the
perinatology research branch at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver ** National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

The report from doctors in Paris said that the woman was 35 weeks
pregnant when she came to the hospital with a fever and a cough that she
developed a couple of days earlier in what was an otherwise healthy
pregnancy. She tested positive for the coronavirus. After three days,
fetal heart monitoring indicated signs of distress, and the baby was
delivered by emergency cesarean
section.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

The baby was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit and was
connected to a ventilator for about six hours, the authors reported. He
seemed to be doing well, but on his third day he became irritable, had
trouble feeding and was experiencing muscle spasms and rigidity.

A brain scan showed some injury to the white matter, which Dr. De Luca
said resembled symptoms of meningitis or inflammation in the brain. He
tested negative for other viruses or bacterial infections that could
have caused such symptoms, while tests of his blood and fluid from his
lungs were positive for coronavirus infection, the authors said. The
baby gradually recovered and left the hospital after 18 days.

The authors said that the highest levels of the coronavirus were found
in the placenta, higher than those in the amniotic fluid and in the
blood of the mother and baby, which Dr. De Luca said suggested that the
virus might be able to replicate in placental cells.

Dr. De Luca, who is also the president-elect of the European Society for
Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care, said his team was analyzing other
suspected cases of placental transmission of the coronavirus.

“This will be helpful for clinicians and policymakers in order to manage
pregnant women, check neonates and reduce the risk of viral transmission
from mothers to neonates,” he said, adding, “The good news is that the
baby recovered spontaneously and gradually despite all this, and this
confirms that the disease is milder in early infancy.”
