# Government Carries Out First Federal Execution in 17 Years

</div>

Hours after a 5-to-4 vote by the Supreme Court, Daniel Lewis Lee was put
to death by lethal injection in Terre Haute, Ind., for his role in the
1996 murder of a family of three.

WASHINGTON — Hours after the Supreme Court
[rejected](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/politics/execution-daniel-lewis-lee.html)
a last-minute legal challenge on a 5-to-4 vote, the Justice Department
put a man to death for his role in the 1996 murder of a family of three,
the first [federal
execution](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/politics/wesley-ira-purkey-executed.html)
in more than 17 years.

The death row prisoner, [Daniel Lewis
Lee](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/arkansas-federal-death-penalty.html),
47, a former white supremacist who renounced his ties to that movement,
was executed by lethal injection at the federal penitentiary in Terre
Haute, Ind., the Bureau of Prisons said. He is the first of three
federal inmates scheduled for execution this week.

Mr. Lee’s death ended an informal moratorium on federal capital
punishment.

The Trump administration
[announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/executions-scheduled-four-federal-inmates-convicted-murdering-children)
last summer its intention to resume the federal death penalty and to
employ a new procedure to carry it out — using a single drug,
pentobarbital — after several botched executions by lethal injection
renewed scrutiny of capital punishment.

But up until the final hours before Mr. Lee’s death, the government had
to fight off legal challenges based on use of the single-drug technique
and the complications of carrying out the death penalty [during a
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/politics/federal-executions-pandemic.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Monday, a federal judge had delayed the execution, saying that
questions about the constitutionality of the lethal injection procedure
had not been fully litigated.

The Justice Department immediately appealed the ruling by Judge Tanya S.
Chutkan of the United States District Court in Washington. In issuing a
[preliminary
injunction](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2019mc0145-135)
against the execution of Mr. Lee, Judge Chutkan cited the “extreme pain
and needless suffering” that could result from the lethal injection
protocol the government planned to use.

The Supreme Court’s [unsigned 5-to-4
ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/20a8_970e.pdf) early
Tuesday morning said pentobarbital had been used in over 100 executions
“without incident” and had been upheld by the Supreme Court and
appeals courts.

“The plaintiffs in this case have not made the showing required to
justify last-minute intervention by a federal court,” the unsigned order
said, quoting from a [decision last
year](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf).
“‘Last-minute stays’ like that issued this morning ‘should be the
extreme exception, not the norm.’”

The court said it was its responsibility “to ensure that
method-of-execution challenges to lawfully issued sentences are resolved
fairly and expeditiously,” so that “the question of capital punishment”
can remain with “the people and their representatives, not the courts,
to resolve.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, repeated their [longstanding
doubts](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/us/politics/death-penalty-opponents-split-over-taking-issue-to-supreme-court.html)
about the constitutionality of the death penalty. “The resumption of
federal executions promises to provide examples that illustrate the
difficulties of administering the death penalty consistent with the
Constitution,” he wrote.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a second dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices
Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, said the court had acted with dangerous haste.

“Today’s decision illustrates just how grave the consequences of such
accelerated decision making can be,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. “The court
forever deprives respondents of their ability to press a constitutional
challenge to their lethal injections, and prevents lower courts from
reviewing that
challenge.”

Last month, the [Supreme Court let
stand](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/supreme-court-executions.html)
an appeals court ruling that found the government was in compliance with
the [Federal Death Penalty Act
of 1994](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3596), which
requires executions to be carried out “in the manner prescribed by the
law of the state in which the sentence is imposed.” Judge Chutkan had
[found](https://src.bna.com/MZD?_ga=2.258585482.1273884090.1575491003-907374773.1567693399)
the government in violation of the law.

Last week, family members of Mr. Lee’s victims sued the Justice
Department, arguing that traveling to the execution site would put them
at risk of contracting the coronavirus. A district court agreed and
[granted a temporary
delay](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/first-federal-execution-delay.html)
in the execution. Late Sunday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit [reversed that
decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/politics/execution-daniel-lewis-lee.html).
The Supreme Court also declined the family members’ petition early
Tuesday morning.

According to his lawyers, Mr. Lee was strapped to a gurney for the final
four hours of his life, while the legal challenges played out.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two men stood beside him in the execution chamber, a U.S. Marshal and a
spiritual adviser, whom the Bureau of Prisons referred to as an
“Appalachian pagan minister.” Neither wore a mask.

“I didn’t do it,” Mr. Lee said, according to a report from journalists
who were at the scene. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I’m
not a murderer.” He claimed the judge in his trial in Arkansas
overlooked DNA evidence that proved he was across the country at the
time of the murders.

After a senior bureau official told him that he was to be put to death,
Mr. Lee shook his head. As the drug was administered to his veins, he
raised his head to look around. Then his breaths became heavy. In just a
few short moments, his chest remained still, his lips turned blue, and
his fingers became ashy. He was pronounced dead at 8:07 a.m.

The federal government is scheduled to carry out two more executions
this week. A court has issued a [temporary
stay](http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2020/D07-13/C:19-3318:J:PerCuriam:aut:T:npDp:N:2544729:S:0)
in the case of Wesley Ira Purkey, 68, whom the Justice Department
scheduled for execution on Wednesday for the 1998 killing and
dismembering of a teenage girl in Kansas City.

Dustin Lee Honken, 52, convicted of killing three adults and two young
girls in 1993, will be executed on Friday, barring any last-minute
stays. Another prisoner, Keith Dwayne Nelson, 46, will face execution in
August for the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl in
1999.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

On Tuesday, a federal judge in Indiana dismissed a suit brought by
spiritual advisers for Mr. Purkey and Mr. Honken that argued for a delay
on the grounds that their health could be jeopardized because of the
coronavirus crisis if they entered the Terre Haute penitentiary.

The Supreme Court struck down the death penalty in 1972, arguing that it
constituted “cruel and unusual punishment.” Four years later, it
reversed that decision, amid rising rates of violent crime. Since then,
some states have carried out regular executions, but only three men have
been put to death by the federal government. Most recently, Louis Jones
Jr. was executed in 2003 for the rape and murder of a female soldier.

Although dozens of federal inmates have been sentenced to death during
the hiatus, 22 states and the District of Columbia have abolished
capital punishment altogether, and an additional three have
governor-imposed moratoriums.

President Trump has advocated the death penalty since well before he
entered the Oval Office. In 1989, he called for the Central Park Five, a
group of Latino and Black teenagers wrongly convicted of raping a
jogger, to be put to death. More recently, he has called for the death
penalty for drug dealers and those convicted of killing police officers.

His campaign has criticized his Democratic opponent, former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for opposing capital punishment “[even
for white supremacist
murderers\!](https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1274050283098734593)”

The executions scheduled for the summer come amid a presidential
election, a pandemic and intensive attention on policing and criminal
justice after the death of George Floyd.

Critics of capital punishment argue that Black offenders and
perpetrators of white victims are disproportionately sentenced to death.
The four men scheduled to be executed this summer are white, but 42
percent of prisoners on federal death row are Black.

Despite the race of the four inmates chosen by the Justice Department,
Samuel Spital, the director of litigation for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal
Defense Fund, said the resumption of the federal death penalty would
have the greatest effect on Black and Latino prisoners.

“The system is infected with racism,” he said.

In the final years of Mr. Lee’s life, several members of his victims’
family — as well as the trial judge and prosecutor — pleaded with the
government to commute his sentence to life in prison without the
possibility of parole. His accomplice in the crime, described as the
mastermind during the trial, was not sentenced to death.

“It is shameful that the government saw fit to carry out this execution
during a pandemic,” Ruth Friedman, Mr. Lee’s lawyer and the director of
the Federal Capital Habeas Project, said in a statement. “It is shameful
that the government saw fit to carry out this execution when counsel for
Danny Lee could not be present with him, and when the judges in his case
and even the family of his victims urged against it.”
