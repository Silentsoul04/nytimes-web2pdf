Who's the world's worst leader at handling the pandemic? Easy.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/virus-video-trump.html}{Donald
Trump}. Right? Well, as
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/politics/abc-ipsos-poll-trump-coronavirus/index.html}{terrible
as Mr. Trump is}, a Brazilian YouTube star, Felipe Neto, argues it's
actually his president, Jair Bolsonaro.

Presidents Trump and Bolsonaro have long
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-praises-brazil-s-far-right-president-white-house-n985116}{admired}
each other's caustic styles of governance. So it shouldn't come as a
surprise that the United States and Brazil are the only two countries in
the world
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html}{with
over a million} confirmed cases of Covid-19. It's a tight race, and to
be sure, neither government should be praised, but
the\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/americas/brazil-one-million-coronavirus-jair-bolsonaro-cases-intl/index.html}{reckless}
denial by Brazilian leadership is appalling.

Mr. Neto is not normally one to comment on politics. He usually sticks
to entertaining his 38 million followers on YouTube with his comedic
takes\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgxw_0r0s20}{on pop culture}.
But as the death toll mounts, he's become more outspoken. And his
message isn't aimed only at Brazilians --- it's also for AmericansFelipe
Neto (\href{https://twitter.com/felipeneto}{@felipeneto}) is a Brazilian
YouTube personality.
