# Rev. Vickey Gibbs, Activist in a Progressive Church, Dies at 57

Ms. Gibbs used her pulpit in Houston to treat broken parishioners in a

*This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the
coronavirus pandemic. Read about others*
[*here*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html)*.*

In the last sermon she preached, the Rev. Vickey Gibbs tied together the
deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, the refusal to wear masks, the
minimum wage, slavery, the destruction of Native Americans, Ta-Nehisi
Coates, reparations, immigration policy, excessive executive pay and
“the desire for power and money.”

It was June 7, Pentecost Sunday, and the 900-seat Resurrection
Metropolitan Community Church in Houston, where Ms. Gibbs was associate
pastor, was empty because of the pandemic. The congregants were in
virtual attendance, watching a video feed at home.

As a nation, she told them, “We have not had our Pentecost moment,”
referring to the religious belief that, after Christ’s ascension, the
Holy Spirit descended on his disciples to begin Christianity’s mission
in the world. Her answer: “Repent, be baptized, seek and give
forgiveness, begin to build bridges of reconciliation.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She died barely a month later, on July 10, of pneumonia brought on by
the novel coronavirus, her wife, Cassandra White, said. She was 57.

Ms. Gibbs had been part of Resurrection for almost 40 years, since she
looked in one day and saw a room full of mostly gay white men — a home,
and also a challenge. She was a young lesbian raised in the Missionary
Baptist church, and Resurrection became a place to find her calling and
to help build a large, racially diverse, politically engaged
congregation.

She succeeded.

The congregation grew so large and she was so beloved that by the time
Ms. Gibbs married Ms. White, the church’s gospel ensemble director, in
March 2016, they had to do it in secret. “Too many people would’ve been
hurt not to be invited to the wedding,” the Rev. Troy Treash, the senior
pastor, said.

Ms. Gibbs made everyone in her presence feel like they belonged, said
the Rev. Ellen Denise Junious, the church’s spiritual director. “She had
a knack for helping people through the most difficult times of their
life, and that’s why so many people were drawn to her,” she said. “She
would create a space for their brokenness, without judgment.”

Vickey Michelle Gibbs was born on Dec. 1, 1962, in Beaumont, Texas, the
younger of two children of Alex and Mildred Gibbs. Her father did
factory work; her mother was a nurse. She attended public schools in
Beaumont, 85 miles east of Houston, and later earned her master’s of
divinity degree from the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif.
She was ordained by the Metropolitan Community Church in 2014, working
first as an administrator for the denomination before becoming a pastor
at Resurrection in Houston.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Her skills as an administrator served her well in organizing people for
food drives, prayer vigils and civil disobedience actions. Working with
the American Civil Liberties Union, the church helped send 20 buses of
demonstrators to the Mexican border in 2018 to protest the treatment of
immigrants, and another large group to stand vigil outside the jail in
Hempstead, Texas, where Sandra Bland was found hanged in a jail cell in
2015 after having been arrested after a traffic stop. Ms. Gibbs was
instrumental in all of these actions.

She did it all while living with lupus, which gave her constant pain and
threatened to shorten her life.

Along with Ms. White, she is survived by their daughters Cara and Ariel
and a grandson.

The church occasionally met resistance from the outside — in the early
years, someone burned a cross on the lawn, Mr. Treash said — and
pressure internally, from congregants who wanted more scripture, less
politics. Ms. Gibbs called this theology “Jesus lite,” Mr. Treash said.

“Part of Vickey’s dream was that we would be fully a justice-oriented
church,” Mr. Treash said, “and that the word political was something
that should be embraced, because that was the
Gospel.”
