# For U.K.’s Minority Women, Economic Toll of Lockdown Lingers

</div>

Black and other ethnic minority groups have long faced economic and
racial inequality in Britain. As workers return, many are saddled with
debt and working longer hours for less pay.

LONDON — Within 10 days of the [British government’s lockdown
announcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/europe/britain-coronavirus-lockdown.html)
in late March, one woman lost all nine of her cleaning jobs. Another was
laid off from a laundromat after she requested a mask, and a live-in
nanny was fired for using public transport on her day off.

In separate interviews, the three women said that they had expected to
confront hardships during the lockdown. But as the economy [starts to
reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson.html),
they and other women on the lower rungs of the economy say they are
still struggling, weighed down by debts accumulated during the freeze
and often facing pay cuts or forced to do more work for the same wages.

The three have one other thing in common. They are all women of color, a
group that has long faced economic and racial inequality in Britain and
is now being hit disproportionately by the financial and psychological
impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, [according to a recent
study](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=cae4917f-1df3-4ab8-94e7-550c23bdc9cf)
by a group of British universities and women’s charities.

“Covid-19 has brought the harsh realities of pre-existing racial
inequalities into sharp relief, and nowhere is this more manifest than
the disproportionate social and economic impact of Covid-19 on Black and
ethnic minority women,” said Zubaida Haque, the interim director of the
Runnymede Trust, a London-based organization advocating racial equality.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The main reason that people of color are so vulnerable, experts say, is
that they are more likely to be in precarious employment or to become
unemployed, making it harder for them to qualify for government support
and to protect themselves from the virus.

Minji Paik, a Korean beautician who works in a hair salon in East
London, said she made 15 pounds an hour before the pandemic, about $19
dollars, plus tips. Now she is making £10 an hour, and has been working
longer shifts because of staff shortages.

“My manager says this is temporary and she will give me more money when
we make money,” Ms. Paik said. “But actually, I should be paid more
because I’m working inside and risking my health.”

[A government
review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-understanding-the-impact-on-bame-communities)
of the disparities in the risk and outcomes from the coronavirus found
that death rates have been higher in Black, Asian and other minority
ethnic groups than in white groups. The review found that Chinese,
Indian, Pakistani and other Asians, as well as Caribbeans and other
Black people, had from 10 percent to 50 percent higher risk of death
than white Britons.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There’s often a risk when people start talking about the underlying
causes of death because of the assumption that the reason is related to
genetics or poor diets,” said Bridget Byrne, director of the [Center on
Dynamics of Ethnicity](https://www.ethnicity.ac.uk/) at the University
of Manchester. “But actually, you need to look at the wider process of
racism and the structuring of race and deprivation.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The precarious nature of the current labor market is a contributing
factor as well, Ms. Byrne said. “It makes people less willing to voice
their concerns, they worry that if they say, ‘I don’t feel safe, I don’t
think I should be coming in,’ they will be the first to be laid
off.”

Candice Brown, 48, a cleaner who is of Jamaican descent, said she had
lost all her clients when [lockdown measures were imposed in
March](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson.html).

“They phoned me one by one to say don’t come,” she recalled, referring
to the owners of the nine houses she cleaned each week in the city of
Manchester, in northwestern England. “Each call was like a bomb,
blasting every bit of my livelihood until I had no work left.”

For two months she tried to navigate the government’s financial support
system for those affected by the pandemic, and even borrowed money from
a friend to hire an accountant to help. But eventually, she found out
that she was not eligible for any aid because she lacked the paperwork
to prove her employment history.

“I applied for universal credit,” she said referring to the government’s
income support program. “But I am still waiting. I haven’t received a
penny.”

Even with the easing of the lockdown measures, Ms. Brown has not been
invited back to work because her employers fear that she could contract
and spread the virus by working between multiple households.

“I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this,” she said. “In the
first month, I was worrying about how to pay my rent and my bills, now I
can’t sleep worrying about how to feed my
children.”

A [survey published by the Fawcett
Society](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/coronavirus-impact-on-bame-women),
a women’s rights charity, found that nearly 43 percent of Black and
ethnic minority women believed that they would be in more debt than
before the pandemic, compared with 37 percent of white women and 34
percent of white men. More than four in 10 of the women said they would
struggle to make ends meet over the next three months.

Many are tasked with carrying out menial tasks that can be perilous in a
pandemic, [a recent study by the Runnymede Trust
found](https://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/publications/pdfs/2020%20reports/The%20Colour%20of%20Money%20Report.pdf).

Zuhr Rind, 48, a Pakistani laundromat worker in East London, was asked
to work the last shift when the pandemic broke out so that she could
wash the uniforms of the front-of-house employees, who collected laundry
from
clients.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“I was not happy about it, but what could I do? Work is work and I was
afraid to lose my job if I made an argument,” she said.

When she asked for a face mask, her manager chided her, she said.

“That is pathetic Z,” her manager wrote back in a text message she
showed to The New York Times. “Doctors and nurses do not even have
enough masks and they’re still going to work.”

A day later, Ms. Rind said, she was laid off. “When you have brown skin,
when you have an accent and when you don’t have a high education, you
don’t have choices,” she said. “And this is a very dangerous situation
to be in during Covid.”

The laundromat where she worked did not respond to a request for
comment.

Ms. Rind was recently offered a cleaning job in a hotel but was forced
to turn it down because she lives 40 minutes away and, as a precaution
against the virus, the employer did not want her to take public
transport.

Black and ethnic minority women also generally have much lower levels of
savings and assets than white Britons, according to the Runnymede Trust
study. So those who lost their jobs in the pandemic have had to seek new
employment straight away, forcing some of them to take lower-paid,
higher-risk posts.

Verona Pollard, an experienced nanny and maternity nurse, has taken up
part-time child care work since she was fired from a full-time nannying
job, after her employer found out she had taken public transport on her
days off.

“She was ruthless about it and wouldn’t take me back, even when the
lockdown was lifted,” she said in a phone interview. “ It’s been brutal
since then, I’m just doing odd jobs here and there.”

And in the Fawcett Society’s survey, work-related anxiety was highest
among Black and minority ethnic women, with 65.1 percent of women
employed outside the home reporting that they felt apprehensive as a
result of having to go to work during the pandemic.

Ms. Brown, the cleaner in Manchester, said that she was still waiting
for her unemployment benefits to come through and that she had been
borrowing money from a friend and from a former employer to get by. In
recent weeks, she said she has become so stressed and anxious that
rashes have broken out over her body and she has noticed her hair
falling out.

“I promise you, what I am going through now is worse than any virus,”
she said.
