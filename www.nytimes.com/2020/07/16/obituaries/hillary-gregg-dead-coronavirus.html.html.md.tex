\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Hillary Gregg signed on in 1979 as a line cook at the celebrated Quilted
Giraffe, which was to restaurants what Studio 54 was to nightclubs ---
chock-a-block with celebrities and influential business, media and
political figures.

It was quite a change for a cook who had started work in Caribbean
hotels.

Barry Wine, the founder and owner of the Quilted Giraffe,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/20/archives/the-quilted-giraffe.html}{which
closed on New Year's Eve in 1992} after winning
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/20/arts/restaurants-187990.html}{four
stars from The New York Times} in 1984, called Mr. Gregg the
restaurant's ``walking cookbook.''

Over his 11 years at the restaurant, on Second Avenue near 51st Street,
many cooks learned their trade from his generous tutelage. ``He was my
grad school,'' said
\href{https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/nish-has-left-the-country/}{Wayne
Nish,} who trained with Mr. Gregg and later employed him at his own
celebrated Midtown East restaurant, March, where Mr. Gregg was a line
cook for 14 years.

Mr. Gregg stood out as a calm presence in the rough-and-tumble kitchens
of these two high-end restaurants and got along famously with most
people, although he could be imperious --- ``kind of like a lion marking
his territory,'' as Mr. Nish put it.

Mr. Nish remembers the day when Mr. Gregg was at the end of a jostling
line of cooks in March's long, narrow kitchen, and Mr. Nish had to
squeeze past him to reach the basement storage room. Mr. Gregg's
saucepan brushed Mr. Nish's forearm and burned it a bit. It happened two
more times.

``I said: `OK, first time's an accident, second time's a coincidence but
the third time is enemy action,''' Mr. Nish recalled. ```Do it once more
and I'll punch you in the face.'''

Instead of fighting they laughed it off.

``From that day on, we were the best of friends,'' Mr. Nish said.

Mr. Gregg died of Covid-19 on May 3 at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, his
daughter Ethel Gregg said. He was 73.

Hillary Gregg was born on April 4, 1947, in the Caribbean island nation
of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/saint-vincent-and-the-grenadines}{St.
Vincent and the Grenadines} to Empson Byrne, a carpenter, and Zilpha
Gregg, a shopkeeper. He adopted his mother's surname. He learned to cook
at hotel restaurants in his homeland, a popular tourist and sailing
destination.

Family lore has it that he worked as the private chef on board the yacht
of Roy Cohn, the notorious McCarthy hearings lawyer and later an adviser
to Donald Trump.

Hired by Mr. Wine, Mr. Gregg moved to the United States, was joined by
his wife Yolanda and became a citizen. Along with his daughter Ethel, he
is survived by his wife; another daughter, Joanna; and a brother,
Clarence.

At home Mr. Gregg recounted funny stories from work, often about the
celebrities who frequented his restaurants. ``Every story led back to
the food --- food was his passion,'' Ms. Gregg said. ``Food and politics
--- and the Mets.''

Mr. Gregg had an uncanny ability to size up a piece of cooked meat or
poultry and tell the temperature just by looking at it, Mr. Nish said.
After Mr. Gregg retired in 2008, his family found that going out
together to restaurants was problematic. He would look at the food and
tell the staff that it was the wrong temperature.

In retirement ``he did let my mom control the kitchen,'' Ms. Gregg said,
``but on the table, he would always just dissect the food.''
