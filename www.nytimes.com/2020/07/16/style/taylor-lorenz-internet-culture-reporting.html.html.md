# How to Report on Internet Culture and the Teens Who Rule It

Taylor Lorenz spends most of her days reporting on the ways we use the
internet. Here’s how she does
it.

*We spend a lot of our days chatting with each other about things we see
online, trying to make sense of it all. This week in the Styles
newsletter, Wait …, Taylor Lorenz, a Styles reporter, Lindsey
Underwood,* [*a Styles editor*](https://www.nytimes.com/section/style)*,
and Jessica Grose, the* [*Parenting
editor*](https://www.nytimes.com/section/parenting)*, discussed how we
report on teenagers and the internet.*

**Jessica:** [Taylor,](https://www.nytimes.com/by/taylor-lorenz) I feel
[your](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/style/what-is-the-cake-meme.html)
[work](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/style/tati-devin-tiktok.html)
in

the
[way](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/style/blm-accounts-social-media-high-school.html)
teens
[use](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/style/police-protests-video.html)
the
[internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/style/call-her-daddy-podcast.html)
is a public service to parents like myself. How do you find your topics
in their vast online world?

**Taylor:** I write stories about culture and technology; a lot of my
stories have [nothing to
do](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/style/roller-skating-is-back-baby-taylor-lorenz.html)
with young people. But young people are often [leading the way
online](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/style/instagram-yearbook-coronavirus.html),
so I do end up talking to them a lot. I also cover the [online
creator](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/style/shane-dawson-jeffree-star-youtube-taylor-lorenz.html)
and [influencer
industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/style/tiktok-collab-houses-quarantine-coronavirus.html),
which is dominated by young people. But I’m not a youth culture reporter
or a reporter on teens. I’m a technology reporter with a focus on
culture.

**Lindsey:** And how do you find your stories?

**Taylor:** I spend all day, every day on the internet.

**Lindsey:** I can attest to this\! I sat next to you in the office in
The Before Times.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Taylor:** It’s very rare that I unplug\! I keep my DMs open on every
platform and I spend a lot of time just listening to people. I try to be
one of the most accessible reporters at The New York Times. I want
people, when they see something interesting or newsworthy online, to
think “Oh, I have to send this to Taylor.”

**Jessica:** How do you get in contact with teenagers? And do they try
to catfish you?

**Taylor:** I never do interviews over text or DM. My goal with everyone
I speak to, whether adult or teenager, is to get them on the phone or a
Zoom. Often, I’ll DM a meme account, for instance, and not have any idea
of the person’s age or identity behind it until I do more reporting and
verify their identity.

I regularly hop on the phone with parents and answer any questions. I’ve
become very friendly with the parents of several kids I’ve covered in
the past and keep in touch with the parents of many more.

When I’ve [visited teenager’s
houses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html),
for instance, for an in-person interview, that is always coordinated
with their parents either directly or through a manager or agent who
works with their parents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I consider it part of my job to very clearly and explicitly explain the
ramifications that coverage in The Times will have. I have had
conversations about this with parents, for instance, about what would
likely happen when a story went up. I talk to kids about this a lot when
I’m discussing how we will refer to them and why. I would never write
about someone without communicating what an article about them means.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Absolutely, people lie to me and try to catfish me every day. Sometimes
that [becomes a story in
itself](https://www.thedailybeast.com/reddits-favorite-high-school-porn-magnate-is-actually-22).
Like any beat, you have to do an enormous amount of due diligence
throughout the reporting process.

**Jessica:** I want to know more about these managers\!

**Taylor:** The people I work with most when covering teenagers are
actually managers and agents. More often than not, when I DM a teenager
looking to get in touch for a piece, it is a manager, agent or PR
representative who will respond. Teenagers with as few as 10,000
followers on a platform have talent managers now.

A lot of these kids’ parents aren’t aware of how famous their children
are, and don’t always understand what their child is doing online that
made them so famous. (That is often [part of the
story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/the-original-renegade.html)\!)
Some parents live quite far away, while their children live in Los
Angeles with a guardian or manager. I wrote [a feature for The Atlantic
several years
ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/raising-a-social-media-star/550418/)
on what it’s like for the parents of kids who become influencers and
social media stars.

**Lindsey:** What’s your goal — if you have one?

**Taylor:** I want to reveal the real work taking place in the online
creator world. I want people to recognize that influencing and creating
things online is a valid career and should be taken seriously.

A lot of young people, even the famous ones, are wary of the press. My
beat is based on taking young people seriously — and that means not
exploiting them, or being condescending, or mocking them. I want them to
know they can trust me from what they see in my work — but I also never
want any kid to mistake me as their peer. I don’t try to speak like a
teenager or act like I’m in their world. It’s important that they
recognize that I’m a professional reporter and an adult, just like their
parents and teachers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That said, I approach all interviews, especially those with young
people, from a place of empathy. It is important that interview subjects
feel comfortable talking to me and trust me enough to tell the truth. I
take confidentiality very seriously and I take issues around identity
very seriously.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Lindsey:** Do teens read your stories or is our coverage for their
parents?

**Taylor:** I receive a ton emails and messages from kids with feedback
and thoughts about my stories. I want young people to feel represented
by this global news organization.

I want kids to read us and feel like they matter to The New York Times
and that The Times is actually working to understand them. Growing up, I
looked up to women in media like Nancy Jo Sales and Atoosa Rubenstein
because I felt like they really understood me. I want to be that person
for the next generation.

**Lindsey:** Do you think teens are thinking about their Google results
or what it means to be in The Times?

**Taylor:** Oh yes. (And I’ve [written
about](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/when-kids-realize-their-whole-life-already-online/582916/)this.)
Young people are [hyper aware of their digital
footprint](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/when-kids-realize-their-whole-life-already-online/582916/)
from a very, very young age. Often, they know that any story written
about them could be the most prominent (or Google-able) information
about them for years to come.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Jessica:** How much money is sloshing around these kids and where is
it coming from?

**Taylor:** Influencer marketing is a $10 billion industry and that only
represents a fraction of the money flowing on the internet. Teenagers
today have unprecedented access to career and moneymaking opportunities.
They can [sell sponsored content on Instagram as a summer
job](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/posting-instagram-sponsored-content-is-the-new-summer-job/568108/),
for instance. Others are building media [empires from their
bedrooms](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/style/the-clout.html).

**Lindsey:** What happened to teen magazines? I read YM and Teen People.
God, what I would have I given to be a CosmoGirl. What does a cool teen
read now?

**Taylor:** The entire media landscape has been upended by social media
and the internet. That’s led to the decimation of the print industry and
a huge shift in how people consume media. That shift to digital and
social is even more apparent in the younger generation. Before writing
full time, I worked as a social strategist for brands and other media
companies. My job was to program content for younger people and meet
consumers where they are these days: Instagram, YouTube, etc.

Teens today don’t have YM or Teen People, but they do have Instagram
accounts like [TikTok room](https://www.instagram.com/tiktokroom/) and
[Messy Monday](https://www.instagram.com/m3ssym0nday/), and a plethora
of YouTubers and podcasters to keep them in the loop on what’s going on
in the world. The number one thing kids ask me when I reach out for an
interview is: “Will this be on [The New York Times YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheNewYorkTimes)?”
