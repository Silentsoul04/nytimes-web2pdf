“I was a strange and rebellious child,” says the designer [Isabel
Marant](https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2019/03/02/t-magazine/48-hours-with-isabel-marant-in-paris.html),
who, after her French father and German mother separated when she was 7,
was largely raised — in the Parisian suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine — by
her stepmother, who was from Martinique and dressed in head-to-toe [Yves
Saint Laurent](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/yves-saint-laurent).
The glamour wasn’t wasted on Marant, but she had her own ideas. “That
era of ’80s super-chic French fashion was really getting on my nerves,”
she says. “By 10, I knew exactly what I wanted to wear, but it didn’t
exist in any shop.” So she started making her own clothes, reworking her
dad’s castoff dressing gowns, sweaters, vintage military fatigues and
silk slippers. At one point she thought she might study economics or
become a veterinarian, but her friends loved her creations and kept
requesting versions for themselves. After studying fashion design at
Paris’s Studio Berçot, Marant launched Twen, a knitwear and jersey line,
with her mother in 1989. “I was determined to work for myself,” she
says. Her eponymous label debuted five years later, with a collection of
men’s-wear-inspired overcoats and striped suits that drew from
Indonesian batiks and ikats. Her credo was simple: She’d only design
pieces she herself would wear. “To this day,” says Marant, 53, “nothing
leaves the workshop without me trying it on.”

Her preference for eye-catching pieces that exude a sense of bohemian
nonchalance has also remained consistent, and those familiar with the
brand are able to spot a Marant schoolboy- style button-down, floral
georgette dress or pair of dip-dyed motorcycle jeans from a block away.
“I think of my collections as versatile satellites of each other that
are meant to transcend time,” adds Marant. Today, she has 52 boutiques
in cities ranging from Copenhagen to Chengdu and, in addition to women’s
wear, oversees accessories, a diffusion line called Étoile and [men’s
wear](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/fashion/isabel-marant-menswear-paris-fashion-week.html).
Still, along with her husband, the handbag designer Jérôme Dreyfuss, and
their 17-year-old son, she manages to split her time between an
apartment in Paris’s Belleville neighborhood and a small cabin in
Fontainebleau. “Far from the madness of Paris, I can clear my head,”
says the designer, “which actually speeds up my ideas.”

Paris atelier. I’m dressed in my typical uniform, which consists of a
lot of light gray and off-white, and I’m wearing my father’s watch from
the ’60s. I always have my hair up in a chignon. Sometimes I think I
should dye it, but then I say, ‘No, no, Isabel — that’s just the way it
is.’”

me in Neuilly-sur-Seine. I must be 5 or 6 here. At the time, my mom was
modeling in fashion magazines; later she ran Elite, the modeling agency.
I think my dad hoped I’d be beautiful like her, but alas, I was very
tomboyish and always hiding myself behind a dark fringe of bangs.”

*Center:* “In France, it’s quite typical to have a classic Breton bowl
with your name on it for breakfast and things. I carry this ‘Isabel’ one
around with me and fill it with tobacco when I roll my cigarettes. A few
years ago, we produced a small run of them, sort of as an inside company
joke, and I sometimes give them to friends as gifts.”

*Right:* “[Manolo Ballesteros](https://www.manoloballesteros.com/),
who’s now in his 50s, was a young artist when I first discovered his
pieces, at a gallery in Barcelona. I’ve always enjoyed the work of
Catalan artists from the 1960s, like Miró and Dalí, and I love the way
that Ballesteros nods to their creations with his own use of geometric
shapes. This work, ‘Untitled’ (2019), is made of folded painted paper
and feels somewhere between a painting and a sculpture. I don’t own it,
but I keep two others of his at my
cabin.”

different handle lengths. I’m not the kind of person who changes their
bag every day — I have one for spring and one for fall, so maybe this

Teller, whom I’ve been working with for five seasons. My German side
appreciates the straightforward roughness of his images. He doesn’t
cheat.”

Jaipur. On the metal tray on the left is a small black-and-white

old-fashioned camera. You could get these sorts of pictures of yourself
all over the city, and they make for sweet

“Music is often a jumping-off point for me. When I was thinking about my
spring 2020 collection, I was listening to a lot of baile funk and
contemporary electronic Brazilian music, and it got me thinking about
Brazil’s beaches, joyful colors and design. I admire the work of the
architect [Oscar
Niemeyer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/t-magazine/niemeyer-house-adriana-varejao.html)
and the landscape designer [Roberto Burle
Marx](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/arts/design/roberto-burle-marx-botanical-garden.html),
and this men’s wear look (right), though it could be unisex, was
inspired by Marx’s trippy, undulating Copacabana boardwalk in Rio de
Janeiro
(left).”

*Left:* “This was the invitation to my first-ever runway show. I found a
square of beautiful abandoned Parisian buildings on Rue St. Sabin and
got permission from the township to hold my show there. Two days before,
they called and said, ‘You can’t do it.’ Well, all the invites had been
sent out, so I pretended I’d call it off but did it anyway —
illegally\!”

*Right:* “I’m very keen on modernism, particularly when it comes to
architecture. Richard Neutra, Alvar Aalto and Frank Lloyd Wright are all
favorites, and I would totally live in this modernist-inspired 1993 Los
Angeles house by [Philip
Dixon](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-the-most-instagrammed-house-in-los-angeles).
I’m drawn to the rawness of the concrete, which is juxtaposed by the
cactuses and lush palm
trees.”

when the weather is good — in the picture, taken five years ago, you can
see my son, Tal. The cabin sits by a deep river and used to be a fishing
shack — there’s still no running water or electricity so I do a lot of
gardening and barbecues. Being there is like an escape to a past era.”
