\section{Extending Cruise Ban, C.D.C. Slams Industry for Spreading
Coronavirus}\label{extending-cruise-ban-cdc-slams-industry-for-spreading-coronavirus}}

In a scathing order extending the current ``no sail'' order on U.S.
cruise lines, the agency said it spent 38,000 hours managing the
outbreaks on ships.

As the coronavirus pandemic raged around the world, cruise ship
companies continued to allow their crews to attend social gatherings,
work out at gyms and share buffet-style meals, violating basic protocols
designed to stop the spread of the highly transmissible virus, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/pdf/No-Sail-Order-Cruise-Ships-Second-Extension_07_16_2020-p.pdf}{scathing
20-page order}, released Thursday, that extended the suspension of
cruise operations until Sept. 30.

In a rebuke of the cruise ship companies, Robert R. Redfield, the
director of the C.D.C., blamed them for widespread transmission of the
virus. The C.D.C. said there were 99 outbreaks aboard 123 cruise ships
in United States waters alone, the agency said in the statement. From
March 1 until July 10, 80 percent of the ships in the C.D.C.'s
jurisdiction were affected by the coronavirus. The agency said there had
been nearly 3,000 suspected and confirmed cases and 34 deaths on ships
in U.S. waters.

As of July 3, nine ships still had ongoing or resolving outbreaks.

The C.D.C. spent at least 38,000 hours managing the crisis, the order
said. Public health authorities had to do contact tracing for some
11,000 passengers, more than the number of contacts identified from
airplane flights since the beginning of the pandemic, the C.D.C. said.

The cruise industry has struggled to manage the coronavirus pandemic
since the start, when the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/world/asia/coronavirus-cruise-ship.html}{Diamond
Princess}, part of the cruise giant Carnival Corporation, moored in the
Japanese harbor of Yokohama, Japan, amid an outbreak that eventually
infected 712 people and killed nine of them. Even as warnings were
issued about the dangers of cruise-ship travel, passengers kept boarding
and ships kept sailing.

Though more and more cruise passengers fell ill, companies
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/travel/coronavirus-cruise-costa-luminosa.html}{continued
their voyages}, offering entertainment that included live music and pool
parties. The industry ultimately suspended operations in mid-March, but
as ships made their way to port, many passengers and crew were stranded
around the world, as countries refused the ships entry.

One ship arrived in Fort Lauderdale with four
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-cruise-zaandam-rotterdam-florida.html}{dead
passengers} on board.

Many of those passengers who were allowed to disembark from contaminated
ships ``traversed international airports, boarded planes and returned to
their homes,'' the C.D.C. said, potentially spreading the virus further.

The cruise industry had already voluntarily suspended operations until
Sept. 15, and many companies withdrew their ships from United States
waters, removing them from the C.D.C.'s jurisdiction. But the order from
Dr. Redfield underscores the gap between the industry and the public
health agency. The companies cannot begin to sail again until they come
up with cohesive plans for prevention and mitigation of the illness.

Cruise ship companies submitted plans on how to safely evacuate crews,
but nearly all the companies failed to meet the basic requirements
necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the C.D.C. said. Crew
members still bunked together and shared bathrooms. Even ships that
seemed to have gone a month without any coronavirus cases had crew
members who tested positive upon reaching shore, Dr. Redfield said.

One company, Norwegian Cruise Lines, said it felt it had exceeded
recommended C.D.C. guidance, because crew members were not just asked
but ``encouraged'' to wear face coverings, the order said. Disney
acknowledged that some of its asymptomatic-infected crew members had not
quarantined until after the results of shipwide testing came in.

The companies created a task force to come up with recommendations on
how to safely sail, but according to the C.D.C., the group will not
produce its findings for several months.

If unrestricted cruise-ship passenger operations were permitted to
resume, it would put ``substantial unnecessary risk'' on communities,
health care workers, port personnel and federal employees, the order
said, as well as placing passengers and crew members at increased risk.

The agency's previous no-sail order was set to expire July 24.

Disney said only one of its four ships, the Disney Wonder, had an
outbreak on board ---but only after passengers had disembarked. The
company tested every crew member on board and isolated non-essential
crew to their cabins for three weeks in April. Half the 174 crew who
tested positive had no symptoms, the company said.

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited

    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''

The ship has not had a positive case since May 8, Disney said.

Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line, whose failures were
specifically cited in the C.D.C. document, released statements in
response to the order that did not specifically address the allegations.

Norwegian said it canceled trips through September, as well as cruises
embarking from or calling on ports in Canada in October. ``We continue
to partner with the C.D.C. and other authorities to mitigate the impact
of COVID-19 by prioritizing the health and safety of our passengers and
crew,'' the company said.

Royal Caribbean said it would suspend operations through September to
comply with the order. ``The health and safety of our guests, crew and
the communities we visit is our top priority,'' the company said.

Carnival Cruises said that it had already extended its suspension
through September. But the company plans three voyages in Germany next
month through a European line, and Italy trips are also expected soon, a
spokesman said.

Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Line Industry
Association, a trade organization that represents most of the major
cruise companies, released a statement that did not address the C.D.C.
criticisms.

``As we continue to work towards the development of enhanced protocols
to support the safe resumption of cruise operations around the world, we
look forward to timely and productive dialogue with the C.D.C. to
determine measures that will be appropriate for ocean-going cruise
operations to resume in the United States when the time is right,'' she
said.
