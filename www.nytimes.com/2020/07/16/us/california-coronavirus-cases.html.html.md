**First, we have a brief update on the
pandemic:**

[California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/california-covid-19-cases.html)
recorded its [highest number of new
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html)
on Tuesday, exceeding 10,000 new cases in one day for the first time,
according to [The New York Times’s
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html).

New cases lag as an indication of the
[virus’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/california-covid-19-cases.html)
spread, and state officials noted that testing had expanded. On Tuesday,
the state reported that [118,321 tests were
conducted](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/).

Still, the milestone was disheartening for
[Californians](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/ca-coronavirus-covid-testing.html)
hoping that the surging case numbers might slow as many counties
reinstated restrictions and the state ordered businesses to close.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced [the most marked rollback
yet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html)
of reopening plans. And on Tuesday, state public health officials
unveiled [new, stricter Covid-19 testing
guidelines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/ca-coronavirus-covid-testing.html)
amid supply shortages and long waits for results.

**Now, here’s an update from Berkeley, by my colleague** **[Kellen
Browning](https://www.nytimes.com/by/kellen-browning):**

The Berkeley City Council on Wednesday morning moved forward with a
[first-in-the-nation plan to prohibit the city’s police
officers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/berkeley-ca-police-department-reform.html)
from conducting traffic stops and instead train unarmed public works
officials to pull over drivers.

In a 8-0-1 **** virtual vote that occurred shortly before 3 a.m., after
hours of public comment, the Council directed the city manager to begin
studying how to enact a pilot program that would create a department of
transportation with civic officials who would stop drivers for
violations like failing to pause at a stop sign.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Researchers have found [widespread racial
bias](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/) nationwide in whom
police officers pull over, and proponents of Berkeley’s plan say
removing armed cops from the mix would de-escalate situations that have
too often turned fatal for Black
drivers.

“Berkeley took a brave action last night to begin the process of
de-policing traffic enforcement and ending pretext stops,” said
Councilman Rigel Robinson, who proposed the legislation. “The heaviest
work is ahead of us still, but we’ve begun a journey that every city in
America needs to make.”

Cities across the country are rethinking [the roles of law
enforcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/us/ca-defund-police.html)
agencies, but Berkeley appears to be the first to seek a change to
police officers’ traffic enforcement duties. The Council, which
[previously
cut](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Berkeley-City-Council-passes-a-budget-with-9-2-15378662.php)
the city’s Police Department budget by $9.2 million, also recommended
other police reforms Tuesday night.

A Berkeley Police Department spokesman previously declined to comment on
the traffic proposal. But Sgt. Emily Murphy, the president of the
Berkeley Police Association, raised concerns with [local television
station
KTVU](https://twitter.com/henrykleeKTVU/status/1283221786801262592?s=20)
on Tuesday about unarmed public works officials facing a drunken or
armed driver.

        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the

        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

**Today’s piece, about a mother and daughter, Carolina Tovar and Leticia
Ramirez, was written by Ashley Njoroge:**

Carolina Tovar, 86, and her daughter Leticia Ramirez, 54, lived minutes
apart from each other in Rowland Heights, a community in the San Gabriel
Valley. Everyone in the family knew Ms. Ramirez was her mother’s go-to:
She drove her to dialysis treatments, shopping and any place else she
needed to go. They were together so often that Ms. Ramirez’s seven
brothers and sisters liked to joke that the two were best friends.

But the mother and daughter were miles apart at different hospitals when
they died of Covid-19 on April 3.

Ms. Ramirez became ill first, in late March, followed soon after by her
mother. Ms. Tovar instructed her family not to put her on a ventilator
if her condition worsened. Her husband, Antonio, had died last January,
months before their 70th anniversary. “Just let me go,” she said to one
of her children. “The love of my life is gone. My kids are fine.”

On a FaceTime call with her family, she blew kisses and blessed each one
of them. They watched as she drew her last breath, with her youngest
daughter, Gina, at her bedside.

A few hours later in another hospital in Los Angeles County, Ms. Ramirez
would also die of Covid-19. Ms. Ramirez, who worked as a receptionist at
a real estate firm, leaves behind a husband and three children.

The double loss for the exceptionally close family has been
overwhelming, all the more so because the family had expected Ms.
Ramirez to recover. “We’re very numb, heartbroken, sad, lost,
everything,” Edward Tovar, one of Ms. Tovar’s 21 grandchildren, said.

“We’re going to miss them,” Carol Padilla, Ms. Ramirez’s niece, added.
“We’re going to continue keeping the family together no matter what.”
