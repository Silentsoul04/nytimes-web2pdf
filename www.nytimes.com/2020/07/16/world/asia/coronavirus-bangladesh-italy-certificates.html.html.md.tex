Certificates}\label{big-business-in-bangladesh-selling-fake-coronavirus-certificates}}

A hospital owner was arrested trying to flee in disguise after selling
certificates saying that migrant workers were coronavirus-free. Most
were never tested.

NEW DELHI --- The Bangladeshi authorities have
\href{https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2020/07/15/regent-hospital-chairman-shahed-arrested}{arrested
the owner of a hospital} who they said had sold migrant workers
thousands of certificates showing a negative result on coronavirus
tests, when in fact many tests were never performed.

The authorities said they caught the hospital owner on Wednesday trying
to sneak across the border into India disguised as a woman. Police
officers said that when they arrested the owner --- a man they
identified as Mohammad Shahed, with a long criminal record --- he was
wearing a black burqa that covered him head to toe.

Over the past week and a half, Bangladeshi investigators pieced together
what happened: Mr. Shahed's hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, had
been selling fake coronavirus certificates --- thousands of them, at
\$59 apiece --- indicating that a patient had tested negative, the
Bangladeshi authorities said.

There is a huge market for these certificates among migrant workers from
Bangladesh hungry to get back to work in Europe, doing jobs like
stocking grocery stores, bussing tables in restaurants or selling
bottled water on the streets. Many Bangladeshi workers have recently
flown to Italy, where they said that employers required such
certificates before allowing them to go back to work.

As Bangladeshi police officers began to close in on Mr. Shahed, he
vanished, the authorities said. But after a nine-day search, they caught
him at the border.

The widespread use of fake Covid-19 certificates has been ``a huge blow
to the image of our country,'' said Obaidul Quader, a minister in
Bangladesh's government.

\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/16/world/16virus-bangladesh01/merlin_174590436_527866cf-622c-4460-b2ec-f18f94a2a8c5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Millions of
Bangladeshis work overseas, sending billions of dollars back home,
keeping the economy afloat. During this pandemic, many workers who had
come back to Bangladesh for a short break found themselves cut off from
their jobs overseas and were eager to get back to work.

Mr. Quader, the minister, has said that different criminal syndicates
were operating across Bangladesh, luring migrant workers with virus-free
certificates and, in turn, endangering many lives. The Bangladeshi
authorities said that the Regent Hospital, run by Mr. Shahed, had issued
more than 10,000 certificates and that most of them were fake, backed by
no actual coronavirus test.

Two other doctors have been arrested and accused of selling thousands of
fake virus certificates from their laboratory in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi
authorities said that special law enforcement agents were on the hunt
for others like them.

Bangladesh's coronavirus situation is especially murky. The country,
home to more than 160 million people, has reported around 200,000 cases.
But with the virus sweeping through South Asia, and with testing
relatively low in Bangladesh, health experts believe the country has a
much higher infection rate than the official numbers indicate.

Italy's health minister, Roberto Speranza, has ordered the suspension of
all flights coming in from Bangladesh after at least 37 Bangladeshi
passengers arrived in Rome and tested positive for Covid-19, according
to Agence France-Presse. Last week,
\href{https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/2020/07/09/italy-denies-entry-to-151-bangladeshis}{Italy
sent back 168 Bangladeshis} who had arrived at airports in Rome and
Milan, Italy's health ministry confirmed.

Even before the testing scam was exposed, Bangladeshi law enforcement
officials said that Mr. Shahed had been investigated in more than 30
other criminal cases connected to corruption, embezzlement and running
fraudulent companies. He has served two years in prison, the authorities
said.

    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when
    they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an

    So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{paper}
    published in April suggests that people are most infectious about
    two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that
    44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from
    people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at
    the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the
    coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was ``very rare,''
    \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3\&context=storylines_faq\#link-1f302e21}{but

``He is a known criminal,'' said Faizul Islam, a member of Bangladesh's
elite police unit, the Rapid Action Battalion. And, Mr. Islam added,
``we are acting against others.''

Bangladesh's foreign ministry released a
\href{https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2020/07/16/bangladeshis-can-enter-italy-from-august-1}{statement}
on Thursday saying that ``around 1,600 Bangladeshis who went to Italy
recently did not carry fake Covid-19 negative certificates.'' But the
statement added, ``some Bangladeshis who traveled to Italy in the recent
days did not follow the mandatory quarantine rule, and probably a few of
them might have spread the virus in the community.''

Fiorenza Aini, a spokeswoman in the press office of Italy's justice
ministry, said that she was not aware of any current joint investigation
between Italy and Bangladesh.

Giuseppe Mazzara, a spokesman from the Lazio region, which includes
Rome, said that more than 6,000 coronavirus swab tests had been carried
out on people who traveled to Italy from Bangladesh in the month of
June, as well as people they came into contact with. So far, 191 had
tested positive, he said.

Taheer Hussain, a Bangladeshi migrant laborer who works in the kitchen
of a restaurant in Milan, said that Italian newspapers have been
continuously reporting on a surge of Covid-19 cases in the Bangladeshi
community, making ordinary workers suspect.

``People are looking at us with suspicious eyes,'' Mr. Hussain said on
phone from Milan, ``as if we all are infected by virus.''

Jeffrey Gettleman reported from New Delhi, and Sameer Yasir from
Srinagar, Kashmir. Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Bergamo,
Italy.
