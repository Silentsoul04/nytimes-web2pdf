BANGKOK — No one knows exactly why Thailand has been spared.

Is it the social distancing embedded in Thai culture — the habit of
greeting others with a wai, a prayer-like motion, rather than a full
embrace — that has prevented the runaway transmission of the coronavirus
here?

Did Thailand’s early adoption of face masks, combined with a robust
health care system, blunt the virus’s impact? Was it the outdoor
lifestyle of many Thais, or their relatively low rates of pre-existing
conditions?

Is there a genetic component in which the immune systems of Thais and
others in the Mekong River region are more resistant to the coronavirus?
Or is it some alchemy of all these factors that has insulated this
country of 70 million people?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One thing is certain. Despite an influx of foreign visitors early in the
year from countries badly hit by the coronavirus, Thailand has recorded
fewer than 3,240 cases and 58 deaths. As of Thursday, there had been no
cases of local transmission for about seven weeks.

“I don’t think it is about immunity or genetics alone,” said Dr.
Taweesin Visanuyothin, the Covid-19 spokesman for Thailand’s Ministry of
Public Health. “It has to do with culture. Thai people do not have body
contact when we greet each other.”

“This is how the countries in the Mekong region greet each other as
well,” Dr. Taweesin added.

It didn’t always look so upbeat. In January, Thailand confirmed the

Another wave of infections was set off by people arriving from Japan,
Europe and the United States. A Thai boxing event turned into a
super-spreader event. But after a lockdown was enforced in March,
shuttering businesses and schools, domestic transmissions subsided. All
of Thailand’s recent cases have been among people who arrived from
overseas.

Dr. Wiput Phoolcharoen, a public health expert at Chulalongkorn
University in Bangkok who is researching an outbreak of the coronavirus
in Pattani in southern Thailand, noted that more than 90 percent of
those who tested positive there were asymptomatic, much higher than
normal.

“What we are studying now is the immune system,” he said.

Dr. Wiput said Thais and other people from this part of Southeast Asia
were more susceptible to certain serious cases of dengue fever, a
mosquito-borne virus, than those from other continents.

“If our immune systems against dengue are so bad, why can’t our immune
system against Covid be better?” he asked.

Though Thailand’s hospitals have not been overwhelmed by coronavirus
patients, the country’s tourism-dependent economy has been battered.

In April, Thailand banned almost all incoming flights, amid the
tightening lockdown. Holidaymakers stopped coming to Bangkok, once the
world’s most visited city. The Thai tourism and sports ministry
estimates that 60 percent of hospitality businesses could close by the
end of the year.

The International Monetary Fund predicts the Thai economy will shrink by
at least 6.5 percent this year. More than eight million Thais may lose
their jobs or income in 2020, the World Bank has said, in a nation
already cleaved by a yawning gap between rich and poor.

Thai households have some of the highest debt loads in Asia, and the
most desperate have lined up at Buddhist temples for handouts of rice.

      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

The country’s large population of migrant workers, many from neighboring
Myanmar and Cambodia, is also hurting. While some people managed to make
it home before the borders closed, others are stuck in Thailand with no
wages from their jobs as hotel cleaners, kitchen hands and food stall
operators.

“Now is when people want more help because it’s been so long and it’s
not going to get better,” Ms. Natalie said.

A sense of normalcy has recently returned to Thailand. Schools have
reopened with children wearing face masks and studying at spaced-out
desks. And in early July, the first holiday weekend in months — Thai New
Year festivities were canceled in April — prompted an uptick in domestic
tourism.

Thailand has also allowed a trickle of foreigners back into the country.
But with the new arrivals comes the risk of contagion.

This week, an Egyptian military pilot was confirmed to have tested
positive for the coronavirus, after he breached quarantine and visited
shopping centers in a Thai beach town. Some schools in the area are now
closed again. Two activists who protested the government’s handling of
the quarantine violation were arrested on Wednesday for contravening
Thailand’s emergency decree.

Questions are also being raised about why migrant workers who were
deported from Thailand arrived home and immediately tested positive for
the disease, despite not being included in the official Thai count of
coronavirus cases. Thailand’s testing rates remain relatively low.

“With the disease still looming,” said Dr. Taweesin, the health ministry
spokesman, “we have to keep our guard up.”
