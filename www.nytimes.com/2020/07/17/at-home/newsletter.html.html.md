# How Can We Be of Service?

We know you have questions about how to manage life at home, life with
family, with roommates, all alone, especially as the summer stretches
onward toward September’s call.

Welcome. Here’s all any of us have been talking about these days on our
calls and video calls, on Slack, in texts and in emails sent too early
in the morning or way too late at night: *What happens when it’s Fall?*

As a corollary: What happens when school starts or it doesn’t, or it
kind of does, or halfway does? What happens when September rolls around
and we’re still out of work? Or when October comes and we’re still
working from a desk in the corner of the bedroom or basement and it’s
dark when you log on and dark a million hours later, when you log off?
What happens when we’re still commuting to workplaces brought back too
soon or too late, to essential jobs that are hard, were harder, that may
become more difficult yet again, when the weather changes, if the
coronavirus flares once more? What happens on Thanksgiving?

And we know it’s not just us, as we work to find ways to make life at
home during the pandemic a little fuller, more cultured, a tiny bit
easier. We know you have questions as well, about how to manage life at
home, life with family, with roommates, all alone, especially as the
summer stretches onward toward September’s call.

\[*Like this newsletter?* [*Sign

Will you share those questions with us? Simply write
<athome@nytimes.com> and tell us: Here’s what I want to know about life
at home as we head into autumn. Here’s what I need help with, at home.
Here’s my chief area of concern.

  - So many plans have had to be canceled in the last few months, but
    Jancee Dunn realized she could help her kids through it by [making a
    big deal of the things
    they](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/parenting/kid-activities-summer.html)[*can*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/parenting/kid-activities-summer.html)[do](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/parenting/kid-activities-summer.html).
    She dug in on her methods, which the child psychologist, Tamar
    Kahane, Ph.D., says can be a “wonderful antidote to all of the
    disappointments, disruptions and lack of agency we’re all feeling.”

  - Our culture writers got together and came up with [seven things you
    should do this
    weekend](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/arts/things-to-do-weekend-coronavirus.html).
    Among the offerings? Streaming Silvia González S.’s brilliant play,
    “Boxcar.”

  - [This week’s
    playlist](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/arts/music/playlist-drake-dj-khaled-mariah-carey.html)
    includes a new track from DJ Khaled and Drake. Jon Caramanica
    believes there will be more to come from the latter, saying “When he
    raps like this, with a stream of boastfulness, it’s often an
    ego-clearing amuse bouche for a more ambitious release to follow.”
    Once you get through those newer offerings, take a journey through a
    list of [15 songs you probably don’t
    know](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/arts/music/pop-hip-hop-samples.html)
    that will sound awfully
familiar.

  - Among the more intriguing options on HBO Max is a huge selection of
    films from Studio Ghibli, including classics like “Spirited Away,”
    “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Princess Mononoke.” Nancy Coleman took
    to
    [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nancylcoleman/status/1283785775721721857)
    to perfectly sum up [her exploration of those
    offerings](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/movies/studio-ghibli-hbo-max.html):
    
    *“There are TWENTY-ONE whole Studio Ghibli movies to stream on HBO
    Max. That’s a lot of Ghibli. So for you, dear reader, and definitely
    not just for my own personal fun, I inhaled a bunch of them and made
    you a road map.”*

  - As always, Margaret Lyons broke down [what you should watch this
    weekend](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/arts/television/hannibal-buress-my-cat-from-hell.html),
    based on how much time you have at your disposal. If you have an
    hour and like comedy, she recommends the new special “Hannibal
    Burress: Miami Nights.” She says Burress “has the best command of
    detail of any comedian working today, and his new special, available
    free, is a knockout.”

  - In the latest installment of our “[Anatomy of a
    Scene](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/movies/the-old-guard-clip.html)”
    series, we asked Gina Prince-Bythewood, the director of “The Old
    Guard,” to break down an action sequence featuring Charlize Theron
    and KiKi Layne. “For women, the tell of whether they are athletic or
    not is a punch,” Prince-Bythewood said when discussing the scene’s
    fight choreography. “If you can throw a punch, we’re going to
    believe that you’re a
fighter.”

    Michael Snyder unpacked the history to show that [this isn’t the
    first time a pandemic has changed how we
