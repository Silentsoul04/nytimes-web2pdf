\section{How Can We Be of Service?}\label{how-can-we-be-of-service}}

We know you have questions about how to manage life at home, life with
family, with roommates, all alone, especially as the summer stretches
onward toward September's call.

Welcome. Here's all any of us have been talking about these days on our
calls and video calls, on Slack, in texts and in emails sent too early
in the morning or way too late at night: \emph{What happens when it's
Fall?}

As a corollary: What happens when school starts or it doesn't, or it
kind of does, or halfway does? What happens when September rolls around
and we're still out of work? Or when October comes and we're still
working from a desk in the corner of the bedroom or basement and it's
dark when you log on and dark a million hours later, when you log off?
What happens when we're still commuting to workplaces brought back too
soon or too late, to essential jobs that are hard, were harder, that may
become more difficult yet again, when the weather changes, if the
coronavirus flares once more? What happens on Thanksgiving?

And we know it's not just us, as we work to find ways to make life at
home during the pandemic a little fuller, more cultured, a tiny bit
easier. We know you have questions as well, about how to manage life at
home, life with family, with roommates, all alone, especially as the
summer stretches onward toward September's call.

{[}\emph{Like this newsletter?}

\emph{to receive it in your inbox.}{]}

Will you share those questions with us? Simply write
\href{mailto:athome@nytimes.com}{\nolinkurl{athome@nytimes.com}} and
tell us: Here's what I want to know about life at home as we head into
autumn. Here's what I need help with, at home. Here's my chief area of
concern.

We want to be of service. \href{mailto:athome@nytimes.com}{How can we
help}? We'll read every word.

Afterward, you can seek respite in music --- say, Sufjan Stevens singing
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2dNTjE6ItI}{Futile Devices}''
on WNYC back in 2011? You can relax into a book. I'm revisiting Colson
Whitehead's
``\href{https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/189755/sag-harbor-by-colson-whitehead/}{Sag
Harbor}'' right now, as I do each summer. You might bake a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020329-blackberry-corn-cobbler}{blackberry
corn cobbler}. Or browse the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/arts/design/art-accounts-instagram.html}{Instagram
feeds of global street photographers} our critic Will Heinrich admires.

And come visit \href{http://www.nytimes.com/athome}{At Home}, where we
make recommendations like that every day, where we seek to be helpful to
you during a difficult time in our world. It's a library of diversion,
of household knowledge, of suggestions for how to live a little better,
despite all. More of those ideas follow below.

And let us know
\href{https://nyt.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e9cKGVFtci4CObz}{what you
think}!

  So many plans have had to be canceled in the last few months, but
  Jancee Dunn realized she could help her kids through it by
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/parenting/kid-activities-summer.html}{making
  a big deal of the things
  they}\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/parenting/kid-activities-summer.html}{\emph{can}}\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/parenting/kid-activities-summer.html}{do}.
  She dug in on her methods, which the child psychologist, Tamar Kahane,
  Ph.D., says can be a ``wonderful antidote to all of the
  disappointments, disruptions and lack of agency we're all feeling.''
\item
  Our culture writers got together and came up with
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/arts/things-to-do-weekend-coronavirus.html}{seven
  things you should do this weekend}. Among the offerings? Streaming
  Silvia Gonz√°lez S.'s brilliant play, ``Boxcar.''
\item
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/arts/music/playlist-drake-dj-khaled-mariah-carey.html}{This
  week's playlist} includes a new track from DJ Khaled and Drake. Jon
  Caramanica believes there will be more to come from the latter, saying
  ``When he raps like this, with a stream of boastfulness, it's often an
  ego-clearing amuse bouche for a more ambitious release to follow.''
  Once you get through those newer offerings, take a journey through a
  list of
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/arts/music/pop-hip-hop-samples.html}{15
  songs you probably don't know} that will sound awfully familiar.

  Among the more intriguing options on HBO Max is a huge selection of
  films from Studio Ghibli, including classics like ``Spirited Away,''
  ``My Neighbor Totoro'' and ``Princess Mononoke.'' Nancy Coleman took
  to
  \href{https://twitter.com/nancylcoleman/status/1283785775721721857}{Twitter}
  to perfectly sum up
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/movies/studio-ghibli-hbo-max.html}{her
  exploration of those offerings}:

  \emph{``There are TWENTY-ONE whole Studio Ghibli movies to stream on
  HBO Max. That's a lot of Ghibli. So for you, dear reader, and
  definitely not just for my own personal fun, I inhaled a bunch of them
  and made you a road map.''}
\item
  As always, Margaret Lyons broke down
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/arts/television/hannibal-buress-my-cat-from-hell.html}{what
  you should watch this weekend}, based on how much time you have at
  your disposal. If you have an hour and like comedy, she recommends the
  new special ``Hannibal Burress: Miami Nights.'' She says Burress ``has
  the best command of detail of any comedian working today, and his new
  special, available free, is a knockout.''
\item
  In the latest installment of our
  ``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/movies/the-old-guard-clip.html}{Anatomy
  of a Scene}'' series, we asked Gina Prince-Bythewood, the director of
  ``The Old Guard,'' to break down an action sequence featuring Charlize
  Theron and KiKi Layne. ``For women, the tell of whether they are
  athletic or not is a punch,'' Prince-Bythewood said when discussing
  the scene's fight choreography. ``If you can throw a punch, we're
  going to believe that you're a fighter.''

  Melissa Clark is back with a recipe for
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/dining/cheesy-tomatoes-recipe.html}{creamy
  tomatoes} that is so good you won't want to share. But if you're
  feeling generous, you could try her
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/dining/caramelized-pepper-pasta-recipe.html}{vegetable-rich
  pasta} (above) that features caramelized peppers that you won't soon
  forget.

  Vallery Lomas's recipe for an

  packed with flavor.

  And while we've all changed our eating habits some in recent months,
  Michael Snyder unpacked the history to show that
