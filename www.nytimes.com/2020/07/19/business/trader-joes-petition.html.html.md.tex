The supermarket chain said it was in the process of phasing out names,
including Trader Ming's and Trader José, that have appeared on its
international food products.

Trader Joe's is being urged to follow the example of other national food
companies and rebrand products that critics say perpetuate racial
stereotypes.

An
\href{https://www.change.org/p/trader-joe-s-remove-racist-packaging-from-your-products}{online
petition} is asking the company to ``remove racist branding and
packaging from its stores,'' including international food items carrying
the names Trader Ming's, Trader José and Trader Giotto's. Those products
and others reflect ``a narrative of exoticism that perpetuates harmful
stereotypes,'' according to the petition, which on Sunday had been
signed by more than 1,500 people.

``They're racist because they exoticize other cultures, present `Joe' as
this default normal, and then the other characters --- such as Thai Joe,
Trader José, Trader Joe San --- falling outside of it,'' said Briones
Bedell, 17, who started the petition.

A Trader Joe's spokeswoman said in a statement that the company had
previously decided to get rid of the names and to rebrand its
international foods with the Trader Joe's name.

``While this approach to product naming may have been rooted in a
lighthearted attempt at inclusiveness, we recognize that it may now have
the opposite effect --- one that is contrary to the welcoming, rewarding
customer experience we strive to create every day,'' said Kenya
Friend-Daniel, the company's national director of public relations.
``With this in mind, we made the decision several years ago to use only
the Trader Joe's name on our products moving forward.''

Ms. Friend-Daniel did not say when the change would be completed, but
she said the company hoped to finish ``very soon'' and was in the
process of updating older product labels.

``Packaging for a number of the products has already been changed, but
there's a small number of products in which the packaging is still going
through the process,'' she said.

Ms. Bedell, a rising high school senior and human rights activist, said
``the branding remains on shelves and unaddressed'' at her local Trader
Joe's in the San Francisco Bay Area.

``There's an abundance of products in their stores, and I think it's
still important --- the petition remains important --- because Trader
Joe's lacks the urgency needed in the current climate to remedy the
issue,'' she said.

The call for Trader Joe's to rebrand its international foods comes as
the national unrest fueled by
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html}{the
killing of George Floyd} in Minneapolis has prompted other food
companies to announce that they were reassessing or doing away with
brands that use racist imagery.

Last month, Quaker Oats announced it would
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/media/aunt-jemima-racial-stereotype.html}{retire
the Aunt Jemima} name and character, which had been associated with its
popular pancake mix and syrup for over a century. Mars Food, which makes
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/aunt-jemima-mrs-butterworth-uncle-ben.html}{Uncle
Ben's rice}, quickly followed by saying that it would ``evolve'' the
brand's signature character, a smiling older Black man, without offering
details or a specific timetable. Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream said it would
change the name and marketing of its
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/business/dreyers-eskimo-pie-name-change.html}{Eskimo
Pie} chocolate-covered ice cream bars.

The first Trader Joe's store
\href{https://www.traderjoes.com/our-story/timeline}{opened in 1967} in
Pasadena, Calif., and today the chain has more than
\href{https://www.traderjoes.com/our-story}{500 stores} across the
United States. Its founder, Joseph Coulombe,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/business/joe-coulombe-dead.html}{died
in February} at 89.
