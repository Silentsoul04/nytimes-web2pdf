\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/movies/ennio-morricone-dead.html}{Ennio
Morricone, who died this month at 91}, was for decades the most
innovative and irreverent composer of film scores working. Best known
for his collaborations with Sergio Leone on his spaghetti westerns,
Morricone scored approximately 500 films, working with a who's who of
landmark directors: Bernardo Bertolucci, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Terrence
Malick, John Carpenter, Quentin Tarantino and many more.

Morricone's music was dynamic, bold and also idiosyncratic --- he made
impressive use of unusual instrumentation and blank space, creating
compositions that contributed to and sometimes dictated the narrative
arc of the film. In 2007, he won a lifetime achievement Oscar.

On this week's Popcast, a conversation about how Morricone's music
shaped the films he worked on, and the high bar he set for other film
composers.

Guests:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Jon Pareles, The New York Times's chief pop music critic
\item
  Joshua Rothkopf, the former film editor of Time Out New York and a
  writer for The New York Times, Sight \& Sound and others
