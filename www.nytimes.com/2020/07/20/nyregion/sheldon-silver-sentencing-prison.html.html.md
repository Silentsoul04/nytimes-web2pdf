Sheldon Silver, the once dominant New York State Assembly speaker who
for nearly five years fended off prison after being convicted twice on
corruption charges, lost a final bid for freedom on Monday when he was
sentenced to 78 months in prison.

His lawyers had asked that Mr. Silver be allowed to serve a term of home
confinement, arguing that sending him to prison would increase his
chances of becoming ill or even dying from the coronavirus. They cited
Mr. Silver’s history of cancer and chronic kidney disease.

“Your honor, I do not want to die in prison,” Mr. Silver, 76, wrote to
the judge before the sentencing.

But the judge, Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court in
Manhattan, said that Mr. Silver had acted out of a sense of greed, and
that he was guilty of “corruption, pure and simple.” She added that
issuing a sentence that did not include prison time was not appropriate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Mr. Silver, his time has come,” the judge said, brushing away a final
effort to delay Mr. Silver’s surrender date to prison. “He needs to go
to jail.”

She also fined Mr. Silver $1 million.

Mr. Silver’s lawyers had noted that other notable white-collar criminals
who had raised concerns about the spread of the virus had been released
from prison to lesser forms of confinement in recent months, including
Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican State Senate majority leader, [and
Paul
Manafort](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/us/politics/paul-manafort-released-coronavirus.html),
the president’s former campaign chairman.

The hearing marked the third time Judge Caproni had sentenced Mr.
Silver, who twice had convictions [overturned in whole or part,
invalidating earlier sentences she had
imposed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/nyregion/sheldon-silver-appeal.html).

Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan’s Lower East Side, served more
than two decades as speaker, wielding extraordinary influence in state
politics and developing a reputation for rebuffing threats and
challenges, whether from political rivals or prosecutors.

Even in recent years, while his convictions were under appeal,
occasional sightings of Mr. Silver around his Lower Manhattan
neighborhood seemed to symbolize, in the view of his critics, a kind of
imperviousness to accountability.

Mr. Silver was retried and convicted the following year, [this time
receiving a seven-year
sentence](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/nyregion/sheldon-silver-sentencing-prison-corruption.html).
Last January, the appeals court again overturned his conviction in the
scheme related to Dr. Taub.

But the appeals court upheld his conviction on charges stemming from the
real estate scheme and a separate money laundering count, the
convictions for which he was sentenced on Monday.

Mr. Silver cut a diminished figure in court, staggering in a few minutes
before his sentencing wearing a dark, loosely fitted suit, a blue
surgical mask and a pair of clear, disposable vinyl gloves.

He remained slumped in a black leather chair, mostly motionless and
listening to the proceedings through earphones.

Writing to the judge in advance of his sentencing, Mr. Silver’s lawyers
cited the pandemic and said their client’s “multiple health conditions”
would “significantly predispose him to the worst outcomes if infected
with Covid-19, including death.” They asked that he be allowed to serve
a substantial term of home confinement, along with a rigorous community
service requirement and fines and forfeitures.

“The risk here is very real,” Mr. Silver’s lawyer, James P. Loonam, said
at the hearing on Monday.

Mr. Silver, addressing the judge, said that his actions were “improper,
selfish and ethically indefensible,” and emanated from a misplaced sense
of entitlement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I want to be clear: What I did was wrong,” he said to the judge.

He said his actions had undermined the public trust. “I know that a lot
of people have lost faith in their government,” Mr. Silver said, adding:
“And I know that my actions contributed to that loss of faith.”

Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said Mr. Silver
“will now finally report to prison to begin serving a sentence that
can begin to repair the harm his conduct caused.”

Federal prosecutors had told the judge that a sentence of more than 10
years would be appropriate but asked that she at least reimpose the
seven-year sentence Mr. Silver received after his second trial.

“He abused his office,” a prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, said on
Monday. “He did it for profit, he did it for at least 15 years, he did
it in multiple ways and he lied about it for years.”

For decades, Mr. Silver was a powerful and sphinx-like figure in Albany,
where his tenure as Assembly speaker was marked by his steely command of
both policy issues and his Democratic colleagues, who hold an
overwhelming numeric advantage over Republicans in the Legislature’s
lower
chamber.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

Along with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mr. Skelos, Mr. Silver became known
as one of the “three men in a room” who controlled decision-making in
Albany, until both Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos were arrested in 2015 in
separate corruption cases.

Mr. Silver’s arrest led to [his
ouster](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/nyregion/6-days-that-felled-sheldon-silver-the-speaker-who-ruled-albany-for-decades.html)
as speaker and to a new chapter in the Assembly: His successor was
Assemblyman Carl E. Heastie, the Bronx Democrat who became the first
African-American to serve as speaker.

Mr. Silver’s first trial ran almost concurrent to the trial of Mr.
Skelos, who was in the same court before a different judge. [The trials
received widespread news coverage and shed a spotlight on Albany’s
culture of influence peddling and
secrecy](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/nyregion/in-two-corruption-cases-the-culture-of-albany-will-go-on-trial.html?searchResultPosition=15).
Their initial convictions in late 2015 led both Mr. Silver and Mr.
Skelos to forfeit their legislative seats.

Mr. Silver must surrender to federal authorities on Aug. 26; his lawyer
asked that his client serve his sentence at [the minimum-security
camp](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/nyregion/michael-cohen-otisville-prison.html)
at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N.Y., which is
known for housing prisoners who, like Mr. Silver, are Orthodox Jews.

In expressing contrition, Mr. Silver said that he believed he had done
good deeds while serving as a lawmaker for more than three decades.

“I thought I was pretty good at it, and I think we helped a lot of
people,” he said. “But I destroyed that legacy.”

During the sentencing, Judge Caproni said she recognized the risk of
Covid-19 in prison — “I do not want Mr. Silver to die in prison,
either,” she said — but she noted a variety of safeguards that could
be taken to protect him.

“I cannot guarantee that Mr. Silver will not contract Covid in prison,”
the judge said. “But I also can’t guarantee that he won’t contract Covid
if he stays out of prison.”

Following his sentencing, a frail-looking Mr. Silver emerged from the
courthouse accompanied by his lawyers.

He wore a mask and a brimmed straw hat under a scorching sun as he
wobbled slowly toward a black SUV that whisked him away. He did not
answer questions from reporters.
