LONDON — A British drug company said Monday that an inhaled form of a
commonly used medicine could slash the odds of Covid-19 patients
becoming severely ill, a sliver of good news in the race to find
treatments that was met by scientists with equal measures of caution and
cheer.

The drug, based on interferon beta, a protein naturally produced by the
body to orchestrate its response to viruses, has become the focus of
intensifying efforts in Britain, China and the United States to treat
Covid-19 patients.

Scientists have found that the coronavirus attacks the body in part by
blocking its natural interferon response, disarming cells that would
otherwise be alerting neighboring cells to activate their own genes and
fortify themselves against the invading virus. In theory, administering
interferon to patients could invigorate its defenses in the early stages
of illness.

But giving patients interferon without eliciting serious side effects
has proved challenging. The symptoms of a seasonal flu, for example, are
largely produced by the mobilization of the body’s interferon response,
scientists said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The British drug company, Synairgen, tried to circumvent that problem by
developing an inhaled form of interferon that directly targets cells in
the lungs, rather than an injection, which can produce more intense side
effects. It conducted a small, double-blind trial on patients
hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in
nine British hospitals.

The initial results, [announced in a brief news
release](https://www.synairgen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/200720-Synairgen-announces-positive-results-from-trial-of-SNG001-in-hospitalised-COVID-19-patients.pdf)
but not yet peer reviewed or published, were promising: The inhaled form
of interferon beta tested by Synairgen was shown to reduce the odds of
hospitalized patients becoming severely ill — needing ventilation, for
example — by 79 percent compared with patients who received a placebo.

But the significance of the findings was seriously limited — and, in the
view of some scientists, undercut — by the small size of the trial. It
involved only 101 patients, Synairgen said, making it difficult to know
for certain how beneficial the drug was or how it affected patients
differently. The study could not rule out that the drug was only
marginally
effective.

The company also fell short of the number of patients it originally said
in a [filing on a U.S. government
website](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04385095?term=interferon&cond=covid-19&draw=2&view=record)
that it intended to enroll. That raised concerns among scientists that
the company had analyzed the results earlier than it should have, once
the treatment appeared to be effective. They said a much larger
randomized trial was needed before they could assess the drug.

Scientists also noted that while injectable interferon has historically
been used to treat hepatitis infections, the inhaled form of treatment
was not yet licensed or widely available.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, amid a crisis caused by a disease with no known cure, the results
were tantalizing. If the finding is borne out, it may represent one of
the most significant breakthroughs to date in treating Covid-19
patients, virologists said.

“If there is the material to distribute it to the population, and you
could keep the price down, this could absolutely be a game changer,”
said Benjamin tenOever, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “I don’t doubt it will work. I
just don’t know how feasible it is.”

Professor tenOever was a co-author of a [study in May in
Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(20\)30489-X), a
scientific journal, about how the virus blocks the body’s interferon
response. He said evidence was piling up that administering interferon
could help limit the replication of the virus, especially in the early
stages of illness, fending the virus off for long enough that a second
set of genes could successfully eradicate it.

In hamsters, Professor tenOever said, there were signs that interferon
cleared the virus and blocked onward
transmission.

In China, the early results of a [study among medical
workers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061473v2)
also showed promise, concluding that interferon nasal drops “may
effectively prevent Covid-19 in medical staff.” The study found that the
drops “have potential promise for protecting susceptible healthy people
during the coronavirus pandemic.”

Among the most pressing challenges for British and American researchers
studying interferon is the difficulty in recruiting patients in places
where caseloads have fallen.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Synairgen, whose share price soared after it announced the results on
Monday, is now struggling to recruit Covid-19 patients who are at home.

Stuart Neil, a professor of virology at King’s College London, said
there had been fears early<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>in
the pandemic that giving interferon to patients could worsen the
over-aggressive immune response that was itself sickening some of them.
But more recent findings have indicated that, in fact, infected patients
mount a limited interferon response on their own. That insight has laid
the groundwork for studies like
Synairgen’s.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“It’s very exciting,” Professor Neil said. “By basically inhaling the
interferon into the site of infection, it looks like you’re taking the
edge off the virus.”

Synairgen said that over the two-week treatment period, patients
receiving the interferon beta drug were twice as likely as patients who
received a placebo to recover to the point where they were no longer
limited by their illness. The company also said that breathlessness was
lower in patients receiving the drug.

But the sparsely detailed news release announcing the findings left many
questions unanswered. Among other concerns, scientists noted that the
company was mostly reporting outcomes over the course of a two-week
treatment period only. They warned that
things<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>could change later.

Synairgen, founded by researchers at the University of Southampton in
southern England, said that as a listed company, it was obligated by
stock market rules to report the early results of its trial.

The company said that it had originally developed the inhaled form of
interferon for patients who are especially susceptible to seasonal colds
and the flu, among them people with asthma and with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

“We have recognized that as a broad spectrum antiviral, it could always
have a place if an unwanted, highly pathogenic virus emerged,” Richard
Marsden, the chief executive of Synairgen, told reporters on Monday. He
said the company would work with regulators to make progress on the
development of the drug as quickly as possible.

Scientists believe the interferon drug will work most effectively on
patients who are not yet seriously ill. By contrast, another drug,
dexamethasone, has been shown to help more severely ill patients.

Dexamethasone is already being used at American and British hospitals to
treat coronavirus patients, doctors have said, and the World Health
Organization called for accelerating production to ensure an adequate
supply.

But the initial reports by scientists of the benefits of dexamethasone
also showed the hazards of conducting science by news release. When the
full study about dexamethasone was posted online — after doctors had
already begun prescribing it — it reported that while the drug seems to
help patients in dire condition, it might be risky for patients with
milder illness.
