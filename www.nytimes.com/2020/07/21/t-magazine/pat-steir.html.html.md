# The Rembrandt Self-Portrait That Has Long Captivated Pat Steir

</div>

When she lived in Amsterdam, the New York-based artist went to see this
painting at least once a week.

[Rembrandt van
Rijn](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/magazine/rembrandt-jan-six.html)
painted and etched his own image dozens of times over the course of his
life, but it’s one of his earliest self-portraits, from around 1628,
that haunts the New York artist [Pat
Steir](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/design/pat-steir-barnes-foundation-waterfall-kiki-smith-feminist.html).
In this work, simply titled “Self-Portrait,” the 22-year-old Dutch
master in the making renders himself in heavy chiaroscuro, his gaze
obscured and light bouncing off his jaw to illuminate an earlobe and the
edges of a helmet of frizzy hair. It’s an oddly dispassionate depiction.
“He painted it the way he would paint a model, without personifying it,”
observes Steir. “It’s letting go of imparting wisdom to the figure.
Brilliance, scale, beauty — letting go of all that. That’s what’s hard
to
do.”

Steir should know: Now in her early 80s, she’s made a career-long quest
of divesting her work of just that kind of painterly ego — even if she
has in the past few years received the kind of recognition that might
give someone less grounded a big head. That includes two major
site-specific museum installations of her ethereal and monumentally
scaled
“[Waterfall](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/497082)”
paintings, the first at the [Barnes
Foundation](https://www.barnesfoundation.org/whats-on/pat-steir-silent-secret-waterfalls)
in Philadelphia in early 2019, the next in an ongoing (though
temporarily shuttered) exhibition at the [Hirshhorn
Museum](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/exhibitions/pat-steir/) in Washington,
D.C., where she has lined a circular gallery with 30 vibrant canvases
that make up a three-dimensional color wheel. In 2018, her painting
“[Elective Affinity
Waterfall](https://www.phillips.com/detail/pat-steir/NY010318/3)” (1992)
sold at auction for a career-record $2.3 million. And the filmmaker
Veronica Gonzalez Peña just released [a sensitive
documentary](https://patsteirthemovie.com/) about Steir’s life and
unusual way of making art.

Steir paints using a carefully choreographed aleatory process inspired
by her late friend, the modernist composer [John
Cage](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/john-cage), and informed by
her interest in Zen meditation and Japanese and Chinese art-making
traditions. Standing on a cherry picker to reach the top of her canvas,
which often measures upward of seven feet tall, Steir pours, flings or
swabs a line of paint, then patiently waits for it to trickle down in
rivulets. She controls the color — building it up on the surface in
dense layers — the weight and viscosity of her pigments and the force of
the flick of her wrist. Gravity and atmospheric conditions **** do the
rest, creating a dance with chance that she finds liberating (when
things go well or awry, nature gets the credit). Her drippy mark, her
athletic way of working — “painting is also my gym,” she says — and her
outsize scale call to mind the Abstract Expressionists, but Steir’s work
is a deliberate rejection of their angsty, macho schtick. She describes
her art not as abstract but as nonobjective: Her lush, dramatic
paintings resemble cascades of water, but they are *actually* cascades
of oil paint, not landscape paintings but literal landscapes. “Like an
open door, not a window,” she explains.

Steir has been honing this process for the past 30 years, which may
account for why she finds Rembrandt’s precocity so touching. Born Iris
Patricia Sukoneck in Newark, N.J., (she took the name Steir from her
flash-in-the-pan first marriage), she turned down a scholarship at Smith
College for the Pratt Institute, and entered the New York art world at a
moment when the prevailing wisdom held, she remembers, that “a woman
couldn’t be a good painter: She didn’t have the balls.” In her early
years, Steir made psychologically fraught figurative work, but by the
late ’60s, she was beginning to wrestle with questions of
representation, producing paintings throughout the 1970s that resembled
pictograms, topographical charts and book mechanicals, using a personal
lexicon of childlike marks, cryptic symbols and scribbled words (she was
shaped by two influential relationships — a friendship with [Agnes
Martin](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/17/arts/design/agnes-martin-abstract-painter-dies-at-92.html)
and a romance turned lifelong friendship with [Sol
LeWitt](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/arts/design/09lewitt.html),
one of her collaborators in founding the **** downtown art-book shop
[Printed Matter](https://www.printedmatter.org/)).

In the ’80s, inspired by the architectural discourse around
postmodernism and the rage for appropriation art, she turned to ****
what she called quotation painting. Steir’s thing was to borrow the
hand, not the imagery, of her forebears. She produced a series of
self-portraits in the manner of painters like Courbet,
[Matisse](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/henri-matisse) — and,
yes, Rembrandt: By this point, she was living part-time near his onetime
Amsterdam home with her second husband, the Dutch book publisher [Joost
Elffers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/style/the-secret-language-of-birthdays.html).
**** In her most epic undertaking, Steir reproduced a floral still life
by the early 17th-century Flemish painter Jan Brueghel the Elder at
massive scale in 64 panels, each painted in the style of a different
artist ([Manet](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/edouard-manet),
[Van Gogh](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vincent-van-gogh),
Rothko) or artistic period. “[The Brueghel Series (A Vanitas of
Style)](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/998)”
(1982-84) was a grand mash-up of Western art movements that slyly
inserted its author into the canon — two panels are in the manner of
Steir herself. But it was also a way of relinquishing control, using
other artists’ gestures to mediate her relationship with her own.

“Such a relief,” she remembers fondly, describing her journey as a
painter as first trying to express herself, then trying to express
something outside of herself, then arriving, at last, at “not trying to
express anything.” With her mature practice, “I’m not trying to do
something to you. I’m not trying to make you see yourself, or make you
see even a waterfall. I’m giving you the opportunity to stand there and
become part of the painting. But if you want to walk by, there’s nothing
that says you
can’t.”
