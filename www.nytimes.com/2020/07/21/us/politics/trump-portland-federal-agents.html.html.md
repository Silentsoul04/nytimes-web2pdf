# As Trump Pushes Into Portland, His Campaign Ads Turn Darker

*Follow our latest coverage of* [*the Biden vs. Trump 2020 election
here*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html)*.*

As [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
deploys federal agents to Portland, Ore., and threatens to dispatch more
to other cities, his re-election campaign is spending millions of
dollars on several ominous television ads that promote fear and dovetail
with his political message of “law and order.”

The influx of agents in Portland has led to [scenes of confrontations
and chaos](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/portland-protests.html)
that Mr. Trump and his White House aides have pointed to as they try to
burnish a false narrative about Democratic elected officials allowing
dangerous protesters to create widespread bedlam.

The Trump campaign is driving home that message with [a new
ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moZOrq0qL3Q&feature=youtu.be) that
tries to tie its dark portrayal of Democratic-led cities to Mr. Trump’s
main rival, [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
— with exaggerated images intended to persuade viewers that lawless
anarchy would prevail if Mr. Biden won the presidency. The ad simulates
a break-in at the home of an older woman and ends with her being
attacked while she waits on hold for a 911 call, as shadowy, dark
intruders flicker in the background.

So far, the campaign has spent almost $20 million over the last 20 days
on that ad and two other similar ones, more than Mr. Biden has spent on
his total television budget in the same time frame, and a relatively
large sum for this stage of the race. Though the ads predate the federal
actions in Portland, they convey a common theme of lawlessness under
Democratic leadership.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The focus of the Trump administration in recent days has been on
Portland, where there have been nightly protests for weeks denouncing
systemic racism in policing. In the last few days, federal agents from
the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Marshals, traveling in
unmarked cars, have [swooped protesters off the
street](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/portland-protests.html)
without explaining why, in some cases detaining them and in other cases
letting them go because they were not actually suspects. The protests
have increased in size since the arrival of federal officials.

Mr. Trump’s deployment of federal law enforcement is highly unusual: He
is acting in spite of local opposition — city leaders are not asking for
help — and his actions go beyond emergency steps taken by some past
American leaders like President George H.W. Bush, who sent troops to
quell Los Angeles in 1992 at the request of California officials.

In Washington on Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security officials held
a news conference for the first time to address the increased federal
deployment in Portland, defending the tactics and training of the
agents. Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary, said a federal statute
allowed the agents to move away from the courthouse that they had been
told to defend, to investigate crimes against federal property and
officers, even if it resulted in the detaining of a protester.

Another top official, Mark Morgan, disputed claims that the agents
lacked adequate insignia, showing reporters a camouflaged ballistic vest
labeled “POLICE.” Mr. Wolf also blamed local officials for the unrest in
Portland. “I asked the mayor and governor, how long do you plan on
having this continue?” Mr. Wolf said. “We stand ready. I’m ready to pull
my officers out of there if the violence stops.”

The president has said he might next deploy federal agents to Chicago,
and has listed other cities where similar enforcement could take place,
including New York but also Philadelphia and Detroit, urban centers in
two battleground states. White House officials said the deployments had
grown out of meetings among administration officials after protests in
Washington, D.C., in late May and early June.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The White House has defended the recent measures.

“By any objective standard, the violence, chaos and anarchy in Portland
is unacceptable, yet Democrats continue to put politics above peace
while this president seeks to restore law and order,” the White House
press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said at a briefing on Tuesday
morning. She listed an array of items she said protesters had hurled at
law enforcement officers.

Trump administration officials and campaign aides have woven together
the protests that began after [the killing of George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html)
in May to try to bolster their claim that under Mr. Biden, the police
would be “defunded.” While Mr. Biden has [walked a careful
line](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/politics/biden-defund-the-police.html)
and said explicitly that he doesn’t support defunding police
departments, the Trump campaign has continued to claim otherwise.

The most recent ad from the Trump campaign, depicting the break-in at a
woman’s home, has a singular goal: terrifying the viewer into believing
that claim.

The ad’s audio includes a news broadcast that talks about “Seattle’s
pledge to defund its police department,” referring to another
progressive city with which Mr. Trump has feuded.

The spot hews to Mr. Trump’s long-held preference for messages that
promote fear and division, dating to [the first ad of his 2016
presidential
campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/us/politics/in-first-ad-donald-trump-plays-to-fears-on-immigration-and-isis.html),
which depicted immigrants as criminals. The campaign has already spent
nearly $550,000 on its new ad, which was released on Monday.

Describing his opponents as supporting violence while portraying police
officers in glowing terms has been a mainstay of Mr. Trump’s public
discourse since the late 1980s.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Protests around the country have been largely peaceful, with spikes of
conflict usually arising in clashes with law enforcement. While polls
show that [a majority of voters support the Black Lives Matter
movement](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/10/upshot/black-lives-matter-attitudes.html),
Mr. Trump and some of his advisers are counting on a backlash, so far
nonexistent, with white voters in the fall that will boost the
president’s numbers.

“Clearly what they’re looking to do here is scare the living hell out of
seniors,” said Pia Carusone, a Democratic ad maker. But, she said, the
new Trump ad falls short in the realm of believability. “You’re making
the assumption that the voter that you’re hoping to convince is going to
relate and think that this could happen. And then you have to make the
leap to blame Biden or the Democrats or whoever. And I think it fails
that first test.”

Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist who now works with the
anti-Trump group known as the Lincoln Project, said Mr. Trump’s team was
focusing on an issue that doesn’t rank at the top of voter concerns.

“I’d bet a lot that the actress they hired for this is more worried
about Covid-19 than a phony threat about cops,” Mr. Stevens said.

Of the $24 million the Trump campaign has spent over all on television
ads over the past 20 days, roughly $20 million has gone to ads that
focus solely on the issue of the police. About 70 percent of that $20
million has been spent on a singular ad that shows a split screen: One
side depicts an empty 911 call center, with an answering service asking
callers to select their emergency, and the other displays violent scenes
from the protests.

The Trump digital apparatus has also been running a torrent of ads
warning of a country in crisis: “Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups are
running through our streets and causing absolute mayhem,” [one ad
with 308 variations
reads](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=281763573095189). “They
are DESTROYING our cities and rioting.”

The Trump team has spent at least $2 million in the past two months on
Facebook ads with similar themes, according to Advertising Analytics, an
ad tracking firm.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The ads are on a political track. But for former Homeland Security
officials who served in the first year of the Trump administration,
seeing images of federal forces on the streets of American cities was
distressing.

“People like me, who served a long time, have to look very long and hard
to figure out who these people are,” said Col. David Lapan, a retired
Marine who served in the Trump administration in 2017 as a spokesman for
the Department of Homeland Security. “For the average citizen, it looks
like the military is being used to suppress American citizens. Even if
that’s not the case, and this is law enforcement, it creates the
impression that the military is being used.”

In a statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden drew a parallel with the
largely peaceful protesters who were [cleared from a park near the White
House](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html)
on June 1 by armed law enforcement officials using chemical irritants
before Mr. Trump’s photo-op outside a historic church.

“They are brutally attacking peaceful protesters, [including a U.S. Navy
veteran](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/portland-protests-navy-christopher-david.html),”
Mr. Biden said of the force used in Portland. “Of course the U.S.
government has the right and duty to protect federal property. The
Obama-Biden administration protected federal property across the country
without resorting to these egregious tactics — and without trying to
stoke the fires of division in this country.” In response, Mr. Trump’s
campaign accused Mr. Biden of attacking law enforcement officials.

Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania who was the first person
to serve as secretary of Homeland Security, also condemned Mr. Trump’s
actions.

”The department was established to protect America from the ever-present
threat of global terrorism,” Mr. Ridge, a Republican, told the radio
host Michael Smerconish. “It was not established to be the president’s
personal militia.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Ridge said it would be a “cold day in hell” before he would have
consented as a governor to what is taking place. “I wish the president
would take a more collaborative approach toward fighting this
lawlessness than the unilateral approach he’s taken,” he said.
