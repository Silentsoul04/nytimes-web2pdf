Wunderkinds, even those who deservedly stick around a long time, don’t
seem to age normally. Zadie Smith’s presence will always carry a
significant memory of the 24-year-old who published [“White
Teeth”](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/30/reviews/000430.30quinnt.html)
to international acclaim. But, being subject to the space-time
continuum, Smith is in her mid-40s now, and has the temperament and
perspective of someone who could be (a compliment, in this case) 105.

It’s never a boom time for wisdom — almost by definition; if it were
more common, it wouldn’t be valued so highly — but this is an especially
arid era for it. We’re in the Age of Certainty, at least in the
bellowing of its various constituents. And maybe that’s fine; maybe some
times are just for fighting ideological fire with ideological fire. But
“polemic” is too generous a word for the dominant cultural tone.

All of which makes Smith feel especially out of time. In the very brief
foreword to her first book of essays, [“Changing My
Mind,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/books/review/Mishra-t.html)
she wrote: “Ideological inconsistency is, for me, practically an article
of faith.” That faith doesn’t seem to have wavered in the 10 years since
that book was published. “Intimations,” her slender new collection (less
than 100 pages) of ultra-timely essays (several written in the past few
momentous months), showcases her trademark levelheadedness.

This cast of mind doesn’t mean that Smith avoids moral stances. In
“Intimations,” she speaks clearly and forcefully about the murder of
George Floyd and the legacy of slavery and the systemic sins revealed by
Covid-19. “The virus map of the New York boroughs turns redder along
precisely the same lines as it would if the relative shade of crimson
counted not infection and death but income brackets and middle-school
ratings,” she writes. “Death comes to all — but in America it has long
been considered reasonable to offer the best chance of delay to the
highest bidder.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At her most withering, on the subject of race, she writes about the
many, “even in the bluest states in America,” who “are very happy to
‘blackout’ their social media for a day, to read all-Black books and
‘educate’ themselves about Black issues — as long as this education
does not occur in the form of actual Black children attending their
actual schools.”

But despite these jabs, Smith remains unmistakably noncombative. This
spirit appears born not of a fear of confrontation but a genuine
perplexity (of a searching, brilliant kind) at the nature of experience
and people, including herself. She says that the art of writing, though
it’s often advertised as “creative,” is really about “control.” “The
part of the university in which I teach,” she says, “should properly be
called the Controlling Experience Department.”

As a writer and reader, what she finds — in a phrase perfectly suited to
her sensibility — is “a wide repertoire of possible attitudes.” But out
in the world, living eludes control; it’s “mystifying, overwhelming,
conscious, subconscious,” and “it just keeps coming at
you.”

Smith’s gifts as a novelist animate her essays. Writing about the
neighborhood nail place where she regularly goes for stress relief, we
get a portrait of her masseur, Ben, who teases her for always reading
during their sessions and who asks where her hair “comes from.”
(“Jamaica and England — via Africa,” she tells him. Ben replies: “Ho
ho ho\! Interesting mix\!”) As the essay closes, Smith watches Ben from
afar, the optimistic face she’s used to seeing changed into “a stern
portrait of calculation and concern,” worried, Smith assumes, about the
constant heavy traffic needed for the place to pay the rent.

Anxiety lurks through these few pages. This is a work of minor
dimensions at — and about — a major time. (Royalties from the book will
go to two charities, The Equal Justice Initiative and The COVID-19
Emergency Relief Fund for New York.)

Smith herself left New York early on in the pandemic’s course, and she
expresses guilt about this without over-performing it. She bemoans, when
thinking about the apocalypse or anything even approaching it, her lack
of a survival instinct. “A book like ‘The Road’ is as incomprehensible
to me as a Norse myth cycle in the original language,” she writes.
“Suicide would hold out its quiet hand to me on the first day — the
first hour.”

In an essay called “Suffering Like Mel Gibson” (its title is a play on a
popular meme), she writes provocatively of Christ on the cross, looking
at those crucified beside him and wondering “whether his agonies, when
all was said and done, were relatively speaking in fact better than
those of the thieves and beggars to his left and right whose sufferings
long predated their present crucifixions and who had no hope (unlike
Christ) of an improved post-cross situation.” This thought comes in a
passage addressing the word of this century so far, “privilege,” which
she does with her usual many-sidedness: She notes her own advantages;
parses the stubbornness of inequality; and outlines the explanatory (and
experiential) limitations of privilege, including its ultimate inability
to shield anyone from suffering, sometimes to the point of suicide. In
Zadie Smith’s universe — meaning, for my money, the one we’re all living
in — complexity is king.

She sympathizes with the generations coming up behind her, born into a
beleaguered century and now living through the current crises with
worried eyes on a deeply tenuous future. In one of the finest lines in
“Intimations,” Smith writes: “The infinite promise of American youth —
a promise elaborately articulated by movies and advertisements and
university prospectuses — has been an empty lie for so long that I
notice my students joking about it with a black humor more appropriate
to old men, to the veterans of wars.”

It might be engrossing to hear Smith in conversation with those she now
teaches, to see where their ideas overlap and diverge. Toward the end of
the book, she writes elliptically of identity as an “area of interest.”
Elsewhere she argues for solidarity among “the plague class — that is,
all economically exploited people, whatever their race.”

Interested in what she once called “coalition across difference,” Smith
has some opinions that she defines as commonplace but that she must know
are now hotly debated.

She resists, for instance, the idea of “hate crime” as a desirable
distinction, calling it “an elevation of importance in what strikes me
as the wrong direction,” lending an undeserved power to the bigotry that
inspires the term.

“The hatred of a group *qua* group is, after all, the most debased and
irrational of hatreds, the weakest, the *most* banal,” she writes. “It
shouldn’t radiate a special aura, lifting it into a separate
epistemological category. For this is exactly what the killer believes.”
