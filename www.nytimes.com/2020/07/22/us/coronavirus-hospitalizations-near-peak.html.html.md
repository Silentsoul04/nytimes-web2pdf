# U.S. Hospitalizations for the Coronavirus Near April Peak

The rising hospitalizations reflect the scale of serious illnesses:
Nearly as many people are in hospitals now as there were when New York
was at its worst.

They are hooked up to ventilators, relying on the machines to breathe.
They are taking experimental drugs that doctors hope will ease their
agony. They are isolated from their families, fighting to recover on
their own.

More people are on track to be hospitalized with the coronavirus in the
United States than at any point in the pandemic, a disturbing sign of
how the current surge has spread widely and is seriously sickening as
many people as ever.

Across the country, 59,628 **** people were being treated in hospitals
on Wednesday, according to [the Covid Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily), nearing an earlier
peak of 59,940 on April 15, when the center of the outbreak was New
York.

The country is [averaging more than 66,000 new virus cases per
day](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
more than twice as many as a month ago, and deaths have also started
trending upward, with an average of more than 800 daily. But
hospitalizations may be the clearest measure of how widely the virus is
causing the most serious illnesses, and could offer a glimpse of what is
ahead.

“Once you get to the point of being hospitalized or in the I.C.U., some
notable portion of those people will die,” said Natalie E. Dean, an
infectious-disease expert at the University of Florida. Even when
patients walk out of the hospital, “we don’t know what the long-term
consequences are,” she said. “Surviving doesn’t mean thriving.”

Not long ago, things seemed to be improving. Fewer than 28,000 patients
were hospitalized as of mid-June, when a new surge of cases was
appearing throughout the Sun
Belt.

The uptick in hospitalized patients around the country reflects a
different phase of the pandemic — a widening geographic area, especially
across the South, for the most serious illnesses compared with what had
been a relatively concentrated crisis in the spring.

Back then, nearly one in five hospitalized patients were in New York,
and the [city had to set up mobile
morgues](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-bodies.html)
to keep up with the rising deaths. Now, the situation looks far
different, and California, where the virus is surging, has reported more
cases than New York. In the past week, both Florida and Texas [have
added an average of more than 10,000 reported cases each
day](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
with California not far behind.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The spike in hospitalizations for the virus has been driven in part by
people younger than 50. That group made up nearly 40 percent of the
hospitalizations as of earlier this month, compared with 26 percent in
late April, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html). The
shift offers one hopeful sign: Young people are less likely to die from
the virus.

The majority of hospitalizations — about 60 percent — are now in the
South, [according to the Covid Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/regional-current-hospitalizations),
which is run by The Atlantic and collects state hospitalization data.

The tracking project’s data is the most complete tally of
hospitalizations available and relies largely on figures reported by
state and local health officials. Still, there are gaps in available
information. Florida [began reporting daily hospitalization numbers only
this
month](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243899367.html),
and the tracking project’s website does not include hospitalization
figures for Hawaii and Kansas because it says those states do not
provide the data.

In some places with lots of seriously ill patients, the rise in
hospitalizations has tested the limits of local hospital systems. Some
of the most severely battered communities are in Texas, where more than
10,800 people were being treated in hospitals for the virus on
Wednesday, a record high for the state. The situation is most acute in
the Rio Grande Valley on the Texas-Mexico border, where more than a
third of families live in poverty.

“Our hospitals are maxed out. They are at 100 percent capacity,” said
Frank Torres, the emergency management coordinator for Willacy County.
He described paramedics and patients spending hours in ambulances before
they could enter hospitals. Inside, patients are left in the halls of
chaotic emergency departments, waiting for a bed.

“It’s just an overwhelming mess,” he said.

But in a sprawling state like Texas, the crisis is not always as
apparent as it was in densely packed New York City, where sirens were
frequently heard and [people emerged from windows and balconies each
night](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/10/nyregion/nyc-7pm-cheer-thank-you-coronavirus.html)
to support front-line workers, sending cheers all around the city.

In San Antonio, an official with Christus Health told reporters that its
hospital system was running out of space for morgues and was preparing
to store bodies in refrigerated trucks even as ordinary life is
proceeding in other parts of the city. One of the biggest movie theaters
in the area, the Palladium, remains open for discounted $5
showings.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The broadening crisis means that even hospitals in states without the
worst outbreaks are feeling the strain. In Oklahoma, hospitalizations
have been on the rise since mid-June, and about 80 to 90 percent of
hospital beds have been filled in recent days. Even so, its situation
seemed enviable compared with neighboring Texas.

“Houston hospitals are calling Oklahoma hospitals trying to place their
sick patients,” said Dr. George Monks, president of the Oklahoma State
Medical Association. Summers are typically a slower season for
hospitals, Dr. Monks said, which has left him worried about the
well-being of health care workers and the long months ahead.

“There is just no pool of doctors and nurses available that we can hire
to come in and help,” he said. “You can’t hire them from Texas. They’ve
got their hands full.”

Aubree Gordon, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University
of Michigan, said the rise in cases and hospitalizations appeared to
reflect people returning to pre-pandemic behaviors, such as going to
bars or gathering with friends. The number of hospitalizations, she
said, was sure to rise further, and she said some political leaders
seemed wary of imposing restrictions again.

“Those locations are more hesitant than before to shut down because they
feel like they shut down before and it didn’t prevent them from having
the big outbreak,” Dr. Gordon said.

In and around Miami, so many patients have packed hospitals that daily
reports routinely show wards at over 100 percent capacity — a sign the
facilities have filled their regular beds and are operating with
additional beds set up solely to accommodate the
surge.

“I always worry about having a scenario like we saw in New York where
the hospital system is overwhelmed,” said Dr. Yvonne Johnson, the chief
medical officer at South Miami Hospital. “Right now, we are handling
things.”

At Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, some coronavirus patients are
being treated in a large, air-conditioned tent in the hospital parking
lot until a room opens up, said Dr. Lilly Lee, the hospital’s director
of emergency medicine. She said that the hospital had treated a wave of
younger patients in June, but that more older people are now coming in
with the virus.

“Over the past week, we’ve noticed that the patients are more 60, 70,”
she said. “That was our concern initially: That some of these younger
people out there would cause illness in the older and more vulnerable
population.”

Contributing reporting were Manny Fernandez, Josh Keller, Patricia
Mazzei and Mitch Smith.
