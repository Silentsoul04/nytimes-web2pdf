# U.S. Northeast, Pummeled in the Spring, Now Stands Out in Virus Control

</div>

In just over two months, the Northeast has gone from the country’s worst
coronavirus hot spot to its most controlled. “It’s acting like Europe,”
one expert said.

BOSTON — Last week, as Dr. Emily Wroe left her home in Boston and drove
west to see her parents in Idaho, she watched as signs of the pandemic
became fewer and farther between.

After she left Ohio, customers at gas stations no longer wore masks. In
Nebraska, when she needed a repair to her truck, the mechanic seemed to
look at her strangely because she was wearing one. In Montana, there
were no masks in sight, and motorcyclists clustered in groups of 20.

The farther she was from the East Coast, the more she found Americans
treating the threat of the virus as “faraway, and not important.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I wasn’t surprised, but it is striking,” said Dr. Wroe, who spent the
spring preparing contact tracers for Massachusetts. “We’re in the middle
of a global pandemic, and there are a lot of towns and businesses along
the way where nothing has changed.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Six months since the coronavirus crisis was first detected in the United
States, the Northeast stands in sharp contrast with the rest of the
nation.

Along the East Coast, from Delaware through Maine, new case reports
remain at a low level, a small fraction of their April peak. Six of the
country’s 11 states with flat or falling case levels are in that
Northeastern corridor.

New York State announced on Wednesday that just over 700 people were
hospitalized because of the virus, the fewest since mid-March and a huge
drop from a peak of over 18,000 people. Deaths have also slowed
significantly, hovering around 20 for the past six days, compared with
the nearly 800 fatalities in a single day at its peak.

“It’s acting like Europe,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard
Global Health Institute, said of the Northeastern United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like Europe, the Northeast suffered a devastating wave of illnesses and
deaths in March and April, and state leaders responded, after some
hesitation, with aggressive lockdowns and big investments in testing and
tracing efforts. Residents have largely followed rules and been
surprisingly supportive of tough measures, even at the cost of economic
pain.

Dr. Jha said the difference in regional trajectories was so pronounced
that, by the time flu season rolls around in the late fall, “I would not
be surprised if what we have is two countries, one which is neck-deep in
coronavirus, its hospitals overwhelmed, and another part of the country
that is struggling a little, but largely doing OK with their economy.”

It is also true that the Northeast remains the corner of America that
has suffered most from the virus. New Jersey, New York, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island have reported the country’s most deaths
per capita over the course of the pandemic, with more than 61,000
combined. And the economic wounds from prolonged shutdowns are deep:
Massachusetts’s unemployment rate in June [climbed to 17.4
percent](https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2020/07/17/massachusetts-unemployment-rate-worst-country),
the worst in the country, according to federal data released on Friday.

But polls, so far, suggest that voters in the Northeast are prepared to
tolerate prolonged economic pain in order to stop the spread of the
virus. Governors from the states that were hit early in the pandemic
have sustained [the highest approval ratings in the
country](https://covidstates.net/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%20APPROVAL%20JULY%202020.pdf).

And in May, when a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center
asked Massachusetts residents how long they could endure the hardships
of a shutdown, 38 percent of those surveyed answered “indefinitely.”

“This isn’t an economic policy, this is life or death,” said David
Paleologos, the center’s director. “That is at the core of why people
are saying, ‘I’ll do whatever it takes.’”

The crisis has drawn out key regional differences in how Americans view
the role of government in their lives, said Wendy J. Schiller, chair of
the political science department at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
The Northeast, she said, with its 400-year tradition of localized,
participatory government, has been less affected by decades of
antigovernment rhetoric.

“In New England and the Northeast, it is easier to say, ‘Let’s put on a
mask and lock down, we’re all in this together, we know each other,’”
she said. “It’s this reservoir of belief that the government exists to
be good.”

Four months ago, all of the New England governors were scrambling to
contain the spread of the virus. They had hesitated to impose shutdowns
in early March, when many in the public health community were urging
immediate action, Dr. Jha said.

“It took longer than it should,” he said.

But the responses that followed were aggressive. Charlie Baker, the
Republican governor of Massachusetts, [decided after a late-night phone
call](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/coronavirus-massachusetts-contact-tracing.html)
with Jim Yong Kim, co-founder of the nonprofit Partners in Health, to
budget $55 million for contact-tracing programs that would recruit and
train a corps of 1,900 newly minted public health workers. The program
was up and running within weeks.

“I certainly felt under the gun — and I know many of my colleagues did —
to make decisions with less than perfect information,” Mr. Baker said.

By this month, tracers were able to reach 90 percent of contacts within
24 hours. New cases had fallen so steeply that the corps was reduced to
500.

There was a similar scramble to acquire personal protective equipment,
which included chartering six flights from China to carry shipments of
masks. In early April, Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England
Patriots, [transported a million N95
masks](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/02/nation/kraft-family-used-patriots-team-plane-shuttle-protective-masks-china-boston-wsj-reports/)
from China to Boston Logan International Airport on a team plane.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There’s all kinds of things that happened over this period of time that
were unusual decisions and risky ones, but for most of us, we felt we
were doing what we had to do,” said Mr. Baker, whose job approval
ratings rose to 81 percent in late June, according to a [Suffolk
University
poll](https://www.suffolk.edu/news-features/news/2020/06/24/11/14/poll-4-out-of-5-bay-staters-say-police-dont-treat-blacks-equally).

In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, took a stern approach
beginning in late March, at one point [ordering State Police to stop
cars](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/coronavirus-rhode-island-checkpoint.html)
entering the state from New York to enforce quarantine requirements. She
regularly warns that expanding freedoms will be curtailed if residents
fail to observe social distancing
rules.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

It has been a transformational political moment for Ms. Raimondo,
lifting her approval ratings to [81 percent in late
April](https://www.wpri.com/news/politics/poll-81-in-ri-back-gov-raimondos-handling-of-coronavirus-crisis/),
at the height of the pandemic, from [35 percent in
January](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/01/17/metro/poll-raimondo-is-no-longer-most-unpopular-governor-us/?s_campaign=rhodemap:newsletter).
Her signature admonition — “knock it off” — became so popular that a
gift shop in Providence [printed it on
T-shirts](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/30/metro/ri-shop-selling-t-shirts-with-raimondos-message-social-distancing-scofflaws-knock-it-off/).

Mr. Baker said the high level of compliance with quarantine measures was
natural, given how badly the region was battered in the spring.

“Like everybody else, I know people who have been directly affected by
this thing,” he said. “I’ve had very close friends almost die. I’ve had
good friends who have lost family members because of it. I went 100-odd
days without seeing my father because he’s 92 years old and in an
assisted living facility.”

It is not certain what the months ahead will hold for the Northeast. A
new surge of cases in the South and the West has spread across other
states, and as of this week, cases were rising in 41 states. The number
of people hospitalized for the coronavirus across the country was
nearing an earlier peak in the spring, according to the [Covid Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily). Among states where
cases were slightly rising in recent days were Rhode Island and
Massachusetts.

In New York, the drop in cases has held even as the state has gone
through a gradual reopening process, one that began with officials
warning that they would not hesitate to restore restrictions if the
virus showed signs of returning. Nearly two months after the state began
reopening, New York has seen about 1 percent of Covid-19 tests return
positive.

Dr. Jha said he was optimistic that Northeastern states could maintain
control over the virus’s spread through the summer, reopening gradually
while closely monitoring shifts in the data.

“I think they’re watching what’s happening in the South and they’re
horrified,” he said.

Gov. Janet Mills of Maine, a Democrat, sounded cautious. She said
officials in her state were “exhaling, but safely, with masks.”

“The last few weeks, in particular, have felt good, but we’re not out of
the woods,” she said.

The coming months will bring new waves of difficulty as well, as the
economic impact of the spring shutdowns ripples outward, unemployment
benefits expire and an expected wave of evictions begins.

Of all the difficult decisions that she faced this year, Ms. Mills said,
none has been more “gut-wrenching” than her first stay-at-home order.

“Nobody wants to be the governor who puts the kibosh on graduations,
weddings, beach parties, bars,” she said. “Nobody wants to be the
governor the tourist industry rails against. Nobody wants to be that
governor.”

New York.
