Two cafeterias used by White House staff members were closed and contact
tracing was conducted after an employee tested positive for the
coronavirus, a Trump administration official said on Wednesday night.

The cafeterias are in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and the
New Executive Office Building, which are part of the White House complex
and are next to the West Wing.

It was not immediately clear whether the employee was a cafeteria
worker, and the White House did not say what kind of symptoms the person
showed.

The White House notified employees about measures in an email and said
that there was no need for them to self-quarantine, according to the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not
authorized to speak publicly about the situation.

The staff members were advised to monitor for symptoms of the virus and
instructed to stay home if they felt sick, the official said.

The development came just hours after President Trump spoke at the White
House daily briefing on the pandemic, which his administration resumed
this week. Mr. Trump's job approval ratings have sagged amid a surge in
new cases across the South and the West.

After months of resisting calls for him to recommend that Americans wear
masks, Mr. Trump finally did so this week. The president also
acknowledged that the pandemic was likely to get worse before it gets
better.

Mr. Trump and members of his administration are regularly tested for the
virus, as are credentialed journalists who cover the White House. But it
was not immediately clear what testing protocols were in place for
employees in the executive office buildings in the complex.

Despite the rigorous precautionary measures, Mr. Trump's administration
has not been able to keep the virus at bay.

In May, a military aide who had contact with Mr. Trump tested positive
for the virus, as did Katie Miller, the press secretary for Vice
President Mike Pence.

This month, Mr. Pence postponed a planned trip to Arizona after Secret
Service agents set to travel with him tested positive for the
coronavirus or showed symptoms of having it. And also this month,
Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News commentator who is dating Donald
Trump Jr., contracted the virus.
