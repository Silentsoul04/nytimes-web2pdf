# Portland Clashes Converge on Courthouse Named for an Antiwar Republican

</div>

The site where federal officers have fired tear gas and projectiles at
protesters is named after a senator, Mark O. Hatfield, who described
himself as “close” to being a pacifist.

At the federal court in [Portland,
Ore.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/22/us/portland-protests.html),
the action usually takes place inside sleek, wood-paneled courtrooms.
That is where an imprisoned C.I.A. spy [admitted to smuggling notes to
Russia](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2010/11/former_cia_spy_jim_nicholson_p_1.html)
through his son, where a judge [upheld Oregon’s landmark
assisted-suicide
law](https://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/04/17/oregon.assisted.suicide/), and
where a jury [acquitted seven
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/us/bundy-brothers-acquitted-in-takeover-of-oregon-wildlife-refuge.html)
who participated in the armed takeover of a federal wildlife sanctuary.

In recent weeks, though, it is the exterior of the Mark O. Hatfield U.S.
Courthouse in downtown Portland that [has become a battleground during
chaotic, nightly
protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/portland-protests.html)
that continued through Wednesday morning. Federal agents have fired
projectiles and tear gas [from inside the
building](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1285490693486473216?s=20)
as protesters lobbed water bottles, set fires and spray-painted the
walls with phrases including “Feds go home.”

The federal courthouse — named after a longtime Oregon lawmaker who said
he was “close” to being a pacifist — is perhaps an unlikely target for
the demonstrations, which have more often focused on [the building next
door](https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/06/portlands-justice-center-fence-a-daunting-place-after-dark-for-both-protesters-and-police.html),
which houses the Portland Police Bureau, a county jail and other local
law enforcement operations.

But the Trump administration’s decision to send [federal agents to
Portland](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/protests-portland-federal-withdrawal.html)
and other cities to stamp out protests and defend U.S. property, like
the courthouse, has in recent days [galvanized
protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/portland-protests-navy-christopher-david.html)
against the federal government.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The courthouse, which takes up an entire city block and rises to 16
floors, began hearing cases in 1997, replacing a nearby building that
had been home to the federal Oregon District Court for 64 years. It cost
$129 million to build, according to [an article published
in 1998](https://usdchs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1998-Spring-Oregon-Benchmarks.pdf)
in Oregon Benchmarks, a newsletter for the court’s historical society,
which said the building’s design had received “more plaudits than pans.”

The courthouse is named after [Mark Odom
Hatfield](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/us/politics/08hatfield.html),
a Republican who served as Oregon’s governor from 1959 to 1967 and then
as one of its senators from 1967 to 1997.

Before his political career, he served as a Navy lieutenant in World War
II and visited Hiroshima not long after the United States dropped the
atomic bomb, experiences that shaped his worldview and turned him
against many future American wars, including in Vietnam. Many described
him as a pacifist — he [never
voted](https://www.senate.gov/senators/FeaturedBios/Featured_Bio_HatfieldMark.htm)
for a military authorization bill — but he told The Associated Press in
1991 that he was not one, only “close.”

“I find that war, with exceptions, has really not settled very many
things that were the causes of the wars in the first place,” Mr.
Hatfield [said in that
interview](https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/442485597/). Later in
1991, he [proposed a
bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/1155)
that would have required federal executions to take place in public and
in a place where they could be broadcast on television, [believing that
doing
so](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/03/opinion/pictures-at-an-execution.html)
would lead the public to oppose the death penalty. The Senate never
voted on the bill.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Hatfield was also known for his devout Christianity and willingness
to work with Democrats. As a state lawmaker in 1953, he [worked to pass
the state’s civil rights
bill](https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/signing-oregon39s-civil-rights-bill-1953)
outlawing racial discrimination by hotels and other businesses. Mr.
Hatfield [died in 2011 at
age 89](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/us/politics/08hatfield.html).

Julie Engbloom, a lawyer and president of the federal court’s historical
society, wrote in the group’s [most recent
newsletter](https://usdchs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/benchmarks_spring2020_rev-final-web.pdf)
about graffiti on the courthouse that had covered a quotation from
Thomas Jefferson. Etched into the building’s stone is [a phrase that
Jefferson
wrote](http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&psid=230)
in opposition to adding Missouri to the United States as a free state:
“The boisterous sea of liberty is never without a wave.”

“The graffiti painted on our beloved courthouse is difficult to take
in,” [she
wrote](https://usdchs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/benchmarks_spring2020_rev-final-web.pdf).
“But we must.”

Ms. Engbloom added that the Minneapolis police killing of [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/article/george-floyd-who-is.html) in May
had unleashed a [wave of
protests](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles)
that were “rolling toward us like a tsunami.” The protesters were
demanding “more from our institutions,” she wrote, “including the
courts.”
