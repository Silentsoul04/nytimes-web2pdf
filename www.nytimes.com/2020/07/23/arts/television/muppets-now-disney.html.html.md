# It’s Time to Re-Re-Re-Meet the Muppets

“Muppets Now,” a new series on Disney+, is the latest attempt to take
Kermit the Frog and his fuzzy companions back to their anarchic sketch
comedy
roots.

At the dawn of [“The Muppet
Show”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE337D_V4vA) in the late 1970s,
a visit to the Muppet Labs consisted of watching its nebbishy
proprietor, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, [demonstrate misbegotten
inventions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j2pvi8FOQA&t=5s) like an
exploding hat or a self-destructing necktie with a brief burst of
pyrotechnics, a canned explosion sound and a puff of smoke.

Today, a return visit to those labs on the Disney+ series [“Muppets
Now”](https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/muppets-now)
features Honeydew and his agitated assistant, Beaker, using a homemade
device called the Infern-O-Matic to reduce everyday items — a carton of
eggs, a wall clock, a guitar — to smoldering piles of ashes.

If this scene from “Muppets Now” feels manic and combustible — and even
a bit familiar — that is by design: as Leigh Slaughter, vice president
of the Muppets Studio, explained recently, she and her colleagues are
hopeful that this series will conjure up “that true Muppet anarchy —
that complete chaos.”

She added: “If they’re going to take on real-world science, we thought,
we have to burn things. We have to drop things. We have to blow things
up.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Muppets Now,” a six-episode series that debuts on July 31, is both
Disney’s attempt to bring those familiar, fuzzy faces to its streaming
service and a parody of internet content. Its segments feature
characters like Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef in rapid-fire comedy
sketches that lampoon popular online formats.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new series also strives to reconnect the Muppets with the disorderly
sensibility they embodied in the era of “The Muppet Show” and get back
to basics after other recent efforts to reboot the characters fizzled
out.

“The thinking is to stop trying so hard to be like everybody else and
just be the Muppets,” said Bill Barretta, a veteran Muppet performer and
an executive producer of “Muppets Now.” “Let’s celebrate the fact that
they all have to deal with each other and just be silly and play and
entertain again.”

Nearly 45 years after its debut, “The Muppet Show” (which originally ran
in syndication from 1976 to 1981) remains a high-water mark for the
franchise. Fueled by the subversive imagination of the Muppets creator,
[Jim
Henson](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/17/obituaries/jim-henson-puppeteer-dies-the-muppets-creator-was-53.html?searchResultPosition=10),
and a small band of like-minded performers and writers, it was a
backstage showbiz satire bolstered by kitschy celebrity hosts and a
madcap attitude inherited from sketch shows like “Saturday Night Live”
([where the Muppets had previously
appeared](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/dregs-and-vestiges/n8614))
and “Monty Python’s Flying Circus.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The popularity of “The Muppet Show” paved the way for hit films like
[“The Muppet Movie”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS3Lkc6Gzlk)
(1979) which tempered the mayhem of the TV series with a sentimental
streak and endeared founding performers like Henson and Frank Oz to a
generation of
viewers.

But keeping the Muppets relevant to modern audiences has proved elusive,
particularly since [they were acquired by
Disney](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/18/business/kermit-and-miss-piggy-join-stable-of-walt-disney-stars.html?searchResultPosition=7)
in 2004. (The Muppet characters created for “Sesame Street” remain the
property of Sesame Workshop, a nonprofit organization, while other shows
like “Fraggle Rock” are owned by the Jim Henson Company.)

A 2011 film, [“The
Muppets,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuh2Ku9PpQ) written by
Nicholas Stoller and Jason Segel (“Forgetting Sarah Marshall”) was a
critical and commercial hit that won an Academy Award for its song [“Man
or Muppet,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRTjksM3YAs) written by
Bret McKenzie. But a 2014 follow-up, [“Muppets Most
Wanted,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXEfNU8Qwk) was a
disappointment and quickly curtailed the revival.

In 2015, an ABC sitcom called [“The
Muppets”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU2Ec5_3E2s) drew attention
for its single-camera mockumentary style (similar to shows like “The
Office”) and a plotline in which Kermit and Miss Piggy broke up. But the
show [was not
well-received](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/arts/television/review-muppets-abc-kermit-ms-piggy.html?searchResultPosition=4);
it was
[troubled](https://deadline.com/2015/11/the-muppets-showrunner-bob-kushell-exit-kristin-newman-reboot-1201606360/)
by [staff
changes](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-says-fired-kermit-frog-actor-unacceptable-business-conduct-1021701)
and canceled after one season.

Barretta, who plays Muppets like Rowlf the Dog and Pepe the King Prawn,
said the approach of that sitcom “was too much, too stereotypical of the
characters.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dan Silver, who is vice president of original unscripted content for
Disney+, agreed that serialized plot twists were not necessarily going
to bring viewers back to the Muppets. “Sometimes it’s not about if Piggy
and Kermit are going to get together,” he said. “It’s about, how does
that make something funny in a skit?”

The Muppets have had other contemporary successes that seemed to point
to a path forward, including [a 2009 viral
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbNymZ7vqY) in which they
performed Queen’s pop-rock operetta “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and a live show
presented at the Hollywood Bowl (in 2017) and London’s O2 Arena (in
2018).

Eric Jacobson, a Muppets performer who now plays Fozzie and Miss Piggy,
said that the live concerts were a crucial step in steering the puppet
troupe back to its fundamental
values.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They were very collaborative experiences,” Jacobson said of the shows,
which included classic Muppets numbers like “Mahna Mahna” and “Rainbow
Connection.”

“There was a real conscious effort to go back to the Muppets’ roots, to
play up the personalities and that sense of abandon that people really
respond to,” he added.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last year, [Disney
announced](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/muppets-shortform-series-a-go-at-disney-1234166)
that it was working with the Muppets Studio to create a new sketch show.
(Another planned Muppets series being prepared by Adam Horowitz and
Edward Kitsis of “Once Upon a Time” and Josh Gad of “Frozen” [was halted
around this
time](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/muppets-disney-comedy-series-scrapped-1238475)
amid creative differences.)

Silver, the Disney+ executive, said that “Muppets Now” should reflect
the elasticity of the underlying property. Like Mickey Mouse or the
Simpsons, he said, the Muppets are meant to “live among us — they’re not
a nostalgia play, they just exist in whatever time we’re in.”

What makes the Muppets work, he said, can be found in something as
rudimentary as [the early test footage for “The Muppet
Movie”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci9gPZnqiGY) that shows Henson
and Oz roaming the countryside as they ad-lib dialogue for Kermit the
Frog, Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear.

“It’s just Jim and Frank figuring out, how do you put them in the real
world outside a studio?” Silver said. “It’s completely improvised and
it’s hilarious. The whole framework was there. It just needed to be
appropriated into today.”

The structure of “Muppets Now,” he said, was also suggested by going
back to the early days and taking a cue from the original “Muppet Show,”
which was in part a sendup of comedy-variety programs of the 1960s and
70s. As Silver put it: “If ‘The Muppet Show’ was a subversion of Sonny
and Cher and Ed Sullivan, what would that be in this day and age? And
the answer is YouTube.”

Taking the programming formats of streaming video and populating them
with its antic characters, “Muppets Now” gives us segments like a beauty
and lifestyle video blog hosted by Miss Piggy; a cooking competition
with the Swedish Chef; and a high-octane Muppet Labs science test with
Dr. Honeydew and Beaker. (Of course, there are also cheeky cameos from
celebrities like Aubrey Plaza, Danny Trejo and Linda Cardellini.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most of the sketches were filmed last summer, amid a process that the
Muppet performers said was collaborative and open to a wide range of
inputs.

“When we’re on set, there is discussion among the Muppet performers with
the writer and the producer and director,” said Matt Vogel, who plays
Kermit the Frog.

“We’ll talk it through before we shoot something,” Vogel said, “and even
when we’re shooting things, the Muppet performers are pretty adept at
ad-libbing as long as it’s character-appropriate.”

Still, some remaining footage for interstitial segments was produced
during the coronavirus pandemic. This required performers to record
themselves at home and required spouses, partners and children to lend a
hand or keep quiet during their creation.

Vogel explained that his family had grown accustomed to the unusual
parameters of his double life.

“I have five kids, and they’re all used to having Muppets around the
house or being on set with Muppets,” he said. “They’re always very
respectful and kind, but they have their own kid lives that they’re more
concerned about than whether or not Kermit’s playing the banjo in their
basement.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Beyond this first season of “Muppets Now,” Disney and the Muppets Studio
are hopeful that the series will provide a starting point for further
projects, but they were wary when it came to discussing specific plans.

“We definitely have ambitions for the Muppets to be doing more,” said
Slaughter, the Muppets Studio vice president. “But there’s nothing that
we’re ready to reveal at this point.”

In the meantime, the creators and performers on “Muppets Now” said that,
in trying to reproduce the do-it-yourself aesthetics of the internet,
they felt they had also tapped into something essential about the Muppet
characters: They are proud underdogs who seem to do their best work with
limited resources.

“The Muppets have always flown by the seat of their pants,” Jacobson
said, explaining that they operate on “primitive production values and a
very low bar that they set for themselves.”

“Our aim was to produce these segments as though they were held together
by spit and glue,” he added.

The fact that “Muppets Now” is arriving during a summer when viewers are
famished for original content felt consistent with the minimal
aspirations of its title characters, Jacobson said.

Summoning up a self-deprecating sentiment that could just as easily come
from the mouth of [Statler or
Waldorf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14njUwJUg1I), Jacobson said
with a laugh, “People’s expectations for anything new on television have
gone down so much that the Muppets can actually deliver.”
