Bronx-born and Boston-educated, he also worked as a translator in Paris
and Amsterdam before settling in New York in the late 1960s. He died of
Covid-19.

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Gerald Williams so impressed his ninth-grade English teacher with a
short story he had written, titled ``Cat-a-log,'' that she anointed him
editor of his school's literary magazine.

``She told me I'd be a writer,'' he told
\href{https://www.massreview.org/node/6609}{The Massachusetts Review} in
2018.

Ms. Figarty was mostly right: Mr. Williams found an eclectic calling as
a poet and essayist but also as an editor and translator.

He began his career after being discharged from the Army in Europe in
the 1950s, when he went to work in Paris for
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/05/obituaries/maurice-girodias-a-french-publisher-and-an-author-71.html}{Olympia
Press}, which published erotic and avant-garde fiction by writers like
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/05/archives/vladimir-nabokov-author-of-lolita-and-ada-is-dead-vladimir-nabokov.html}{Vladimir
Nabokov},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/09/archives/henry-miller-88-dies-in-california-a-credo-of-hedonism-henry-miller.html}{Henry
Miller} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/nyregion/william-s-burroughs-dies-at-83-member-of-the-beat-generation-wrote-naked-lunch.html}{William
Burroughs} --- work that was often banned in English-speaking countries.

He went on to work for the World Veterans Federation, a humanitarian
organization, and Delta, a literary review in Amsterdam.

Mr. Williams returned to the United States in the late 1960s and settled
in Manhattan, where he became an associate editor of Reader's Digest and
translated art books from Dutch, French and German into English for
Harry N. Abrams, Inc., now Abrams Books.

Mr. Williams died of complications of the coronavirus on July 17 in
Manhattan, his cousin, Clayton Carrington, said. He was 85. Mr. Williams
was also being treated for pancreatic cancer.

Gerald M. Williams was born on June 2, 1935, in the Bronx to Joseph and
Joyce (Sims) Williams. His mother was a high school teacher, and his
father was a truck driver. Gerald spent his teenage years in Boston, and
after graduating from \href{https://www.englishhs.org/}{The English High
School} there, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1957 from
Boston University.

``He began writing prose and poetry as a boy, and continued to do so all
his life,'' his friend Bob Baldock said.

In addition to contributing to numerous literary publications, like New
Letters, The Massachusetts Review and Harvard Review, he wrote a
book-length biographical poem titled ``Blowing Up Hitler: A Life
of\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/world/europe/16hitler.html}{Johann
Georg Elser}, Would-Be Assassin'' (1986*),* about a 1939 attempt to kill
the Führer with a time bomb secreted in a pillar in a Munich beer hall
at an annual rendezvous of Nazi figures. (The plot failed when Hitler
left 10 minutes early.)

Mr. Williams's chapbook included this passage from the poem:

\emph{Hitler and his pack}

\emph{Must be replaced}

\emph{By a nonwarring State}

\emph{(Elser resolves);}

\emph{One that honors}

\emph{Hard work}

\emph{With a decent wage.}

While working as a substitute teacher in Manhattan, Mr. Williams
discovered that students no longer learned cursive writing. In his essay
``The Astounding Power of Penmanship'' (2017), he lamented its loss both
to written communication and to the training of memory.

In his interview with The Massachusetts Review, Mr. Williams explained
the impact of penmanship on his creativity.

A keyboard ``tends to make my outpourings smart-alecky and seldom allows
me to say what I really mean,'' he said.

He added: ``Longhand is a must. My brain is in my hand then.''
