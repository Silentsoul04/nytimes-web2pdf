# Where an American Passport Doesn’t Work: The World, and Irish Pubs

Will the coronavirus finally show Americans how much privilege they’ve
enjoyed?

You know how countries have slogans, like Thailand is “The Land of
Smiles”? That seems like a lot of pressure on citizens and tourists
alike. An entire land of constant smiles? Even when you have lower back
pain or you’ve just been served surprise divorce papers: Smile\!

It’s been encouraging to see countries throw off this corporate-style
branding in recent times. Did you know that America’s last attempt at a
slogan was the 2016 “It’s all within reach”? Of course, we’re unable to
say it with a straight face anymore after years of travel bans. “It’s
aspirational,” we murmur beneath our masks, wincing as the country
isolates and dips further and further down in the world’s estimation.
Ireland regularly promoted itself as “The Land of a Thousand Welcomes” —
until the coronavirus came along and coughed on that idea, rendering it
high-risk.

The list of countries with borders open to Americans has never been
shorter. But for now, Ireland, unlike many others in Europe, is still
allowing Americans in. It’s the welcome part that’s missing. American
tourists who don’t feel like quarantining and instead hope to drink and
dine at recently and cautiously reopened restaurants and bars are being
soundly [turned
away.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/world/europe/Ireland-americans-break-quarantine.html)

This is of interest to me, an Irish citizen who lives in the United
States, because of my recent trip back. I went to Ireland when the
pandemic started, [figuring it would be
safer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-isolation-ireland.html).
It was. In fact, Ireland has [one of the lowest rates of Covid-19 in
Europe](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/ireland-has-lowest-current-incidence-of-covid-19-in-western-europe-1.4294642).
However, I missed my home and my life and mainly Shake Shack, so I
decided to go back to New York. It wasn’t easy, because of the travel
ban the United States has put in place on people coming from Europe.
This obstacle was new to me. An Irish passport is a powerful one that
usually admits me to most parts of the world, and an American visa like
the one I have in my passport is an equally rare and precious thing.

Suddenly, though, doors were being slammed shut and gates locked tight.
I decided to return through Canada. I applied for and got my visa waiver
online within minutes. I flew to London but was not allowed on the
connecting flight to Toronto. It turns out Canada has an extensive
travel ban too; Canadians are just too polite to shout about it. Between
the jigs and the reels, as we say in Brooklyn, I had to come through
Mexico. Not just transit through — I had to stay there for 14 days,
which I did last month. This itinerary was not my choice and certainly
not logical, but that’s what the travel ban did; it forced me to take
two extra long-haul flights, as well as holding me squarely in the
beautiful and resilient Mexico City, which at that time was a hot spot
experiencing record-high levels of infection.

I was there during [the June 23
earthquake](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/mexico-earthquake.html).
It was the first one I had experienced, and the shock waves made my
building sway. In the end, I made it back to New York, flying over the
land border that is now all but closed to those seeking asylum. I
quarantined and I’m grateful to be home.

I remain rocked by how something as physically flimsy as a passport and
as artlessly made as a border serve to divide human beings up into two
camps, the powerful and the powerless. Of course, this is not new
information to billions of people in the world. My inconvenient route
home was hardly a taste of the reality lived by most people today. It’s
just that now this bad luck is finally going around. Americans are now
barred from visiting [most of the rest of the
planet](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-international-travel-covid-19/index.html).
Perhaps now that American passports have stopped working and this
nation-state is no longer on top, more of us will understand the
injustice of the entire system.

What to do with this understanding, I’m not quite sure. One option is to
hew ever closer to the bald and horrifying reality that we — any and all
of us — are not entitled to any rights because we are human beings,
rather because we happen to be born in such and such a country, and to
act accordingly. To shut down, to prioritize ourselves and vigorously
declare to hell with everybody else. Fine. Although we’ve been trying
that and it isn’t actually working. In fact, it seems pretty
self-destructive.

Borders and bans and even nation-states, along with all of the laws and
violence that hold them together and apart, are relatively new compared
with how long humans have been around. Now that more of us are seeing
and living the constricting and dangerous reality of those artificial
distinctions, surely we need to change them. The person, the human
being, the vulnerable creature no different from any other, that is what
is sacred. Not their paperwork. Americans are learning that now. And
what easier way than being gently turned away from an Irish pub?
