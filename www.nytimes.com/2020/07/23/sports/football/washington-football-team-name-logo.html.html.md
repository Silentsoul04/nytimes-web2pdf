Washington’s N.F.L. team will retire Redskins branding and adopt a
placeholder team name until it can decide on a permanent name, the
organization said Thursday, weeks after announcing it would yield to
pressure from sponsors and activists and [drop the name it has used for
nearly 90
years](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/football/washington-redskins-new-name.html).

“For updated brand clarity and consistency purposes, we will call
ourselves the ‘Washington Football Team’ pending adoption of our new
name,” the team said in a news release, adding that the logo would be
retired by the start of the 2020 season in September.

The team also said it would roll out an aesthetic that would reflect the
direction of the new franchise as it changes.

The team’s [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/WashingtonNFL) and
[official site](https://www.redskins.com/) on Thursday took on the
temporary name and logo, a large W, though images of the original logo
remained in some places and its web address using the old name remained
unchanged.

The team also tweeted a design for new uniforms, which featured its
existing color scheme and a numeral on its helmet instead of the drawn
profile of a Native American face.

The team advertised forthcoming “Washington Football Team” merchandise,
and [on its website shared
prototypes](https://www.redskins.com/team/washingtonfootball) of the
temporary logo, uniform concepts and field designs that included an
N.F.L. logo at midfield. The end zones in its mock field design read
“Washington Football Team, Est. 1932.”

Team officials did not answer messages seeking comment on Thursday. It
was not immediately clear whether fans — if spectators are allowed at
all during the coronavirus pandemic — would be allowed to wear
merchandise with the old logo to games. It was also not clear whether
the team would eventually change its distinctive burgundy and gold
colors, [a move sought by Native American
groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/football/native-american-washington-name-change.html)
and nearly 150 federally recognized tribes in a letter sent to N.F.L.
Commissioner Roger Goodell this month.

The team is scheduled to open its season Sept. 13 against the
Philadelphia Eagles.

On July 13, [10 days after announcing it would
review](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/sports/football/washington-redskins-nickname-history.html)
the 87-year-old team name and under mounting pressure from corporate
sponsors, fans and Native American activists, the team [said it would
drop its logo and the name
“Redskins,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/sports/football/washington-redskins-new-name.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
a term many had long considered a racial slur.

The team’s owner, Daniel Snyder, had previously been uncooperative in
changing the team’s name, but said the new name would “[take into
account](https://www.nfl.com/news/washington-redskins-to-undergo-thorough-review-of-team-s-name)
not only the proud tradition and history of the franchise but also input
from our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National Football
League and the local community it is proud to represent on and off the
field.”

The name change came after weeks of national unrest following the
killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in late May,
and as much of the country quickly moved to change historical
representations that use racist symbols.

Last month, the Washington franchise spent several days [removing a
monument and remembrances honoring its former
owner](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/sports/football/redskins-ring-of-fame-marshall.html),
George Preston Marshall, from team facilities and its website. The
change came amid pressure on the team to acknowledge Marshall’s
resistance to signing and drafting African-American players and his
decision in 1933 to name the team the “Redskins.” A memorial of
Marshall, which had stood in front of R.F.K. Stadium, the team’s former
arena, was removed by a city agency after being defaced.

Last week, the team was once again in the spotlight as [15 women said
they were sexually
harassed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/sports/football/washington-sexual-assault-harassment-dan-snyder.html)
while employed by the team.
