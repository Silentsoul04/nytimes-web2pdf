We’ll probably never know exactly what sorts of documents were
incinerated at China’s Consulate in Houston in the days before the
United States forced it to close on Friday, after accusing it of being a
hub of espionage. We may also never know what caused this month’s
catastrophic fire aboard the U.S.S. Bonhomme Richard, a massive
amphibious assault ship that was being fitted out to double as a small
aircraft carrier, in the port of San Diego.

What we should know is that the two fires are actually one. We are
racing toward a conflict with China we may be ill-prepared to wage.

The closure of the consulate comes on the heels of a quad of bellicose
speeches from top administration officials, collectively amounting to a
declaration of Cold War against China. Robert O’Brien, the national
security adviser, painted China’s leadership [as unreconstructed
Marxist-Leninists](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/chinese-communist-partys-ideology-global-ambitions/).
The F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, spoke of China’s practice in the
art of [“malign foreign
influence.”](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states)
Attorney General Bill Barr accused China of [“economic
blitzkrieg.”](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/transcript-attorney-general-barr-s-remarks-china-policy-gerald-r-ford-presidential-museum)
And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted the free world [may need a new
version of
NATO](https://www.state.gov/communist-china-and-the-free-worlds-future/),
this one aimed at Beijing instead of Moscow.

Given that the source is Team Trump and the timing is an election year,
it’s tempting to dismiss the speeches’ warnings as cynical,
hypocritical, political — and therefore wrong. Why complain about civil
liberties in Hong Kong when we have goon squads in Portland? Why accuse
China of trashing global norms when that’s been Trump’s ambition from
the beginning? Why characterize Chinese President Xi Jinping as a linear
ideological descendant of Joseph Stalin when, as we know from John
Bolton, Trump was fulsomely praising him and soliciting his help for his
re-election bid?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And why all of this now, when Trump needs enemies both foreign and
domestic to rescue his flagging re-election bid?

But the problem with these questions is that — however on-point they are
as criticisms of Trump — they obscure two hard facts a Biden
administration will also confront. The first is that, under Xi, China
has become drastically more repressive at home, more aggressive abroad,
and more shameless about both than at nearly any point since the death
of Mao.

This is not a matter of Beijing reacting badly to Trump (as the early
Obama administration erroneously supposed that bad relations with Russia
were a matter of Moscow reacting badly to George W. Bush). Some of
China’s biggest digital heists date to the Obama years — including the
[2015 hack of the Office of Personnel
Management](https://www.lawfareblog.com/why-opm-hack-far-worse-you-imagine),
which gave Beijing the background security files for nearly 22 million
current or former U.S. government employees and their family members.
China’s [outrageous and illegal
claims](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/world/asia/south-china-sea-hague-ruling-philippines.html)
to most of the South China Sea also predate Trump and will fester long
after he’s gone.

What stands out now is just how brazen Beijing has become. Take one
detail from Wray’s speech: “We have now reached the point where the
F.B.I. is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about
every 10 hours,” he said. In one case, a single scientist, Hongjin Tan,
[pleaded
guilty](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-national-sentenced-to-prison-in-1-billion-trade-secret-theft-case-11582839551)
to stealing an estimated $1 billion in trade secrets from an
Oklahoma-based energy company.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Multiply that hundreds if not thousands of times over, and what you have
is arguably the largest single theft of foreign property since Germany
looted Europe in World War II. Whatever else one might say against the
Trump administration, it isn’t lying about China.

But this brings us to the second blunt fact. U.S. power in East Asia is
waning. Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership — the single best hedge the U.S. had against Chinese
economic dominance of the region — may, in hindsight, prove to be his
single worst policy mistake. He has tried to shake down both South Korea
and Japan to pay more for basing U.S. forces: penny ante politics that
only raise doubts about America’s reliability as an ally.

And then there’s the degraded state of the U.S. Navy, epitomized by the
fire on the Bonhomme Richard (itself the latest in a string of
corruption, leadership, [cost
over-run](https://news.usni.org/2020/07/02/navy-removes-ford-carrier-program-manager-citing-performance-over-time)
and [competency
scandals](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/01/14/worse-than-you-thought-inside-the-secret-fitzgerald-probe-the-navy-doesnt-want-you-to-read/)
to bedevil the service). Trump came to office with grand plans to build
a 355-ship Navy, up from the current 300. The Pentagon all but admits
[it has no hope of reaching that
goal](https://breakingdefense.com/2020/02/navy-marines-caught-by-surprise-by-espers-budget-cuts/).
Meanwhile, the Chinese Navy — which isn’t stretched around the world —
has 335 ships, [a 55 percent increase in 15
years](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2020/3/9/eagle-vs-dragon-how-the-us-and-chinese-navies-stack-up),

If the U.S. and the People’s Republic were to come to blows after some
incident over some atoll in the South China Sea, are we confident we’d
prevail?

When (fingers crossed) Joe Biden is president, he needn’t ask his
cabinet members to deliver philippics against Beijing. But, as George
Kennan once wrote about another regime, he must be prepared to confront
China with “unalterable counter force at every point where they show
signs of encroaching upon the interests of a [peaceful and stable
world.](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/1947-07-01/sources-soviet-conduct)”
