# Once a Source of U.S.-China Tension, Trade Emerges as an Area of Calm

</div>

The trade deal is providing a rare point of stability as relations
between the United States and China fray over Hong Kong, the coronavirus
and accusations of espionage.

WASHINGTON — For the better part of three years, President Trump’s trade
war with China strained relations between the world’s largest economies.
Now, the trade pact the two countries signed in January appears to be
the most durable part of the U.S.-China relationship.

Tensions between the United States and China are flaring over the
coronavirus, which the Trump administration accuses China of failing to
control, as well as accusations of espionage, intellectual property
theft and human rights violations. American officials on Tuesday ordered
[the closure of China’s consulate in
Houston](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html),
saying that diplomats there had aided in economic espionage, prompting
China to [order the
closure](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/asia/china-us-consulate-chengdu.html)
of the American consulate in Chengdu.

Earlier in the week, the Trump administration [added another 11 Chinese
companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/business/economy/china-sanctions-uighurs-labor.html)
to a government list barring them from buying American technology and
other products, citing human rights abuses against predominantly Muslim
ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region in China’s far west. The two
countries are also clashing over China’s security crackdown in Hong
Kong, its global 5G ambitions and its territorial claims in the South
China Sea.

But unlike [previous
moments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/business/china-tariffs-trump.html)
of heightened tensions between the United States and China, Mr. Trump
has not threatened to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods or take
other steps to punish companies that export their products to America.
And neither side is threatening to rip up the initial trade deal they
signed in January, which took years of painful negotiations to complete.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Trade, long the most contentious part of the U.S.-China relationship,
has suddenly become an area of surprising stability.

The reasons have more to do with politics than diplomacy. Both the Trump
administration and Chinese leaders invested time and political capital
in reaching [their initial trade
deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html),
which removed barriers for foreign firms doing business in China and
strengthened the country’s intellectual property protections. The deal
also required China to purchase an additional $200 billion of American
goods by the end of next year, including some agricultural goods like
soybeans, pork and corn from farm states that are crucial to Mr. Trump’s
re-election chances.

As tensions between the two countries rise again, both sides appear to
think they have more to lose from rupturing the agreement than they
would gain.

“Ironically, trade has become an area of cooperation or stability,” said
Michael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Hudson Institute who advises
the Trump administration.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In some ways, the signing of the sought-after trade deal in January has
paved the way for the Trump administration to press China on other
fronts. In pursuit of a trade deal, the Trump administration had long
shelved various actions to address other concerns about China, including
[its human rights abuses in
Xinjiang](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/world/asia/trump-china-uighurs-trade-deal.html),
[its crackdown in Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/trump-hong-kong-china.html)
and [security
threats](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/business/us-reprieve-huawei.html)
and [sanctions
violations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/business/us-china-zte-deal.html)
by Chinese technology and telecommunications companies like Huawei and
ZTE.

As painful as the trade war was for companies on both sides of the
Pacific, it provided a strange source of stability for the U.S.-China
relationship by focusing the conflict between the countries on purely
economic matters. With trade no longer the source of friction, tensions
are spilling over into diplomacy, security and technology, [issues that
are more contentious and trickier to
solve.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/world/asia/cold-war-china-us.html)

The technological divide between the United States and China, which
censors its internet with the help of its so-called Great Firewall, is
growing larger. China is considering whether to extend new internet
controls to Hong Kong, while the Trump administration is weighing
[potential action against Chinese-owned social media
services](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/technology/tiktok-washington-lobbyist.html),
like TikTok and Tencent’s WeChat.

The United States has been pressuring other countries to ban equipment
from Huawei, which it views as a surveillance and national security
threat, from wireless networks around the globe, including [in
Britain](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html),
which recently barred the Chinese telecom giant. On Thursday,
cybersecurity researchers revealed that a popular Chinese-made drone was
[collecting large amounts of personal
information](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/dji-drones-security-vulnerability.html)
that could be exploited by Beijing.

Geopolitical tensions are rising, too. [Clashes between Chinese and
Indian
troops](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/18/world/asia/china-india-border-conflict.html)
over their disputed border in the Himalayas have resulted in fatalities.
American officials have increased their criticisms of [China’s actions
in the South China
Sea](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/world/asia/south-china-sea-pompeo.html),
calling Beijing’s claims to the disputed waters “completely unlawful.”
In April, the United States [sent two
warships](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/world/asia/coronavirus-south-china-sea-warships.html)
into disputed waters near Malaysia as a show of force after a Chinese
government vessel tailed a Malaysian state oil company ship for days.

American officials say that China’s behavior has become increasingly
provocative in recent months, prompting tougher action not just from the
United States but also Australia, Britain, India and other nations. Some
public figures in China have blamed increasing tensions on Democrats and
Republicans in the United States competing to appear tougher on China
ahead of the general election in November.

Jia Qingguo, a professor of Peking University’s the School of
International Studies, said in an online panel hosted by the National
Press Foundation on Thursday that the United States and China were not
yet in a new Cold War, but they were heading in that direction with
“accelerating speed, thanks to the Trump administration.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If the current momentum continues, I think the two countries are likely
to end up in a Cold War and maybe even in a hot one,” Mr. Jia said.

The Chinese government is trying to keep trade matters separate from
other frictions in the bilateral relationship, though that has proved
more difficult as the two countries begin closing each other’s
consulates.

“Comparatively speaking, trade I think is more stable and more quiet,”
said He Weiwen, a former Chinese commerce ministry official and now a
senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a nonprofit
research group in Beijing. But he said there are reasons to be worried
going forward.

“I’m quite concerned about the trade relationship ahead, because we need
a calm, stable political environment,” said Mr. He, who is also an
executive council member of the China Association of International
Trade.

Chinese officials and experts argue that recent difficulties in
bilateral relations between Washington and Beijing are caused by the
Trump administration and not by the Chinese government, which has tried
to address different challenges in the relationship individually, rather
than linking them together for leverage.

“China has made all efforts to smooth the relationship with the U.S.,”
said Tu Xinquan, the dean of the China Institute for World Trade
Organization Studies at the University of International Business and
Economics in Beijing.

“Though it is admitted that there are problems between the two
countries, China has never planned an all-out whole-government strategy
against the U.S.,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the trade truce is holding for now, that could prove fleeting if
Mr. Trump decides Beijing is not living up to its side of the deal. The
agreement left tariffs in place on more than $360 billion of Chinese
goods and ushered in a détente that forestalled further tariff increases
by either side.

But the president views tariffs as one of his most effective and
reliable tools, a powerful cudgel to wield against foreign countries
that doesn’t require the approval of Congress. And China appears to be
[lagging far behind on the purchases of American
products](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/business/economy/trump-china-trade-war-farmers.html)
it pledged to make as part of the trade deal, partly as a result of the
pandemic.

Analysts have long viewed those targets as unrealistic. But Mr. Trump
sees those purchases as crucial to narrowing the U.S. trade deficit and
boosting the fortunes of farmers and businesses, and thus his
re-election prospects.

“The president has repeatedly said if they don’t make the purchases, I
will terminate the deal,” Mr. Pillsbury said.

As China shakes off the coronavirus, its purchases of American products
appear to be ticking up. Data from China’s General Administration of
Customs shows that the country’s imports from the United States were up
15.1 percent in June from the same month last year, when calculated in
China’s currency, the renminbi, compared to a 5.2 percent increase in
China’s exports to the United States.

Agricultural imports from the United States have been especially strong
this summer, with two of the three largest Chinese purchases ever of
American grain
[occurring](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-14/china-books-record-deal-for-u-s-corn-stepping-up-buying-spree)this
month.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump pointed to [record-setting purchases of
corn](https://www.fas.usda.gov/newsroom/private-exporters-report-sales-activity-china-251)
made by China. But, he added that “the trade deal means less to me now
than it did when I made it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Can you understand that? It just means much less to me,” the president
said.

For now, [Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/business/economy/trump-navarro-china-trade-deal.html)
[and his trade
advisers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/economy/us-trade-china-tariffs.html)
are mostly defending China’s efforts to live up to the trade deal,
saying China has been taking crucial steps to open its agricultural
markets and financial system.

“I don’t think it’s going away,” Jamieson L. Greer, a former chief of
staff to the United States Trade Representative, who is now a partner at
the law firm King & Spalding, said of the initial trade deal. “The
Chinese really needed it, and the administration has every incentive to
keep it, too.”
