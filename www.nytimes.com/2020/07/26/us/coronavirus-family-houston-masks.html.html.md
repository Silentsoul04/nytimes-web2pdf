A Texas family tried to ward off the virus. But as cases in the state
soared and debates about masks and distancing raged, there was only so
much they could control.

HOUSTON — Elaine Roberts, a longtime bagger at a supermarket, tried to
be so careful. She put on gloves and stopped riding the bus to work,
instead relying on her father to drive her to keep their family safe.
She wore masks — in space-themed fabrics stitched by her sister — as she
stacked products on shelves, helped people to their cars and retrieved
carts from the parking lot.

But many of the customers at the Randalls store in a Houston suburb did
not wear them, she noticed, even as coronavirus cases in the state began
rising in early June. Gov. Greg Abbott, who had pushed to reopen
businesses in Texas, was refusing to make masks mandatory and for weeks
had blocked local officials from enforcing any mask requirements. The
grocery store only **** posted signs asking shoppers to wear them.

Ms. Roberts, 35, who has autism and lives with her parents, got sick
first, sneezing and coughing. Then her father, Paul, and mother, Sheryl,
who had been so cautious after the pandemic struck that their rare
ventures out were mostly for bird-watching in a nearly empty park, were
hospitalized with breathing problems.

Their cases were unusual: Sheryl Roberts, a sunny retired nurse,
experienced severe psychiatric symptoms that made doctors fear she was
suicidal, possibly an effect of the disease and medicines to treat it.
She is recovering, but her husband is critically ill, on a ventilator,
with failing kidneys and a mysterious paralysis that has afflicted about
a dozen others at Houston Methodist Hospital.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While no one can be certain how Elaine Roberts was infected, her older
sister, Sidra Roman, blamed grocery customers who she felt had put her
family in danger.

“Wearing a piece of cloth, it’s a little uncomfortable,” she said. “It’s
a lot less uncomfortable than ventilators, dialysis lines, all of those
things that have had to happen to my father. And it’s not necessarily
you that’s going to get sick and get hurt.”

“Whoever came to the grocery store and didn’t wear a mask,” she added,
“doesn’t know this is going on.”

What happened to the Robertses is in many ways the story of Texas, one
of the nation’s hot spots as coronavirus cases mount and deaths climb.
For weeks, politicians were divided over keeping the economy open,
citizens were polarized about wearing masks, **** doctors were warning
that careless behavior could imperil others, and families were put at
risk by their young.

Mr. Roberts, 67, is among the patients now packing intensive care units
across Texas and other parts of the Sun Belt. The surge in virus cases
here that took off in June first appeared to involve mostly younger
adults, causing milder illnesses doctors believed would respond to new
treatments. But the chain of infections that began with people under 40
— many who socialized at bars or parties without masks or distancing —
moved to essential workers like Ms. Roberts, and then to their
relatives.

“We thought this might be different, maybe with some of the things we’ve
learned,” Dr. Pat Herlihy, chief of critical care at Baylor St. Luke’s
Medical Center, said last week. But, he went on, “We’re right there now
with super, super sick people.”

The same is likely to befall hospitals in other areas where cases are
rising; Houston was among the cities at the leading edge of the summer
wave, and critical illnesses often lag new infections by weeks.

Nearly 11,000 confirmed coronavirus patients were in Texas hospitals as
of Wednesday, the last day for which complete data were available. It
was a record high, according to the state health department, five times
as many as the peak in the
spring.

At Houston Methodist, the city’s largest hospital, beds were filled
disproportionately with Hispanic patients and with multiple members of
families. There were people who believed they were invulnerable to the
virus and others, like the Robertses, who knew that they were not.
Coronavirus deaths across Methodist’s hospital system have multiplied,
as they have elsewhere: 31 in May, 47 in June and 144 in the first three
weeks of July.

Administrators have created I.C.U. after I.C.U. to tend to the growing
number of severely ill patients who often require weeks of
resource-intensive treatment. In recent days, doctors were told to stop
offering a remedy used as a last resort — treatment with a heart-lung
machine — to any more patients because staffing was too stretched.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With patients on ventilators awaiting beds in I.C.U.s, physicians have
been pressed to move patients through as quickly as possible, including
urging families to make decisions about removing life support when there
is little chance of
recovery.

Dr. Herlihy and Dr. Faisal Masud, the head of critical care at the
Methodist hospital system, said that because so many patients were so
severely sick, they had been forced to turn away some transfers from
other institutions.

“I get desperate calls, desperate emails,” Dr. Masud said. “I have to
make the call as to who can come and not come in. That’s a huge burden,
because in my heart, with my saying no, they will more than likely end
up dying.”

## Masks Were ‘Kind of 50-50’

Elaine Roberts began working at the Randalls grocery store in Bellaire,
part of a larger chain, when she was 16. Nearly two decades later, she
is one of its longest-tenured employees.

Diagnosed in childhood with a form of autism that she says has made
learning difficult, she didn’t speak until she was 8, when the words
came in a burst during a Disney World trip. But her parents have raised
her to be as independent as possible.

She completed a four-year vocational program after high school and
applied to countless other jobs over the years, to no avail. Outgoing
and chatty, she has a boyfriend whom she’s known since elementary school
and a circle of good friends. She loves old television comedies and the
color pink.

“She’s so sweet and very caring and will do anything you ask of her,”
said her manager, Cindy Fletcher.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To protect against the virus, Ms. Fletcher said, the store devotes many
hours a week to cleaning, and employees are asked to stay home if they
have viral symptoms.

Until late June, the company did not require patrons to wear face masks.
Postings asked customers to put them on, but “it wasn’t anything we had
to enforce,” Ms. Fletcher said. “It was kind of 50-50,” she added, with
“younger customers not as
much.”

Ms. Roberts had no choice about coming into close contact with shoppers,
whether they wore masks or not. “I ended up sacking their groceries,”
she said. “I couldn’t say anything to them about it. I didn’t want to be
bossy.”

Public health officials acknowledge that masks and social distancing are
not complete defenses against the virus, but [studies
suggest](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent)
they can have a significant impact in protecting others. In Harris
County, which includes Houston, a local order directing businesses to
require people to wear masks went into effect on June 22 after the
governor relented. A sign went up at the Randalls entrance saying that
masks were mandatory. Compliance, Ms. Fletcher says, has been good.

But it was too late for the **** Roberts family.

Paul Roberts, a former musician and carpenter turned computer programmer
for NASA, now works at a software company. He and his wife, a retired
Methodist Hospital nurse who calls herself a “glass half full person,”
ran an online fanzine and attended Comic Con events years ago. For
years, they gathered weekly with their two daughters, son-in-law and
now-7-year-old grandson for jigsaw puzzles and fierce games of Uno.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They are amazing nerds,” Ms. Roman, 38, said of her parents.

Sheryl Roberts, 65, understood the perils of the pandemic — she had
diabetes, asthma and heart disease, which could put her at higher risk.
Her husband had chronic lung disease and a stent to open a blocked
coronary artery.

“We have been so careful, so very careful, and stayed away from people,”
Ms. Roberts said. Her husband began working from home in the spring when
Washington State, New York and then other areas around the country were
hit hard. Mr. Roberts occasionally made a supermarket run during
“senior” hour; the couple’s only “big, hot date” in recent months,
Ms. Roberts said, was to view wildflowers from their car.

Their younger daughter was diligent as well. But then she came back from
work sneezing one day in **** mid-June and thought it was allergies.
Soon she had a cough, fever, headaches and diarrhea, and lost her senses
of taste and smell, telltale symptoms of the coronavirus.

“She told me, ‘I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I wore a mask, I
wore gloves, I washed my hands,’” Ms. Roberts said. “You do the right
things, and still you get it.”

Elaine Roberts, who tested positive for the coronavirus, did not become
seriously ill. But for her parents, it would be much worse.

## Daughter, Sister, Caretaker

Mr. Roberts and his wife started sneezing, then coughing, just like
their daughter, and developed fevers and severe body aches. Then he got
“awfully sick, awfully quickly,” Sheryl Roberts recalled. He became
confused on June 22. Alarmed, she tested his oxygen level. It was low,
and she called her older daughter to take him to an emergency care
center, the second visit in two days.

Before he left, his wife asked him to make a
promise.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Within a week, she, too, was admitted to Methodist after becoming short
of breath.

Neither daughter could see their parents: Methodist, like many other
hospitals around the country, blocked visitors to contain the virus’s
spread. The couple were isolated in separate buildings, and could not
communicate with each other. Mr. Roberts was gravely ill, and his wife’s
condition was deteriorating. Ms. Roman, an oil industry engineer, tried
to fill the gap.

“I’ve known for a very long time that when the time comes, I get to step
up,” said Ms. Roman, 38. “I have to take care of my parents. I have to
take care of my sister. I just didn’t expect it all to converge at
once.”

After about a week in the hospital, there was a crisis: Ms. Roberts
became delirious and repeatedly pulled the tubing that supplied oxygen
out from under her nose. Doctors put restraints on her, stationed a
sitter outside her room and called Ms. Roman to say they thought her
mother’s turmoil might be a result of medication side effects combined
with her illness.

Ms. Roman called her sister in tears. “I said, ‘I’m scared, Lainie, I’m
scared.’ She said, ‘I am, too.’”

After Ms. Roberts’s steroid dose was cut, the symptoms resolved over a
couple of days. **** “They said that I had said that I was going to kill
myself,” Ms. Roberts recalled the doctors telling her. “This is not me.”

Her breathing gradually improved, and she did not need a ventilator. A
few days later, she said she was keeping herself going by imagining a
trip on her bucket list: taking her husband to see macaws in the
Amazon.

Doctors called Ms. Roman with updates on her father and requests to give
consent for procedures, including a catheter for emergency kidney
dialysis. He received steroids, which work against inflammation, and
experimental medications. Mr. Roberts was put under deep sedation and
given drugs to paralyze him so the ventilator could work more
effectively.

There were some glimmers of hope — Mr. Roberts’s lungs seemed to be
healing — but whenever the medical team reduced the sedation over the
next few days, his blood pressure rose and his heart raced, signs of
agitation. On July 9, Dr. Mukhtar Al-Saadi called Ms. Roman with an
update. “It was very difficult for us to wake him up meaningfully to see
if he can breathe on his own,” the doctor said.

## ‘Believe Me, It’s Real’

Last week, after she was discharged and just about to be wheeled out of
the hospital, Ms. Roberts received a terrifying call. Her husband was
still not waking up or moving, and doctors believed a massive stroke or
another neurological problem was the likely reason. Ms. Roberts and her
daughters gathered that night, discussing the difficult decisions they
might have to
make.

“Do we just let him go, if he’s brain-dead?” Sheryl Roberts said they
wondered. As they considered what the “very bright, very proud man”
would want, Ms. Roman said, the three women wept.

A brain scan the next day showed that he had not had a stroke, but
additional studies were delayed to avoid exposing the few available
technicians to the virus. On Friday, Dr. R. Glenn Smith, a neurology
attending physician, performed neuromuscular testing that indicated
severe damage to Mr. Roberts’s nerve coverings.

About a dozen other patients at the hospital have developed a paralysis
or profound weakness that doctors believe may be a complication of the
virus, according to Dr. Smith. Doctors had already begun treating Mr.
Roberts with a medication used for Guillain-Barre syndrome, a similar
paralyzing disorder that occurs rarely after some viral infections.

They don’t know how much function he will be able to regain; he has
begun showing some limited progress. On Tuesday a staff member brought a
tablet into Mr. Roberts’s room and made a video connection. “He nodded,
I chatted,” Ms. Roberts said. “He blew me a kiss.”

While her husband waits for a bed in a long-term acute care unit to
begin rehabilitation, he remains on a ventilator. Even if there are no
more challenges, his recovery will take months, Dr. Smith
said.

"It’s going to be slow,” Ms. Roman said. “It’s not going to be easy.”
But, she added, “it seems like he’s still Dad upstairs so I’ll take it.”

The family’s ordeal has made her mother more outspoken about the toll of
the pandemic. The misinformation and confusion about the virus that she
sees on social media scares her, she said. “The ignorance kills me.
‘It’s really not that bad, it’s not really fatal.’”

She said she now responds to such statements. “I’m always happy to show
right up and say, ‘You know, I just lived through it — believe me, it’s
real.’”

She still requires oxygen, and Elaine Roberts is taking care of her,
cooking meals, helping her shower and maintaining her breathing device.
When her parents were both gone, she assumed new household tasks. “My
youngest has proved to me she’s far more capable of things than I ever
dreamed,” Ms. Roberts said. “I’m so proud of her.”

On Monday, Elaine Roberts has a coronavirus test scheduled. If it is
negative, she hopes to go back to work at Randalls.
