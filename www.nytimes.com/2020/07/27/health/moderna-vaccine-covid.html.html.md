The first large study of the safety and effectiveness of a [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/health/covid-19-vaccine-monkeys.html)
in the United States began on Monday morning, according to the National
Institutes of Health and the biotech company
[Moderna](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html),
which collaborated to develop the vaccine.

A volunteer in Savannah, Ga., received the first shot at 6:45 a.m., Dr.
Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, said at a news briefing.

The study, a Phase 3 clinical trial, will enroll 30,000 healthy people
at about 89 sites around the country this summer. Half will receive two
shots of the vaccine, 28 days apart, and half will receive two shots of
a saltwater placebo. Neither the volunteers nor the medical staff giving
the injections will know who will get the real vaccine.

Researchers will then monitor the subjects, looking for side effects.
And their main goal will be to see if significantly fewer vaccinated
people contract Covid-19, to determine whether the vaccine can prevent
the illness. The study will also try to find out if the vaccine can
avert severe cases of Covid and death; if it can block the infection
entirely, based on lab tests; and if just one shot can prevent the
illness.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A second company, Pfizer, announced late Monday afternoon that it had
also begun a late-stage study of a coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer has been
working with a German company, BioNTech. Their study will also include
30,000 people, from 39 states in the United States, and from Brazil,
Argentina and Germany.

The first subjects received injections at the University of Rochester on
Monday.

The government announced last week that it had reached [a $1.95 billion
deal to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer’s
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
by the year’s end, but only if the trial proves it safe and effective.

Dr. Fauci estimated that the full enrollment of 30,000 people in the
Moderna trial would be completed by the end of the summer, and that
results might be available by November. Findings might emerge even
earlier, he said, but added that he doubted it. He said that the high
rates of transmission in some parts of the country, though unfortunate,
would help speed up the process of determining whether the vaccine
works.

Dr. Mark Mulligan, the director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center in New
York, which will begin giving injections of the Pfizer vaccine on
Tuesday, said he thought that full enrollment would take two months, and
that it would take four to six months to determine whether the vaccine
worked.

Over all, a total of 150 to 160 coronavirus infections in the study will
be enough to determine whether the Moderna vaccine is acceptably
effective — that is, if it protects 60 percent of those who receive it,
Dr. Fauci said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ideally, he would like the figure to be higher, but he said 60 percent
“would be a major, huge step at controlling this outbreak; we’ll take
that amount.”

Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health,
said the U.S. government was reaching out to groups hit hardest by Covid
— [older
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-elderly-protection.html),
[those with chronic
diseases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html),
[Blacks, Latinx and Native
Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html)
— to encourage them to participate in the study. He said that the
pandemic had put health disparities into “sharp relief” and that extra
efforts were needed to gain the trust of people in those groups who
might be reluctant to sign up for a medical experiment.

[Earlier tests of Moderna’s
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/health/cornavirus-vaccine-moderna.html?searchResultPosition=5)
showed that it stimulated a strong immune response, with minor and
transient side effects like sore arms, fatigue, achiness and fever. But
exactly what type of immune response is needed to prevent the illness is
not known, so Phase 3 studies are essential to determine whether a
vaccine really
works.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In a statement, Dr. Collins said, “Having a safe and effective vaccine
distributed by the end of 2020 is a stretch goal, but it’s the right
goal for the American people.” He said that despite the unprecedented
speed in bringing this experimental vaccine to human testing, “the most
stringent safety measures” were being maintained.

Moderna said in a statement that it would be able to deliver about 500
million doses a year, and possibly up to a billion doses per year,
starting in 2021. The Massachusetts-based company, which has received
nearly $1 billion from the federal government to develop a coronavirus
vaccine, [has said it will not sell the vaccine at cost, but for
profit.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/health/covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-moderna-pfizer.html)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Moderna has not said what it will charge. “We will price it responsibly
during the pandemic, to make sure it is broadly accessible,” a
spokesman, Ray Jordan, said in an email. The company may change the
price later, when the virus becomes endemic, “but that is not something
we have settled at this time,” Mr. Jordan said.

Moderna shares were up more than 9 percent on Monday.

Pfizer has also said it would sell its product at a profit; the contract
with the government works out to about $20 a shot, and people will need
two.

Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines use a synthetic version of
genetic material from part of the coronavirus, encased in tiny particles
made of fat that help it get into human cells. The genetic material,
[called messenger RNA or
mRNA](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html),
then prompts the cells to churn out a tiny piece of the virus, which the
immune system sees as foreign and learns to recognize. If the person is
later exposed to the real virus, the immune system will attack it.

At the news briefing, Dr. Collins said that three more Phase 3 trials
would be starting soon, each needing 30,000 patients. Those trials will
involve vaccines made by
[Novavax](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine-novavax.html),
[Johnson &
Johnson](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/health/coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-janssen.html)
and a collaboration of the [University of Oxford and
AstraZeneca](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/world/covid-coronavirus-vaccine.html).
All three companies are part of the Trump administration’s Operation
Warp Speed. Pfizer is not.
