The state’s health commissioner opened an inquiry after video footage of
the concert showed crowds of people standing close together.

A charity concert on Saturday night in the Hamptons featuring
performances from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs and the D.J. duo
the Chainsmokers drew widespread outrage and a state investigation after
video footage showed attendees appearing to ignore public health
precautions.

The concert, [called Safe &
Sound](https://www.tixr.com/groups/intheknow/events/jaja-presents-safe-sound-hamptons-chainsmokers-18912),
was billed by organizers as a “drive-in music experience in the famous
summer hot spot, the Hamptons.” Guests would be able to sit outside near
their parked vehicles in spaced-out areas to watch the performances,
including one from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, David M.
Solomon, [also known as D.J.
D-Sol](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-dj-d-sol.html),
and another from Jay Schneiderman, the supervisor of the Town of
Southampton, where the concert was held.

Tickets cost up to $25,000, [according to
Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/9418214/the-chainsmokers-drive-in-concert-everything-we-know).

“Safe & Sound will set the bar for a new era of immersive experiences,”
the organizers said. “This will be a safe and controlled environment,
setting the bar for all events to come.”

But the event instead has generated angry social media posts, and on
Monday it drew the ire of state officials.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a blistering letter addressed to Mr. Schneiderman, New York’s health
commissioner, Howard A. Zucker, wrote that he was “greatly disturbed” by
reports that showed thousands of people standing close together and
“generally not adhering to social-distancing guidance.”

“I am at a loss as to how the Town of Southampton could have issued a
permit for such an event, how they believed it was legal and not an
obvious public health threat,” Dr. Zucker wrote.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At a news conference in Southampton on Tuesday, Mr. Schneiderman said
that when his band was performing, nobody was crowded in front of the
stage. But he said people were allowed to gather there later, which
violated the permit for the event.

“It violated the social distancing regulations,” he said. “They’ve been
cited by the town. There’s likely to be more following an investigation
we’re doing.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The event’s organizers, In The Know Experiences and Invisible Noise,
said in an emailed statement on Monday night that they had followed “all
proper and current protocols,” noting that guests were repeatedly told
that they could not leave their designated areas, spaced at least six
feet apart, unless they needed to use the bathroom.

Guests’ temperatures were checked and “security guards regularly
patrolled the area to encourage mask wearing and promote
social-distancing guidelines,” the organizers said.

The organizers did not answer questions about whether they knew that
people were breaking the rules.

Several people who went to the concert [told Buzzfeed
News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/massive-chainsmokers-concert-during-covid-draws-backlash)
that they felt safe and that people were social distancing.

The fierce criticism of the concert came as [news
reports](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/we-all-want-pretend-isnt-happening-mask-free-pandemic-parties-are-popping-nyc)
and posts on social media have highlighted a number of parties and
concerts being held in the New York City area where guests have
seemingly ignored social-distancing rules. Concerts across the country
[have been
canceled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/arts/music/concerts-cancelled-coronavirus.html)
for fear of endangering public health.

Many [criticized the
concert](https://twitter.com/FirenzeMike/status/1287484244433022979) in
the Hamptons on Saturday night as being representative of a disregard
among wealthy New Yorkers, many of whom vacation in the Hamptons, to the
dangers of the coronavirus, which has disproportionately hurt low-income
populations.

“The Department of Health will conduct an investigation,” Gov Andrew M.
Cuomo [said in a
tweet](https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1287901143172108289). “We
have no tolerance for the illegal & reckless endangerment of public
health.”
