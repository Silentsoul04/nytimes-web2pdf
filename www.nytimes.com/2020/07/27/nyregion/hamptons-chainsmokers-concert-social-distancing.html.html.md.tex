\section{Chainsmokers Concert in Hamptons Is Under Fire Over Social
Distancing}\label{chainsmokers-concert-in-hamptons-is-under-fire-over-social-distancing}}

The state's health commissioner opened an inquiry after video footage of
the concert showed crowds of people standing close together.

A charity concert on Saturday night in the Hamptons featuring
performances from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs and the D.J. duo
the Chainsmokers drew widespread outrage and a state investigation after
video footage showed attendees appearing to ignore public health
precautions.

The concert,
\href{https://www.tixr.com/groups/intheknow/events/jaja-presents-safe-sound-hamptons-chainsmokers-18912}{called
Safe \& Sound}, was billed by organizers as a ``drive-in music
experience in the famous summer hot spot, the Hamptons.'' Guests would
be able to sit outside near their parked vehicles in spaced-out areas to
watch the performances, including one from the chief executive of
Goldman Sachs, David M. Solomon,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-dj-d-sol.html}{also
known as D.J. D-Sol}, and another from Jay Schneiderman, the supervisor
of the Town of Southampton, where the concert was held.

Tickets cost up to \$25,000,
\href{https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/9418214/the-chainsmokers-drive-in-concert-everything-we-know}{according
to Billboard}.

``Safe \& Sound will set the bar for a new era of immersive
experiences,'' the organizers said. ``This will be a safe and controlled
environment, setting the bar for all events to come.''

But the event instead has generated angry social media posts, and on
Monday it drew the ire of state officials.

In a blistering letter addressed to Mr. Schneiderman, New York's health
commissioner, Howard A. Zucker, wrote that he was ``greatly disturbed''
by reports that showed thousands of people standing close together and
``generally not adhering to social-distancing guidance.''

``I am at a loss as to how the Town of Southampton could have issued a
permit for such an event, how they believed it was legal and not an
obvious public health threat,'' Dr. Zucker wrote.

At a news conference in Southampton on Tuesday, Mr. Schneiderman said
that when his band was performing, nobody was crowded in front of the
stage. But he said people were allowed to gather there later, which
violated the permit for the event.

``It violated the social distancing regulations,'' he said. ``They've
been cited by the town. There's likely to be more following an
investigation we're doing.''

The event's organizers, In The Know Experiences and Invisible Noise,
said in an emailed statement on Monday night that they had followed
``all proper and current protocols,'' noting that guests were repeatedly
told that they could not leave their designated areas, spaced at least
six feet apart, unless they needed to use the bathroom.

Guests' temperatures were checked and ``security guards regularly
patrolled the area to encourage mask wearing and promote
social-distancing guidelines,'' the organizers said.

The organizers did not answer questions about whether they knew that
people were breaking the rules.

Several people who went to the concert
\href{https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/massive-chainsmokers-concert-during-covid-draws-backlash}{told
Buzzfeed News} that they felt safe and that people were social
distancing.

The fierce criticism of the concert came as
\href{https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/we-all-want-pretend-isnt-happening-mask-free-pandemic-parties-are-popping-nyc}{news
reports} and posts on social media have highlighted a number of parties
and concerts being held in the New York City area where guests have
seemingly ignored social-distancing rules. Concerts across the country
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/arts/music/concerts-cancelled-coronavirus.html}{have
been canceled} for fear of endangering public health.

Many
\href{https://twitter.com/FirenzeMike/status/1287484244433022979}{criticized
the concert} in the Hamptons on Saturday night as being representative
of a disregard among wealthy New Yorkers, many of whom vacation in the
Hamptons, to the dangers of the coronavirus, which has
disproportionately hurt low-income populations.

``The Department of Health will conduct an investigation,'' Gov Andrew
M. Cuomo
\href{https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1287901143172108289}{said in
a tweet}. ``We have no tolerance for the illegal \& reckless
endangerment of public health.''
