CHICAGO — The latest count of new coronavirus cases was jarring: Some
1,500 virus cases were identified three consecutive days last week in
Illinois, and fears of a resurgence in the state even led the mayor of
Chicago to shut down bars all over town on Friday.

But at the same moment, there were other, hopeful data points that
seemed to tell a different story entirely. Deaths from the virus
statewide are one-tenth what they were at their peak in May. And the
positivity rate of new coronavirus tests in Illinois is about half that
of neighboring states.

“There are so many numbers flying around,” said Dr. Allison Arwady, the
commissioner of the Chicago health department. “It’s hard for people to
know what’s the most important thing to follow.”

This is a pandemic that has been told in harrowing stories from
hospitals, factories, nursing homes and meatpacking plants. But as the
crisis stretches on, it is also unfolding in an increasingly complex
spread of numbers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Six months since the first cases were detected in the United States,
more people have been infected by far than in any other country, and the
daily rundown of national numbers on Friday was a reminder of a mounting
emergency: more than 73,500 new cases, 1,100 deaths and 939,838 tests,
as well as 59,670 people currently hospitalized for the virus.

Americans now have access to an expanding set of data to help them
interpret the coronavirus pandemic. They are closely tracking the number
of sick and dead. They can read daily case counts in their cities and
states, the percentage of positive tests, the number of people
hospitalized and the weekly change in cases. It is possible to look on
the Illinois Department of Public Health
[website](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/hospitalization-utilization)
and learn how many hospital beds exist statewide, how many ventilators
are available in Peoria and how many intensive-care unit beds are free
in Champaign.

Sophisticated data-gathering operations by
[newspapers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
research universities and [volunteers](https://covidtracking.com/) have
sprung up in response to the pandemic, monitoring and collecting
coronavirus metrics around the clock. Elected officials who were not
particularly well versed in public health or infectious disease when
2020 began now sound a little like epidemiologists, spending their days

“Everybody’s tracking this virus in a way that they’ve never done with
any other infectious disease,” said Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, a physician and
senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who has
treated coronavirus patients. “For some people, it’s helped them
understand what is happening. For other people, it’s been misinterpreted

He offered an example of an “armchair epi” from his own social circle:
Scanning his Facebook feed recently, Dr. Adalja read a high-school
classmate authoritatively sharing information on the coronavirus
fatality rate — far lower than the flu, the classmate asserted.

Dr. Adalja instantly saw that the calculation was flawed. “For flu, he
used the denominator of total number of flu infections,” he said. “For
coronavirus, he used the denominator for the population of the U.S.”

He resisted the urge to type a hasty correction — Covid-19 is believed
to have a substantially higher fatality rate than that of the seasonal
flu — and kept scrolling.

Epidemiologists generally advise against relying on a single data point
to determine the state of the virus in a particular area. Instead, to
assess coronavirus trends, they recommend reviewing the daily case
count, the positivity rate, hospitalization data and the number of
confirmed and probable deaths from the virus. But they also cautioned
that data can be misleading and difficult to interpret, and that it is
perhaps best seen as one piece in a larger, complicated puzzle.

“I view everything with a lot of skepticism,” said Dr. Natalie E. Dean,
an infectious-disease expert at the University of Florida. “I try and
triangulate across a lot of different things.”

For many Americans, the numbers are a way to make sense of the pandemic
— which is spreading in the South, West and much of the Midwest, but
calming in the Northeast — and to gauge whether things are better or
worse in their own cities.

They often begin with the case count. That is the daily tally of
individuals whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by laboratory
tests, a data point that is frequently quoted, misused and debated.

“If I’m sitting at home and saying, ‘How is my community doing?’ I’d
want to look at daily case counts,” said Dr. John Swartzberg, an
infectious-disease specialist and a clinical professor emeritus at the
University of California, Berkeley’s School of Public Health.

Those numbers are jaw-dropping. In the United States, the cumulative
count of people infected with the coronavirus has surpassed four
million. New daily records tied to the case count have been alarmingly
frequent in recent weeks: At least 16 states have posted single-day case
records last week. On Friday, more than 73,000 new cases were identified
across the country, the second-highest day of the pandemic.

There are several ways to parse the case count
number.

President Trump and other officials have frequently questioned the
legitimacy of coronavirus case counts, falsely suggesting that a rise in
testing availability is solely responsible for the increase in confirmed
infections. More testing can cause an uptick in new reports of
infections, but data
[shows](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/22/us/covid-testing-rising-cases.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
that the rise in cases far outpaces the growth in testing.

Experts suggested that the daily case count is better viewed as a rough
measure of whether an outbreak is slowing, expanding or stabilizing. A
decrease in new confirmed cases could also indicate that testing is not
available widely enough, or that there is a backlog of tests that have
not yet been processed and delivered to the local health department.

Time period matters, too. Comparing case counts in July to case counts
in April is misleading, because many people were sick but few people
were tested early in the epidemic. But comparing case count to a more
recent period, when testing was relatively constant, is a useful
measure.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another frequently cited number is the positivity rate, the percentage
of coronavirus tests that have returned with a positive result.

“The positivity number is one of the first places I go to,” said Gov.
Mike DeWine of Ohio, who wakes up each morning to a fresh PowerPoint
presentation from his staff, which he reads on his iPad before 8 a.m.
“That’s what I zero in
on.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of

        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

A rising positivity rate can point to an uncontrolled outbreak; it can
also indicate that not enough testing is occurring.

Mr. DeWine is an avid reader of the daily PowerPoint presentation, which
he calls the Situation Update. It started small in the early days of the
pandemic. It has grown to at least 31 slides of numbers, charts and
graphs — every day.

He said he also focused closely on the number of Ohioans who have been
hospitalized for the coronavirus, a data point that is difficult to spin
or misinterpret. Last week, the pandemic approached an alarming
[milestone](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/us/coronavirus-hospitalizations-us.html):
About as many people in the United States are now hospitalized with the
coronavirus as at any other time in the pandemic, including during an
earlier surge in the New York region in the spring.

“Hospitalization is a hard number,” Mr. DeWine said. “There’s no fudge
on
it.”

Yet even that measure has caveats. Hospitalizations do not reflect how
many people are sick at home and experiencing mild symptoms —
particularly younger people — but who could still be infecting others.

Dr. Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University
who studies infectious diseases, said that viewed individually, much of
the available coronavirus data can only offer a glimpse of the state of
the pandemic.

“I think people tend to cherry-pick what they want to see, to confirm
their biases,” she said.

She has been hesitant to place much stock in statistics on deaths caused
by coronavirus, for instance. “I see a lot of use of the fatality
statistics, which are incomplete,” Dr. Smith said. “You do have deaths
from coronavirus, but we know those are undercounted. For me, at least,
that is not a particularly useful metric. But those are the type of
statistics that some people grab onto.”

Perhaps the most telling numbers are trend data — examining which
direction a community or state seems to be heading, said Michael T.
Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for
Infectious Disease Research and Policy.

“There’s no magic number for any of this,” Dr. Osterholm said. “This is
more like a windshield where you’re looking at everything in front of
you. It’s not one piece of data. It’s all of it coming together.”

In 1918, newspapers in cities across the United States published daily
tallies of the sick and the dead from the flu pandemic, said John M.
Barry, the author of “The Great Influenza,” and public health officials
made policy decisions accordingly, based on the data.

Today’s elected officials have far more granular data to consider.

In Chicago, Dr. Arwady, the city health commissioner, has a call with
Mayor Lori Lightfoot every morning, discussing the city’s total cases,
deaths, the seven-day average for testing and detailed hospitalization
numbers, among other metrics.

“Data to me is one of the best ways to make it real for people,” Dr.
Arwady said. She often tries to steer Chicagoans to look at coronavirus
numbers broken down by ZIP code, so that they understand the risk they
face in their own neighborhoods. “Mostly, I want people to feel like
Covid is in their lives.”
