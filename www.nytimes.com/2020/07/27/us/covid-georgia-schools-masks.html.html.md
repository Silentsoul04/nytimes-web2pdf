# A Small Georgia City Plans to Put Students in Classrooms This Week

In-person classes without a mask requirement are scheduled to begin on
Friday in Jefferson, worrying some parents, students and teachers as the

JEFFERSON, Ga. — When Jennifer Fogle and her family moved from Indiana
to Georgia 13 years ago, they settled in Jefferson, a small, handsome
city an hour’s drive from Atlanta, because they had heard about the
excellent schools. And until recently, they had little to complain
about. The teachers are passionate and committed, and the facilities
rival those found at some private schools.

But in recent days Ms. Fogle found herself uncharacteristically anxious,
after learning that Jefferson City Schools planned to offer face-to-face
instruction in the midst of a resurgent coronavirus pandemic that has
seen thousands of new cases reported daily in Georgia.

As other districts around the state delayed their back-to-school days or
moved to all-remote learning, Jefferson school officials announced that
they were sticking with their Friday start date, one of the earliest in
the nation. And while school officials said they would “strongly
encourage” masks for students and teachers, they stopped short of making
masks mandatory.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Fogle, 46, a stay-at-home mother, thinks these decisions are unwise.
But after weighing her options, including online education promoted by
the district but taught by a private company or the state, she decided
it best to let her two teenage children embrace the risks and physically
attend Jefferson High School. It seemed futile, she said, to go against
the grain in a heavily pro-Trump community where many see masks as an
infringement of their personal freedom — and in a state where the
Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has been urging districts to reopen
their classrooms despite the pandemic’s growing toll.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I can’t fix it,” Ms. Fogle said. “So I have to learn, how do we live
life as normal as possible and still try to protect ourselves?”

The reopening plans have starkly divided Jefferson, a middle-class city
of about 12,000 people, offering a likely preview of the contentious
debates ahead for many other communities whose school years start closer
to the end of summer.

An [online
petition](https://www.change.org/p/jefferson-board-of-education-mandate-masks-at-jefferson-city-schools)
created by two Jefferson High seniors calling for a mandatory-mask rule
has garnered more than 600 signatures. But a [competing
petition](https://www.change.org/p/jefferson-board-of-education-banned-use-of-mask-in-jefferson-city-schools?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_23575435_en-US%3A3&recruiter=1133092121&recruited_by_id=947a76d0-ca11-11ea-be25-252352018b69&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&utm_term=tap_basic_share)
demanding that masks remain a choice for students has attracted more
than 200 signers, some of whom have left comments that underscore the
politicized nature of the disagreement. “Only liberals can get rona and
I’m not a liberal,” wrote one, using a slang term for the coronavirus.
“TRUMP2020 no mask fo me.”

The virus has been surging in the United States since mid-June. And the
possibility of more online-only schooling in the fall — after a spring
in which many people were forced to learn from home — is raising
concerns about the quality of students’ education, the possible harm it
may cause them psychologically and socially, and the child-care problems
that working parents will
face.

President Trump said on Thursday that schools in areas hit hard by the
coronavirus should delay reopening. But he also said schools should not
be able to partake in a proposed multibillion-dollar aid package unless
they opened for in-person learning. That same day, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention [issued a full-throated call to reopen
schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/health/cdc-schools-coronavirus.html).

[Researchers have painted an incomplete
picture](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/health/coronavirus-schools-reopen.html)
about the wisdom of physically opening schools. Children are less likely
than older people to get seriously ill from Covid-19, and some research
suggests that younger children may be less likely than teenagers to
infect
people.

Jefferson sits northeast of Atlanta and is the seat of semirural Jackson
County, which has had 13 coronavirus-related deaths, and an infection
rate of 1,067 per 100,000 people. But in nearby Gwinnett County, which
has about 12 times as many people, the infection rate is considerably
higher and 216 people have died. More broadly, Georgia, in the week
ending July 23, has seen an average of 3,287 new cases per day — an
increase of 42 percent from the average two weeks earlier. Many
Jefferson residents traditionally commute for work to Atlanta and
beyond.

The president won almost 80 percent of the vote in Jackson County in
2016, and he has [repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-factcheck.html).
Similar sentiments have been a staple on a Facebook forum for Jefferson
residents that has been flaring with passionate disagreements about the
pandemic and the school system’s response to it.

“My kids have been to baseball, wrestling and cheerleading practices,”
one commenter wrote recently. “We have been out to eat and shopping. Yes
I will be taking precautions but locking my kids up and making sure they
are 6ft from their friends is ridiculous. What about their mental
health. It’s not normal for children to have no interactions.”

Jefferson’s public school system, which dates to 1818, [has been growing
quickly](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/local-school-district-s-student-population-explodes-in-recent-years/799563106/).
Today four schools service the 3,800-student system. The district, which
is 78 percent white, boasts of high test scores and other accolades on
its website, and makes some spots available to out-of-district students
for $900 to $1,000 per year.

Donna McMullan, the district superintendent, acknowledged the
nervousness. But she said the reopening plan was carefully devised to
comply with state and federal guidelines, and was developed after
consulting
parents.

“Obviously there are different viewpoints about wearing the masks,” Dr.
McMullan said. The reason they were not being mandated had nothing to do
with politics, she said, but because students with disabilities or other
medical conditions may not be able to wear them.

She also said the plan could change. Last week, reports surfaced that
the state board of education was [considering pushing all school
openings to
Sept. 8](https://www.ajc.com/education/get-schooled-blog/state-may-impose-statewide-start-date-of-sept-8/O5WRRZX3EFCL5KKFPVQ3KYRURU/#:~:text=Activate%20My%20Account-,Georgia%20may%20push%20statewide%20start%20date%20of%20Sept.%208%20for,start%20of%20school%20until%20September.&text=At%20its%20meeting%20Thursday%2C%20the,school%20statewide%20until%20Sept.%208.),
though nothing came of the idea.

A copy of notes from a July 15 high school department chair meeting
describes how masks will be required on school buses, hallways will be
marked to encourage walking on the right side, and teachers will be
required to send children with coronavirus symptoms to a school nurse in
an “isolation
room.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“Teachers cannot require students to wear masks in their classroom,” the
document says, though it also encourages teachers to “make masks the
culture.”

Several teachers told The New York Times they were concerned about their
health and the health of others. All of them requested anonymity because
they feared retaliation. One teacher said he had numerous underlying
health issues and was afraid to go back into the
classroom.

“I think they’re worried about upsetting people who aren’t taking Covid
seriously,” the teacher said. He noted that Governor Kemp is suing Mayor
Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, a Democrat, over her efforts to mandate
masks in the city. “So many Republicans at all levels of government
aren’t taking this seriously.”

But other teachers say they are ready to go back to work. “I’m not
paranoid, actually, of the virus. I’m more worried about our kids and
their well-being if we don’t get them back into the classroom,” said
Katie Sellers, an eighth-grade physical science teacher at Jefferson
Middle School.

Ms. Sellers has two students in the district, an eighth grader and a
senior. She said she was letting them make up their own minds about
whether to wear masks. “My senior has absolutely said no” on the grounds
that school feels like a “safe space” for him, she said.

Dr. McMullan said 2 percent of students have selected the
remote-learning option. Those students will be able to choose between at
least two programs, one provided by a private company called
[Edgenuity](https://www.edgenuity.com/) and the other by [Georgia
Virtual School](https://www.gavirtualschool.org/), which is run by the
state.

The teachers of online classes will be state certified, but some parents
were disappointed they were not teachers from the Jefferson system. Pete
Fuller, a candidate for a local seat in the State Legislature, said his
two children, an eighth and a ninth grader, would be starting the year
learning from home. “The choice was basically given and it’s not the
choice I want to make,” he said.

Mr. Fuller said his ninth grader, Rainey Fuller, 14, a trombone player,
tried to attend marching band practice this month, and became
uncomfortable when many students stopped wearing masks by the second
day.

Last week, about 30 incoming freshmen and their parents arrived in the
big school auditorium for an introductory session led by the principal,
Brian Moore. Normally, the hundreds of incoming freshmen would show up
in one session, but because of the virus they had broken into smaller
sessions. About a third of them were wearing masks.

As he set out to find his new classrooms with his mother, Hunter Walker,
14, said he did not plan to wear a mask. “No one around my age has
really been affected by it as much,” he said. Then he noted that a
football player who had been exposed to the coronavirus had been at a
weight training session last Monday, forcing coaches to shut down
ninth-grade football practice for the week.

It was one of many indications that this could be a very long year on
campus — or, in fact, a very short one.
