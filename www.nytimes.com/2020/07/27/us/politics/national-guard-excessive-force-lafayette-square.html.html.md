# National Guard Officer Says Police Used ‘Excessive’ Force at White House Clash

</div>

An Army National Guard officer at Lafayette Square plans to tell
lawmakers that the Park Police unleashed an “unprovoked escalation” on
peaceful protesters last month.

WASHINGTON — An Army National Guard officer who was called in to enforce
the crackdown on protests in [Lafayette
Square](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/lafayette-square-park-police-protests.html)
last month will tell lawmakers that the demonstrators were peaceful and
“subjected to an unprovoked escalation and excessive use of force,”
according to written testimony made public on Monday.

Maj. Adam DeMarco, an Iraq war veteran who currently serves in the
District of Columbia National Guard, will testify on Tuesday before a
House panel investigating the clash, giving the latest account of how
Park Police and Secret Service officers violently cleared protesters
away from the White House. He intends to testify that the harsh actions
were taken without provocation or adequate warning just before President
Trump walked through the area with senior administration officials to
[stage a photo
event](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/politics/trump-st-johns-church-bible.html)
in front of a historic church.

“From my observation, those demonstrators — our fellow American citizens
— were engaged in the peaceful expression of their First Amendment
rights,” Major DeMarco will say, according to the advance text of his
remarks. “Yet they were subjected to an unprovoked escalation and
excessive use of force.”

The [shocking
clash](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html)
on June 1, yards from the White House, produced stunning images as
mounted police and riot officers routed demonstrators with smoke, flash
grenades and tear gas, minutes after Mr. Trump declared himself “your
president of law and order” and “an ally of all peaceful protesters.”
Those events have prompted lawmakers, infuriated by the violent scene,
to investigate who ordered the attack on protesters and why.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The reckoning has been particularly acute in the military. Gen. Mark A.
Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation’s top
military officer, [publicly
apologized](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/politics/trump-milley-military-protests-lafayette-square.html)
for taking part in the president’s photo op. Members of the District of
Columbia National Guard — a majority of whose personnel are people of
color — have both [publicly and privately
lamented](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/national-guard-protests.html)
their role in the protests.

The District of Columbia National Guard, typically deployed to help
after natural disasters or to assist with managing crowds and logistics
support for large public events in the capital, was called in with Guard
units from other states to help respond to the growing protests in front
of the White House in the aftermath of the [police killing of George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles)
and other Black Americans.

The Guard’s job on June 1 was not to clear protesters, Major DeMarco
will say, according to the text, but to “hold a static line,”
establishing a new security perimeter around the White House.

But he was taken aback, according to his testimony, when the Park Police
began issuing orders to protesters to evacuate the park 40 minutes
before the city’s curfew began.

“From where I was standing, approximately 20 yards from the
demonstrators, the announcements were barely audible,” Major DeMarco
says, “and I saw no indication that the demonstrators were cognizant of
the warnings to disperse.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Major DeMarco said that a liaison officer for the Park Police told him
that no tear gas was being deployed against the protesters, but that he
felt “irritation in my eyes and nose” that he identified as tear gas.
Later, he saw tear gas canisters on the street. The Park Police
initially denied that it had been used against protesters, and then
claimed the statement was a “mistake.”

Major DeMarco also noted that the equipment to build a [barrier around
the White
House](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/white-house-security.html)
— the stated reason for clearing the protesters — did not arrive until 9
p.m., more than two hours after the evacuation order was given. He
called the episode “deeply disturbing.”

Gregory T. Monahan, the acting chief of the Park Police, will testify on
Tuesday before the House Committee on Natural Resources, along with
Major DeMarco.

The episode at Lafayette Square is the latest controversy for the Park
Police, which prosecutors and defense lawyers say has a reputation for
[fostering a culture of
recklessness](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/park-police-gregory-monahan.html).
As a U.S. Park Police patrol officer nearly two decades ago, Mr. Monahan
was accused of conducting unlawful body cavity searches and providing
unreliable testimony.

A spokeswoman for the National Park Service said the allegations were
investigated and “determined to be unfounded.”
