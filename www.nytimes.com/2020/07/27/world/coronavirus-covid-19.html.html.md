# Research Boosts Evidence of Masks’ Utility, Some Experts Say

</div>

Masks have long been known to help stop infected people from spreading
the virus, but some research suggests they also protect the uninfected.
President Trump shared a video with misinformation about the virus.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

## Masks may also protect people wearing them, some experts say.

Researchers have long known that masks can [prevent people from
spreading airway
germs](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003205)
to others.

But now experts are pointing to evidence suggesting that masks [also
protect the people wearing
them](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23498357/), lessening the severity
of symptoms, or in some instances, staving off infection entirely.

Different kinds of masks “block virus to a different degree, but they
all block the virus from getting in,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an
infectious disease physician at the University of California, San
Francisco. If any virus particles do breach these barriers, she said,
the disease might still be milder.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Gandhi and her colleagues make this argument in a
[paper](https://ucsf.app.box.com/s/blvolkp5z0mydzd82rjks4wyleagt036) to
be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. Drawing from
animal experiments and observations of various events during the
pandemic, they contend that people wearing face coverings will take in
fewer coronavirus particles.

Dr. Tsion Firew, an emergency physician at Columbia University who
wasn’t involved in the work, cautioned that the links between masking
and milder disease haven’t yet been proved as cause and effect.

Ideas about the importance of viral dose in the development of disease
have cropped up in the medical literature since [at least
the 1930s](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/27/3/493/99616).
More recently, scientists have gone as far as to [puff different amounts
of a flu virus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25416753/) up the noses
of human volunteers. The more virus in this nasal plume, they found, the
likelier the participants were to get infected and experience symptoms.

That sort of experiment can’t be done ethically for the new coronavirus,
given how dangerous it is. But earlier this year, a team of researchers
in China tried something similar in hamsters: They housed
coronavirus-infected and healthy animals in adjoining cages, some of
which were separated by buffers made of surgical masks. Many of the
healthy hamsters behind the partitions never got infected. And the
unlucky animals who did [got less
sick](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa644/5848814)
than their “maskless” neighbors.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rules around mask wearing have been highly politicized. President Trump
spent months questioning their utility and refusing to wear one in
public, though he has recently changed
course.

Another of summer’s most cherished rites was upended by the pandemic on
Monday when the attempted return of Major League Baseball hit a snag, as
the Miami Marlins postponed their home opener after 14 members of the
team tested positive for the coronavirus.

The troubled return of the national pastime, after [months of careful
planning,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/sports/rob-manfred-mlb-season.html)
was only the latest sign that the virus, instead of ebbing over the
summer as officials had once hoped it would, is spreading at record
levels across wide sections of the United States.

A month that began with [canceled July 4 fireworks
displays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-fourth-of-july.html)
across the country and [sporadic beach
closures](https://www.miamigov.com/Notices/News-Media/4th-of-July-Weekend-in-the-City-of-Miami)
has continued with edicts shutting down [the bars of Bourbon
Street](https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_0a3bbc54-ce03-11ea-97ba-cfbad95a9c94.html)
in New Orleans and the[dance floors of
Nashville](https://www.asafenashville.org/roadmap-for-reopening-nashville-phase-2-guidance-and-resources/).
Now a new round of cancellations —[including the Marlins game and a
Phillies game in
Philadelphia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/sports/baseball/marlins-game-canceled.html),
where the visiting Yankees would have had to use the same clubhouse that
the Marlins had — is continuing to disrupt summer life.

The infections, and postponements, cast a pall over baseball’s plans to
attempt a 60-game season using 30 stadiums, [including a ballpark in
Buffalo for the Toronto Blue
Jays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/sports/baseball/blue-jays-buffalo.html),
who were barred from playing home games by the Canadian government
because of the risk of travel to and from the United States.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, warned
early on about how the pandemic would transform professional sports. He
threw out the first pitch at baseball’s opening game last Thursday
between the Yankees and Washington Nationals, an image featured on a
limited-edition Topps NOW baseball card that Topps said sold 51,512
copies during its 24-hour offering.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Topps said that the demand for the card was more than double the
previous record for a Topps NOW card, which was 19,396 copies of a
Vladimir Guerrero Jr. card in 2019.

There will also be no summer blockbuster at the local movie theater:
“Tenet,” the Christopher Nolan thriller that Warner Bros. had hoped
would lure fans back to multiplexes this month, has been postponed until
Sept. 4, the beginning of Labor Day weekend.

The political blockbusters planned for later this summer — the national
conventions — will be unrecognizable from in years past. President Trump
said last week that he was bowing to the reality of the virus and
canceling the convention activities he had tried to move to
Jacksonville, Fla., after officials in North Carolina, where they were
initially supposed to be held, had insisted on enforcing health
guidelines. And Democrats have long been working on [a scaled-back
convention in
Milwaukee](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/politics/democratic-convention-milwaukee.html)
where they plan to nominate Joseph R. Biden Jr.

One of the other big television events of the summer — the Olympics — is
off, too. Tokyo, where the games were supposed to be underway right now,
instead finds itself grappling with[record numbers of new cases on
several recent
days.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/asia/japan-coronavirus.html)

Even the unofficial end of summer — the start of the school year — is
being postponed in many districts, where officials say that they need
more time to prepare for classes, which will be held in person in some
places and online in
others.

President Trump shared on his Twitter account Monday night a viral video
containing a series of false or misleading medical claims about the
coronavirus, as social media companies scrambled to halt the video’s
rapid spread.

Facebook and YouTube removed versions of the video, and Twitter later
removed the post shared by the president. At least one version, which
was shared on Facebook by the right-wing Breitbart news site, had
garnered over 13 million views before it was removed. Other versions of
the video, including shorter, edited clips, were still online Monday
night.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

The video featured what appeared to be a group of doctors in white
coats, standing in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington,
D.C., in what appeared to be a news conference. The doctors made a
series of misleading claims, including that hydroxychloroquine could be
taken as a preventive measure.

The use of the drug to treat or prevent coronavirus has been [widely
disputed by the medical
establishment](https://www.nytimes.com/article/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html).
The Food and Drug Administration [revoked its emergency
authorization](https://www.fda.gov/media/138945/download) in June after
deeming it “unlikely to be effective” while carrying potential risks,
and the National Institutes of Health [halted clinical trials of the
drug in
June](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trial.html).
But Mr. Trump repeatedly boosted the drug in the early months of the
crisis, and said in June he was taking it
himself.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

Republicans are seeking a $400-per-week reduction in unemployment
benefits in their $1 trillion economic recovery package, initially
lowering the extra federal payments for tens of millions of jobless
Americans from $600 to $200, according to Senator Mitch McConnell,
Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The proposal to slash the jobless aid by two-thirds, part of a
Republican plan they began rolling out on Monday afternoon, is likely to
be among the most bitterly contested issues in bipartisan negotiations
over the next round of pandemic relief. Democrats support a $3 trillion
package that includes extending the $600-per-week federal payments,
which expire on Friday, through the end of the year.

Many Republicans detest the supplement to state jobless aid, put in
place by the $2.2 trillion stimulus law, arguing that it is a
disincentive to returning to work because it exceeds what some workers
can earn in regular wages. The Republican proposal, which has [badly
divided the
party](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/republicans-stimulus-coronavirus.html),
envisions eventually shifting to a new system of calculating benefits
that would cap payments at about 70 percent of a worker’s prior income,
[which would also amount to about $200 per
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits.html).

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It also proposes another round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans.

In a nod to the long odds of striking a deal before the benefits expire
on Friday, administration officials continue to [float the prospect of
speeding through a much narrower
bill](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F07%2F26%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fcoronavirus-stimulus-bill-unemployment.html)
that would extend extra jobless aid, provide funding for schools and
enact new liability shields for operating businesses.

But Democrats have rejected that idea, saying it would sap momentum for
other crucial relief measures.

Democratic leaders left a nearly two-hour meeting with White House
officials on Monday evening saying they were unsatisfied with the

Senate counterparts for struggling to coalesce around a proposal.

“If they’re not even getting to the fundamentals of food and rent and
economic survival, they’re not really ready to have a serious
negotiation,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said after nearly two
hours of meeting with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Mark
Meadows, the White House chief of staff; and Senator Chuck Schumer of
New York, the minority leader. Mr. Schumer added, “We hope they can get
their act together — we very much want to get something done for the

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even as the virus rages across much of the nation, forcing many states
to slow or reverse their reopenings, President Trump said on Monday that
more states should be opening up.

During a visit to a North Carolina biotechnology lab, Mr. Trump boasted
that progress toward a vaccine was “substantially ahead of schedule” and
that a breakthrough would lead to a “tremendous” economic recovery.

In the next breath, Mr. Trump complained that “a lot of the governors
should be opening up states that they’re not opening, and we’ll see what
happens with them.”

It was something of a return to form for Mr. Trump, who has [long
pressed states to
reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-governors.html),
downplaying the threat of the virus, but who had [seemed to shift last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-masks.html)
when he declared at the White House that the virus “will probably,
unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But on Monday, Mr. Trump also urged Americans to “especially focus on
maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large
gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wears masks when appropriate.”
And he then donned a mask himself for a subsequent tour of the lab
facility, where researchers are making components for a potential
vaccine.

Mr. Trump spoke after the White House announced that his national
security adviser, [Robert C. O’Brien, had tested positive for the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/politics/robert-obrien-virus.html),
making him the most senior White House official known to have contracted
the virus. In a statement, the White House said that Mr. O’Brien “has
mild symptoms” and is working remotely from “a secure location off
site.”

Mr. O’Brien typically works from a West Wing office that is steps away
from the Oval Office. It is unclear when he was last in contact with Mr.
Trump, although he joined him on a [July 10 trip to
Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-florida-maduro.html).
A photo of Mr. O’Brien taken after he left the plane in Miami shows him

mask.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration’s coronavirus response
coordinator, made it clear during a visit to Tennessee on Monday that
she believed that everyone in the state should be required to wear masks
— but she stopped short of publicly asking its governor to issue a
statewide mandate.

“We need 100 percent of the counties, including the rural counties, to
have these mandates,” Dr. Birx said [during a news
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1UBeX0x-I8).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then the state’s governor, Bill Lee, a Republican, took to the lectern
and was asked if Dr. Birx had pressed him to issue a statewide mandate.
“We talked about statewide mandates. We also talked about alternative
approaches,” he said. Tennessee reported 2,871 new cases on Sunday, the
most it has reported in a single day, according to [a New York Times
database.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/tennessee-coronavirus-cases.html)

It was another example of how the nation’s patchwork of rules and
recommendations at different levels of government has complicated
efforts to control the virus.

Federal health officials issue guidelines and make recommendations, but
state and local officials do not always follow them. Mr. Trump has been
dismissive of or slow to promote some federal recommendations — it took
weeks for him to appear in a mask after health experts called for face
coverings — and suggested on Monday that more governors should
reopen.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

As Kentucky officials weighed new restrictions, Dr. Birx said over the
weekend that the leaders of nearby states should consider doing the same
by closing bars again and issuing restrictions on public gatherings “to
really make it possible to control the pandemic before it gets worse.”

Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said Monday that the state’s bars would
have to close again to slow the spread, about a month after they had
reopened.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>He also reduced the
legal restaurant capacity from 50 percent to 25 percent, and issued an
informal recommendation that schools wait until the third week of August
to resume in-person classes.

Kentucky had already implemented two other recommendations put forward
by Dr. Birx: requiring face masks for public indoor spaces, and limiting
social gatherings to 10 people. “I don’t want to be a state where casket
makers are running out,” Mr. Beshear said.

States in the South and Midwest are facing the prospect of shutting down
parts of their economies again to try to stem the virus, which the Trump
administration and many governors have increasingly been forced to
[recognize as
unrelenting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-masks.html).
[Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html#link-44261c05)
has surpassed New York, an early center of the pandemic in the United
States when testing was scarce, in the number of known cases. And on
Monday, Oklahoma and New Mexico broke state records for single-day
cases. Texas became the fourth state to record over 400,000 total cases,
after California, Florida and New York.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And despite increased testing capacity across the nation, there is a
consensus among federal state and local officials that test results are

## Boris Johnson’s new tactic against the virus: urge Britons to lose weight.

Britain will crack down on junk food advertising and introduce calorie
counts on menus in an effort to tackle obesity and ease the pressure on
the country’s National Health Service amid the coronavirus pandemic, the
government said on Monday.

For the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the intersection of
obesity and the coronavirus is personal. Mr. Johnson was, by his own
admission, “way overweight” when he was admitted to the hospital after
[becoming ill with Covid-19 this
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/world/europe/coronavirus-queen-elizabeth-speech.html),
and his health deteriorated to such an extent that [at one point he
needed intensive
care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/world/europe/coronavirus-boris-johnson-britain.html).

Studies have [linked obesity to a greater risk of serious illness or
death from
Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/coronavirus-obesity-higher-risk.html),
and Mr. Johnson, [writing in the British newspaper The Daily
Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1314742/Boris-Johnson-health-reforms-obesity-latest),
described his time in hospital as a “wake-up call.”

“We all put things off — I know I have,” Mr. Johnson wrote. “I’ve wanted
to lose weight for ages and like many people I struggle with my weight.”

As part of the government’s [new obesity
strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-obesity-strategy-unveiled-as-country-urged-to-lose-weight-to-beat-coronavirus-covid-19-and-protect-the-nhs),
advertisements for any food high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned on
television and online until 9 p.m. to avoid hours when children are most
likely to see them. There will also be a consultation on whether Britain
should entirely ban online ads for junk food.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

All large restaurants and cafes will be required to add a calorie count
to their menus, and the government will look into adding calorie labels
to alcoholic drinks.

Promotional offers like “buy one, get one free” on fatty or sugary foods
will also be
prohibited.

Instead of the welcome that a tourism-hungry island would usually
extend, travelers to Puerto Rico over the weekend encountered angry
protesters outside the San Juan airport, demanding that the airport be
closed to tourists.

The protesters’ complaint: Too many visitors have been blithely ignoring
social-distancing precautions and mask mandates.

A caravan of cars honking their horns, with protesters holding up signs,
blocked traffic into the airport, and some protesters on foot clashed
with police.

“We are going to continue with this caravan and with this fight, because
this is a question of life or death,” one protester, Ricardo Santos
Ortiz, said on
[WAPA-TV](https://www.wapa.tv/noticias/locales/manifestacion-que-exigia-cerrar-aeropuerto-culmina-con-un-arresto_20131122482738.html)

Puerto Rico reopened to tourism July 15, but a day later Gov. Wanda
Vázquez Garced reversed course, pushing the opening off for a month and
shutting many businesses down again, because coronavirus cases were
soaring on the island. That has not stopped tourists from arriving
anyway, often flying in from virus hot spots around the U.S. to vacation
in one of the few tropical getaways that Americans can visit now.

About 12,000 people have flown to San Juan from Miami so far in July,
five times as many as in April, according to Greg Chin, a spokesperson
for Miami International Airport. José Reyes of the Puerto Rico National
Guard said in [a televised
interview](https://www.wapa.tv/noticias/locales/alarmante-cantidad-de-viajeros-que-llegan-de-la-florida-a-puerto-rico_20131122482429.html)
last week that only about 20 percent of arriving visitors were complying
with Puerto Rico’s requirement that they have a negative coronavirus
test from the previous 72 hours.

Puerto Rico shut down early, before any U.S. state, and managed to avoid
a major coronavirus outbreak in the spring. But its daily case counts
have soared in the last two weeks, and residents say the influx of
tourists is to blame for much of the rise.

Videos of unmasked tourists [dancing in the
streets](https://www.telemundopr.com/noticias/puerto-rico/sin-mascarilla-y-distanciamiento-decenas-de-turistas-por-la-libre-en-condado/2105861/)
and [scuffling at the
airport](https://www.facebook.com/100000978562895/videos/4176373252405252/)
have recently gone viral, and some businesses have [called the
police](https://www.telemundopr.com/noticias/puerto-rico/sin-mascarilla-y-distanciamiento-decenas-de-turistas-por-la-libre-en-condado/2105861/)
to deal with tourists who became aggressive when asked to wear a mask.

Though the island’s hotels are open, much else is shut down, including
hotel swimming pools, casinos and tourist attractions; beaches are
closed except for solo
exercise.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

One of the first large studies of safety and effectiveness of a
coronavirus vaccine in the United States began on Monday, according to
the National Institutes of Health and the biotech company Moderna, which
collaborated to develop the vaccine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The first shot was given to a person at 6:45 a.m., Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,
the nation’s leading infections disease expert, told reporters.

The study, a Phase 3 clinical trial, will enroll 30,000 healthy people
at about 89 sites around the country. Half will receive two shots of the
vaccine, 28 days apart, and half will receive two shots of a saltwater
placebo. Neither the volunteers nor the medical staff giving the
injections will know who is getting the real vaccine.

Dr. Fauci estimated that the trial’s full enrollment of 30,000 will be
completed by the end of the summer, and that results might be available
by November. Even earlier results might be possible, he said, but added
that he doubted that would be the case.

A second company, Pfizer, announced Monday afternoon that it would also
begin a late-stage study of a coronavirus vaccine, on Tuesday. Pfizer
has been working with a German company, BioNTech. Their study will also
include 30,000 people, from 39 states in the United States, and from
Brazil, Argentina and Germany.

The government announced last week that it had reached [a $1.95 billion
deal to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer’s
vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
by the year’s end, but only if the trial proves it safe and effective.

At the news briefing, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National
Institutes of Health, said that at least three other Phase 3 trials
would be starting soon, each needing 30,000 patients. Those trials will
involve vaccines made by Novavax, by a collaboration of the University
of Oxford and AstraZeneca, and by Johnson & Johnson. All are part of the
U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed.

Once volunteers are vaccinated, researchers will be looking for side
effects and waiting to see if the vaccine significantly lowers cases of
Covid-19. The study will also try to find out if it can prevent severe
Covid-19 cases and death; if it can prevent infection entirely, based on
lab tests; and if just one shot can prevent the illness.

showed that it stimulated a strong immune response, with minor and
transient side effects like sore arms, fatigue, achiness and fever. But
exactly what type of immune response is needed to prevent the illness is
not known, so Phase 3 studies are essential to determine whether a
vaccine really

Long Beach Island, a popular summertime destination along the Jersey
Shore, is now a different kind of hot spot.

Thirty-five lifeguards from two boroughs on the barrier island — Surf
City and Harvey Cedars — recently [tested positive for the
coronavirus](http://lbihealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pressrelease727.pdf),
the island’s health department announced on Monday.

Public health officials said that half of the lifeguards were
experiencing mild symptoms and the rest were asymptomatic. None were
hospitalized, the officials said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The outbreak was traced to two social gatherings that the lifeguards
attended on July 12 and July 14, according to the Long Beach Island
Health Department, which said it dispatched nurses to investigate cases
and issue quarantine orders.

“Based on our investigation so far, the workplace was not the source of
transmission and practices likely prevented additional cases,” the
Health Department said in a news release on Monday. “The youth and young
adults should recognize they are not immune to this virus.”

During a daily briefing on the coronavirus pandemic on Monday, Gov. Phil
Murphy of New Jersey mentioned the outbreak on Long Beach Island and
said he was troubled by reports of large social gatherings of young
people.

“This is among us, folks,” Mr. Murphy said. “Any of us who thinks we can
just put our feet up and relax and let this take its course is not
paying attention, particularly congregating inside, in close proximity,
poor ventilation, without face coverings. You’re looking for trouble.
You’re absolutely looking for trouble, no matter how old you are.”

In Harvey Cedars, 18 of 73 lifeguards were infected, according to the
[borough’s website](http://www.harveycedars.org/), which said that its
beaches were still open and fully staffed. The lifeguards who tested
positive for the virus will not be allowed to return to work until they
meet the safety protocols set by the island’s health department,
according to a post on the borough’s website. It was not immediately
clear what those protocols are.

When reached by phone on Monday evening, the mayor of Surf City, Francis
R. Hodgson Sr., refused to comment.

On Long Beach Island, only one lifeguard is allowed in a lifeguard stand
under social distancing guidelines that the island’s Health Department
said it implemented at the start of the season. Lifeguards must report
directly to their stand, and communal activities are barred, health
officials
said.

The doctor who supplied the data for two discredited Covid-19 studies
had a history of cutting corners and misrepresenting information as he
pursued his ambitions, former colleagues say.

In May, Dr. Sapan Desai published two high-profile studies, including
one that found that anti-malaria drugs promoted by President Trump had
harmed patients being treated for Covid-19. The study almost instantly
disrupted multiple clinical trials amid the pandemic. (The Food and Drug
Administration said that hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to be
safe and effective and should not be used outside clinical trials.)

Last month, both studies were retracted by the medical journals that had
published them, after researchers around the world suggested the data
was dubious. Dr. Desai, who declined to share the raw data even with his
co-authors, claimed it was culled from a massive trove acquired by
Surgisphere, a business he started during his residency.

The New York Times interviewed more than two dozen people who have known
Dr. Desai over the past two decades. He has cast himself as an ambitious
physician, an entrepreneur with an M.B.A. and a prolific researcher
published in medical journals.

But more than a dozen doctors who worked with him during training and
residency said they had often found him to be an unreliable physician,
who seemed less interested in patient care than in his company and a
medical journal he founded.

“You couldn’t trust what he said,” said Dr. Vanessa Olcese, a former
chief resident who worked with Dr. Desai at Duke University Medical
Center.

U.S. ROUNDUP

## Google’s employees will work from home until mid-2021.

Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google’s parent company, Alphabet,
told employees Monday that they would not be expected back in the office
until mid-2021.

The company’s work force, which has been working remotely since March,
had previously been told to expect a return to offices in January 2021.

A Google spokesman said: “To give employees the ability to plan ahead,
we are extending our global voluntary work from home option through June
30, 2021, for roles that don’t need to be in the office.”

Technology companies moved quickly with work-from-home policies, and
have been reluctant to bring workers back too early. In May, Facebook
said it would allow many employees to work from home permanently.

In other developments around the United States:

  - **Washington, D.C.**, said travelers should quarantine themselves
    for 14 days if they arrive [from 27 “high-risk”
    states](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/release/dc-health-releases-list-high-risk-states)
    that meet certain criteria, including California, Florida and Texas.
    Residents in nearby Maryland and
    [Virginia](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/virginia-coronavirus-cases.html)
    — which are both seeing increased numbers of cases — are exempted
    from the order. People arriving after essential travel in those
    states or arriving in Washington for essential travel should
    self-monitor. Many states across the United States [have added
    restrictions on incoming
    travelers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/travel/state-travel-restrictions.html)
    in hopes of curbing the spread of the virus.

  - The Labor Department has been struggling to process a pileup of
    **compensation claims from federal workers** who have fallen ill
    with the coronavirus, according to an audit by the department’s
    inspector general. The department expects to have received roughly
    6,000 claims by next Tuesday, and has been slow to sift through the
    ones it has received already, according to[the
    report](https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2020/19-20-004-04-001.pdf):
    As of June 16, the department had processed only 911 of the 2,866
    claims it had received.

  - Twenty-three states [are going ahead
    with](http://www.ncbex.org/ncbe-covid-19-updates/july-2020-bar-exam-jurisdiction-information/status-table/)**[in-person
    bar
    exams](http://www.ncbex.org/ncbe-covid-19-updates/july-2020-bar-exam-jurisdiction-information/status-table/)**
    — the grueling tests that aspiring lawyers must pass to practice —
    on Tuesday and Wednesday, despite the recent surge in coronavirus
    cases across the country. Most of the states are in the South or
    Midwest; many, like Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma, have seen
    sharp recent rises in case reports. The danger posed by having
    numerous test-takers sitting in the same rooms for hours has
    prompted many other states to postpone the exam until later in the
    year, switch to administering it online, or both. Some states that
    usually give the exam in early September have also announced
    postponements.

  - Gov. Gavin Newsom of **California** announced a $52 million grant
    from the federal government aimed at slowing the virus’s rampage
    through the states’s Central Valley, where residents of
    predominantly Latino communities have consistently been required to
    keep showing up at work in fields or meatpacking plants and
    [warehouses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/coronavirus-ca-warehouse-workers.html).
    The money will go toward more focused testing efforts to identify
    outbreaks, education for employees and employers about rights to
    sick leave and other safety issues, as well as improvements to
    quarantine and isolation protocols.

  - State officials in **Texas** changed their methodology for reporting
    coronavirus deaths on Monday, causing a spike in their data. More
    than 6,000 people in Texas are now known to have died from the
    coronavirus, according to a New York Times database that uses state
    and county data, an increase of more than 1,000 since Sunday.

  - The gym chain **Planet Fitness**
    [announced](https://www.planetfitness.com/club-cleanliness) Monday
    that guests would be required to wear masks at all times while
    inside its facilities, effective Aug. 1. The announcement follows
    [similar policies by national
    chains](https://www.nytimes.com/article/which-stores-require-masks.html)
    in recent weeks. Planet Fitness opened its 2,000th gym in December
    2019.

  - **[George Washington University](https://coronavirus.gwu.edu/)**
    **** announced on Monday that all undergraduate classes would be
    taught online this fall as the [number of cases rises in Washington,
    D.C.,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Maryland and
    Virginia](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu).
    The university said it would provide on-campus housing to a limited
    number of students with extenuating personal or academic
    circumstances. *(An earlier version of this briefing reported
    erroneously that Georgetown University would also be holding all
    classes online.)*

  - The **Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference** [said it would cancel
    fall
    sports](https://maacsports.com/news/2020/7/27/general-maac-statement-of-fall-sports-competition.aspx)competition
    because of virus concerns, including men’s and women’s soccer,
    women’s volleyball, and men’s and women’s cross country. It joined
    the [Ivy League and the Patriot
    League](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/sports/ncaafootball/ivy-league-fall-sports-football-coronavirus.html)
    in placing sports on hold.

  - The surge in coronavirus infections in **Missouri** has temporarily
    shut down Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis, less than a
    month before the fall semester was set to begin, because of a
    cluster of reported infections among campus employees. The
    historically black university conducted all its summer classes
    online this year, so there were few students and faculty members on
    the campus. But a smattering of other university employees have been
    working there since May, and the city of St. Louis and the
    surrounding county have been reporting high rates of
infection.

Across France, thousands of winemakers, famous and obscure, are facing
moments of heartbreak.

The economic crisis, combined with the Trump administration’s 25 percent
tax on French wines in a trade war dispute with Europe, has collapsed
the wine market.

So some of the wine for which France is famous will wind up as hand

The 2020 harvest, blessed by abundant sunshine, is barely a month away.
The wine vats must be emptied for the new production. The distillery is
the only option.

“We’re producing more than we can sell,” said Thibaut Specht, a
winemaker in Alsace. “We have no choice.”

Marion Borès’s family business, Domaine Borès, in Reichsfeld, is sending
off half its production — 320,000 liters — to a distiller for conversion
into alcohol for sanitizer. “It’s like you are saying goodbye to
somebody who is very dear to you,” she said.

After North Korea on Sunday [accused a man of secretly
crossing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus-kim-jong-un.html)
into the country from South Korea and bringing the virus with him, Seoul
went in search of any defectors ​in ​the South who were missing.

By Monday, [South Korean officials had zeroed
in](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/world/asia/north-korea-defector-coronavirus.html)
on a 24-year-old man, identified only by his family name, Kim, who in
2017 swam across the western inter-Korea border to defect to the South.
On July 19, he swam back across the border into Kaesong in the North,
they said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was not immediately clear why the defector had crossed. The South
Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the man had been wanted by the
South Korean police for questioning after a rape accusation.

North Korea said on Sunday that the North Korean man was “suspected to
have been infected with the vicious virus” and could be the country’s
first case. And the reverse defection prompted the North’s leader, Kim
Jong-un, to order a total lockdown of Kaesong, a border city of 300,000,
and declare a “maximum” national emergency.

Until Sunday, North Korea had ​repeatedly ​said that it had no Covid-19
cases. The[claim was questioned by outside
experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article).

South Korea officials could not say whether the man might have ​carried
the virus across the border.

    single-day count since the pandemic began.

  - **Belgium’s** prime minister reinstated strict social-distancing
    rules on Monday, saying she was taking aggressive steps to avoid
    another lockdown. She ordered Belgians not to socialize with more
    than five people and restricted all shopping visits to 30 minutes.
    Such measures were in place this spring, as Belgium was just
