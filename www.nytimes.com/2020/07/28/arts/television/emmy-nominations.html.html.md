## Netflix and “The Mandalorian” show the might of streamers.

Netflix dominated the 72nd
[Emmy](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/emmy-awards) Award nominations
on Tuesday, breaking the record for the most nominations ever, and a
newcomer to the streaming universe, Disney+, scored a nomination in a
big category for “The Mandalorian” in yet another sign of the growing
importance of digital technology to Hollywood.

A longtime Emmy champion, HBO, remained a force: “Watchmen,” the cable
network’s innovative spin on a difficult-to-adapt superhero graphic
novel, led all shows with 26 nominations. Amazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs.
Maisel,” an Emmy favorite, came in second, with 20.

Netflix smashed the record for most nominations of any network, studio
or streaming platform, with 160, breaking the record set last year by
HBO. HBO came in second, with 107 nominations. The next closest
competitor, NBC, had 47.

Netflix and HBO have waged hard-fought battles against each other at the
Emmys in recent years, and the Tuesday announcement marked the second
time that Netflix had bested HBO in the total number of nominations. The
two entertainment giants are these days competing even more directly,
now that HBO’s parent company, AT\&T, unveiled the ambitious streaming
service HBO Max in May.

With an Emmy stalwart, “Game of Thrones,” finally out of the competition
after a nearly decade-long run, the best drama race was open to
newcomers and other programs that have yet to win big. HBO’s operatic
family saga, “Succession,” Netflix’s
[more-popular-by-the-day](https://deadline.com/2020/04/ozark-season-3-ratings-netflix-1202915140/)
crime series “Ozark” and Netflix’s lush period piece about Queen
Elizabeth II, “The Crown,” all scored nominations in the category.

“The Handmaid’s Tale,” the Hulu show that was voted best drama in 2017,
also received a nomination, although [some critics were
cool](https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-handmaids-tale/critic-reviews?sort-by=date&num_items=100)
to its third season, which premiered more than a year ago.

And there was a surprise nod in the best drama category for the Disney+
series, “The Mandalorian,” the Baby Yoda sensation that made its debut
on the Walt Disney Company’s multibillion-dollar streaming service in
November 2019. The “Star Wars” spinoff scored 15 nominations overall.

The top show for Apple — another recent entrant in the streaming wars —
was the AppleTV+ series “The Morning Show.” The big-budget backstage
drama received acting nominations for Jennifer Aniston, Billy Crudup,
Mark Duplass, Martin Short and Steve Carell.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On the comedy side, Pop TV’s “Schitt’s Creek,” which has attracted a
wider audience since it started streaming on Netflix, received 15
nominations for its final season.

Amazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” the 2018 best comedy winner, is
also in the mix. It will compete in the best comedy category against
Netflix’s “Dead to Me,” NBC’s “The Good Place,” FX’s “What We Do in the
Shadows,” Netflix’s “The Kominsky Method” and two HBO shows, “Insecure”
and “Curb Your
Enthusiasm.”

The envelopes are scheduled to be unsealed on Sept. 20 during a ceremony

were more nominations than ever this time around.

the number of Emmy submissions rose by 15 percent, and the academy

Of all the acting categories, best actress in a drama was the most
star-studded.

Olivia Colman’s turn as Queen Elizabeth II in “The Crown” scored
a<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>nomination on Tuesday — and
an Emmy win would make a nice to complement to the Golden Globe she has
already won for the role, not to mention the Oscar she took home in 2019
for her portrayal of Queen Anne in “The Favourite.”

The four-time Emmy winner Laura Linney, a star of “Ozark,” also landed a
nomination, as did Aniston, who plays an overwhelmed news anchor on “The
Morning Show.” For the “Friends” star, it was her first nomination in 11
years. (She was last nominated for a guest appearance on “30 Rock.”)

Last year’s winner, Jodie Comer, a star of AMC’s “Killing Eve,” is also
a contender for the prize, as is her cast mate Sandra Oh, who has yet to
win an Emmy. Zendaya received her first Emmy nomination for HBO’s
“Euphoria.”

Just how competitive is this category? Snubs included Reese Witherspoon
for “The Morning Show,” Nicole Kidman for “Big Little Lies,” Viola Davis
for “How To Get Away With Murder” and Elisabeth Moss for “The Handmaid’s
Tale.”

The limited series category has become the Emmy ceremony’s most
glamorous and intriguing, given its major stars and blockbuster budgets
invested by cable networks and streaming companies into single short
seasons.

This year’s contest will be a showdown between two ambitious programs
that tackled social issues: [“Mrs.
America,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/arts/television/mrs-america-review.html)
the drama from FX and Hulu created by Dahvi Waller that chronicles the
battle over the Equal Rights Amendment, and
[“Watchmen,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/arts/television/watchmen-finale.html)
which was created by Damon Lindelof.

The other nominees in the category were Netflix’s “Unbelievable,” one of
the streamer’s most popular [original series
in 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/media/netflix-top-ten-movies-tv-shows.html),
along with another Netflix series, “Unorthodox,” and Hulu’s “Little
Fires Everywhere.”

The best actress in a limited series race looks like it will be a battle
between Cate Blanchett, who plays the conservative firebrand Phyllis
Schlafly in “Mrs. America,” and Regina King, the masked hero of
“Watchmen.”

Kerry Washington was also nominated for “Little Fires Everywhere,” along
with Octavia Spencer for Netflix’s “Self-Made” and Shira Haas for
Netflix’s
“Unorthodox.”

Here’s what we know for sure about the Emmys ceremony: ABC will put on
the telecast, and its late night personality, Jimmy Kimmel, will return
as the show’s host for a third time.

And that’s about it.

Will it be virtual? Will it be live? Will the winners deliver acceptance
speeches via Zoom?

What even *is* an awards show ceremony in the middle of a pandemic?

The Television Academy has provided little information — but with
ratings for [live television events
surging](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29532370/mlb-opener-was-most-viewed-regular-season-game-2011)
in recent months, a charmingly makeshift awards night could be just the
thing to reignite interest in the Emmys.

The weirdness was apparent during the announcements on Tuesday, when Ms.
Jones played the host from a studio and introduced her remote
co-presenters Laverne Cox, Josh Gad and Tatiana Maslany. The chairman of
the Television Academy, Frank Scherma, kicked off the ceremony from what
appeared to be a basement room with cinder block walls.

Last year, the Emmys broadcast [hit a
low](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/business/media/emmy-ratings.html)
in the ratings, with an audience of 6.9
million.

## James Corden, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon were all snubbed in the talk show category.

Snubbed. Snubbed. Snubbed.

Corden, the CBS late-night host who follows Stephen Colbert, had been a
mainstay in the talk show category in recent years. On Tuesday he was
left out, partly because of a rule change that winnowed the category’s
nominees from six to five. Fallon, the NBC host, was ignored by Emmy
voters in the category for a fourth consecutive year.

John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight,” which has won the category four years
in a row, was nominated once again.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
