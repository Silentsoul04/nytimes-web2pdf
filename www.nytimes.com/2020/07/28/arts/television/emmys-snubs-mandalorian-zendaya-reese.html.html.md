# Emmys 2020 Snubs and Surprises: Baby Yoda Breaks Through

Heading into an Emmys season eclipsed by both Black Lives Matters
protests and the Covid-19 pandemic, the question was whether we would
see new trends in the nominations or business as usual. [Tuesday’s
announcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/arts/television/emmy-nominations.html)
wasn’t stuffed with surprises, but you could read a few signs of the
times into [the
nominees](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/arts/television/emmy-nominees-list.html),
beginning with …

## Surprise: ‘The Mandalorian’

Everyone loved the Disney+ “Star Wars” series, and its beatific Baby
Yoda, but no one was predicting it would be nominated for an Emmy as
best drama series. Maybe the coronavirus really has made us susceptible
to comfort-food TV, a possibility supported by another at least slightly
surprising nominee in the category, Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” More
socially engaged shows that didn’t make the field included “Pose,” “The
Good Fight” and “The Morning Show.”

## Surprise: Zendaya

If you were looking for signs of an uptick in diversity, you could find
them in the acting categories, although reading anything into a
particular nomination is unwise. But still: Zendaya’s nomination for
“Euphoria,” William Jackson Harper’s for “The Good Place,” Andre
Braugher’s for “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” Octavia Spencer’s for “Self-Made:
Inspired by the Life of Madame C.J. Walker,” Jeremy Pope’s for
“Hollywood” and Samira Wiley’s for “The Handmaid’s Tale” (beating out
her castmate Ann Dowd) add up to a lot of less-than-expected names in
the running.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Snub: Reese Witherspoon

Ubiquitous as a producer and performer in high-toned television drama,
Witherspoon didn’t get a nomination as an actress for “Little Fires
Everywhere,” “The Morning Show” or “Big Little Lies,” and the latter two
shows were shut out of the drama race. She’ll have plenty of reason to
pay attention on Emmys night, though, with a limited-series nomination
for “Little Fires” and a raft of acting nominations for other performers
in her series.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Snub: Jane Lynch

Lynch was considered a lock for a comedy supporting-actress nod for her
now regular role as the poseur comic Sophie Lennon on “The Marvelous
Mrs. Maisel.” Taking her place was probably Cecily Strong, nabbing a
second nomination in the category (along with Kate McKinnon) for
“Saturday Night Live.”

## Surprise: ‘What We Do in the Shadows’

The droll FX vampire comedy is a critical favorite but wasn’t thought to
have much of a chance at the Emmys. Most likely paying the price for the
unexpected appearance of “Shadows” in the comedy-series field: Hulu’s
“Ramy.”

years in a row of being nominated in the variety talk category, James

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Snub: ‘The Late Late Show With James Corden’

A nominee in the variety talk category in each of the past four years,
Corden was eliminated from among the usual suspects (Samantha Bee,
Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Trevor Noah, John Oliver) after the
category was shrunk to five nominees from six.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Surprise: Steve Carell and Mark Duplass

Jennifer Aniston’s and Billy Crudup’s acting nominations for “The
Morning Show” were no surprise, but it was a little startling to see
Carell and Duplass join them, particularly when the series itself was
left out of the drama category.

## Snub: ‘At Home With Amy Sedaris'

The Television Academy had announced that the variety sketch series
category would be reduced to four nominees, but on Tuesday only three
names were read, leaving out Sedaris’s superb parody of a small-time
home-improvement show.

## Snub (sort of): ‘Better Call Saul’

Yes, the AMC series was nominated for best drama and Giancarlo Esposito
was in the field for supporting actor. But it was noticeable that Bob
Odenkirk, Rhea Seehorn and Jonathan Banks, all solid favorites in their
categories, were shut out.

## Critic’s Corner

A small selection of shows and people I thought were better than most or
all of the nominees in their categories: “The Good Fight,” CBS All
Access; “Our Boys,” HBO; “Bosch” and Titus Welliver, Amazon; Zoe Kazan
in “The Plot Against America,” HBO; “Quiz” and Matthew Macfadyen, AMC;
Nicholas Pinnock and Indira Varma in “For Life,” ABC; “My Brilliant
Friend: A New Name,” HBO; “The Conners,” ABC; Tamsin Greig and Harriet
Walter in “Belgravia,” Epix; Sophina Brown in “Twenties,” BET. And any
TV awards that do not include John Goodman’s perpetually marvelous
performance in “The Conners” don’t really need to be held.
