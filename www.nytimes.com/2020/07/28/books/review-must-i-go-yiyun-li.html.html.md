Yiyun Li’s new novel, “Must I Go,” was for many years a book
interrupted.

The award-winning author has been acclaimed for her haunting portrayals
of the Communist China of her youth. Her latest, set in America, follows
Lilia, a retiree who is annotating the posthumously published diaries of
a former lover. (He gets a lot wrong, as you might imagine.) But as Li
began delving into Lilia’s past — how, at 44, she lost a child to
suicide — she abruptly and inexplicably abandoned the project.

At the time, Li was 44 herself. Shortly after, in an appalling
coincidence, her own child — her 16-year-old son, Vincent — killed
himself, in 2017.

“Was I writing to prepare myself?” Li has wondered aloud in interviews.
At first, she did not return to “Must I Go.” She not only shelved the
novel but, in dramatic fashion, dismantled her own style. For her, the
pleasure in writing had always come from precision and revision —
unsurprising perhaps, for a mathematical prodigy who had once trained as
an immunologist. In the months following her son’s death, Li wrote
[“Where Reasons
End”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/books/review-where-reasons-end-yiyun-li.html)
in one furious draft.

That novel is a series of ragged, recursive conversations between a
mother and the ghost of her dead son — shockingly autobiographical for a
writer so famously leery of self-disclosure. She could scarcely abide
the pronoun “I,” she wrote in her memoir, [“Dear Friend, From My Life I
Write to You in Your
Life,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/books/review/dear-friend-from-my-life-i-write-to-you-in-your-life-yiyun-li.html)
itself a masterpiece of reticence, with its oblique depictions of the
writer’s own history of suicide attempts and hospitalizations.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

No word, no notion in Li’s work or life seems as necessary or as prized
as privacy. It even governed her choice of language. She mastered and
adopted English in her 20s, drawn to the idea of working in a tongue she
could imagine was hers alone, untainted by personal history or the
Communist Party’s degradation of language. “What marks our era,” a
character in her first novel, “The Vagrants,” says, “is the moaning of
our bones crushed beneath the weight of empty words.”

Now, Li has finally published “Must I Go,” a book that was scarily
prescient. What does Lilia, that other grieving mother, tell us? “I
haven’t stopped arguing with Lucy for 37 years,” she writes of her dead
daughter. “Everything in my life is a part of that long
argument.”

There’s an echo of the epigraph from “Where Reasons End,” a line from
Elizabeth Bishop: “Argue argue argue with me.” The books bleed into each
other. Their titles could run together in a single despairing sentence,
a mission statement of sorts: *Where reasons end, must I go*. Where the
previous book is stripped down, a bundle of exposed nerves, “Must I Go”
is upholstered with the nested narratives, intricate back stories and
details of a historical novel. For all their differences, their concerns
are knotted together. They reach into realms that the author and
characters feel are unspeakable: What is this perplexing obligation to
endure? What are the limits and consolations of language? What is the
self that can survive the death of a beloved child? Do we still call
that existence life?

They are among the loneliest books I’ve ever read — if they are merely
books. At times they seem more like ruins; the chipped sentences and
broken structures let you see all the devastated, discarded certainties.

“I am writing with my burnt hand about the nature of fire,” the novelist
Ingeborg Bachmann once wrote. With Li too, there is that feeling — her
books are documents of survival but they bear wounds as a body might.

“Must I Go” is less immediately autobiographical, although there are
little hints scattered throughout: The echoes of Li’s own name in
“Lilia,” to say nothing of the character’s unfortunate, heavy-handed
last name: “Imbody.” Her lover Roland’s middle name belongs to Li’s son.
They are small sparks of continuity and connection in an expansive plot
— or so it first seems.

Lilia has led a full life. She married three times and outlived all
three husbands. She bore five children, buried one (Lucy) and raised
Lucy’s child, Katherine, as her own. When we meet Lilia, she is readying
a version of Roland’s diaries to present to Katherine (Roland was Lucy’s
father), accompanied by a crippling amount of life advice. Much of the
action of the book is just this: Lilia repetitively, even compulsively
explaining to Katherine, and by extension the reader, her philosophy of
survival, a harsh and doughty stoicism.

Little happens, but I’ve always found the openness, the near
shapelessness of Li’s work to be part of its beauty. Her characters are
never coerced; they are patiently observed, they are allowed to live,
allowed to disappoint.

The core of “Must I Go” is the same as that of “Where Reasons End”:
Again, we see a mother desperately trying to prolong her conversation
with the dead, to keep her child close. The new book is bloated and
unwieldy, however; it lacks the blunt power of its predecessor, which
was stark and swift, flensed of artifice. There is a strange feeling of
watching Li retreating into a form and narrative structure she has
outgrown and outpaced.

There is an image that has always haunted me from Li’s early work. In
the short story “Kindness,” a young girl buys a small chick from the
market. It gets sick and dies. The girl cannot accept its death. She
goes to the kitchen, cracks open an egg and drains it. She tries to
squash the dead chick into the empty shell. *Begin again, begin again*,
I imagine her thinking. *Let’s start again*. So too in these narratives,
we feel these desperate resurrections, this attempt to return to the
beginning. *What did I miss with you?* *Where did I go wrong?* the
mothers wonder. It’s worth noting that the title of this new novel is
taken from Roland’s diaries; it’s the one question the mothers don’t
ask. They sermonize and theorize, lecture and filibuster. *Don’t go just
yet; let’s start again.* Lilia talks and talks — to Lucy, to Katherine.
And then, one day, as an old woman, she hears someone suddenly mention
her daughter’s name — “Lucy? Isn’t she dead?” She opens her mouth and no
words come.
