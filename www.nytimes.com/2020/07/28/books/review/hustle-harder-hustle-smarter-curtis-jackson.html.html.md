When considering self-help books by celebrities, I look first at what
expertise the author has that qualifies him or her to be dispensing
advice. So what to do with **HUSTLE HARDER, HUSTLE SMARTER (Amistad, 304
pp., $27.99), by Curtis Jackson**, the
rapper/producer/actor/entrepreneur known as 50 Cent? I don’t need advice
on selling drugs (Fiddy at age 12), getting shot (nine times) or making
hit records (over 30 million albums sold). But it happens the man has
made several fortunes (and lost a couple too), which makes “Hustle
Harder” an inspirational, if at times alarming, read. Like Snoop Dogg,
Jackson’s got his mind on his money, and his money on his mind.

“Hustle Harder” is a business guide for the terminally cool, meaning few
of us could get away with this stuff. Can you be the one sober person at
every party, and elicit key information from everyone once they’re
drunk? Fiddy can. Would your takeaway on the idea of being betrayed
sound like this: “I’d rather be robbed at gunpoint than be betrayed …
there’s an undeniable rush when someone pulls out their piece”? In the
town I grew up in, Scarsdale, we’d be more likely to threaten someone
who wronged us with a lawsuit. And unlike Jackson I wouldn’t feel I was
“much stronger over all for having survived the experience.” A
complicated discussion about stakes in a business deal where Jackson and
his crew “expressed our concerns” has a threatening subtext. So this
advice is not tailor-made for all business situations, though it could
come in handy next time I have to deal with my co-op
board.

Much of the appeal of Al Roker’s breezy **YOU LOOK SO MUCH BETTER IN
PERSON: True Stories of Absurdity and Success (Hachette Go, 224 pp.,
$28)** is you get to spend time with Al Roker — and who doesn’t want
that? This book is not for the alpha guy. The “Today” show’s weatherman
is like the anti-50 Cent, and he is here to gently remind you that you
can be a little bit nerdy and antisocial (he has suggested in interviews
that he may, like his son, be on the autism spectrum) and still be a
roaring success. His career advice, called “ALtruisms” (get it?), is not
exactly earth-shatteringly original — there are chapters advising you
not to boast, whine or name-drop (what he calls “goober-smooching”), and
to work a little harder than the next guy. But they are illustrated with
great charm, and show that you don’t have to be the company chest-beater
to be the winner.

Not surprisingly, dealing with injustice and racism is a recurring
theme: Black newsmen were still pretty rare when Roker was coming up,
and there were many moments that could spark outrage. When he was still
reporting the weather in Cleveland, the evening news anchor Doug Adair
was swatted on the head by an unbalanced African-American homeless man
outside the studio. During the broadcast the next day, Adair turned to
Roker and said, “Al, I don’t know if you heard, but last night after the
11:00 news one of your people attacked me.” Before anyone could draw a
shocked breath, Roker calmly turned to him and asked, “Doug, why would a
weatherman attack you?” And that, my friends, is how you become one of
the most beloved fixtures on network
news.

Loni Love, the comedian, actor and co-host of the TV chat show “The
Real,” has a gift: She can preach without being preachy. In **I TRIED TO
CHANGE SO YOU DON’T HAVE TO: True Life Lessons (Hachette Go, 241 pp.,
$28),** Love tells her story about growing up in Detroit’s
Brewster-Douglass projects at the height of the crack epidemic. Her
formative years were every bit as harrowing as 50 Cent’s, with hunger a
constant theme and ketchup sandwiches a staple. When Love was tapped to
be a dealer’s girlfriend — an honor among her friends — she demurred.
The French-horn-playing, math-loving teenager had other ideas. She made
her money delivering groceries, then got a job on the G.M. line
glue-gunning car carpet (all the while secretly living in her car — her
mother had thrown her out to make room for her new boyfriend). With help
from an exec who saw her reading “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” — who
had himself made it out of the projects — she turned in her glue gun and
went to college. In a few years she was working as an engineer at Xerox
by day, and trying out her comedy chops on the Chitlin Circuit (the
Black L.A. comedy clubs) at night. At various points in her life she
tried to make herself what she was not: skinny, corporate, a “Black
Stepford wife.” Fortunately, none of it worked.

Much of Love’s early life was, objectively, awful, but she mines it for
comedy and life lessons, not pity. When one Christmas her mother
couldn’t afford presents for the kids, she watched as her brother’s
father (she didn’t know her own) brought him a bounty but nothing for
her. The upshot was, “I learned two important life lessons that day:
Number one: Feeling let down by someone’s bad behavior is a healthy sign
that you know your worth. And number two: If Santa shows up with a Jheri
curl, don’t let him in.”

With her maniacal work ethic, incredible nerve, practical wisdom and
huge heart, it’s no surprise that Love found love. She’s a woman whose
romantic advice we should all listen to. On vacation with a new
boyfriend, she lost her wig while swimming. He’d never seen her without
it. Not only did he tell her she looked beautiful in her cornrows, he
dived into the water to retrieve it. “Ladies, take my advice, if you
find yourself a man willing to brave an undertow to bring you back the
hair you paid good money for, he’s a keeper.” They’re still together.
