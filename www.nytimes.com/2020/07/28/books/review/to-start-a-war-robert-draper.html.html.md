**TO START A WAR**  
**How the Bush Administration Took America Into Iraq**  
By Robert Draper

In April 2003, after he had launched the invasion of Iraq, George W.
Bush stood in the Oval Office reception room and watched the televised
liberation of Basra, which serves as the country’s main port. Next to
him was Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had warned Bush about the
dangers of ousting Saddam Hussein from power. Smoke rose from the
intelligence service headquarters. The city prison had been opened.
Looters were filching desks, chairs and water tanks from state
buildings. As he looked at the pictures, Bush was perplexed. He asked,
“Why aren’t they cheering?”

In “To Start a War,” which is filled with such telling scenes, [Robert
Draper](https://www.nytimes.com/by/robert-draper) carefully examines the
Bush administration’s illusions about Iraq. Draper is a writer at large
for The New York Times Magazine and the author of [“Dead
Certain,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/review/Lewis3-t.html)
a study of the Bush administration that relied on numerous interviews
with the president himself. Draper relates that Bush, who was apparently
displeased with his depiction in “Dead Certain,” declined to be
interviewed for this book. But Bush did not seek to hinder access to his
former aides and Draper has performed prodigious research, including
conducting interviews with several hundred former national security
officials and scrutinizing recently declassified government documents.
He does not provide any bold revelations, but offers the most
comprehensive account of the administration’s road to war, underscoring
that Bush was indeed The Decider when it came to Iraq — there was never
any debate about *not* overthrowing Hussein.

The basis for conflict, Draper reminds us, had already been prepared in
the late 1990s by what might be called the military-intellectual complex
in Washington. Two key events occurred in 1998: The first was when
Congress passed, and Bill Clinton signed into law, the [Iraq Liberation
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4655),
which the Iraqi expatriate Ahmad Chalabi and his neoconservative allies
like Paul Wolfowitz had championed, and that made it official American
policy to topple Saddam Hussein. The second was the establishment by
Congress of the Rumsfeld Commission. It provided the former s[ecretary
of defense Donald
Rumsfeld](https://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/Article/571280/donald-h-rumsfeld/),
Wolfowitz and other hawks with a high-profile platform to castigate the
C.I.A. for its putative shortsightedness about the looming perils posed
by North Korea, Iran and Iraq. In particular the commission focused on a
variety of doomsday scenarios that might allow Iraq to obtain nuclear
weapons and target America “in a very short time.”

In those days, none of this seemed to matter that much. But after 9/11,
it did. Drawing on their years of warnings about threats from abroad,
Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz teamed up with Vice President Dick Cheney to push
for war and isolate the reluctant Powell.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some of Draper’s most revealing passages focus on the intense pressure
that Cheney and his chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby, as well as the
Defense Department official Douglas J. Feith, exerted on the
intelligence agencies to buttress and even concoct the case that Saddam
had intimate ties with Al Qaeda and that he possessed weapons of mass
destruction. Draper presents the former C.I.A. director [George
Tenet](https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/06/us/george-tenet-fast-facts/index.html)
in a particularly unflattering light. After being shunted aside during
the Clinton presidency, Tenet was desperate to show Bush that he was an
important and loyal soldier in the new war against terrorism. “Here we
had this precious access,” one senior analyst told Draper, “and he
didn’t want to blow it.” Tenet and his aides, Draper writes, “feared
the prospect of President Bush being spoon-fed a bouillabaisse of
truths, unverified stories presented as truths and likely falsehoods. On
the other hand, the agency stood to lose its role in helping separate
fact from fiction if it appeared to be close-minded.”

But Tenet ended up displaying canine fealty to Bush. In October 2002,
when asked by the Senate intelligence chairman Bob Graham about whether
any links between Saddam and Osama bin Laden really existed, Draper
writes, Tenet “issued a reply that Cheney, Libby, Wolfowitz and Feith
could only have dreamed of.” He declared, among other things, that there
was “solid reporting of senior level contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda
going back a decade.”

For all the effort that Cheney and others expended in trying to depict
Iraq as a dire menace, how much did the evidence and details actually
matter? The cold, hard truth is that they didn’t. They were political
Play-Doh, to be massaged and molded as Bush’s camarilla saw fit. Draper
highlights the famous “slam dunk” meeting in the Oval Office in December
2002, when Tenet assured Bush that the evidence for Colin Powell’s
upcoming speech at the United Nations Security Council in support of an
invasion was solid.

In [“Plan of
Attack,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/28/books/review/plan-of-attack-all-the-presidents-mentors.html)Bob
Woodward described Bush as being beset by doubt about the case for war,
and suggested that Tenet’s affirmation had been “very important.” Draper
disagrees. The issue wasn’t the evidence. It was the spin: “Tenet’s
words were ‘important’ only because they helped remove any doubt as to
whether the C.I.A. could mount a solid case.” Bush’s thinking was as
clear as it was simplistic. Saddam was a monster. It would be a bad idea
to leave him in power. According to Draper, Bush’s “increasingly
bellicose rhetoric reflected a wartime president who was no longer
tethered to anything other than his own convictions.”

In his 2005 Inaugural Address, Bush tried to turn neoconservative
ideology into official doctrine: “It is the policy of the United States
to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions
in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in
our world.” It wasn’t until the shellacking that the Republicans endured
in the 2006 midterm elections that Bush began to abandon his fantasies
about spreading peace, love and understanding across the Middle East. He
fired Rumsfeld and shunted Cheney to the side.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If Draper expertly dissects the ferocious turf battles that took place
within the administration over the war, he does not really seek to set
it in a wider context other than to note rather benignly that “the story
I aim to tell is very much a human narrative of patriotic men and women
who, in the wake of a nightmare, pursued that most elusive of dreams:
finding peace through war.” But there was more to it than that. Thanks
to Donald Trump’s bungling, Bush may be benefiting from a wave of
nostalgia for his presidency. But he was criminally culpable in his
naïveté and incuriosity about the costs and consequences of war. At the
same time, Cheney and Rumsfeld were inveterate schemers whose cynicism
about going to war was exceeded only by their ineptitude in conducting
it.

With American power at its apogee after the fall of the Soviet Union,
their aim was to ensure American primacy, to establish what the
Washington Post [columnist Charles
Krauthammer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/obituaries/charles-krauthammer-prominent-conservative-voice-dies-at-68.html)had
called America’s unipolar moment. Instead, they squandered the
opportunity. In the name of spreading democracy abroad, they were
willing to countenance its degradation at home. Despite the debacle in
Iraq, the very same truculent impulses continue to linger in the Trump
administration, which has been steadily pushing for regime change in
Iran. In this way, Draper provides a timely reminder of the dangers of
embarking upon wars that can imperil America itself.
