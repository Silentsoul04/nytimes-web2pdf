\textbf{Twitter} on Tuesday put limits on the account of Donald Trump
Jr. after he shared a viral video containing false medical claims about
the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the
coronavirus, violating the company's
\href{https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter}{Covid-19
misinformation policies}.

Twitter said Mr. Trump, the son of President Trump, was required to
delete the tweet with misinformation; the platform said it would also
limit his account's functionality for 12 hours. ``The tweet you
referenced was in violation of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,'' a
Twitter spokesman, Ian Plunkett, said. ``We are taking action in line
with our policy
\href{https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter}{here}.''

On Monday evening, President Trump also posted a number of tweets
linking to the same video with Covid-19 misinformation, which have since
been removed.

The video featured what appeared to be a group of doctors in white
coats, standing in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington,
D.C. The doctors made a series of misleading claims, including that
hydroxychloroquine could be taken to prevent getting the virus.

It was the most recent example of the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/technology/plandemic-movie-youtube-facebook-coronavirus.html}{misinformation
that has spread about the coronavirus}, at times shared by the president
and others in the White House. \textbf{Facebook} and \textbf{YouTube}
removed versions of the video on Monday evening. But it racked up more
than 16 million views on Facebook and was the second most engaged post
before it was taken down by the social network.
