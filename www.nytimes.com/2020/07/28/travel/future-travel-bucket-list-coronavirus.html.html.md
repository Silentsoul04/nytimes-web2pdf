# Longer, Slower, Farther: Savoring the Prospects of Future Travels

</div>

In the travel lull induced by the pandemic, many people are planning
ambitious, once-in-a-lifetime trips. Optimists are targeting 2021. For
others, their next big trip will be in 2022.

Beth Warren, a middle school history teacher in Lookout Mountain, Ga.,
had been looking forward to a much-anticipated trip this summer to
Egypt, a country she vowed to show her husband and friends after her
first visit several years ago. She was deep into organizing the trip
with [High End Journeys](https://www.highendjourneys.com/) when the
pandemic struck, and has since shifted the visit to summer 2022, in part
to make sure the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza is open.

“2022 sounds really far away,” she said. “But once I saw Egypt, I
couldn’t get enough of it.”

People have always planned big trips months or even a year ahead of
time, but now many are extending that timeline even further. In the
travel stasis induced by the pandemic, future travelers have taken to
tackling their bucket lists with big trips that are more distant and
longer than usual — and planned further in advance. Optimists are
targeting 2021. For others, their next big trip will be in 2022.

Before the pandemic, according to the American Society of Travel
Advisors, most travelers booked trips six months or more in advance, on
average, and longer for elaborate honeymoons or very special events like
the solar eclipse passing over South America in December. Some travel
companies say longer term bookings have recently rebounded.
For<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>instance, [Red
Savannah](https://www.redsavannah.com/), a British luxury travel agency
that organizes custom trips,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>says it is up 160 percent over bookings this time last year.

These days, even spontaneous types have more time to think about where
they want to go and put a plan in place.

“I’m trying to go big with my trips,” said Rayme Gorniak of Chicago, who
is currently laid off from his work managing fitness studio franchises.

Anything short and normally easy to plan might bring disappointment as
the pandemic continues, he reasoned, but a far-horizon destination —
he’s considering Jordan for June 2021 — offers hope. The trip also
represents a personal conquest for Mr. Gorniak, who is gay and worried
about the persecution of L.G.B.T. people in some Muslim countries.

“Jordan’s been on my radar because of the rich history, and off it
because of the potential risk I would have,” he said. “But I’ve been
doing research on Amman and seeing, as strict religious standards go,
it’s a little bit more lax on tradition,” he said.

For Lori Goldenthal of Wellesley, Mass., changing plans meant changing
the destination. She had originally planned a trip in and around Vietnam
for her husband’s upcoming 60th birthday. But after the pandemic hit,
she worked with the agency [Extraordinary
Journeys](https://extraordinaryjourneys.com/) to book a two-week trip to
Namibia for 2021.

“Namibia was on my bucket list and it seemed like a better idea than
going to all these big cities in Asia,” she said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“I believe we will go, but who knows,” she added, noting generous
cancellation policies that made her more comfortable booking the trip.
“Having something to look forward to is fantastic.”

Other forward-looking travelers are simply picking up a year later.

After months of reading about the climate and culture of Greenland, Jill
Hrubecky, a structural engineer based in Brooklyn, was excited for a
cruise she had planned there in August with her mother and an aunt and
uncle. Working with their agency, Huckleberry Travel, they rebooked the
cruise for summer 2021 only after learning that the cancellation policy
is flexible.

“I will not make any nonrefundable, permanent plans for the next couple
of years,” she said. “But I’m an optimist. Half the fun of traveling is
planning and getting
excited.”

There are psychological benefits to planning activities in the future,
especially travel, according to Shevaun Neupert, a professor of
psychology at North Carolina State University. Future-oriented thinking
is equated with proactive coping, a means of reducing stress through
detailed planning, such as learning which flights to book to avoid
layovers, and gathering the resources — including time and money — to
make it happen.

“Being able to think about and imagine something positive in the future
has benefits in the present,” she said.

The pandemic, too, may have shown travelers that what they thought they
could always do — namely, see the world — isn’t such a certainty.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Maybe they thought it would always be available, which was previously
true. Now we’ve experienced restrictions and realize, oh, I need to make
this happen,” she added.

Advance planning is also a practical way to turn vague desires into
concrete plans. The travel adviser network Virtuoso offers a program
called [Virtuoso
Wanderlist](https://www.virtuoso.com/wanderlist/#/sign-in), an online
survey that friends or family seeking to travel together take
individually. (Since the pandemic, Virtuoso has made the online planning
tool free.)

The program asks where they want to go, their interests and the kinds of
activities they prefer. It then compares the results of those surveyed
to identify mutual preferences and priorities that a travel adviser will
analyze and, in consultation with the clients, come up with a five-year
plan of tackling the bucket list.

Jim Bendt, the managing director of Virtuoso Wanderlist, equates travel
planning with financial planning in the sense that both seek to maximize
precious resources. In the case of travel, the currency is time.

“It turns a bucket list into a

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your

Theirs started with Vietnam and Cambodia last year. This fall, it was to
be a small ship cruise in Greece, which has been postponed a year
because of the virus. The pandemic, she said, reshuffled their
priorities, pushing Tanzania — originally planned for 2021 — farther
out, pending a coronavirus vaccine, and moving Alaska up in its place.

“Having a plan takes it from dreaming and conjecturing to actually
having things committed on paper, always with adjustments,” she said.
“We’ve moved the chess pieces around.”

In addition to compounding their wanderlust, many travelers and planners
say the pandemic has revealed travel’s environmental impact and are
planning more mindfully.

“Our current situation has made me even more committed to focusing
exclusively on sustainability going forward,” wrote Rose O’Connor, a
travel adviser in Granite Bay, Calif., in an email.

“On one hand, we have seen how tourism can be vital to conservation
efforts in certain destinations,” she wrote, noting the uptick in
poaching in Africa in the absence of tourism revenue. On the other hand,
she added, traveling from a hot spot like the United States particularly
to remote or developing countries “is an ethical issue.”

Jeremy Bassetti, a professor of humanities at Valencia College in
Orlando, Fla., has a sabbatical coming up in fall 2021 and plans to use
miles to get to China and then travel overland to Tibet, Nepal and India
for several months. While big trips often accompany sabbaticals, Mr.
Bassetti has rethought his to “travel longer, farther and more slowly in
2021,” he said.

“Why wouldn’t we want to travel more to connect more when our
assumptions about being free to travel wherever we want is disappearing
before our eyes?” he added. “If you want to experience new cultures, you
can’t do it very quickly.”

For others, 2022 presents the possibility of traveling in a time when
the virus may be contained and spontaneity can resume.

High school freshmen Scout Dingman, of Miami, and Sophie Brandimarte, of
Glen Head, N.Y., had been collaborating on a 2021 trip to Europe, making
plans for their families to join. They have marked up maps and are
keeping a Google Doc of destinations where they might branch out to from
Hamburg, where they plan to visit a friend, though they are keeping
their plans loose.

Because of the uncertainly of the virus, and the possibility of having
to cancel and risk deposits, they are delaying the trip to summer 2022
while maintaining their optimism.

“We thought if we pushed it back, then we wouldn’t be disappointed,” Ms.
Dingman said.

“We have to think of safety measures now,” Ms. Brandimarte added. “But
in terms of the actual trip, we really want to keep on the bright side
and not have to worry about that, too.”
