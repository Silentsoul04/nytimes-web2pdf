<div class="css-53u6y8">

Attorney General William P. Barr vigorously defended the federal
response to nationwide protests and civil unrest in a combative
congressional hearing on Tuesday where Democrats accused him and other
Trump administration officials of suppressing protesters’ rights in an
overly violent crackdown.

The attorney general also insisted that he intervened in the criminal
cases of President Trump’s allies Roger J. Stone Jr. and Michael T.
Flynn to uphold the rule of law, not to do Mr. Trump’s bidding.

Mr. Barr’s defenses punctuated an outright hostile election-season
oversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. Democrats tried
to portray him as a dangerous errand boy for the president. But Mr. Barr
insisted he was trying to enforce the law against what he characterized
as rioters using demonstrations as cover to commit crimes. He also said
of the criminal cases that grew out of the Russia investigation that he
wanted to be fair to Mr. Trump’s former advisers.

“The president’s friends don’t deserve special breaks, but they also
don’t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people,” he said.
“And sometimes that’s a difficult decision to make, especially when
you know you’re going to be castigated for it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The five-hour hearing, Mr. Barr’s first on Capitol Hill in more than a
year, grew increasingly heated as Democrats spoke over his attempts to
respond to their accusations. At one point, the attorney general
exclaimed, “I’m going to answer the damn question.”

Democrats were clearly angered as Mr. Barr quibbled over small details
or ignored questions about his rationale or actions. But amid frequent
sniping, lawmakers came away with few, if any, new facts or admissions.

Democrats have sought to hold Mr. Barr to account since he presented a
summary last year of the then-secret findings of the special counsel,
Robert S. Mueller III, that a federal judge later said was “distorted”
and “misleading” in a way that torqued public understanding of its
findings in Mr. Trump’s favor.

But Mr. Barr — who did not testify before the House Judiciary Committee
when he was attorney general the first time, under President George Bush
— had repeatedly put off requests to appear before the committee, saying
he was too busy. In the meantime, lawmakers accumulated a long list of
additional grievances that they aired on Tuesday.

“You have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president,”
Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the committee chairman, said
at the start of the hearing to Mr. Barr, who sat impassively.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Democrats charged that Mr. Barr had intervened improperly in the Stone
and Flynn cases to please Mr. Trump. They accused him of helping the
president promulgate bogus fears about voter fraud to help shake
confidence in November’s election. And they warned that under Mr. Barr’s
leadership, the Justice Department was trampling on the civil liberties
of citizens like those demanding that the nation eradicate
institutionalized racism against Black
Americans.

“The president wants footage for his campaign ads, and you appear to be
serving it up to him as ordered,” Mr. Nadler said. “You are projecting
fear and violence nationwide in pursuit of obvious political objectives.
Shame on you, Mr. Barr.”

The attorney general denied the charges, arguing at first calmly and
then more irritably that federal agents confronting protesters were not
trying to quash peaceful expressions of free speech, but to deal with
“mob” violence.

“Rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak
senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims,” he said.

In particular, he defended the deployment of federal agents in Portland,
Ore., accusing the local police of essentially abandoning a federal
courthouse as rioters and vandals “laid siege” to it, threatening the
functioning of the court system.

“What unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called
protests,” Mr. Barr said. “It is by any objective measure an assault on
the government of the United States.”

Local officials [have accused federal agents of being heavy-handed and
said](https://www.nytimes.com/article/portland-protests-explained-protesters.html)
their presence reinvigorated tensions that had been subsiding.

Mr. Barr likewise defended the federal response to protests last month
at Lafayette Square outside the White House, where law enforcement used
pepper balls and smoke bombs to clear the area before [Mr. Trump walked
through to take a
photograph](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html)
in front of a nearby church. Mr. Barr said officials had reached a
“consensus” that a protective perimeter outside the White House had to
be extended because they wanted to prevent the vandalism of previous
nights.

“Do you think the response at Lafayette Square to tear gas, pepper spray
and beat protesters and injure American citizens who were just simply
exercising their First Amendment rights was appropriate?” asked
Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington.

Mr. Barr responded that “no tear gas was used” on the protesters but did
not address the substance of the question. The United States Park Police
has
[confirmed](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/uspp/6_2_20_statement_from_acting_chief_monahan.htm)
“the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls.”

The Justice Department’s independent inspector general is investigating
the actions of federal agents during the episode.

Asked about the pleas for racial justice informing many of the protests,
Mr. Barr said, “I don’t agree that there is systemic racism in police
departments generally in this country,” and he quoted statistics that
more white Americans had been killed by the police than Black Americans.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Critics have called those figures misleading because they do not account
for relative population differences; a Black person is more likely to be
killed than a white person.

Republicans backed the attorney general for showing “courage” by taking
aim at the Russia investigation and attacks on the police.

Their most visceral defense came in a five-minute [video
montage](https://twitter.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1288140402101555201)
that appeared to show protesters or people infiltrating their ranks
turning to violence. It began with footage of cable news anchors
describing the protests as “peaceful” before streaming through scenes
like a police precinct being set ablaze in Minneapolis, American flags
burning, cans being hurled at the police and stores being looted.

“I want to thank you for defending law enforcement, for pointing out
what a crazy idea this defund-the-police policy, whatever you want to
call it, is, and standing up for the rule of law,” Representative Jim
Jordan of Ohio, the panel’s top Republican, told Mr. Barr before playing
the video.

Republicans cheered on Mr. Barr as he defended his decision to overrule
career prosecutors in the Stone case, saying that they were trying to
treat Mr. Stone more harshly than other defendants. The Judiciary
Committee [heard testimony from one of the prosecutors last
month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/roger-stone-sentencing-politicized.html)
who accused department leaders of changing the sentencing recommendation
for “political reasons.”

“The line prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was
more than twice what anyone else in a similar position had ever served,”
Mr. Barr said. “This is a 67-year-old man, first-time offender, no
violence, and they were trying to put him in jail for seven to nine
years. I was not going to advocate that. Because that is not the rule of
law.”

But the prosecutors said in court that they arrived at the
seven-to-nine-year recommendation by following the Justice Department’s
own sentencing guidelines, as is customary in any federal criminal case.
Questioned by the federal judge who oversaw the Stone case, department
officials acknowledged that it was the policy of the United States
attorney’s office in Washington to seek the harshest possible sentence
under the sentencing guidelines and to let the judge decide whether it
was warranted.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, later asked Mr. Barr
repeatedly if he would point to any other case where the department had
failed to recommended a punishment in line with the guidelines set out
for a defendant like Mr. Stone, who had threatened a witness.

Mr. Barr did not answer directly, insisting that “the judge agreed with
me” because she gave Mr. Stone a lighter sentence than the prosecution
team had recommended before he overruled them. Mr. Trump [commuted Mr.
Stone’s
sentence](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html)
this month.

Asked about the criminal prosecutor, John H. Durham, reviewing the
Russia investigation, Mr. Barr declined to commit to waiting until after
the general election in November to release any report that Mr. Durham
produced. Mr. Barr repeated his view that Justice Department policy
against taking actions that could affect elections should apply to Mr.
Durham’s
work.

Democrats also pressed Mr. Barr to justify his repeated warnings about
the risk of increased mail-in balloting in the upcoming election because
of the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
After Mr. Trump attacked such efforts and claimed that mail-in ballots
would be used for fraud to rig the election against him — even though he
himself has voted by mail — Mr. Barr suggested without evidence,
including in interviews with [The New York
Times](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.nytimes.com_2020_06_01_magazine_william-2Dbarr-2Dattorney-2Dgeneral.html&d=DwMFaQ&c=jGUuvAdBXp_VqQ6t0yah2g&r=bVVNPs8-wzWySU1LPjQH-giyvd3jgwNM5mI4gec0ZVgkgSksNhhps0rPEeN63Yaq&m=Wj_rdThk_pA73T0byJFaMQwQ5zUDujOvP2xsA8g0eD0&s=QDYgELfVpfZGzQjB_QxaqbPpm_pO8hwJpUsg1kpaEgg&e=)
and [Fox
News](https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/exclusive-maria-bartiromo-interviews-ag-barr-on-police-reform-big-tech-censorship-durham-investigation),
that there was a serious risk of foreign countries mass-counterfeiting
ballots.

Experts say that a foreign-sponsored plot to systematically [tamper with
ballots is nearly
impossible](https://www.nytimes.com/article/mail-in-vote-fraud-ballot.html)
because of how they are printed and tracked. Many states have conducted
elections by mail for years without any major security problems or
widespread fraud.

Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana, asked Mr. Barr
whether he believed the presidential election would be rigged. The
attorney general said he had no reason to think it would be, but then
added, “If you have wholesale mail-in voting, it substantially increases
the risk of fraud.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For all the grab-bag of policy issues raised by the questioning, the
exchanges proved to be more heated than illuminating. At one point, Mr.
Jordan — who is known for his bombastic style of questioning witnesses —
complained that Democrats were talking over Mr. Barr.

“For months you have tried to get the attorney general to come,” Mr.
Jordan interjected. “He is here. Why don’t you let him speak?”

“Rudeness? Rudeness? Rudeness?” Mr. Jordan shot back. “Time after time,
you refuse to let the attorney general answer the questions posed to
him.”
