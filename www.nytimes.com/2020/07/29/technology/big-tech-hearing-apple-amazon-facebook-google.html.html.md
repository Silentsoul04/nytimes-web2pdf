<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — The chief executives of [Amazon, Apple, Google and
Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/the-daily/congress-facebook-amazon-google-apple.html),
four tech giants worth nearly $5 trillion combined, [faced withering
questions](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony)from
Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike on Wednesday for the tactics
and market dominance that had made their enterprises successful.

For more than five hours, the 15 members of an antitrust panel in the
House lobbed questions and repeatedly interrupted and talked over Jeff
Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and
Sundar Pichai of Google.

It was the first congressional hearing for some time where Democrats and
Republicans acted as if they had a common foe, though for different
reasons. Democratic lawmakers criticized the tech companies for buying
start-ups to stifle them and for unfairly using their data hoards to
clone and kill off competitors, while Republicans questioned whether the
platforms had muzzled conservative viewpoints and were unpatriotic.

“As gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power
to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and enrich
themselves while choking off competitors,” said Representative David
Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee’s antitrust subcommittee. “Our founders would not bow before a
king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In response, Mr. Pichai, Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Cook and Mr. Bezos, who
testified via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic, were
forced to strike a more humble chord. They presented themselves as
participants in enormously competitive and fast-changing digital
marketplaces, and they evaded questions about the decisions that turned
their companies into giants.

“We approach this process with respect and humility, but we make no
concession on the facts,” said Mr. Cook at the outset of his testimony.

Not since [Microsoft stood trial in the
late 1990s](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/business/microsoft-rests-its-case-ending-on-a-misstep.html)
for antitrust charges have tech chief executives been under such a
microscope for the power of their businesses. With echoes of the
trustbusting of U.S. Steel and Standard Oil more than a century ago and
AT\&T in 1984, the hearing underlined the government’s recognition that
this cohort of tech companies — which wield immense control over
commerce, communications and public discourse — had become the new
trusts of the internet age.

President Trump also used the event to rail against tech power. In a
[post on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1288506554585505793)
before the hearing began, he said that he would issue executive orders
to rein in the companies if Congress did not.

From its conception, the House antitrust hearing was set to be a
spectacle, lining up four of the world’s most powerful executives — with
two of them among the planet’s richest individuals — to answer largely
hostile questions together. While the joint appearance limited sustained
questioning of any one executive, it created a side-by-side image that
recalled the [1994
congressional](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/us/tobacco-chiefs-say-cigarettes-aren-t-addictive.html)hearing
of top American tobacco executives, who said they did not believe that
cigarettes were addictive.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

House lawmakers, who had opened an investigation into the tech companies
in June 2019, made the most of it. Representative Jerry Nadler, Democrat
of New York, confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with the C.E.O.’s own emails,
saying they showed a plot to take out a young competitor. Representative
Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said Google was biased and asked Mr.
Pichai whether the company would change its products to help elect
Joseph R. Biden for president.

In one of the sharpest exchanges, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a
Washington Democrat, confronted Mr. Bezos on accusations that an Amazon
lawyer had lied to the committee about how the company develops its own
products. She asked him to answer whether it misused data with a yes or
no.

“I can’t answer that question yes or no,” said Mr. Bezos, appearing
rattled.

Yet while the hearing was ripe with theater, any impact will be limited
by antitrust laws that were created a century ago and that are
[imperfect for corralling internet
firms](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html).
Since the 1980s, enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer
welfare as the predominant test for antitrust violations — generally
meaning that if prices are not going up, the markets are most likely
competitive enough. The tech giants have generally not driven up prices
of digital services or consumer goods; many do not charge at all for
services like Google Maps or Instagram.

While Democrats at the hearing indicated they were more inclined to
change antitrust law, Representative Jim **** Sensenbrenner, Republican
of Wisconsin, said he did not think the laws needed to change. ****
Ultimately, Congress doesn’t have the power to break up the companies.

Still, the proceedings provided fuel to other investigations of the tech
companies by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and
state attorneys general. The Justice Department is expected to [soon
announce charges against
Google](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/technology/barr-google-investigation.html)accusing
it of abusing its dominance in online advertising, people with knowledge
of the investigation have said. The [F.T.C. is preparing to question Mr.
Zuckerberg](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/ftc-facebook-investigation.html)
under oath in its investigation of Facebook’s grip over social
networking and acquisitions of nascent rivals.

“This is a critical juncture in how the Washington policy clash with the
titans of Silicon Valley unfolds,” said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice
Department antitrust official and a special adviser to the consumer
advocacy group Public Knowledge.

Regulators around the world are also moving to limit the power of the
tech giants. Europe has led the charge with antitrust investigations and
Margrethe Vestager, the region’s top trustbuster, [recently vowed to
take a harder
line](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/tech-regulator-europe.html)
on the companies. On Wednesday, [Turkey passed
legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/europe/turkey-social-media-control.html)
giving its government sweeping new powers to regulate social media
content.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The hearing on Wednesday was a turnabout from just a few years ago, when
Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple were emblems of national pride for
their innovation and growth. But the expanding reach of the four — which
are involved in everything from smartphones to e-commerce to digital
payments — and their stumbles
in[misinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/virus-video-trump.html),
privacy, [election
interference](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html)
and labor issues have increasingly raised hackles.

Even so, the companies have continued growing as more people live their
lives online, with all of them expected to post solid financial
performances when they report quarterly earnings on Thursday.

The hearing was made more bizarre by Mr. Bezos, Mr. Cook, Mr. Pichai and
Mr. Zuckerberg dialing in remotely using Cisco’s Webex videoconferencing
service. Lawmakers — who mostly appeared in person wearing masks in a
House hearing room — faced empty chairs and a jumbo screen with the
faces of the executives, who looked soberly into their cameras.

Lawmakers nonetheless drilled down on key moments when the companies had
gained power or allegedly squeezed consumers, competitors and small
businesses. They directed most of their questions to Mr. Zuckerberg and
Mr. Pichai, then to Mr. Bezos, according to[a
tally](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony/heres-which-tech-ceo-is-getting-asked-the-most-questions-by-lawmakers)
by The New York Times. Mr. Cook was asked the fewest questions.

The tone of the hearing was set with Mr. Cicilline’s very first
question, directed at Mr. Pichai. “Why does Google steal content from
honest businesses?” Mr. Cicilline asked. Mr. Pichai replied: “Mr.
Chairman, with respect, I disagree with that characterization.”

Mr. Pichai was repeatedly asked about Google’s dominance in search and
how the company was potentially trying to keep users within “a walled
garden.” He said Google had many competitors for specific categories of
search, such as shopping.

Mr. Zuckerberg was asked about Facebook emails where executives
discussed the company’s 2012 acquisition of Instagram as a possible
strategy to take out a nascent competitor. Mr. Zuckerberg said that, in
fact, Instagram’s success had never been guaranteed and was the result
of Facebook’s investment in the product.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When lawmakers asked Mr. Bezos if Amazon had bullied small merchants, he
said that it was “not how we operate the business” — before being
confronted by an audio recording of a bookseller begging him directly
for relief.

In response to questions about whether Apple favored some app developers
over others, Mr. Cook said there were “open and transparent rules” that
applied “evenly to everyone.”

David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a
project-management company that has battled with both Google and Apple
over their market power, said the hearing would be irrelevant if the
government did not act to rein in the tech giants.

“What we ultimately need is relief. We don’t just need a historic
moment. We need this to lead to legislation and regulation and
enforcement,” he said.

But, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson added, “thankfully I’ve never been more
optimistic for that than I am right
now.”

#### A grilling on the power of digital giants in the internet age.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: The C.E.O.s of the nation’s most influential technology
    companies — Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook — are brought before
    Congress to answer a question. Are they the too powerful and too
    dominant monopolies of the internet age? My colleague, Cecilia Kang,
    was in the room.
    
    It’s Thursday, July 30.
    
    Cecilia, we are talking just ahead of the start of what is probably
    the most anticipated hearing in the history of the tech industry.
    So, just to begin, why is this hearing happening at all?

  - cecilia kang  
    This hearing is happening because there is a recognition across
    government that these four very powerful and very important
    companies to the economy have become so dominant that they are
    harming consumers and harming competition.
    
    So Congress has summoned the C.E.O.s of the corporations — Jeff
    Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and
    Sundar Pichai of Google — to ask them and interrogate them on their
    business practices, and find out if these internet giants that have
    become, in many ways, the new trusts of our economy, if they are
    harming consumers and competition.

  - michael barbaro  
    So how exactly did we get to this point where these four executives
    are being summoned before Congress and being forced to confront that
    question?

  - cecilia kang  
    I think you can start with the 2016 presidential election. That
    really was a wake up call in Washington and across the world,
    really, about the power of these social media platforms to be used
    for harm, not just for entertainment and good. The presidential
    election of 2020 in the United States then really picked up on this
    feeling of concern.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    I’m deeply concerned right now that the space around companies like
    Amazon, Facebook, Google, is now referred to by venture capitalists
    as the “kill zone.”

cecilia kang

And we saw for the first time a political candidate, Elizabeth Warren,
announced her promise to break up big tech.

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive
    robust market in America. That’s how capitalism should work.

cecilia kang

This was the first time that even the real term “big tech” became sort
of part of our lexicon.

michael barbaro

Right, and almost like a kind of epithet.

cecilia kang

Absolutely.

  - archived recording  
    You have criticized a lot of big banks. Today, you’re talking about
    breaking up big tech. Why?

  - archived recording (elizabeth warren)  
    So here’s the deal. We need real competition in this field. And
    there’s a problem.

cecilia kang

And there was a domino effect after that.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    So I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook —

cecilia kang

Donald Trump —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    — they’re really treading on very, very troubled territory. And they
    have to be careful. It’s not fair to large portions of the
    population.

  - archived recording (hillary clinton)  
    I’m also really disappointed in a lot of the tech companies.

cecilia kang

— Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders —

  - archived recording (bernie sanders)  
    I think we need vigorous antitrust legislation in this country.

cecilia kang

— all articulated similar concerns about big tech.

  - archived recording (bernie sanders)  
    They have incredible power over the economy, over the political life
    of this country in a very dangerous sense.

cecilia kang

Soon after, the ground moved underneath the technology companies in
Washington. In the span of one week in June 2019, the Department of
Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys generals all
announced that they had opened investigations into the biggest
technology companies. It was unprecedented. These companies have not
been investigated, except for Google, on antitrust grounds before in the
United States. And beyond that, it was a real recognition to put these
four companies into a cohort.

michael barbaro

I wonder if you can briefly walk us through how each of these companies’
behavior has gotten them to this point, into this hearing room. Because
these four companies are all big and they’re all tech, but they’re
actually all pretty different, right? So what exactly has each done that
people during this hearing are going to be confronting them about?

cecilia kang

So, in the case of Amazon, the accusation is that it is both a retailer
and it is a platform for third-party sellers — in other words, another
small business that might sell, let’s say, a face mask or tissue paper —
that will sell their goods on Amazon. And the accusation is that Amazon
abuses its position and its clout to make sure that their own products
will always perform better than these third parties. And they also use
the data and the intelligence they have to suppress and to charge these
third-party sellers more.

In the case of Apple, the accusation is that it unfairly uses its clout
over the App Store. The App Store is huge. It has more than a million
apps on it. And it uses its power over the platform to block rivals and
to force the apps that are on the App Store to pay high commissions.

In the case of Facebook, the accusation is that it is a monopoly in
social networking and that it has acquired rivals like Instagram and
WhatsApp to maintain its monopoly. And in the process, really killed off
competition on the internet.

In the case of Google, the accusation is that it uses its dominant
position in search and online advertising, and in the Android smartphone
market, to crush rivals and to continue to maintain its dominance in all
of those marketplaces.

michael barbaro

So the common theme here is size, dominance and basically, monopolistic
conduct.

cecilia kang

Yeah, and I would say that they are different companies, and they do
have different business models. But the one thing I would say they have
in common is that they are gatekeepers. They are actually the
chokepoints on the internet, because they control commerce, and they
control communications, and they control the discovery of information on
the internet. These are sort of unprecedented in their scope. And
they’re global. Everyone around the world uses them.

michael barbaro

So, listening to you talk about this hearing — the stakes of it, the
questions around influence and conduct — I am inevitably reminded of —

  - archived recording  
    I’d like to ask our guests to please take your seats.

michael barbaro

— what was probably the most famous congressional hearing of my
lifetime, which was the tobacco industry hearings of 1994.

  - archived recording  
    For the first time ever, the chief executive officers of our
    nation’s tobacco companies are testifying together before the
    United States Congress.

michael barbaro

And of course, tobacco, smoking, health are different than technology.
But it was a moment when the top executives of billion dollar companies,
and very powerful companies in the economy —

  - archived recording  
    The truth is that cigarettes are the single most dangerous consumer
    product ever sold.

michael barbaro

— were summoned before Congress and really held to account in a highly
public way.

cecilia kang

I similarly see the comparison to the tobacco hearings. I mean, this is
the moment when you have the heads, the captains of the biggest
companies in technology, just like we saw the heads, the captains of the
biggest companies of the tobacco industry, have to come before Congress
—

  - archived recording  
    If you raise your right hand.

cecilia kang

— stand up —

  - archived recording  
    Do you swear —

cecilia kang

— raise their right hand, swear in —

  - archived recording  
    — the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

cecilia kang

— and really defend themselves as companies that are potentially harmful
to society.

michael barbaro

Hm.

  - archived recording (congressman)  
    First, I’d like to just go down the row. Yes or no, do you believe
    nicotine is not addictive?

  - archived recording (executive 1)  
    I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.

  - archived recording (congressman)  
    Mr. Johnston.

  - archived recording (executive 2)  
    Uh, Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the
    classic definitions of addiction. There is no intoxication.

  - archived recording (congressman)  
    We’ll take that as a no, and again —

cecilia kang

The moment of reckoning is similar for the tech industry in the way that
that was a moment of reckoning for the tobacco industry.

michael barbaro

And of course, in that case, those tobacco hearings, they were the
beginning of very serious changes in how the United States regulated
tobacco companies. There were big reforms. There were big fines. It was
a turning point. And if this hearing ends up feeling like a turning
point for the technology industry, I wonder what the basis for whatever
regulation flows from this would be.

cecilia kang

The hearing is going to be a real test of whether antitrust laws and
competition laws that were first created in 1890 can actually apply to
internet companies, where the companies of Silicon Valley are just so
different than rail, sugar, steel — the trusts that, at that time, were
the inspiration for trust busters like Theodore Roosevelt and others
that were trying to contain the power of the big industrialists at that
time. So a lot of the conventional tests that have been used on whether
a company has violated antitrust laws may not apply.

And one of the biggest tests is this test known as the consumer welfare
test. This is a standard that’s been used for about 40 years now and
very much permeates antitrust thinking in this country. And that
question is, are consumers harmed? It’s really hard to prove harm with a
company like Google or Facebook, when they can say, well, at the end of
the day, our products are free. And at the end of the day, if you don’t
like us, we’re one click away from an alternative.

michael barbaro

Mm. Well, this is going to be an interesting hearing.

We’ll be right back.

  - cecilia kang  
    Hi, this is Cecilia Kang. It is noon. I am in the House Judiciary
    Committee’s hearing room in the Rayburn Building. Right now, we have
    some lawmakers, and many of their aides are shuffling in, all with
    their face masks on. And there is, in the middle of the room, which
    would normally be about five rows of chairs very tightly packed
    together, they’re all spread apart, about six feet each. It’s an odd
    scene.
    
    There’s a lot of cleansing of desks and microphones. We have right
    now a cleanup crew coming in with their gloves and face masks,
    cleaning off the microphones with some alcohol, and everybody being
    handed Purell and hand wipes. So that’s the scene a few minutes
    before we begin.

  - archived recording  
    The subcommittee will come to order.

michael barbaro

So Cecilia, tell us how this hearing starts on Wednesday.

cecilia kang

So the hearing started just a little bit late, about one hour late. And
the lawmakers, 15 of them, looked towards the back of the room at a big
jumbotron type screen from their dais. And they saw the faces of the
C.E.O.s streamed from the homes and offices of Silicon Valley and
presumably Seattle with Jeff Bezos. And —

  - archived recording  
    Will you please unmute your microphones and raise your right hands?
    Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony
    you ought to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge?

cecilia kang

— after Chairman Cicilline gavels in the hearing, he begins to ask the
C.E.O.s to introduce themselves.

michael barbaro

And Cecilia, I found these introductions, these five-minute kind of
testimonials, surprisingly personal.

cecilia kang

I think the C.E.O.s really wanted to accomplish a lot in these opening
remarks.

  - archived recording (jeff bezos)  
    Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and
    members of the subcommittee. I was born into great wealth, not
    monetary wealth, but it is said the wealth of a loving family.

cecilia kang

You heard Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai in particular really emphasize
their humble roots.

  - archived recording (jeff bezos)  
    My mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school
    student in Albuquerque. Being pregnant in high school was not
    popular.

  - archived recording (sundar pichai)  
    I didn’t have much access to a computer growing up in India. So you
    can imagine my amazement when I arrived in the U.S. for graduate
    school and saw an entire lab of computers to use whenever I wanted.

cecilia kang

They are known as the richest individuals in the world, and that’s
certainly the case with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. And I think they
wanted to be more relatable. Each of these companies wanted to start
off, right off the bat, by explaining how they were scrappy for so long,
and they continue to have that scrappy spirit. And then, in some cases,
they aren’t monopolies.

  - archived recording (mark zuckerburg)  
    Many of our competitors have hundreds of millions or billions of
    users. Some are upstarts, but others are gatekeepers with the power
    to decide if we can even release our apps in their app stores to
    compete with them.

cecilia kang

And that, in fact, there’s competition all over the world.

  - archived recording (mark zuckerburg)  
    And history shows that if we don’t keep innovating, someone will
    replace every company here today. And that change can often happen
    faster than you expect.

cecilia kang

So they wanted to set a line early on to just dispel the notion that
there is a big tech kind of threat right now in our economy, and that
they, as individual companies, are part of a very vibrant, competitive
marketplace that’s changing very quickly.

michael barbaro

So then we get to the questions from lawmakers to these four C.E.O.s.
And what do you think characterize those questions overall?

cecilia kang

Well, it was fascinating, Michael. The Democrats and Republicans were
very much split in their approaches.

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    So my first question, Mr. Pichai, is why does Google steal content
    from honest businesses?

cecilia kang

Right off the bat, the Democrats launched into very specific questions
about antitrust, and the antitrust cases against each of these
companies.

  - archived recording (sundar pichai)  
    Mr. Chairman, with respect, I disagree with that characterization.

cecilia kang

They really used this opportunity to show off the most damning evidence
that they had collected over 13 months, the hundreds of hours of
interviews that they’ve held with employees and rivals.

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    Conservatives are consumers, too.

cecilia kang

The Republicans were very coordinated as well on one particular message.

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    Censorship of conservative viewpoints —

cecilia kang

They believe that tech companies represented are so powerful that
they’re censoring public discourse. They’re censoring speech.

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    You know, I’m concerned that the people who manage the net — and the
    four of you manage a big part of the net — and are ending up using
    this as a political screen.

michael barbaro

I was wondering throughout that line of questioning, Cecilia, is there a
case that the Republicans focusing on this idea of conservative bias
kind of is related to anti-trust — that ultimately, these companies have
a monopoly on the market of ideas? Or, is this really just Republicans
using this opportunity, this face time with these executives, to focus
on political grievances, and kind of ignoring the intention of this
hearing?

cecilia kang

I do think that there’s a sincere belief that antitrust is related to
their concerns about censorship. Because they believe that the companies
have become so powerful, the social media companies, and that they have,
right now, the biggest marketplace of ideas and the biggest exchanges of
information. And so they see the problem of censorship as a symptom of
companies that are too big and powerful.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm, that’s interesting. But we didn’t really see much Republican
focus on the more traditional idea of antitrust, meaning a business has
gotten so big that it’s hurting kind of all consumers, and it’s
anti-competitive to other businesses. Is that an indication that the
Republicans are less concerned about big tech as an economic threat than
Democrats are?

cecilia kang

Yeah, I was surprised actually by how little the Republican side went
into the specific debates on antitrust around these companies. And you
did hear, for example, James Sensenbrenner, who is the ranking member of
the antitrust subcommittee, say that —

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    I think the law’s good.

cecilia kang

— actually, right now, the market should work itself out.

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    And we don’t need to throw it all in the wastebasket.

cecilia kang

And that things are OK right now. The laws do not need to change.

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    Let me ask Mr. Bezos. You know, say you are required to spin stuff
    off so you might have no more of a one-stop shop. How are the
    consumers helped by that?

cecilia kang

And said that this test — the consumer welfare standard, this test that
whether prices go up and if there are fewer options for consumers — that
should remain the big test for even big tech and these tech companies.

  - archived recording (jeff bezos)  
    Sir, thank you. They would not be.

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    Right.

  - archived recording (jeff bezos)  
    Very clear.

michael barbaro

Right, he said the laws don’t need to change —

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    — of enforcement of those anti-trust laws —

michael barbaro

— but that enforcement does.

cecilia kang

Indeed. He said that enforcement is appropriate. The laws just simply
don’t need to change. And also, we should be careful, he said. In his
words, he said, being big —

  - archived recording (james sensenbrenner)  
    Being big is not inherently bad.

cecilia kang

— doesn’t inherently mean that you’re bad.

michael barbaro

OK, so let’s talk about the most memorable exchanges involving each
company when the focus was on the more traditional aspects of antitrust
and the evidence that had been dug up in the course of this
investigation. Did they focus these lines of questioning on what you had
predicted? For example, Facebook, you had said, was going to be asked
about its tendency to buy up competitors. Is that what happened?

cecilia kang

I definitely expected the issue of buying up competitors to come up.
What I did not expect is the level of specificity that was included in
the line of questioning.

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    And thank you, John. I now recognize the distinguished chair of the
    full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler from New York.

cecilia kang

I was really surprised, for example, that Jerry Nadler —

  - archived recording (jerry nadler)  
    Mr. Zuckerberg, I want to thank you for providing this information
    during our investigation.

cecilia kang

— brought up and read directly from emails from the top executives at
Facebook during the time when they wanted to purchase Instagram.

  - archived recording (jerry nadler)  
    However, the documents you provided tell a very disturbing story.

cecilia kang

And quoted from these emails the intent to, for example, neutralize
competitors —

  - archived recording (jerry nadler)  
    You have written that Facebook can likely always just buy any
    competitive startups.

cecilia kang

— and the concern articulated in these emails —

  - archived recording (jerry nadler)  
    When Facebook contemplated acquiring Instagram, a competitive
    startup, you told your C.F.O. that the nascent Instagram could be
    very disruptive to us. And in the weeks leading up to the deal —

cecilia kang

— that Instagram was going to be a big threat.

  - archived recording (jerry nadler)  
    — saying that, quote, “Instagram can meaningfully hurt us without
    becoming a huge business.”

cecilia kang

And Mark Zuckerberg responded by saying —

  - archived recording (mark zuckerberg)  
    Yes, I’ve been clear that Instagram was a competitor.

cecilia kang

— well, yes, Instagram is a competitor. And we clearly thought they’re
our competitor. And by the way —

  - archived recording (mark zuckerberg)  
    I think the F.T.C. had all of these documents and reviewed this and
    unanimously voted at the time not to challenge the acquisition.

cecilia kang

— the F.T.C. in 2011 approved this merger. So let’s be clear that this
has been vetted by the federal government. He also said that if not for
Facebook and the resources that Facebook had, Instagram perhaps would
not be the company it is today, the app that it is today, which is a
wildly popular global app. And Jerry Nadler responded to that —

  - archived recording (jerry nadler)  
    Mr. Zuckerberg, you’re making my point.

cecilia kang

— I think you’re proving my point. He’s saying, you do take nascent
competitors, and you gobble them up. And then you turn them into
important parts of the Facebook ecosystem. But those are really
interesting exchanges, in particular because they were so specific, and
they were taking the words of the executives in these emails and in
these documents straight back to the executives, and asking them
directly to respond and defend themselves. And that was something that
these executives aren’t used to having to do, and certainly not in front
of the public.

michael barbaro

OK, let’s move on to Google. You had predicted that Google would be
asked about the downside of its dominance in search. Is that what
happened?

cecilia kang

Yes, David Cicilline asked Sundar Pichai about his search practices. He
said —

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    We heard throughout this investigation that Google has stolen
    content to build your own business.

cecilia kang

— you steal content. You surface search results that aren’t necessarily
the best search results, but that are the best search results for you
and your services.

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    These are consistent reports. And so, your testimony that that
    doesn’t happen is really inconsistent with what we’ve learned
    during the course of the investigation.

cecilia kang

And you steal content from companies specifically like Yelp, which is a
restaurant review site. And you use that content to help lift and
benefit other Google services. David Cicilline’s accusation was that
Google has a walled garden of all kinds of services, and they just want
users to be on their services as much as possible. And as a consequence
of that, any rival is either being used or being blocked entirely from
this important gateway, which is this Google search engine.

michael barbaro

And I noticed that when the chairman tried to press the C.E.O. of Google
on, for example, this allegation of stealing content from Yelp —

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    Mr. Pichai, isn’t that anti-competitive?

michael barbaro

— the C.E.O. of Google did not respond.

cecilia kang

Sundar Pichai, throughout his whole testimony, was very reserved.

  - archived recording (sundar pichai)  
    Congressman, you know, when I run the company, I’m really focused on
    giving users what they want. We conduct ourselves to the highest
    standard.

cecilia kang

And often, he did not reply to specific accusations. And that was the
case this time as well.

  - archived recording (sundar pichai)  
    Happy to engage and understand the specifics and answer your
    questions further.

cecilia kang

He was deflecting.

michael barbaro

And on Amazon, Cecilia, you had said that Jeff Bezos would be challenged
about the way that company treats third party vendors. How did that play
out?

cecilia kang

Several lawmakers questioned Jeff Bezos about its treatment of third
party vendors.

  - archived recording (pramila jayapal)  
    Does Amazon ever access and use third-party seller data when making
    business decisions? And just a yes or no will suffice, sir.

  - archived recording (jeff bezos)  
    I can’t answer that question yes or no.

cecilia kang

Representative Lucy McBath —

  - archived recording (lucy mcbath)  
    And we’ve interviewed many small businesses, and they use the words
    like “bullying,” “fear,” and “panic” to describe their relationship
    with Amazon.

cecilia kang

— aired the recording from one of her constituents in her district who
was a bookseller on Amazon.

  - archived recording (bookseller)  
    And as we grew, we were shrinking Amazon’s market share in the
    textbooks category.

cecilia kang

And this bookseller was delisted from the marketplace.

  - archived recording (bookseller)  
    So now in retaliation, Amazon started restricting us from selling.

cecilia kang

And in this recording, we heard the bookseller talk about how being
delisted essentially crippled her business entirely.

  - archived recording (bookseller)  
    We haven’t sold a single book from the past 10 months. We were never
    given a reason. Amazon didn’t even provide us with a notice as to
    why we were being restricted. There was no warning. There was no
    plan.

michael barbaro

What did that anecdote, that audiotape, illustrate about Amazon and this
question of antitrust?

cecilia kang

I think it demonstrated that Amazon is so big.

  - archived recording (lucy mcbath)  
    Do you think this is an acceptable way to treat someone that you
    described as both a partner and a customer?

cecilia kang

And it spoke to the fact that Amazon, in a way, has become its own
economy.

  - archived recording (jeff bezos)  
    No, congresswoman, and I appreciate you showing me that anecdote.

cecilia kang

You could say the same thing with Apple, too, and its App Store. There
are so many other companies that depend on these economies and
platforms, if you will, for their livelihoods. And in a way, they become
their own subeconomies. All four of them, actually.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. You just mentioned Apple. And it was your prediction that this
hearing would be about the App Store and not much else. Was that true?

cecilia kang

That was the case. With Apple, Tim Cook was asked about Apple’s control
over its App Store. And Representative Hank Johnson, a Democrat from
Georgia, asked Tim Cook —

  - archived recording (hank johnson)  
    Mr. Cook, does Apple not treat all app developers equally?

cecilia kang

— if he treated all apps fairly. He asked, why is it that developers
have to get permission, and why is it that you charge developers 30
percent commission on average for simply operating on iPhones?

  - archived recording (tim cook)  
    If you look back at history —

  - archived recording (hank johnson)  
    What’s to stop Apple from increasing its commission to 50 percent?

  - archived recording (tim cook)  
    Sir, we have never increased commissions in the store since the
    first day it operated in 2008.

  - archived recording (hank johnson)  
    There’s nothing to stop you from doing so, is there?

cecilia kang

What’s to stop you from raising that commission price? The line of
questioning really was about how Apple maintains its monopoly over that
App Store and makes sure that it stays ahead of rivals by that dominant
gateway position that they have as the controller of App Store.

  - archived recording (tim cook)  
    So we had fierce competition at the developer side and the customer
    side, which is essentially it’s so competitive, I would describe it
    as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business.

cecilia kang

And Tim Cook really didn’t have a great answer.

  - archived recording (david cicilline)  
    As a great American Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis once said,
    “We must make our choice. We may have democracy, or we may have
    wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both.”
    This concludes today’s hearing. Without objection, this hearing is
    adjourned.

  - archived recording

michael barbaro

So let’s talk about how this all went. This was supposed to be big
tech’s big tobacco moment, as you said. But Democrats and Republicans
were up to two very different things in this hearing. And I’m mindful
that lawmakers have been ridiculed in the past for their kind of shallow
understanding of technology in hearings like this. And this is for tech
companies that are distinctly difficult to understand because of their
vastness, pinning down their inner workings. And so, I’m wondering if
you think that this did feel like a big tobacco moment. Did this hearing
accomplish what lawmakers had intended?

cecilia kang

This hearing felt like big tech’s big tobacco moment in that, for the
first time, the four C.E.O.s of the four biggest technology companies
had to defend themselves from accusations that were pretty tough, that
presented these companies in a pretty dark and negative light — as
brutal, dominant enterprises that are willing to squash competition and
harm consumers along the way to maintain their dominance. In that way,
the hearing presented them through a lens that the companies had not
before been viewed through by consumers or the public. The hearing
really presented the companies as something different than just tech
startups. They presented them as big enterprises, very similar to the
trusts of the late 1800s and the early 1900s.

michael barbaro

Right.

cecilia kang

At that time, the same sort of debates were swirling around, whether it
was good for U.S. steel or for standard oil to be such sprawling
enterprises, and to be such big actors and have so much influence.

michael barbaro

So where does this leave us now? I mean, this combination of a 13-month
investigation, this spectacle of this hearing, what happens next?

cecilia kang

So that’s the big question, Michael. I think that what you saw was
agreement among the Republicans and Democrats that they were angry at
these technology companies, and they had a lot of concerns. But where
you’re going to see disagreement is what comes next in terms of
legislative change, what comes next also in terms of recommendations to
enforcement agencies that are actually investigating these companies at
this time. So there’s going to be a lot of disagreement as to what the
path forward is going ahead.

What does change is that these companies now really can’t shake this
image that they have an antitrust problem — that all of them are, in
some way, dominant and have abused their monopoly power to harm
competition and potentially to harm consumers as well. And that’s not
the kind of tag that any of these companies want attached to them.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

In other words, once you have been tagged as a trust and a monopoly,
it’s probably just a question of what the regulatory answer to that
is.

cecilia kang

Yeah, I think it’s just a question of time.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

Thank you, Cecilia.

cecilia kang

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that more
than 150,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the U.S., a new
milestone in the pandemic. The death rate, which had briefly fallen over
the summer, is now rising in 23 different states, especially in Arizona,
South Carolina and Mississippi. On average, the virus has killed 1,000
people a day over the past week alone.

And the governor of Oregon, Kate Brown, said that federal officers would
begin to withdraw from the city of Portland today. Under an agreement
between the governor and the Trump administration, Oregon state police
will provide security for the exterior of the city’s federal courthouse,
replacing the federal officers, who had repeatedly clashed with and tear
gassed protesters there.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    You hear all sorts of reports about us leaving. We’re not leaving
    until they have secured their city. We told the governor, we told
    the mayor, secure your city.

michael barbaro

Even as the negotiations to leave were underway, President Trump
threatened that federal agents would remain in Portland or return there.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    If they don’t secure their city soon, we have no choice. We’re going
    to have to go in and clean it out. We’ll do it very easily. We’re
    all prepared to do it. So in Portland, they either clean out their
    city and do the job —

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.
