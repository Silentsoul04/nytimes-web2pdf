President Trump did not ask President Vladimir V. Putin whether Russian
operatives in Afghanistan had paid Taliban-affiliated militants
[bounties to kill American
soldiers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/russia-afghanistan-bounties.html),
Mr. Trump said in a new interview, dismissing a scenario backed by U.S.
intelligence as “fake news.”

Mr. Trump made the comments in an interview on Tuesday [with
Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-russia-bounties-taliban-putin-call-4a0f6110-ab58-41c0-96fc-57b507462af1.html)
scheduled to air on HBO next week. Portions of it were released early
Wednesday.

Mr. Trump spoke by telephone last week with Mr. Putin, but during a
public appearance on Monday declined to say whether he had raised the
bounty issue.

“We don’t talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of
discussion,” he told reporters.

But Mr. Trump was more direct when pressed by the Axios reporter
Jonathan Swan. “That was a phone call to discuss other things, and
frankly that’s an issue that many people said was fake news,” he said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If it reached my desk, I would have done something about it,” Mr. Trump
added, without elaborating on what action he would have taken.

Mr. Trump said the purpose of last week’s call with Mr. Putin was “to
discuss nuclear proliferation,” calling that issue “a much bigger
problem than global warming.”

Asked directly about the bounties, Mr. Trump said, “I have never
discussed it with him.” Mr. Trump has spoken to the Russian leader
numerous times in recent months.

Although Mr. Trump cast the bounty allegation as a media fiction, U.S.
intelligence analysts found
[evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/politics/russian-bounties-afghanistan-intelligence.html)
of the scheme credible, although some intelligence officials have higher
confidence on the question than others. The intelligence was provided to
Mr. Trump in a [written
briefing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/russian-bounty-trump.html)
in February, but it is unclear whether he read it.

Mr. Trump told Axios that the issue “never reached my desk” because
intelligence officials “didn’t think it was real.”

“If it reached my desk I would have done something about it,” he said,
adding: “I comprehend extraordinarily well.”

Mr. Trump has long taken pains not to personally criticize Mr. Putin,
despite generally hostile relations between Washington and Moscow, and
even seemed intent on downplaying evidence of broader Russian military
and financial support for the Taliban.

Asked about claims to that effect by the former top U.S. general in
Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., Mr. Trump dismissed the notion.
“I didn’t ask Nicholson about that,” he said, before saying that the
general “didn’t have great success” in his command, which ended in 2018.

Mr. Trump also suggested that Russian backing for the Taliban would be a
kind of understandable payback for America’s backing of fighters
opposing the Soviet occupation of that country during the 1980s.

“Well we supplied weapons when they were fighting Russia too,” Mr. Trump
said.

In an interview with the BBC in 2018, General Nicholson, then the
commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, said publicly that the Russians
were sending weapons to the Taliban.

The accusation came after months of American officials quietly asserting
the insurgent group was receiving support from the Kremlin under the
guise of countering the newly assertive Islamic State affiliate in
Afghanistan’s east.

General Nicholson never provided any hard evidence of Russia’s meddling,
though Russian officials have long had connections to Afghan militias
and other armed groups following the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan
in the 1980s.

U.S. officials believe Russia has made significant inroads with the
Taliban as the Russians believe the Taliban will be a major player in
Afghanistan following any peace negotiations with the U.S.-backed
government in Kabul and the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops in the
coming months.
