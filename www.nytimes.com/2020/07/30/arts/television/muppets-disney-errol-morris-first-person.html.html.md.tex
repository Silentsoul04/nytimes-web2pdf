Weekend?}\label{how-much-watching-time-do-you-have-this-weekend}}

The Muppets are back; also, check out an excellent but previously
hard-to-find Errol Morris docu-series.

\textbf{`Muppets Now'}\\
\textbf{When to watch:} Starting Friday, on Disney+

I want to believe that our society is capable of birthing another great
Muppet TV show, that our good will toward the characters and their
worldview will again lead us to a satisfying, joyous payoff of humor and
imagination, that the simplicity of puppetry will again nudge us to fill
in the blanks with our own emotional reasoning, thus creating a
surprisingly personal bond of empathy. ``Muppets Now'' is not quite
there, though it's closer than a Muppet property has been in a long
time. This new iteration replaces the variety format of ``The Muppet
Show'' with web-series formats ---~a good and timely swap! ---~but it
doesn't always capitalize on what actually makes those web shows
entertaining.

\textbf{`Taskmaster'}\\
\textbf{When to watch:} Sunday at 8 p.m., on the CW.

Existing somewhere between a game show, a panel show and contest show,
this British series pits five comedians against one another in a series
of strange and silly tasks, for example painting a horse while riding a
horse, or collecting the highest weight of doughnuts in a bucket while
keeping your hands on your hips. Think a combo of ``Double Dare'' and
crossword-puzzle logic. The first six seasons of ``Taskmaster''
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT5C7yaO3RVuOgwP8JVAujQ}{are
available on the show's YouTube channel}, and starting this weekend the
CW will be airing Season 8 --- but there's really no good or bad place
to start. Every episode is funny and surprising. This is the show I have
recommended most often and most insistently to my friends and family
during quar.

\textbf{`First Person'}\\
\textbf{When to watch:} Now, on
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhyNRRJPOb4\&list=PLVmRJGCDzW4QL42BGfwC-QpMMl46zDGJ9}{YouTube}.

The director Errol Morris recently posted his 2000-2001 documentary
series, ``First Person,'' on his YouTube channel, and the episodes are
fascinating --- often but not uniformly morbid, and also spirited and
alive in ways interviews rarely are. The show, which aired on Bravo, is
mostly monologues; Morris's subjects include a retired C.I.A. agent, a
woman who dated multiple serial killers, a man connected to a
particularly notorious mass shooting, a researcher obsessed with giant
squid. The aesthetic here is definitely of its era, but Morris's ability
to capture the human poles of passion and casualness is as exciting as
ever.
