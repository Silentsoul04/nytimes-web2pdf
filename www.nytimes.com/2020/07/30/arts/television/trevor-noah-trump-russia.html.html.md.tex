Russia}\label{trevor-noah-thinks-trump-is-oddly-chilled-out-about-russia}}

The president said he didn't ask Vladimir Putin whether Russia paid to
have U.S. troops killed. The ``Daily Show'' host can see why that talk
would have been ``super awkward.''

\subsection{No Room for Intelligence}\label{no-room-for-intelligence}}

U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Russia paid bounties to
Afghan militants to kill American soldiers.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/politics/trump-putin-bounties.html}{In
an interview} released on Wednesday, President Trump said he didn't
bring that up in a recent conversation with President Vladimir Putin,
and that a briefing on the subject never reached his desk.

``Unlike every other American president, he's been oddly chilled out
about Russian aggression toward the U.S.,'' Trevor Noah said on ``The
Daily Show.''

\begin{quote}
``First of all, I actually believe Trump when he says that this
intelligence briefing never reached his desk. Because I mean, his desk
is so full of Goya beans, where were they going to put the files?''
\emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}

``\emph{{[}imitating Trump aide{]}} Sir, we'd have something we'd like
to get on your desk immediately. There's a bit of a --- bit of a bean
jam right now. Little backup on the bean products, so maybe next week
stop back and I'll see if I can work through the beans.'' \emph{--- SETH
MEYERS}

``But it is bizarre that Trump is the most impulsive president ever ---
except when it comes to Russia. I mean, people are protesting against
the police and he's like, `We've got to send in the troops. Break it up
people, we've got to destroy them!' But when Russia is putting bounties
on American troops, he's like, ** `They're only lashing out because we
hurt them. Like Dr. Jen says: Hurt people hurt people.''' \emph{---
TREVOR NOAH}

``I mean, I guess I can understand where Trump is coming from. It is
super awkward bringing up to your buddy how he put a bounty on your
soldiers' heads, you know? You're talking sports, you're talking chicks
--- you don't want ruin the vibe with how he's spearheading a campaign
to compensate enemy combatants for killing your troops. Zero chill, man,
zero chill!'' \emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}

Edition)}\label{the-punchiest-punchlines-bezos-and-friends-edition}}

\begin{quote}
``It was not an easy day for lawmakers. They were like, `I'd grill you,
but I need Amazon to survive, Google knows my search history, Apple's
got my texts and Facebook's got my drunk pics. So we're good.'''
\emph{--- JIMMY FALLON, on the chief executives of those companies
testifying before Congress on Wednesday}

``I don't like to pass judgment, but these guys made the cast of `The
Big Bang Theory' look like the Avengers.'' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``It is basically like the Super Bowl of guys who are picked last in
sports.'' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``While Jeff Bezos is testifying in Congress for the first time ever,
his ex-wife, Mackenzie Scott, was making news of her own. Because Forbes
magazine recently named her the third richest woman in America, but now
she's working hard on moving down the list.'' \emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}

``Damn, \$1.7 billion donated to charity! It's almost like Mackenzie
Scott is determined to be the anti-Bezos. She's woke, she doesn't hoard
her money, and she has a full head of hair.'' \emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}
