Regular listeners of the Book Review’s podcast know that I have a soft
spot for thrillers. From time to time, I don’t mind giving up a bit of
psychological complexity in exchange for ingenious plotting and the
clarity of life-or-death action scenes. (That’s not to suggest the
trade-off is necessary: Just look at John le Carré’s nuanced and morally
ambiguous spies.) We recommend some good ones this week, from Camilla
Lackberg’s “The Golden Cage,” about a vengeful wife, to Lauren Beukes’s
“Afterland,” about a pandemic that singles out men, to Alex North’s
“The Shadows,” about a copycat killing that brings the past roaring
back. There’s also a real-life spy narrative, about the role of the
K.G.B. in Russian politics, and a true-crime history about a
19th-century grifter.

For readers who prefer quieter thrills, we recommend Alex Trebek’s
memoir, “The Answer Is…,” along with Zadie Smith’s latest essay
collection and Colin Dickey’s sympathetic look at true believers in the
paranormal.

[**THE ANSWER IS...: Reflections on My
Life**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/books/review-answer-is-alex-trebek-jeopardy-memoir.html)**,**
*by Alex Trebek. (Simon & Schuster, $26.)* Only after the outpouring of
support following his announcement last year that he had pancreatic
cancer did the longtime “Jeopardy\!” host Alex Trebek, a private and
reserved person, feel he owed something to the public. The “Jeopardy\!”
champion Ken Jennings has described Trebek as “a riddle wrapped in an
enigma wrapped in a Perry Ellis suit.” So perhaps it’s no surprise that
Trebek has written what our critic Parul Sehgal calls “a memoir of
consummate caginess, one of the wariest I’ve read: a friendly, often
funny account marked by a reluctance so deep that it confers a curious
integrity upon the celebrity tell-all.”

[**PUTIN’S PEOPLE: How the KGB Took Back Russia and Then Took On the
West**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/books/review-putins-people-kgb-catherine-belton.html)**,**
*by Catherine Belton. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $35.)* This book by the
dauntless investigative reporter Catherine Belton is a meticulously
assembled portrait of Vladimir Putin’s circle, and of the emergence of
what Belton calls “K.G.B. capitalism” — a form of ruthless wealth
accumulation designed to serve the interests of a Russian state that she
calls “relentless in its reach.” Belton talked to figures with disparate
interests on all sides, tracked down documents and followed the money to
write a “voluminous yet elegant account of money and power in the
Kremlin,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes.

[**INTIMATIONS: Six
Essays**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/books/review-intimations-essays-zadie-smith.html)**,**
*by Zadie Smith. (Penguin Books, $10.95.)* In her slender new collection
(less than 100 pages) of ultra-timely essays (several written in the
past few momentous months), Zadie Smith speaks clearly and forcefully
about the murder of George Floyd, the legacy of slavery and the systemic
sins revealed by Covid-19. The book also showcases her trademark
levelheadedness on a variety of other subjects. “This is a work of minor
dimensions at — and about — a major time,” our reviewer John Williams
writes.

[****TRUE
STORY****](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/books/review/kate-reed-petty-true-story.html)****,****
*by Kate Reed Petty. (Viking, $26.)* In her spellbinding debut novel —
about the rippling impact of a sexual assault — Petty uses shifting
genres to show the way trauma works on us, how it shapes our lived
experience and the way we frame that experience for others. “After a day
or two, the book continued to work on me,” Megan Abbott writes in her
review, “spurring me to question my own expectations of genre, and even
story itself, and their capacity to get at stickier truths about trauma
and its reverberations and what we expect from narratives dealing with
sexual assault.”

**[**THE KING OF CONFIDENCE: A Tale of Utopian Dreamers, Frontier
Schemers, True Believers, False Prophets, and the Murder of an American
Monarch**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/books/review/king-of-confidence-miles-harvey-james-jesse-strang.html)**,****
*by Miles Harvey. (Little, Brown, $29.)* Harvey’s entertaining history
of James Jesse Strang, a 19th-century con man who led a breakaway Mormon
colony on an island in Lake Michigan, chronicles a manic, anxious,
gullible time, not unlike our own. “Rather than a probing biography of a
single man,” Chris Jennings writes in his review, “Harvey offers a vivid
portrait of the time and place in which a character like Strang could
thrive, an era when ‘reality was porous’ and an anxious population cast
about for something exciting to believe in and someone confident to
follow.”

[****THE GOLDEN
CAGE****](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/books/review/the-golden-cage-camilla-lackberg.html)****,****
*by Camilla Lackberg. Translated by Neil Smith. (Knopf, $26.95.)* Faye
Adelheim appears to have an enviable life — a wealthy husband, a perfect
child, a sumptuous Stockholm apartment — until it all falls away. That’s
when this stylish thriller gathers steam, taking readers on a whirlwind
tour of retribution and revenge. The moral: Never underestimate a
spurned wife … or her friends. “It would be remiss not to mention the
theme of sisterhood in this smart, unflinching novel,” our reviewer,
Mary Kubica, writes. “Women in it are rarely pitted against one another,
but are instead united by common experience. Their friendships are
empowering in and of themselves, and the dispensability of the opposite
sex — except perhaps for sexual pleasure — speaks volumes.”

[****BLACKTOP
WASTELAND****](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/books/review/blacktop-wasteland-s-a-cosby.html)****,****
*by S. A. Cosby. (Flatiron, $26.99.)* In this gritty thriller, set in
rural Virginia, Beauregard “Bug” Montage — the owner of a struggling
auto shop — is drifting back into his old life of crime. Cosby has a
talent for well-tuned action, raising our heart rates and filling our
nostrils with odors of gun smoke and burned rubber. Daniel Nieh,
reviewing it, calls the book a “thrilling reminder that small-town
America has an underbelly, too. … Cosby’s voice is distinctive, and he
plays a sharp-tongued Virgil as we descend into the Hades of bucolic
poverty.”

**[**THE UNIDENTIFIED: Mythical Monsters, Alien Encounters, and Our
Obsession With the
Unexplained**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/books/review/the-unidentified-colin-dickey.html)**,****
*by Colin Dickey. (Viking, $27.)* Why do so many people find paranormal
events and ideas so persuasively real? As Dickey explains, it’s not that
they necessarily want weirdness, but they do want the freedom of
possibility. So there’s beauty in the idea of “a world beyond our
understanding, a world we can glimpse here and there but never fully
see.” Deborah Blum’s review calls it a “fascinating, troubling,
compassionate and — in the end — deeply thoughtful narrative. … Dickey’s
sense of history reminds us of the complex reasons our odder beliefs
endure.”

[****LOVE AND
THEFT****](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/books/review/stan-parish-love-and-theft.html)****,****
*by Stan Parish. (Doubleday, $25.95.)* Though this novel opens with a
thrilling set piece — a spectacular Vegas jewel heist — Parish’s true
interests lie in his characters, all battered people looking for
absolution or, failing that, some form of shelter, maybe in one another.
“Attention to sentence-by-sentence pleasure is an undervalued, even
disdained, skill among thriller writers,” Adam Sternbergh writes in his
review. “But a precision-cut sentence can quicken the reader’s pulse as
reliably as a surprise twist or a character’s excruciating dilemma. When
a novel delivers all of the above — as ‘Love and Theft’ ultimately does,
its racecar engine revving to a smooth and satisfying purr — it can feel
to the reader like a kind of
miracle.”

[****AFTERLAND****](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/books/review/lauren-beukes-afterland.html)****,****
*by Lauren Beukes. (Mulholland, $28.)* Beukes brings verve and mordant
wit to her neo-noir, coast-to-coast chase novel, set shortly after a
pandemic has wiped out 99 percent of the men in the world. The author is
from South Africa, and sees America with the fresh eyes of an outsider.
“Will readers want a pandemic novel at this fraught moment in American
life?” Stephen King writes in his review. “Maybe they will. Make that
probably. Because our current situation looks pretty good compared with
a world where young boys have been declared a natural resource and sperm
bootlegging means imprisonment.”

[****IMPERFECT
WOMEN****](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/books/review/araminta-hall-imperfect-women.html)****,****
*by Araminta Hall. (MCD/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.)* Although there’s
a murder at the heart of “Imperfect Women,” it’s not a conventional
detective story. Its real mysteries concern love, friendship, obligation
and the disappointments that come with the passage of time. “The book
creeps on you slowly, like a fog,” Sarah Lyall writes in her review,
“until you find yourself enveloped in this tangled skein of
relationships, eager to see how all this is going to play out, who is
going to betray whom and in what way.”

[****THE
SHADOWS****](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/books/review/the-shadows-alex-north.html)****,****
*by Alex North. (Celadon, $26.99.)* In North’s assured thriller, the
narrative shifts between past and present as a man in his 40s returns to
his bleak hometown and learns of a recent murder that appears to be a
copycat of one that rocked his adolescent world. This is absorbing,
headlong reading, an inventive play on classic horror. “North is aware
of how a good horror novel can subtly rearrange a reader’s surroundings,
charging them with menace,” Flynn Berry writes in her review. “As with
all the best illusions, you are left feeling not tricked, but full of
wonder.”
