``a place of happiness'' and vowed to take a more hands-on role.

Ellen DeGeneres apologized to the staff members of her talk show in an
email on Thursday, a week after Warner Bros. Television informed
employees that its parent company would conduct
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/business/media/ellen-degeneres-show-investigation.html}{an
investigation} into the program's troubled workplace.

In the email, which was reviewed by The New York Times,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/arts/television/ellen-degeneres.html}{Ms.
DeGeneres} wrote: ``On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first
meeting that The Ellen DeGeneres Show would be a place of happiness ---
no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with
respect. Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn
that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry.''

The workplace of ``The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' came under scrutiny this
month after BuzzFeed News published
\href{https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/ellen-employees-allege-toxic-workplace-culture}{an
article} reporting that former staff members said they had faced
``racism, fear and intimidation'' at work. Those whose accounts were
included in the article laid most of the blame on three executive
producers, Ed Glavin, Mary Connelly and Andy Lassner.

In a joint statement to BuzzFeed News, the three executive producers
said that the responsibility for running the show was ``completely on
us,'' adding that they realized that ``we need to do better, are
committed to do better, and we will do better.''

In a statement on Thursday, Warner Bros. Television acknowledged ``some
deficiencies related to the show's day-to-day management'' and suggested
changes were in store. ``We have identified several staffing changes,
along with appropriate measures to address the issues that have been
raised, and are taking the first steps to implement them,'' the
statement said.

Two people with knowledge of the investigation, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak
publicly about it, said Mr. Glavin would be removed from his position.

Warner Bros. would not comment on specific staffing changes. Mr. Glavin
did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ms. DeGeneres, a comedian with an amiable public image who has been a
staple of daytime television since her talk show made its debut in 2003,
also said in her email to staff members that she would take a more
active role in running the program.

``As we've grown exponentially,'' she wrote, ``I've not been able to
stay on top of everything and relied on others to do their jobs as they
knew I'd want them done. Clearly some didn't. That will now change and
I'm committed to ensuring this does not happen again.''

Hollywood Reporter} first reported on Ms. DeGeneres's email and the
change among the show's executive producers.

One of the first television stars to announce that she was gay --- a
statement she made in 1997, when she did as the star of the prime time
sitcom ``Ellen'' --- Ms. DeGeneres tried to reassure employees that
their workplace would be improved by invoking her own experience.

``As someone who was judged and nearly lost everything for just being
who I am,'' she wrote, ``I truly understand and have deep compassion for
those being looked at differently, or treated unfairly, not equal, or
--- worse --- disregarded. To think that any one of you felt that way is
awful to me.''

Last year, Ms. DeGeneres, 62,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/arts/television/ellen-degeneres.html}{renewed
her contract} to continue hosting her eponymous show through 2022. She
also
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/business/ellen-degeneres-hbo-max.html}{signed
a deal}to create three shows for WarnerMedia's streaming platform, HBO
Max.
