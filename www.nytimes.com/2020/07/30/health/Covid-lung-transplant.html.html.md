The last thing that Mayra Ramirez remembers from the emergency room at
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago is calling her family to say
she had Covid, was about to be put on a ventilator and needed her mother
to make medical decisions for her.

Ms. Ramirez, 28, did not wake up for more than six weeks. And then she
learned that on June 5, [she had become the first Covid
patient](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/health/coronavirus-lung-transplant.html?searchResultPosition=2)
in the United States to receive a double-lung transplant.

On Wednesday, she went home from the hospital.

Ms. Ramirez is one of a small but growing number of patients whose lungs
have been destroyed by the coronavirus, and whose only hope of survival
is a lung transplant.

“I’m pretty sure that if I had been at another center, they would have
just ended care and let me die,” she said in an interview on Wednesday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The surgery is considered a desperate measure reserved for people with
fatal, irreversible lung damage. Doctors do not want to remove a
person’s lungs if there is any chance they will heal. Over all, only
[about 2,700 lung transplants](https://unos.org/data/transplant-trends/)
were performed in the United States last year.

Patients must be sick enough to need a transplant, and yet also strong
enough to survive the operation, recover and get back on their feet.
With a new disease like Covid-19, doctors are still learning how to
strike that balance.

“It’s such a paradigm change,” said Ms. Ramirez’s surgeon, Dr. Ankit
Bharat. “Lung transplant has not been considered a treatment option for
an infectious disease, so people need to get a little bit more of a
comfort level with it.”

On July 5, he performed a similar operation on a second Covid patient,
Brian Kuhns, 62, from Lake Zurich, Ill.

Mr. Kuhns spent 100 days on life-support machines before receiving the
transplant. Before becoming ill, he had thought Covid was a hoax, his
wife, Nancy Kuhns, said, in a statement issued by the hospital.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kuhns said, “If my story can teach you one thing, it’s that Covid-19
isn’t a joke.”

Two more patients at Northwestern are awaiting transplants, one from
Chicago and one from Washington, D.C., said Dr. Bharat, who is the chief
of thoracic surgery and surgical director of the lung transplant
program.

A patient is to be flown in from Seattle next week, and the Northwestern
team is consulting on still another case with a medical group in
Washington, D.C. Other transplant centers are considering similar
surgeries, Dr. Bharat said.

Last Friday, a Covid patient transferred from another state underwent a
double lung transplant at the University of Florida Health Shands
Hospital in Gainesville, Dr. Tiago Machuca said.

While other centers have also sought to refer cases, most of the
patients had other serious medical problems that ruled them out, he
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In some cases, Dr. Bharat said, hospitals appeared to have waited too
long to recommend a transplant. One patient being referred to his center
seemed like a good candidate but then had major bleeding into the lungs
as well as kidney failure, and the surgery was no longer feasible.

“I think people need to recognize this option earlier and just start at
least talking about it before it gets to that point,” Dr. Bharat said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In some cases, he said, insurers’ reluctance to cover the surgery or to
pay for travel to transfer patients has led to delays.

“This is so new to our field,” Dr. Machuca said. “It will be a challenge
for physicians to determine which patients truly are candidates and
what’s the timing. We don’t want to do it too early when the patient
still can recover from Covid lung disease and resume with good quality
of life, but also you don’t want to miss the boat and have a patient
where it’s futile, the patient is too sick.”

He said that, in some cases, extensive rehabilitation has brought about
recovery in Covid patients who were being considered as possible
transplant candidates.

Because the extensive lung damage in Covid patients makes transplant
surgery especially difficult, most patients would be referred to major
transplant centers that are best equipped to perform the risky
operations and provide the intensive aftercare that patients need, the
surgeons said. Mr. Kuhns was transferred to Northwestern from another
health system.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Before she became ill, Ms. Ramirez, a paralegal for a law firm
specializing in immigration, was working from home and having her
groceries delivered. She was in good health, but had an autoimmune
condition, neuromyelitis optica, and took medication that suppressed her
immune system and might have made her more vulnerable to the coronavirus
infection.

She was ill for about two weeks, and consulted with a Covid hotline
about her symptoms. At one point, she headed to the hospital but then
turned back without going in. She dreaded the idea of being admitted,
and told herself she would recover.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But on April 26, her temperature reached 105 degrees Fahrenheit, and she
was so weak that she fell when she tried to walk. A friend drove her to
the hospital. When doctors told her that she needed a ventilator, she
had no idea what they meant. She thought it meant some kind of fan, like
the word in Spanish.

“I thought I’d just be there for a couple of days, max, and get back to
my normal life,” she said.

But she spent six weeks on the ventilator, and also needed a machine to
provide oxygen directly into her
bloodstream.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“The entire time, I had nightmares,” she said.

Many of the nightmares involved drowning, her family saying goodbye, the
doctors telling her she was going to die.

The disease was relentless. Bacterial infections set in, scarring her
lungs and eating holes in them. The lung damage caused circulatory
problems that began to take a toll on her liver and heart.

The doctors told her family in North Carolina that it might be time to
come to Chicago to say goodbye, and her mother and two sisters made the
trip.

But Ms. Ramirez held on, cleared the coronavirus from her body and was
placed on the transplant list. Two days later, on June 5, she underwent
a grueling, 10-hour operation.

She woke scarred, bruised, desperately thirsty and unable to speak,
“with all these tubes coming out of me, and I just couldn’t recognize
my own body.”

The nurses asked if she knew the date. She guessed early May. It was the
middle of June.

She was not told she’d had a lung transplant until several days after
she woke up.

“I couldn’t process it,” she said. “I was just struggling to breathe and
I was thirsty. It wasn’t until weeks later that I could be grateful, and
think there was a family out there who had lost
someone.”

Because of concerns about infection, her family could not visit after
the surgery. At a news conference on Thursday, Ms. Ramirez said, “The
hardest part was going through this alone.”

She suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, she said. Eventually, the
rules were relaxed, and her mother could visit. But it was wrenching to
say goodbye each day.

Before her illness, she worked full-time and enjoyed running and playing
with her two small, scrappy dogs. Now, she still feels short of breath,
can walk only a short distance and needs help to shower and stand up
from a chair. The dogs were overjoyed at her homecoming, but their
energy was a bit much. Her mother, who lives in North Carolina, took
time away from her job at a meatpacking plant and traveled to Chicago to
help her recover.

Ms. Ramirez said she was learning to use her new lungs and getting
stronger every day.

She is looking forward to getting back to work, but she still has a way
to go. Her family is assisting her, and a friend started a [GoFundMe
page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/covid19-lung-transplant?utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link-tip)
to help pay the bills.

“I definitely feel like I have a purpose,” Ms. Ramirez said. “It may be
to help other people going through the same situation that I am, maybe
even just sharing my story and helping young people realize that if this
happened to me it could happen to them, and to protect themselves and
protect others around them who are more vulnerable. And to motivate and
help other centers around the world to realize that lung transplantation
is an option for terminally ill Covid patients.”

The outlook for Ms. Ramirez is good, Dr. Bharat said, because she is
young and healthy. She will be on anti-rejection medicines for the rest
of her life. Transplanted lungs can still be rejected, he said, but he
has seen some last 20 years. And patients may be able to receive a
second transplant.

“I think from now on she’ll continue to get stronger and stronger,” he
said. “She asked if she could go skydiving. We’ll probably get her there
in a few months.”
