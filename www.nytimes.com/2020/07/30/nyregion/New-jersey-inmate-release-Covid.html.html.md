# About 20% of N.J. Prisoners Could Be Freed to Avoid Virus

Believed to be the first Covid-19 bill of its kind, the legislation

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New Jersey lawmakers are expected to approve legislation that could free
more than 3,000 prisoners — about 20 percent of the state’s prison
population — months before their release dates in response to the
extraordinary threat posed by the coronavirus in tightly packed
correctional facilities.

Inmates who are within a year of completing their state prison sentences
would be eligible to be released up to eight months early based on
credits awarded for time served during the pandemic.

The bill, which the American Civil Liberties Union believes to be the
first legislative initiative of its kind in the United States, would not
permit the release of most sex offenders, but would apply to inmates
sentenced for other violent crimes, including murder.

“There are people who were sentenced to long prison terms, but they
weren’t sentenced to die in prison,” said Amol Sinha, executive director
of the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey, one of the groups urging passage of the
legislation.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Legislature was prepared to take a final vote on the bill on
Thursday but it was delayed when several last-minute amendments were
introduced.

The proposal comes amid nationwide efforts to reduce state and federal
prison populations to protect inmates and employees from the virus,
which [continues to spread
rapidly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/us/coronavirus-inmates-prisons-jails.html)
through some prisons. The [five largest known
clusters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#clusters)
of the virus in the United States are now linked to correctional
facilities.

New Jersey’s prison death rate is the highest in the nation, with 27
deaths per 10,000 prisoners, according to [data
collected](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons)
by The Marshall Project and The Associated Press.

In California, the governor ordered the [release of up to 8,000
nonviolent
offenders](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-10/california-release-8000-prisoners-coronavirus-crisis-newsom)
by the end of August. [Connecticut’s prison
population](https://portal.ct.gov/DOC/Common-Elements/Common-Elements/Press-Release-Related-COVID19)
has dropped by 16 percent since March to the lowest levels in 29 years,
in part because of coronavirus releases.

New Jersey has already released<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>about 800 inmates early from its prison system under an [April
executive
order](https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/20200410d.shtml) and
freed nearly 700 people from its [county
jails](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/nyregion/coronavirus-nj-inmates-release.html)
after a legal challenge. But those releases have occurred largely on a
case-by-case basis and did not involve legislative action.

“He was, like, gray,” said Art Devlin, 55, who shared a dormitory room
with Mr. Price for a year at the house in Bridgeton, N.J. “He started
with the coughing, the hacking. I told them, ‘This guy’s sick.’”

But Mr. Price continued to work in the kitchen, sleep in a 12-man
dormitory and dream of the party his family was planning when he was
freed in May, Mr. Devlin said.

He never got home. Mr. Price died May 1 of the coronavirus in a
Vineland, N.J., hospital 21 days before his release date.

“It has been a living nightmare,” said his mother, Bernice Ferguson, 54.
“He was doing his time. He did not go there for a death sentence.”

At least 48 other prison inmates in New Jersey have [died from the
virus](https://www.njdoc.gov/pages/COVID19Updates.shtml).

If approved, the bill could free more than 3,000 inmates — about
one-fifth of the 16,704 people serving state criminal sentences in New
Jersey. The prison population in New Jersey has declined by about 12
percent since the start of the pandemic in March based on a combination
of factors, including the early releases and a virus-related slowdown
within the court system.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The proposed legislation earned unanimous bipartisan support during a
Senate committee hearing, and has won backing from key lawmakers,
leaving supporters hopeful it will be approved.
Lawmakers<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>voted to approve
several<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>final amendments on
Thursday, including the addition of a 45-day implementation window.

A final vote is expected in late August. If signed into law by Gov.
Philip D. Murphy, the release of inmates could begin by the middle of
September, according to a sponsor of the bill in the Senate, Nellie Pou.

“We have to realize that we’re dealing with an emergency here,” said Ms.
Pou, who added that she is confident the bill will be approved in the
Assembly and Senate.

A spokesman for Mr. Murphy would not comment on whether he would sign
the bill into law. A spokesman for the state attorney general, Gurbir S.
Grewal, who oversees the State Police and county prosecutors, also said
he would not comment on pending legislation.

Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Republican who represents parts of Bergen
and Passaic Counties and describes himself as a law-and-order
conservative, said his support for the legislation stemmed from “basic,
simple justice.”

He said the state Department of Corrections had failed to keep inmates
in its custody safe.

“We are not doing very well at all in terms of protecting people,” said
Mr. Cardinale, who voted to approve the bill in a Senate committee.
“They’re prisoners, but they are human beings.”

Since March, [2,892
inmates](https://www.njdoc.gov/pages/COVID19Updates.shtml) — about 17
percent of the population — and 781 employees have tested positive for
the virus at New Jersey correctional facilities. In addition to the 49
inmates who have died, several employee deaths have been linked to
Covid-19.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At one point since March, there were 800 active cases of Covid-19 in
state correctional facilities. Prisons have since successfully slowed
the spread. The state has begun its second phase of universal testing,
and there are now fewer than 30 coronavirus cases linked to state
correctional facilities, according to the commissioner of the Department
of Corrections, Marcus O. Hicks.

Still, employees continue to pose a risk of importing new cases of the
virus, and social distancing in crowded facilities remains virtually
impossible.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Scott Clements said he feared that his brother Brian, who has diabetes
and heart disease and will be 59 next week, may not make it until his
February release
date.

Brian Clements is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence at South
Woods State Prison for his role in a fatal car accident, but does not
fall into any of the four categories eligible to apply for release under
the governor’s April executive
[order](https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/20200410d.shtml).

“If he was to contract the virus, it’s going to be as close to a death
sentence as anyone could imagine,” said Scott Clements, 48. “I want to
bring my brother home in my Toyota Camry, not in a
hearse.”

Nicole D. Porter, the director of advocacy for the Sentencing Project, a
national nonprofit that advocates for sentencing reform and the
elimination of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, said
that while the proposal is a step it the right direction, it is still
not enough.

“What the United States has done pales in comparison to other
countries,” she said, citing the release of [85,000 prisoners in
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/world/americas/coronavirus-brazil-prisons.html)
and [30,000 in
Indonesia.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-indonesia-prisons/indonesia-to-release-30000-prisoners-early-amid-virus-concerns-idUSKBN21I11Z)

“Every day is urgent for somebody in prison,’’ Ms. Porter said. “It’s
just now the entire world is going through an urgent experience
together.”

A Republican who voted against the bill in an Assembly committee,
Christopher P. DePhillips, said he was sympathetic to the significant
challenges facing prisoners in the middle of a pandemic.

But, Mr. DePhillips said, he was concerned about allowing the early
release of violent offenders, and would have preferred for the
Legislature to have had a role in devising ways to keep inmates safe —
before being asked to free them.

Mr. Devlin, however, said it was impossible to remain apart in the
prison housing units, where masks were not regularly worn. Officials
from the halfway house, run by the Kintock Group, did not return calls.

“I was scared for my life — absolutely scared for my life,” said Mr.
Devlin, who completed his sentence in late May but still worries about
those left behind. “Now I’m scared for their lives.”
