<div class="css-53u6y8">

One Sunday afternoon in July, around a dozen parents gathered in a
backyard in Hastings-on-Hudson, a village about a half-hour north of
Midtown Manhattan. Another dozen joined them via Zoom. Folding chairs
had been placed at prudent distances, and masks were dutifully worn. An
Australian Labradoodle belonging to the home’s owners strutted among the
guests.

Despite the breezy suburban tableau, the occasion was fraught. Over the
preceding months, the adults in the backyard had grown increasingly
concerned about the coming school year, which, it had become clear,
might put students in class, at best, only part-time. Parents were
determined to avoid having their children sit alone for hours each day,
withering in the gray light of a Chromebook.

A young woman named Cate Han, one of the founders of the [Hudson Lab
School](https://www.hudsonlabschool.com/), in Hastings, along with
partners from [Portfolio School](https://www.portfolio-school.com/), in
TriBeCa, were in the yard to pitch a solution: Learning Pods. “We looked
at the situation and asked, ‘What makes sense?’” Ms. Han said. “A social
bubble, consistent schooling, and have it be with a teacher in person.”

Babur Habib, a Portfolio founder, took a more visionary tone. “Yes, we
are in a pandemic,” he said. “But when it comes to education, we also
feel some good may even come out of this.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One thing was certain. It was going to be very expensive — maybe
prohibitively so — but these parents wanted a solution. Many had chosen
to live in Hastings because of its outstanding public schools. Now they
were considering withdrawing their children and embracing a novel
teaching model that could have implications for public education for
years.

There might be no more potent symbol of inequality during the pandemic
than [the pod
school](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/parenting/school-pods-coronavirus.html):
A single semester in a Hudson Lab pod can cost more than $13,000.

This fall, a majority of [50 million American
children](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_203.10.asp)
enrolled in public school are almost certainly going to be confined
within their homes for part or all of the school day. The numerous harms
of being kept out of school — academic, social, emotional,
psychological, physical — are felt by all children, but a
disproportionate weight will
be[borne](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html)
by those with the least resources. The wealthiest children will be
ensconced in private schools and catered to by tutors and nannies. For
most, there are few options.

But for a slice of enterprising American parents with resources,
so-called pod schools have arrived. Cropping up all over, these small
educational groups aim to offset the looming wreckage of a national
experiment in distance learning. Among the many options are [School
House](https://www.getschoolhouse.com/), based in New York City, which
is offering “micro schools” around the country, and [Whiz
Kidz](https://www.whizkidztutoring.com/wk-pods), based in nearby
Irvington.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The idea of learning pods, both formally organized by outfits like the
Hudson Lab, as well as more ad hoc parent-run variations, appears to be
speaking to parents who feel that government agencies and school
districts have failed to plan for their children.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The program presented by Ms. Han and her colleagues that afternoon
sounded relatively simple.

Parents will form groups of three to 10 children, usually in the same
grade. The “pods” will meet each day from around 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in a
host parent’s basement or cordoned-off living room or perhaps somewhere
outdoors, to learn from a teacher provided by the Hudson
Lab.

Each [pod](https://www.learning-pods.com/) for grades K-4 will cost
$125,000 for the academic year, or $68,750 for a five-month commitment.
With five children in a pod, for example, the cost per student will run
$13,750 per semester. The more children in the pod, the lower the cost
per student. There is different pricing and reduced hours for preschool
pods. (Both H.L.S. and School House are seeking partnerships with
foundations so they can offer scholarships.)

“My children didn’t get an education this spring,” said Ronit Sukenick,
who offered her backyard for the Hudson Lab presentation. She has two
boys, Jonah and David, who experienced the last three months of second
and sixth grade at their dining table.

“None of the things that were great about my sons’ schools translated to
remote learning,” she said. “No science experiments or a teacher at
their sides. No interaction with friends.”

The loss of both the academic and social aspects of school was a refrain
from more than a dozen parents I spoke with regarding distance learning.

Ms. Han appealed to the palpable anxiety among the parents in the yard.
“We are social beings,” she said as a few parents nodded in agreement.
“Our identities are formed based on our interactions with others.”
Learning for children is tied to being with peers, she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Why should a child suffer in isolation, struggling to learn how to read
through a computer, when they could thrive with a small group of peers
and a real teacher instead?

To enroll full-time in the Hudson Lab learning pods, parents withdraw
their children from the public school and register as home-schoolers, a
process that requires parents to submit academic plans to their district
for approval. Hudson Lab also offers an option that allows students to
remain enrolled in school remotely while using a learning pod as a
supplement.

Pod families also need to draw up agreements on the various facets of
distancing behavior each child and family will be obligated to. Is it OK
if someone gets a haircut in the city? What about play dates outside the
pod?

Aside from safety concerns, other issues will surely arise — different
learning styles, teacher and parent goals. It all needs to be worked
out. But as part of its fee, the Hudson Lab School will help with the
paperwork, mediate parent interaction with the teacher, and align pod
curriculums to state standards.

Pod programs offer an inoculation against the possibility that public
schools might close. As long as the community isn’t in complete
lockdown, the learning pods can keep going.

Lauren Lazarin is a single mother in Riverdale, in the Bronx, with a
limited income, but she’s considering signing up for a Hudson Lab pod.
“If I have to ditch my salaried job as an early childhood educator and
work as a private tutor so my 5-year-old daughter can get her education
and I can keep my family safe,” she said, “then I might have to make
that choice.”

For Ms. Sukenick, who works as a physical therapist, the choice is
stark. She can either quit working while she looks after her sons when
they’re home, or she can keep her very fulfilling job and deplete her
savings to pay for the pods. “This is our emergency fund,” she said,
noting they were thankful to have it. “And this is our emergency.”

Erica Paris, a stay-at-home mom in Towaco, N.J., recently received her
daughters’ fall schedule from the school district. Her 8-year-old,
Alexa, will attend elementary school four half-days per week; Emma, 12,
will attend middle school just two half-days per week. Ms. Paris said
she will have to hire someone to help with remote learning during their
copious time out of school. “I respect educators. I don’t know how to
take the curriculum and do it myself,” she said. “I can’t be both a
teacher and a
parent.”

She has reached out to other parents “to see if their girls want to do a
small group and share a tutor.” For Ms. Paris, the sharing of a tutor is
less about saving money than for the advantage of her girls being in a
group setting. Her daughters’ schedules are also baffling and
frustrating.

“The reason they have half-days is because the teachers’ contract
guarantees a duty-free lunch, which is understandable,” she said. “But
couldn’t we figure out how to hire aides for an hour? Two half-days of
school a week is
ridiculous.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

I’ve been similarly disheartened over the pending school policies in
Hastings. I was in the Sukenicks’ back yard that afternoon because
remote learning this spring for my children, ages 9 and 11, had been an
abysmal affair.

My younger son would blast through the days’ assignments, often
consisting of watching videos and checking boxes. By 9:30 each morning
he’d confront me, panicked: “I’m done. Now what do I do?” My daughter
was saddled with extensive projects and a detailed course load she often
needed help with.

Mainly it was a profoundly lonely time for them. The neighborhood kids
shut off from one another, hours were spent alone in their rooms,
dissolving into electronic screens.

And I’m aware my children are more fortunate than many others.

The many parents I’ve spoken with for this article have expressed
sadness and unease over the inequities that a remote-learning model
engenders. Yet allowing their children to suffer is not the remedy to a
systemic problem.

As a journalist I began scouring the research on children and Covid-19
when our schools shut down some five months ago. I haven’t climbed out
of the data pit since.

The preponderance of evidence suggests that children, by and large, are
spared dangerous effects of the
virus.

[Data](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/5e248b82cc284971a1c5fd922e7770f8/forekomst-covid-19-olika-yrkesgrupper.pdf)
from Sweden, where lower schools have been open for the entirety of the
pandemic, without specific distancing mandates or children in masks,
show that teachers were at no greater risk than other professionals.

Philosophically, I believe schools should be among the last institutions
to close and the very first to open. Many experts have argued similarly,
including in [The
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/coronavirus-schools.html).
But I am aware plenty of people feel differently.

What I can say here, though, is what I know to be true for my family.
After months of solitude, where screen time essentially became time
itself, my kids have finally escaped. They’ve been in camp for the past
few weeks, playing and interacting with other children all day. The
transformation has been akin to a time-lapse video of the reanimation of
a long dormant creature. They finally seem like themselves again. I want
my children, and all children, to have the opportunity to be with their
peers, every day, in person.

That afternoon at the Sukenicks’ I quickly realized that the Hudson Lab
pod program is well beyond my family’s financial means. I don’t know
what exactly we’re going to do when school starts.

In my district, there has been an interesting overlap between the
send-them-back-to-schoolers and the keep-them-homers, in that most are
seeking any alternative they can think of to their children sitting
alone at a computer each day. A [movement for outdoor
classes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-schools-reopening-outdoors.html)
seemed to bring many from opposing sides together. Yet despite the
enthusiasm of parents, the likelihood of that coming to fruition seems
dim. American can-do spirit somehow seems absent from getting kids in
school, even — or especially — if school is
outdoors.

Several weeks after the backyard presentation, Cate Han told me that
Hudson Lab has not finalized any pods yet but has around 60
applications. Many families are waiting to hear what the state and local
guidelines will be before making a decision.

Ms. Sukenick has not yet decided on plans for her boys. Whatever it is,
she hopes it will include an in-person experience every day.

Ms. Lazarin, the single mother in Riverdale, isn’t only worried about
remote learning. She’s also worried about the in-school environment,
with “these unnatural experiences of eating lunch in cubicles, recess
alone in a square on the pavement.”

After pausing for a moment, thinking about the pod, she said, “If I have
to sell my arm to make that happen, then I’ll do it.”
