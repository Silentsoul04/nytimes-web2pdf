Major League Baseball had to shuffle its schedule yet again on Thursday,
postponing the Philadelphia Phillies’ scheduled games for this weekend
after a coach and a clubhouse attendant received positive test results
for the coronavirus.

The Phillies had been scheduled to play a doubleheader with the Toronto
Blue Jays on Saturday in Philadelphia and another game on Sunday, but
the positive tests caused the team to shut down their stadium, Citizens
Bank Park, for baseball activity.

“Our plans right now are to stay put and let M.L.B. work through
whatever they’re working through, and then they’re going to let us know
what’s our next step,” Toronto Manager Charlie Montoyo told reporters on
Thursday, before the Blue Jays’ game in Washington. “But we’re not going
to Philadelphia. Those games have been postponed.”

The Phillies are the second team, with the Miami Marlins, to be forced
to miss a full week of action because of the pandemic. The Marlins, who
played three games in Philadelphia last weekend, have had 19 positive
tests for the coronavirus within their traveling party, including 17
players.

The team has remained in isolation in Philadelphia while receiving
testing and treatment. No Phillies players are known to have tested
positive since the season began, but Major League Baseball felt the
Phillies’ recent exposure to the Marlins made it unwise to go ahead with
the games this weekend.

“Had this happened a week ago, that would have been the answer, because
in our manual, we talk about what to do when there’s a positive case and
how we handle contact tracing,” said Dr. Gary Green, M.L.B.’s medical
director. “But the commissioner correctly decided that this was an
extraordinary situation, and we wanted to go beyond the manual and
reassure the public as well as the players and the staff that we were
taking every possible precaution.”

The Phillies had been scheduled to play in Miami next week, but with the
Marlins in limbo, M.L.B. has instead scheduled the Phillies for four
games against the Yankees, on Monday and Tuesday in the Bronx and in
Philadelphia on Wednesday and Thursday.

The Yankees had been scheduled to play at Tampa Bay on Thursday, but now
they will most likely make up that game as part of a doubleheader that
weekend.

The adjustments underscore how flexible M.L.B. and its clubs must be
while playing during the pandemic, with the abbreviated schedule subject
to reorganization based on circumstances. The Yankees and the Orioles,
who were supposed to face the Phillies and the Marlins this week,
switched to a two-game series against each other in Baltimore. The
Nationals and the Blue Jays, who were scheduled to play the Marlins and
the Phillies this weekend, are now idle.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Missing a full week will make it all but impossible for the Phillies and
the Marlins to squeeze in a full 60-game schedule. To do so, the teams
would each have to play 57 games in 56 days from Monday through the end
of the regular season on Sept. 27. They could fill in some games on off
days or make up some with doubleheaders — which will include games that
last just seven innings — but the league no longer views 60 games as a
must for each team, given the unprecedented
disruptions.

### The Games Resume

#### Sports and the Virus

Updated July 31, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - The [N.B.A.
        returned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/basketball/clippers-lakers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup),
        and the Lakers held on to beat the Clippers in a thriller. Zion
        Williamson played in the first game of the night for the
        Pelicans.
      - Players, coaches and analysts are watching this season’s
        baseball games [to see what
        effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/sports/baseball/baseball-empty-stadiums-effects.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup)
        the absence of fans has.
      - With no summer tournaments to play in, top high school
        basketball stars are [committing to colleges
        earlier](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/ncaabasketball/college-basketball-recruiting.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup).
        Villanova is one of the beneficiaries.

As M.L.B. tries to untangle the Marlins’ outbreak — and how it
originated — the league has instructed teams to more closely monitor
players’ adherence to safety rules. Each team will have one employee
serve as a compliance officer, making sure players observe health
protocols at the ballpark and do not leave the team hotel on the road,
except for games.

“The difficulty — and you’re seeing this across the country with contact
tracing — it’s very difficult to know exactly where somebody picked
something up, because people don’t just go to one place,” Dr. Green
said. “It is a little bit difficult to determine where that actually
occurred. But our contact tracers have been working on that as well as
our department of investigations. They have been doing that pretty much
full-time since this happened.”

Dr. Green emphasized that M.L.B. had performed more than 11,000
coronavirus tests since the Marlins’ outbreak, and no players on any of
the other 29 teams have tested positive.

“Twenty-nine out of 30 is a pretty good batting average,” he said. “So
what that means is overall, it’s been successful. Obviously we’re upset
there’s been an outbreak with one team, which is one team too many, but
if you look at our positive rate overall, even with the Marlins, since
the surveillance started it’s about .1 percent.”

Dr. Green said it was up to the players and teams to follow the
protocols both at the ballparks and away from them to limit the spread
of the virus. But he said the league understood all along that some
positive tests would occur.

“We were never under any illusions that this was going to be perfect or
that we weren’t going to get positive cases,” he said. “The whole idea
was to try to mitigate that and be able to play sports within the
setting of a pandemic, which has never been done before.”
