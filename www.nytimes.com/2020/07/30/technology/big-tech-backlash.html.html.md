# Big Tech’s Backlash Is Just Starting

The congressional antitrust hearing showed that concerns about the tech
stars aren’t going
away.

Wednesday’s[five-plus-hour congressional
probing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html)
of the bosses of America’s tech giants did not reveal a singular
“gotcha” moment or smoking gun email. We’ve heard many of these
examples of Big Tech abuse before.

But the power of this hearing and others like it was the cumulative
repetition of tales of abusive behavior, and evidence of the harm this
has had on people’s lives.

The spectacle also showed that the impact of congressional
investigations is the digging that happens when the C-SPAN cameras are
turned off.

Worries about America’s tech stars have swirled for years. It’s clear
now that this isn’t going away. In world capitals, courtrooms and among
the public, we are wrestling with what it means for tech giants to have
enormous influence on our lives, elections, economy and minds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And while what happens to the future of Google, Amazon, Apple and
Facebook is anyone’s guess, it was clear from Wednesday’s hearing that
Congress was pointing the way for other branches of government to pick
up the digging from here.

We saw on Wednesday old
[emails](https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0002.pdf) and
[texts](https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0006336700063372.pdf)
from Mark Zuckerberg, worried about Facebook [losing ground to
Instagram](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony/lawmakers-said-documents-show-facebook-tried-to-neutralize-a-competitive-threat)
and suggesting that buying competing apps is an effective way to take
out the competition. The big deal here: Trying to reduce competition by
purchasing a rival is a violation of antitrust law. (Zuckerberg said
that Instagram’s success wasn’t assured when Facebook bought it.)

Representatives said that their interviews with former Amazon employees
backed up [news
reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015)
that the company used private data from its merchants to make its own
version of their products.

The subcommittee discussed their conversations with companies that
claimed Google funneled web searches to services it owned rather than to
rivals like Yelp. Through company documents and questioning, members of
Congress picked apart Apple’s stance that it treats all app developers
the same.

My colleague Kevin Roose
[wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/big-tech-ceos.html)
that the tech bosses seemed to be “taken off guard by the rigor and
depth of the questions they faced.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The [Department of
Justice](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/technology/barr-google-investigation.html)
and the Federal Trade Commission are also investigating whether these
companies abuse their power, and I bet they watched closely. The U.S.
government’s [antitrust case against
Microsoft](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony/todays-hearing-has-echoes-of-bill-gates-22-years-ago)
more than 20 years ago was built, in part, on the emails of Bill Gates
and other Microsoft executives discussing how they planned to kill
upstart competitors.

Here’s one more sign that the backlash against Big Tech has only just
begun: The shouty tech critics in Congress and the tech bosses all
seemed to agree that these four companies have a meaningful impact on
many people’s lives.

The tech bosses focused on the good that comes from their companies’
size, reach and influence. A New York bakery finds customers by buying
advertisements on Google. Merchants can thrive by selling their products
or apps on Amazon or Apple.

The representatives pointed out examples of the dark side of Big Tech’s
size, reach and influence. In the pin drop moment of the hearing, a
House member played an audio recording of a book seller saying her
family was struggling because of a change Amazon apparently made that
dried up her sales there.

The subcommittee chairman said these tech powers can pick the winners
and the losers. That might be stretching it. But both sides demonstrated
that these four companies have a profound say in who wins or loses.

Lawmakers of all political stripes seemed uncomfortable with the
knowledge that four companies have this much influence. Beyond the legal
antitrust questions at issue, it’s this feeling of discomfort that makes
it hard to imagine that nothing will change for these tech superpowers.

## Another theme: anti-conservative bias

Wednesday’s hearing was really two hearings. The Democrats mostly asked
the four tech chief executives about ways their companies wielded their
power and influence. Republican members [largely
asked](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony/republicans-focused-on-bias-concerns-about-platforms)
about persistent concerns that Google and Facebook in particular censor
right-leaning viewpoints or treat conservative figures unfairly.

Some Republican politicians’ complaints about political bias aren’t
backed by credible evidence. Regardless, suspicion of bias is a thorny
problem for these companies.

In a 2018 Pew Research
[survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/29/fast-facts-about-americans-views-of-social-media-companies-as-trump-twitter-dispute-grows/),
Americans who described themselves as Republicans or Republican-leaning
overwhelmingly said that they believed that tech companies censor online
information for partisan reasons. (A smaller, but still majority, share
of Democrats said that they believed this, too.) Since then, polling has
shown a growing mistrust of tech companies, particularly among
conservatives.

This doesn’t seem to have hurt the tech companies’ businesses. In fact,
some Republican members on Wednesday argued that even though people
don’t trust Big Tech, they have no choice but to continue using these
services because these companies have so much influence. It was an
effective way to connect bias concerns to investigations into tech
company market power. (Yes, I
[said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/congress-big-tech.html)
earlier this week not to pay attention to bias claims. But maybe pay
attention a little?)

Even if allegations of bias don’t cause the companies to lose customers,
the loss of faith among a large share of Americans should worry them.

It’s also a problem if the tech companies overcorrect. Facebook
employees and critics have said fears of being accused of bias have made
the company reluctant to crack down on people, including President
Trump, who spread dangerous or inflammatory messages online. It’s a fine
line to walk.

## Before we go …

  - **The really important stuff from the Big Tech hearing: House plants
    and bookshelves.** My colleague Mike Isaac [rated the tech bosses’
    choices of
    backgrounds](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony/tech-executives-looked-like-they-work-in-well-tech-offices)
    for their webcast testimony. Mike gave Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who sat
    in front of wooden shelves with a sprinkling of books and
    tchotchkes, a score of 8 out of 10 for his “cool Pacific Northwest
    dad office vibes.”

  - **Example infinity of technology as a flawed virus surveillance:** A
    Wall Street Journal technology columnist reviewed smart watches,
    internet-connected thermometers and other gizmos that say our heart
    rate readings or other bodily data can provide [early warnings of
    coronavirus
    infections](https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-you-have-covid-19-soon-your-smartwatch-or-smart-ring-might-tell-you-11595949072).
    Spoiler alert: Some of this stuff holds promise but needs further
    research, and we still need more laboratory virus testing.

  - **If you feel like screaming when you watch TV:** Rolling Stone [has
    a hilarious and smart rage
    fest](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/streaming-wars-user-experience-sepinwall-1031729/)
    on why the video streaming services can be so infuriating to use.
