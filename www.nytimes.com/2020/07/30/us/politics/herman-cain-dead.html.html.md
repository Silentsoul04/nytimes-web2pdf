Herman Cain, who rose from poverty in the segregated South to become
chief executive of a successful pizza chain and then thrust himself into
the national spotlight by seeking the 2012 Republican presidential
nomination, has died. He was 74.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His death was announced on Thursday [on his
website](https://hermancain.com/heartbroken-world-poorer-herman-cain-gone-lord/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thenewvoice&utm_content=2020-07-30)
and on social media accounts. It did not say precisely when or where he
died. Dan Calabrese, the website’s editor, attributed the death to the
coronavirus, which President Trump, in a White House briefing, later
referred to as the “China virus” and a “horrible plague” in affirming it
as the cause.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cain had been hospitalized in the Atlanta area this month after
testing positive for the virus on June 29.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We knew when he was first hospitalized with Covid-19 that this was
going to be a rough fight,” Mr. Calabrese said in the announcement,
adding, “Although he was basically pretty healthy in recent years, he
was still in a high-risk group because of his history with cancer.” Mr.
Cain had overcome colon and liver cancer in the mid-2000s.

Mr. Cain had attended President Trump’s indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla., on
June 20 and had done “a lot of traveling” recently, Mr. Calabrese said.

“I don’t think there’s any way to trace this to the one specific contact
that caused him to be infected,” he said at the time. “We’ll never
know.”

In a video posted to his website after the Tulsa rally, Mr. Cain [said
he had worn a
mask](https://hermancain.com/trump-tulsa-rally-i-was-there/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thenewvoice&utm_content=2020-06-22)
while he was in groups of people. But he also [posted
photographs](https://twitter.com/THEHermanCain/status/1274489632886075398?s=20)
of himself on social media that showed him without a mask and surrounded
by people in the arena. Later, after Mr. Trump had scheduled an event at
Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, Mr. Cain wrote approvingly on Twitter
that masks would not be mandatory. “PEOPLE ARE FED UP\!” he wrote.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On the stump, Mr. Cain called himself an ABC candidate — American Black
Conservative. He brought an irreverent style to the 2011 campaign as he
touted his by-the-bootstraps story in an appeal to Tea Party
conservatives.

his celebrity in conservative circles endured, and he became an ardent
ally of Mr. Trump.

Mr. Cain said he had become a Republican after a Black man at a
restaurant yelled out: “Black Republicans? There’s no such
thing.”

platform was best known for his[9-9-9 tax
plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/us/politics/herman-cains-tax-plan-changes-gop-primary-math.html):
a flat 9 percent individual income tax rate, a 9 percent corporate tax

After his campaign ended, he continued to appear at political
conferences and in the conservative news media. Once Mr. Trump took
office, Mr. Cain’s name was floated periodically as a potential addition
to the administration. President Trump considered naming him to a seat
on the [Federal Reserve
Board](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/trump-herman-cain-federal-reserve.html)
last year, but several Republican senators indicated that they would
vote against his confirmation, partly because of the sexual harassment
accusations against him. He withdrew his name.

After the announcement of his death, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House
press secretary, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Cain had “embodied the
American dream and represented the very best of the American spirit.”

Herman Cain was born on Dec. 13, 1945, in Memphis, to Lenora (Davis) and
Luther Cain. His mother was a cleaning woman and domestic worker; his
father, who grew up on a farm, worked as a janitor and a barber and as a
chauffeur for Robert W. Woodruff, president of the Coca-Cola Company,
which is based in Atlanta, where Herman was raised.

Herman graduated from historically Black Morehouse College in Atlanta in
1967 with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. He worked as a civilian
ballistics analyst for the Navy and earned his master’s degree in
computer science at Purdue University in 1971.

He married Gloria Etchison in 1968. She survives him, as do their
children, Melanie and Vincent, and four grandchildren. Mr. Cain’s
younger brother, Thurman L. Cain, died in 1999.

After finishing his education, Mr. Cain worked for Coca-Cola as a
computer systems analyst. He then moved to Minneapolis to work for
Pillsbury, and in 1978 he became an executive in the company’s
restaurant and foods
group.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At Pillsbury, Mr. Cain joined a training program at Burger King, a
company subsidiary, in which potential executives were trained from the
grill up, working as “Whopper floppers” and cleaning bathrooms. He rose
to oversee 400 Burger King franchises in the Philadelphia area, and his
success in improving their bottom line led Pillsbury to appoint him to
run its Godfather’s Pizza chain.

He served as chairman and chief executive of the chain from 1986 to 1996
and lived in Omaha, where the company was headquartered.

Mr. Cain first gained wide attention in 1994, when he had the chance to
spar with President Bill Clinton during a [nationally televised town
hall-style](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WP5dYfBBzU) meeting on
health care. Mr. Cain insisted that a broad Clinton health care plan
would cost jobs. “If I’m forced to do this,” he asked, “what will I tell
those people whose jobs I’m forced to eliminate?”

Their polite, if pointed, back and forth — Mr. Clinton pushed back with
calculations that Mr. Cain declared “incorrect” — made the pizza
executive a minor celebrity, particularly among conservatives.

One was Jack Kemp, a leading Republican member of Congress, who shared
Mr. Cain’s free-market views. In 1996, when Bob Dole, the Republican
nominee for president, chose Mr. Kemp as his running mate, Mr. Cain
became an adviser to their campaign.

He left the pizza company in 1996 and became president of the National
Restaurant Association, a once-sleepy trade group that he transformed
into a lobbying
powerhouse.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 3, 2020

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in

        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your

        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

At the time, anti-drunken-driving groups were trying to lower the legal
blood-alcohol limit to 0.08 percent from 0.10 percent, a change that
restaurant owners feared would hurt liquor sales. Mr. Cain called
instead for stiffer penalties for drunken driving. That argument drew a
pointed rebuke from Diane Riibe, a board member of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Mr. Cain and those he represents are in the business of selling
alcohol,” Ms. Riibe wrote, “not saving lives.”

The restaurant association gave Mr. Cain an intimate view of the way
Washington worked. And it helped him lay the groundwork for his first
entry into electoral politics, a short-lived bid for the White House in
2000.

After that, he became co-chairman of the businessman Steve Forbes’s
unsuccessful presidential campaign. And that same year, he moved back to
Georgia to concentrate on his motivational speaking business and to
write books espousing his business and political philosophies.

They included “Speak as a Leader: Develop the Better Speaker in You”
(1999), “CEO of Self: You’re in Charge” (2001) and “They Think You’re
Stupid: Why Democrats Lost Your Vote and What Republicans Must Do to
Keep It” (2005).

He sought the Republican nomination for the Senate from Georgia in 2004
but lost badly in the primary to Johnny Isakson, who went on to win the
general election.

Less than two years later, Mr. Cain received a diagnosis of late-stage
colon cancer, which had spread to his liver. He recovered, and he later
said he believed that his survival had shown that God had other plans
for him. He credited God with persuading him to run for president after
Barack Obama, a Democrat, took office in early 2009.

Mr. Cain published a memoir, “This Is Herman Cain\!,” in 2011, just as
he was saddling up again for a presidential run. Some critics said he
was [running for president to sell his
book,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/10/herman-cain-skips-out-on-early-states-to-push-his-new-book/246260/)
and his travel schedule, which rarely took him to the early voting
states of Iowa and New Hampshire, resembled a book tour more than a
serious campaign.

Still, he grabbed attention with his novel “9-9-9” plan. Thanks to the
strength of his debate performances and a [surprise
victory](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/herman-cain-wins-florida-straw-poll/ "post on The Caucus blog")
in a Florida straw poll in September, Mr. Cain did well in early
polling. He was essentially tied with Mitt Romney, the former
Massachusetts governor who had consistently led most polls and who
eventually became the Republican
nominee.

Mr. Cain’s political downfall came as swiftly as his ascent, after
[Politico
reported](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/10/exclusive-2-women-accused-cain-of-inappropriate-behavior-067194)that
the National Restaurant Association had paid settlements to two former
employees who claimed Mr. Cain had sexually harassed them.

Other complaints piled up. He called them smears dreamed up by his
opponents and categorically denied them.

Then came a complaint by a woman named Ginger White, who contended [that
she had had a 13-year extramarital
affair](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/us/politics/cain-accused-of-affair-by-ginger-white.html)
with Mr. Cain that ended shortly before he announced his presidential
bid. Ms. White produced phone records to prove that they had called or
texted each other frequently, and Mr. Cain acknowledged giving her
financial support. He said his wife of 43 years had been unaware of what
he insisted was only a friendship.

With Ms. White’s revelation, some of Mr. Cain’s supporters and defenders
began backing away, and he eventually dropped out.

The flurry of attention he received in his presidential run helped him
land a job as a radio host in 2013. He also wrote columns for Newsmax
and appeared as a commentator on Fox News.

During the 2016 election season, Mr. Trump, running as a businessman and
a brash political outsider, drew early comparisons to Mr. Cain. At a
time when many Republicans were skittish about Mr. Trump, Mr. Cain came
to his defense, pushing back against accusations that Mr. Trump was a
racist.

After Mr. Cain’s death was announced, Mr. Romney, now a senator from
Utah, took to Twitter to write: “Saddened that Herman Cain — a
formidable champion of business, politics and policy — has lost his
battle with Covid. St. Peter will soon hear ‘999\!’ Keep up the fight,
my friend.”
