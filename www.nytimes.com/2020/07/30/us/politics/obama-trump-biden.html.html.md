# Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden

</div>

Barack Obama has spoken candidly about President Trump to party donors,
bringing up the sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump and warning
of his efforts to push “nativist, racist, sexist” fears.

At fund-raising events where he has pulled in more than $24 million for
[Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)’s
campaign in the past two months, former President Barack Obama has
privately unleashed on [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
to party donors, bringing up past accusations of Mr. Trump’s “assaulting
women” and warning of his efforts to push “nativist, racist, sexist”
fears and resentments.

With less than 100 days until the [presidential
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-postpone-election.html),
Mr. Obama has laid out the stakes of 2020 in forceful fashion. He has
urged support for Mr. Biden, his former vice president, while worrying
about the state of American democracy itself, even making an oblique
reference to Nazi Germany, according to notes made from recordings of
Mr. Obama’s remarks, donors and others who have been on the calls.

Even three years out of office, Mr. Obama remains one of the Democratic
Party’s biggest draws for giant contributors and small donors alike. A
virtual conversation on Tuesday with the actor George Clooney sold out
of tickets that ranged from $250 to as much as $250,000. (The biggest
donors got access to a small “virtual clutch” with Mr. Obama.)

Donors who have paid six-figure sums to see Mr. Obama on Zoom — he held
two other, more intimate, conversations for donors with Reid Hoffman,
the founder of LinkedIn and a major Democratic donor, and J.B. Pritzker,
the billionaire governor of Illinois — have been privy to wide-ranging
Q. and A. sessions about the state of politics and unvarnished analysis
from the former president.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Tuesday evening, during the event with Mr. Clooney, Mr. Obama was
asked what keeps him up at night these days. He cited fears of voter
suppression and an effort by Mr. Trump to question the election’s
legitimacy.

Mr. Obama, who has [carefully calibrated his public
statements](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/obama-biden-trump.html)
since leaving office to avoid being pulled into one-on-one combat with a
current president looking for a foil, is considerably more caustic when
the cameras are off, according to people who have been on the calls and
notes made from recordings.

During his conversation with Mr. Pritzker, Mr. Obama spoke about how Mr.
Trump has a core base that “filters out any contradictory information.”

“It’s just glued to Fox News and Breitbart and Limbaugh and just this
conservative echo chamber — and so, they’re going to turn out to vote,”
Mr. Obama said. “What he has unleashed and what he continues to try to
tap into is the fears and anger and resentment of people who, in some
cases, really are having a tough time and have seen their prospects, or
communities where they left, declining. And Trump tries to tap into that
and redirect in nativist, racist, sexist ways.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Obama’s office did not dispute his private comments but declined to
comment further.

The former president dismissed Mr. Trump’s [continued focus on the
Confederate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-bubba-wallace-nascar.html)monuments
as a distraction amid the coronavirus pandemic — “that’s like his No. 1
priority” — but also characterized it as a menace that “gives you a
sense of what this is about.” He then pivoted to what those “darker
impulses” have wrought in history.

“The endpoint of that we saw in Europe 60 years ago, 70 years ago — what
happens when those things get unleashed,” Mr. Obama said, according to
the notes. “You don’t nip that in the bud, bad things can happen. Among
the most quote unquote civilized
societies.”

During the event with Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Obama called out Mr. Trump for
stoking “anti-Asian sentiment” when talking about the virus, [which the
president has
called](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html)
the “kung flu” and “Chinese virus.”

“That still shocks and pisses me off,” Mr. Obama said. He went even
further as he told the virtual crowd that he hoped his seriousness of
purpose was emanating through the screen.

“We already saw this guy win once,” he said. “After he bragged about
physically assaulting women — and that didn’t seem to matter. So, enough
said. Let’s get to work.”

Mr. Obama criticized Mr. Trump without naming him as he delivered the
eulogy at [Representative John Lewis’s
funeral](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/john-lewis-live-funeral.html)
on Thursday, saying Republican efforts to curtail voting rights had left
the electoral system under attack.

“Even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their
darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations
and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and
attacking our voting rights with surgical precision,” Mr. Obama said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“George Wallace may be gone,” the former president said, “but we can
witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons
against peaceful demonstrators.”

Mr. Obama [sat firmly on the
sidelines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/us/politics/obama-south-carolina-primary.html)
during the Democratic primary race but has mobilized to help his former
vice president. In addition to the four virtual events — his joint
appearance with Mr. Biden is still the campaign’s single biggest
fund-raising event — he has lent his name to digital solicitations that
are among the party’s highest-performing missives.

And Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden’s “socially distanced” video released last
week not only earned airtime on television news, but was also an
organizing tool for the campaign, which tripled email sign-ups in the 24
hours after its initial release, compared with the day before.

At the Democratic National Committee, the times that Mr. Obama signs
emails have been known internally as “Barack Obama days” for the influx
of contributions and for a reactivating effect among supporters.

“He’s obviously one of our most effective surrogates,” said Tom Perez,
the D.N.C. chairman, who hailed the efficiency of virtual fund-raisers
and moderated the conversation between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hoffman.

“The virtual context means you don’t have to put him and other
surrogates on a plane,” Mr. Perez said. “This just allows him to do more
events, more efficiently. That’s been a surprise.”

Mr. Obama is still said to be concerned that appearing in too many
virtual fund-raisers will blunt his impact over time — but he recently
told a former campaign aide that they were far easier than he expected,
taking only about an hour of his time, requiring no travel and providing
a cash return for the Biden team that exceeded his expectations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Obama’s first fund-raising appearances with Mr. Biden raised $11
million, including $7.6 million from smaller online contributors and
$3.4 million from big donors who got a more private session with the two
men, according to the Biden campaign. The Hoffman event raised $5.6
million and the Pritzker event more than $3 million, according to people
familiar with the
matter.

In his private fund-raisers, Mr. Obama has praised Mr. Biden’s character
and hailed him as a future “great president,” almost turning the tables
on donors and others who have tried to offer “constructive criticism” to
the Biden campaign given the stakes of the election.

“We have a worthy candidate and we have a worthy platform,” Mr. Obama
said. “But you know what, let’s not be so sophisticated that we are
constantly finding reasons why this isn’t good enough or the candidate’s
not doing this or the campaign seems to not be getting that quite
right.”

D.N.C. officials and Biden campaign aides have tried, gingerly, to
enlist Michelle Obama to appear in her own online fund-raisers. But the
former first lady, who has been focusing her energy on other projects
like a new podcast, has told people in her orbit that she does not
consider herself a political player. She has committed to virtually
appearing at the Democratic National Convention but signaled she would
engage more in the campaign at a time and in a fashion of her choosing.

So far, Mrs. Obama has neither headlined high-dollar fund-raisers nor
signed messages to email lists for Mr. Biden and the D.N.C.

In a window into the Obamas’ contrasting approaches, Mr. Obama [tweeted
a link](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1287417455447552002) on
Sunday to the Democratic Party’s iwillvote.com voter registration
portal, noting that it was 100 days until the election. That tweet,
along with a link by the model Kendall Jenner to her 135 million
Instagram followers, drove [more than 100,000
visitors](https://twitter.com/MegDiMartino/status/1287571323246583812).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That day — within minutes of Mr. Obama’s post — Mrs. Obama also
[posted](https://twitter.com/MichelleObama/status/1287419441320517633) a
video urging people to register to vote on Twitter. But she linked to
her own nonpartisan nonprofit, When We All Vote.

“Where we disagree is usually you just think things just have to get
super, super bad before folks figure stuff out,” Mr. Obama told Mrs.
Obama on her podcast, which debuted on Wednesday.

“Well, I hope we’re at that point,” she said, before adding, “We’ll
figure it out before we crash into the sun.”

Mrs. Obama’s office declined to comment.

Mr. Clooney, appearing on Tuesday in a blazer and an unbuttoned white
dress shirt, framed this year’s election as a simple choice.

“Like, this is easy,” he said. “There’s two candidates here. One claims
that our first Black president wasn’t a citizen, and the other was his
vice
president.”
