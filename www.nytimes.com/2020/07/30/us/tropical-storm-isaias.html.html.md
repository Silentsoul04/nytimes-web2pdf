Isaias, the ninth named storm system of the busy 2020 hurricane season,
strengthened into a hurricane early Friday morning, according to the
National Hurricane Center.

The storm, which battered parts of Puerto Rico and the Dominican
Republic on Thursday, was expected to travel up the eastern [coast of
Florida](https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1288945960547123210)
and [continue
north](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/234050.shtml?key_messages#contents),
potentially bringing heavy winds, rain and flash flooding, [according to
the
center](https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1289128870101184514).

On Friday morning, Isaias was southeast of the Bahamas and moving
northwest at 17 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of 80 m.p.h.
The storm was lashing the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos
Islands with strong winds and heavy squalls, the center
said.

A hurricane warning was issued for the northwestern Bahamas, and
tropical storm conditions were possible for the east coast of Florida on
Saturday.

The center said there were risks from winds, heavy rainfall and storm
surge late this weekend on the northeastern Florida coast and northward
along the East Coast through early next week. The “entire U.S. East
Coast should monitor” Isaias, the center said.

On Wednesday, the Florida Division of Emergency Management announced
that all state-sponsored coronavirus testing sites would close at 5 p.m.
Thursday. The department later said that state-sponsored sites in 11
counties [would remain
open](https://twitter.com/FLSERT/status/1288974249194147840).

The other sites would be closed until it was safe to reopen, which is
expected to be no later than 8 a.m. Wednesday, [according to a
statement](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/FLDEM/bulletins/297ef6d).

“All sites have free-standing structures including tents and other
equipment, which cannot withstand tropical storm force winds, and could
cause damage to people and property if not secured,” the statement said.

As the storm passes through the state, testing sites will reopen on a
rolling basis, and symptomatic Floridians were encouraged to pick up a
self-swab test from any of the [testing
sites](https://floridadisaster.org/covid19/testing-sites/).

On Wednesday alone, Florida reported more than 9,400 new coronavirus
cases and 216 deaths. There have been [more than 461,000
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/florida-coronavirus-cases.html)
of coronavirus and more than 6,500 deaths since the beginning of the
pandemic in the state, a New York Times database
shows.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

Emergency managers this year have been wary of [what might happen if a
major hurricane strikes during the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/us/hurricane-pandemic-coronavirus-florida.html).
Evacuation orders often put people in close contact with one another in
shelters, which would make maintaining social distancing and other
safety measures against the virus difficult to maintain.

Over the weekend, officials in Hawaii worried that space at shelters
could be limited because of social distancing policies if [Hurricane
Douglas](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/hurricane-douglas-hawaii.html)
hit the islands grimly. The American Red Cross also faced obstacles
recruiting volunteers to run the state’s shelters because of anxieties
surrounding exposure to the coronavirus.

Last week, Hanna [hit the southern coastal region of Texas as a
Category 1
hurricane](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/us/hanna-storm-texas.html),
taking aim at some of the same communities that have seen a sudden spike
in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. As the storm neared the coast,
the mayor of Corpus Christi urged people who had taken in relatives to
wear masks in their homes; San Antonio opened a reception center for
people who had fled their homes, where officials handed out vouchers for
hotel rooms.

The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30,
has been a busy one. The first tropical storm was Arthur, [which formed
off the coast of Florida in
May](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/us/tropical-storm-arthur-2020-path.html),
followed by
[Bertha](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/bertha-storm.html), which
made landfall near Charleston, S.C., later that month. The systems made
2020 the sixth year in a row that a storm developed before the official
start of the season.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [predicted an above
normal Atlantic hurricane
season](https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/busy-atlantic-hurricane-season-predicted-for-2020),
with as many as 19 named storms — of which six to 10 could become
hurricanes. And three to six of those could develop into Category 3, 4
or 5 hurricanes.

An average hurricane season usually produces 12 named storms, with six
becoming hurricanes and three of those six developing into major
hurricanes.

An analysis of observational data of satellite images since 1979 by
researchers suggests that [climate
change](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/climate/climate-changes-hurricane-intensity.html)
is making hurricanes stronger and more destructive.
