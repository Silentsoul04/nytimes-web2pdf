## As states scramble to put out fires, Fauci and other top U.S. health officials will go back before Congress.

Two days after U.S. deaths surpassed 150,000, three familiar federal
health officials, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, will return to Capitol
Hill to testify in front of a new audience: the House’s special select
committee investigating the Trump administration’s response to the
pandemic.

Dr. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, will be joined on
Friday morning by Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, and Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the
assistant secretary for health and the administration’s point person on
coronavirus testing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The hearing begins at 9 a.m. and will be streamed online by The New York
Times.

The three witnesses last testified a month ago before lawmakers in the
Republican-controlled Senate, when the subject was school reopenings.

But the Democrat-led House select committee has had a hard time securing
Dr. Fauci and his colleagues as witnesses. The Trump administration
initially refused to make them available to the panel before relenting
to the demands of Democrats.

The hearing is taking place as states across the country are reimposing
limits amid a resurgence of cases — a turn of events reflected in the
title lawmakers gave the hearing: “The Urgent Need for a National Plan
to Contain the Coronavirus.”

The session is expected to center on three overlapping subjects:
testing, vaccines and the push in some quarters to send children back to
school. On Thursday, the president, meeting with reporters, again
stressed his desire for students to return to the classroom.

With President Trump clearly intent on announcing promising vaccine
news, it has fallen to<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Dr.
Fauci to offer reassurances that the federal government is moving
quickly but safely.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Redfield will most likely be asked about the C.D.C.’s shift on
reopening schools. The agency’s[recently published
guidelines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/health/cdc-schools-coronavirus.html)
tilt strongly toward reopening, listing numerous benefits of in-person
education and playing down the potential health risks.

For Admiral Giroir. the questions are likely to focus on the delays in
test results across the South, where local health officials have
complained of excruciating wait times.

The coronavirus panel was established this spring by Speaker Nancy
Pelosi in large part to put a check on how the federal government is
spending the trillions of dollars in emergency
aid.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>But its mandate has
broadened to include a panoply of issues, including [racial disparities
in the
pandemic](https://coronavirus.house.gov/subcommittee-activity/briefings/coronavirus-panel-hold-member-briefing-racial-health-disparities)
and [nursing home
outbreaks](https://coronavirus.house.gov/subcommittee-activity/briefings/devastating-impact-coronavirus-crisis-america-s-nursing-homes).

The panel includes some of the most fiery members of the House,
including Representative Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who has been a
regular skeptic of Dr. Fauci and public health mandates, including mask
wearing.

A number of prominent House Democrats who sit on the panel are also not
known for shying away from conflict, including the chairman of the
committee, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, and
Representative Maxine Waters of California.

The hearing will take place one day after Florida and Arizona broke
their single-day records for deaths from the virus, reporting 253 and
158, respectively, on Thursday. Mississippi also set a record, with 48
deaths. That state and three others —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Missouri, Hawaii and Ohio — set single-day records for new
cases.

The coronavirus pandemic’s unrelenting toll came into sharper focus on
Thursday as the United States announced that it had suffered its [worst
economic contraction on
record](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
this spring, several states reported record numbers of deaths as the
nation mourned
[150,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/coronavirus-deaths-150000.html)
and an [impasse in
Washington](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/30/upshot/coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html)
threatened to leave millions of jobless Americans facing the loss of
federal aid.

As the Senate continued its stalemate ahead of Friday’s expiration of
the weekly $600 in federal jobless aid, President Trump, whose unsteady
handling of the virus has left him trailing in the polls, floated the
idea of changing the date of the presidential election — which he has no
authority to do, and which instantly drew [rare rebukes from top
Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

The president, who has been pushing for schools across the country to
reopen for in-person instruction and calling on more governors to reopen
their states even as federal data shows [serious outbreaks across many
states](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/28/us/states-report-virus-response-july-26.html),
broached the idea on Twitter, writing, “Delay the Election until people
can properly, securely and safely vote???”

And as the U.S. surpassed 150,000 deaths, the [highest toll of any
nation in the
world,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
Arizona, California, Florida and Mississippi all set records this week
for the most deaths they have reported in a single day. Herman Cain, the
businessman who made a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in
2012, died of the virus.

Arizona reported 158 new deaths on Thursday, a single-day record,
according to a New York Times database. Florida set death records three
days in a row this week, hitting its latest record, 253, on Thursday.
And California saw back-to-back records, with 172 deaths reported on
Tuesday and 192 on Wednesday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent days the number of new cases in those states have stopped
spiking, but the virus continues to spread widely and infect thousands
of people. On average, in Arizona, there have been about 2,500 new cases
a day; in California, more than 9,000 new cases a day; and more than
10,000 a day in Florida, which leads the country with the most new cases
[per 100,000 in the past
week](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
according to the Times
database.

Top Democrats on Thursday rejected the Trump administration’s proposal
for a short-term agreement to address the looming expiration of enhanced
unemployment benefits, administration officials said.

Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Mark Meadows, the White
House chief of staff, spent nearly two hours in the Capitol Hill suite
of Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, along with Senator Chuck Schumer
of New York, the minority leader, where the two Democrats “made clear
they don’t want to do that,” Mr. Mnuchin said afterward.

“Our proposals were not received warmly,” Mr. Meadows said afterward,
later adding, “I wouldn’t say that optimism is the word I would
characterize in negotiations.”

Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said they had insisted that any agreement
needed to be broad and comprehensive. “We just don’t think they
understand the gravity of the problem,” Mr. Schumer told reporters.

“I think they understand that we have to have a bill,” Ms. Pelosi added,
“but they just don’t realize how big it has to be.”

With negotiations over the broader recovery package stalled, Senate
Republicans tried to pass the stand-alone bill, which would have
continued the extra jobless aid payments through the end of the year,
but slash them to $200 a week from $600.

Democrats blocked the effort and instead tried to pass the $3 trillion
stimulus measure the House approved in May, which includes an extension
of the full $600 benefit through January.

Republicans blocked that legislation, dismissing it as too costly and
too broad in scope.

The group of negotiators plan to continue talks on Friday, either by
phone or in person.

Cases in New Jersey, which recently plunged to their lowest levels since
the pandemic began, are rising again.

Just a week ago, New Jersey recorded its lowest seven-day average of new
daily cases — 224 — since the numbers peaked in the state in early
April, according to [a database maintained by The New York
Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html)
But cases have been rising since then, and the state has averaged 416
cases per day over the past week.

The increase, which came after the state moved to ease a number of
restrictions, has worried elected leaders and public health officials,
who say that young people who are enjoying summer parties are not taking
enough precautions.

A party that dozens of Long Beach Island lifeguards attended has been
linked to 35 cases of the virus, according to the state’s health
commissioner. A house party in Middletown, N.J., has been blamed for 65
new cases; 52 of the people infected were between the ages of 15 and 19,
Gov. Philip D. Murphy said. Judith M. Persichilli, the state health
commissioner, [said
Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqLsxnOmEAc) that 15 Rutgers
football players had tested positive.

And a house party in Jackson, N.J., about 65 miles south of Manhattan,
drew more than 700 people on Sunday night, leading the police to issue
tickets to its organizers. More than 100 cars were parked outside, and
it took the police more than five hours to clear the
scene.

Officials with the governor’s office noted that despite the uptick, New
Jersey continues to be among the six states with the [fewest new daily
infections](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#states)
per 100,000 residents. Some of the increase in the past week also can be
linked to a lag in testing results, which they said are sometimes
delivered in large bulk batches, skewing the daily case counts.

Perry N. Halkitis, an epidemiologist and dean of the Rutgers School of
Public Health, agreed the delay in testing results muddies the daily
data report. But he said the seven-day trend is alarming.

“It’s time for us to say, ‘Indicators are bad,’” Professor Halkitis
said. “People are just gathering with no thought in mind.”

He added, “It’s almost like we have to re-pause, right now, before it
gets too late.”

Here’s what else is happening around the United States:

  - **Wisconsin**’s governor announced on Thursday that he will require
    people to wear face coverings indoors starting Saturday and strongly
    recommends that people wear them outdoors and when they cannot
    social distance.

  - Public schools in **Washington, D.C.,** will all rely on remote
    teaching until Nov. 6, the mayor said on Thursday. The Washington
    Teachers’ Union had petitioned the mayor to issue the order, as
    cases in the Washington metropolitan region continued to tick
    upward.

Education officials in New York City, [one of the few large districts in
the country that are still planning to open schools in the
fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html),
laid out a plan on Thursday for what would happen in the seemingly
inevitable event that cases of the coronavirus are confirmed in a
classroom.

The protocol means it is likely that at many of the city’s 1,800
schools, individual classrooms or even entire buildings will be closed
at points during the school year. Although the city’s test positivity
rate and caseload are relatively low, many public health experts expect
those numbers to tick up this fall, whether or not schools reopen.

Officials said confirmed infections among students, teachers and staff
members would be treated the same. One or two confirmed cases in a
single classroom would require those classes to close for 14 days; all
students and staff members in that classroom would be ordered to
self-quarantine, and students would learn remotely. The rest of the
school would continue to operate.

But if two or more people in different classrooms in the same school
tested positive, the entire building would close while disease
detectives from the city’s Department of Health were brought in to
investigate the cases, which could take several days. Depending on the
results of the investigation, the building could reopen, but the
classrooms with positive cases would remain closed for 14 days.

If disease detectives were not able to find a link between two or more
confirmed cases in a building, including exposure to the virus outside
of school, the entire building would remain shuttered for two weeks.

[New York City is currently planning to reopen its schools on a hybrid
model starting
Sept. 10](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html),
with students reporting to classrooms one to three days a week to allow
for social distancing. All staff members will be asked to take
coronavirus tests before the start of school, with expedited results.

Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration[faced enormous criticism for
waiting until mid-March to close
schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/nyregion/nyc-school-reopening-plan.html),
after the virus had already begun to spread significantly throughout the
city, which soon became a global center of the crisis. Throughout March,
when a student or staff member tested positive, the school would
automatically close for 24 hours for cleaning, a protocol that many
parents and teachers said was too lax.

Other states, including California, have announced less stringent
policies for how to manage positive cases in schools. But most

communities.

Herman Cain, who [made a
bid](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/us/politics/herman-cain-suspends-his-presidential-campaign.html)
for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2012 race and was a
recent contender for a top Federal Reserve job, [died after being
hospitalized with the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/herman-cain-dead.html),
according to [an
announcement](https://hermancain.com/heartbroken-world-poorer-herman-cain-gone-lord/?ff_source=twitter&ff_medium=thenewvoice&ff_content=2020-07-30)
posted to his personal website and on his verified social media
[accounts](https://twitter.com/THEHermanCain).

Mr. Cain, 74, was the former chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza. Mr.
Trump [said
in 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/business/herman-cain-federal-reserve.html)
that he was planning to nominate him to the Federal Reserve Board, but
Mr. Cain [withdrew his
name](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/trump-herman-cain-federal-reserve.html)
as he battled old accusations of sexual harassment, the same ones that
had halted his earlier presidential campaign.

“We knew when he was first hospitalized with Covid-19 that this was
going to be a rough fight,” Dan Calabrese, editor of
[HermanCain.com](http://hermancain.com/), wrote on the website.
“Although he was basically pretty healthy in recent years, he was
still in a high-risk group because of his history with cancer.”

In 2018, Mr. Cain formed the America Fighting Back political action
committee, which had a mission of publicly rebutting what he believes is
misinformation about Mr. Trump.

He [was admitted to a hospital with the coronavirus at the beginning of
July](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/herman-cain-coronavirus.html).
Mr. Cain attended Mr. Trump’s indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20.
A few hours before the event, the Trump campaign
[disclosed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/politics/tulsa-trump-rally.html?searchResultPosition=64)
that six staff members who had been working on the rally had tested
positive during a routine screening. Two members of the Secret Service
also tested positive there, people familiar with the matter said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a video on his website, Mr. Cain described the rally and [said he had
worn a
mask](https://hermancain.com/trump-tulsa-rally-i-was-there/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thenewvoice&utm_content=2020-06-22)
while in groups of people. But he also [posted
photographs](https://twitter.com/THEHermanCain/status/1274489632886075398?s=20)
of himself on social media that showed him without a mask and surrounded
by people in the arena.

The statement on Mr. Cain’s Twitter account in early July announcing he
had tested positive said that there was “no way of knowing for sure how
or where Mr. Cain contracted the coronavirus.”

Mr. Cain, who was an official surrogate for Trump’s 2020 re-election
campaign, [wrote an op-ed after the
rally](https://www.westernjournal.com/herman-cain-tulsa-trump-rally-crowd-huge-enthusiastic/?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=PostTopSharingButtons&amp;utm_campaign=websitesharingbuttons)
in which he defended the event, writing, “The media worked very hard to
scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday
night in Tulsa.”

On July 8, the top health official in Tulsa said that a surge in cases
in and around Tulsa [was probably connected to Mr. Trump’s campaign
rally](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/coronavirus-tulsa-trump-rally.html).

Mrs. Bolsonaro is the latest prominent figure in Brasília to get the

The president’s office disclosed her illness a day after Brazil reported
a record number of virus deaths. The government nevertheless decided to

March. A decree published on Wednesday night said visitors were now
allowed to fly to Brazil as long as they could prove that they were
covered by health insurance for the duration of their trip.

Other countries in Latin America, like Argentina and Colombia — which
are reporting far fewer cases than Brazil — are keeping their borders
closed to international flights.

Travelers crossing the border through land and sea are still barred,
with some exceptions, and most incoming foreigners are still are not
allowed at international airports in five of Brazil’s 27 states. The
government didn’t offer an explanation for its decision.

Brazil has now reported more than 90,000 deaths and 2.5 million cases,
the highest figures after the United States.

    would now be mandatory for Manila residents. Mr. Duterte said that
    he expects China to develop a vaccine by December, and that he would
    distribute a vaccine for free.

Tabaski, the Senegalese version of Eid al-Adha, is the biggest religious
celebration of the year in a country that is about 95 percent Muslim.
Properly celebrating it requires a sacrificial sheep.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But [government-imposed measures to contain the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/africa/senegal-tabaski-sheep-eid-adha.html)
— borders closing, markets shuttering and travel severely restricted —
have been financially devastating for many people. The sheep, a purchase
of great cultural and social significance, is beyond reach for many this
year.

The sheep’s role in the Tabaski celebration is far more central than
just providing a meal. Eid al-Adha honors the story of Ibrahim, whom God
asked to sacrifice his cherished son, Ismail, but then told him at the
last minute he could swap in a ram.

This year, in an effort to alleviate worries about catching the virus at
in-person markets, the livestock ministry set up a Tinder-like digital
matchmaking site where sellers could post appealing photos of their
sheep. Buyers were able to swipe left or right through hundreds of sheep
profiles, and then arrange a deal for the preferred animal, skipping
hours of risky face-to-face haggling.

But even if a would-be buyer finds a sheep, it may not be affordable. A
$140 sheep last year now costs more than $170, with the hike
attributable to the ripple effects of virus restrictions.

About half of Senegal’s Tabaski sheep come from neighboring Mali and
Mauritania. Until late June, all the herds were stuck on the other side
of the border. And even though the bovid border has been reopened, the
expected surge of sheep has not materialized. One reason is that sheep
now must be transported only in trucks, and many drivers are charging
twice as much as usual to move the
animals.

Mr. Trump said Thursday that a renewed economic shutdown to contain the
virus is “not a viable option” for responding to the recent surge in
case numbers nationwide.

“The primary purpose of a shutdown was to ‘flatten the curve,’” to
prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed and to buy time for new
treatments and therapies, Mr. Trump said in a briefing at the White
House.

“And we’ve done that,” he said.

Mr. Trump allowed that “a small shutdown of certain areas” might be
helpful for short periods. A federal report issued this week urged state
officials to impose more restrictions to try to curb the spread in 21
states considered to be in the “red zone” of outbreaks.

“A blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is
certainly not a viable long-term strategy for any country,” said Mr.
Trump, who noted that several U.S. states that once appeared to have
contained the virus, including California, have recently seen a steep
rise in cases.

Mr. Trump continued to press for schools to reopen, claiming that “young
people are almost immune” to the virus.

While it is true that only a very small percentage of children have
shown symptoms and tested positive for the virus, there is a growing
body of evidence that children can spread the virus to others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A large [study from South
Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-children-schools.html)
found that children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 can
spread the virus at least as well as adults do, and that while children
younger than 10 transmit to others much less often than adults do, the
risk is not zero.

And a small
[study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952)
published on Thursday found that infected children may have at least as
much of the virus in their noses and throats as infected adults, and
that children younger than 5 may host up to 100 times as much of the
virus in the upper respiratory tract as adults.

That [does not necessarily mean that children are passing the virus to
others](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html).
Still, the findings should factor into the debate over reopening
schools, several experts said.

“I’ve heard lots of people saying, ‘Well, kids aren’t susceptible, kids
don’t get infected.’ And this clearly shows that’s not true,” said
Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital.

Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of goods and services
produced — fell 9.5 **** percent in the second quarter, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. On an annualized basis, G.D.P. fell at a rate
of 32.9 percent.

The collapse was unprecedented in its speed and breathtaking in its
severity. By comparison, economic output fell 4 percent during the
entirety of the Great Recession a decade ago — and took 18 months to
sink that far. The only possible comparisons in modern American history
came during the Great Depression and the demobilization after World War
II, both of which occurred before the advent of modern economic
statistics.

What’s more, fears are growing that after rebounding strongly in May and
June, the economy has run out of steam, with many states closing
businesses again after coronavirus cases surged.

Also on Thursday, the government reported that 1.43 million **** people
filed new claims for state unemployment benefits.

It was the 19th straight week that the tally exceeded a million, an
unheard-of figure before the coronavirus

Europe had nearly 50 percent more deaths than normal at the peak of the
outbreak, according to [data compiled by
Britain’s](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020)
and [France’s](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4637552) national
statistics agencies, with tens of thousands more people dying the last
week of March and the first week of April than in previous years.

As Europe [became the center of the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-center-lessons.html)
in the late winter and early spring, many countries implemented
nationwide lockdowns, which was already killing thousands. Most of the
[excess
deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html)
were in four big, hard-hit countries — Britain, Italy, Spain and France.

In their worst weeks, Belgium, England, France and Spain all had more
than twice as many deaths than was usual for the time of year.

England had the second-highest peak mortality after Spain in Europe, and
“the longest continuous period of excess mortality,” according to a
report published by Britain’s Office for National Statistics on
Wednesday. Britain had registered over [55,000 confirmed
deaths](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales)
as of mid-July, and is the worst-hit country in Europe.

Although European countries encountered wide discrepancies in their
excess deaths, most saw a rise over the course of two deadly weeks, from
March 30 to April 12. During the last week of March, the deadliest
across Europe with 33,000 excess deaths, Spain alone registered over
12,500 more deaths than would be expected when compared with data from
2016 to 2019, a 155 percent increase, and Italy over 6,500, according to
data provided by the French national statistics agency, INSEE. The
following week, Belgium recorded over 2,000 excess deaths, an increase
of nearly 110 percent compared with data from previous years.

The virus has [depleted nursing
homes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/world/europe/Spain-coronavirus-nursing-homes.html)

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

United Nations diplomats have said that this year’s annual General
Assembly would sharply be scaled back and that much of it would be held
virtually, with leaders of the 193 member states delivering speeches via
recorded messages. It would be the first time in the 75-year history of
the United Nations that the leaders will not gather physically for what
is known as the high-level week, the world’s biggest diplomatic stage,
scheduled to start on Sept. 22.

The American ambassador, Kelly Craft, suggested that Mr. Trump might be
the exception and come anyway, as leader of the host country. “We’re
hoping that President Trump will be speaking in person in the General

Holliday, a former American diplomat and president of [Meridian
International](https://www.meridian.org/), a nonprofit group that
promotes diplomacy. “He will be the only world leader that will be
speaking in person.”

There was no immediate confirmation from the White House press office
concerning Mr. Trump’s General Assembly plans.

The president of the General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of
Nigeria, said last month that it would be impractical for world leaders
to attend the high-level event this year, given that most of them travel
with enormous retinues of aides, making it difficult or impossible to
adhere to the social-distancing requirements of the pandemic. “We cannot
have them in person as we used to,” Mr. Muhammad-Bande said, referring
to the past 74 years of the annual
event.

## The Supreme Court won’t allow electronic signatures for an Idaho ballot initiative.

The Supreme Court on Thursday [blocked a judge’s
order](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/20a18_f2qg.pdf) that
would have allowed a group proposing a ballot initiative in Idaho to
collect signatures electronically because of the pandemic.

The group, Reclaim Idaho, seeks to place a measure that would increase
spending on education on the November ballot. State law requires
hard-copy signatures.

The court’s brief order was unsigned, and the vote count was impossible
to determine. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., joined by Justices
Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, issued an
opinion setting out his reasoning.

A stay of the Federal District Court judge’s order was warranted, the
chief justice wrote, because the Supreme Court is likely to overturn it.
The order, he wrote, placed an unacceptable burden on state election
administrators.

“In addition to preparing for elections with a record number of absentee
ballot requests,” the chief justice wrote, “the county clerks must now
also learn, under extraordinary time pressures, how to verify digital
signatures through an entirely new system mandated by the district
court.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
dissented, saying that the justices should have waited for an appeals
court to rule before intervening in the case. This was, she added, part
of an unfortunate pattern.

“By jumping ahead of the court of appeals,” she wrote, “this court once
again forgets that it is ‘a court of review, not of first view’ and
undermines the public’s expectation that its highest court will act only
after considered
deliberation.”

A [new
analysis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20153049v1)
of one of the most mysterious and dramatic virus outbreaks — aboard the
Diamond Princess cruise ship early this year — points to small, floating
droplets as a primary driver of virus transmission.

The analysis used computer simulations to model the outbreak on the
ship, in the same way disease modelers have reconstructed the virus’s
spread with computer modeling. It found that small, floating particles
accounted for about 60 percent of new infections on the Diamond
Princess.

The new findings, if confirmed, would have major implications for making
indoor spaces safer and choosing among a panoply of personal protective
equipment.

The computer modeling adds a new dimension of support to an accumulating
body of evidence implicating small, airborne droplets in multiple
outbreaks, including at a [Chinese
restaurant](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/health/airflow-coronavirus-restaurants.html)
and among [choir members in Washington
State](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20132027v2).

“Many people have argued that airborne transmission is happening, but no
one had numbers for it,” said Parham Azimi, an indoor-air researcher at
Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the lead author of the
study. “In this paper, we provide the first real estimates for what that
number could be, at least in the case of this cruise ship.”

One researcher not involved in the study, Julian Tang, an honorary
associate professor of respiratory sciences at the University of
Leicester in the United Kingdom, said the paper was “the first attempt,
as far as I know, to formally compare the different routes of
coronavirus transmission, especially of short versus long-range
aerosols.”

The virus has been spreading rapidly in four of six key [battleground
states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/upshot/poll-2020-biden-battlegrounds.html)
crucial to the presidential election in November —
[Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/arizona-coronavirus-cases.html),
[Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/florida-coronavirus-cases.html),
[North
Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/north-carolina-coronavirus-cases.html)
and
[Wisconsin](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/wisconsin-coronavirus-cases.html).
The states are among 21 recently declared to be in the “red zone” in a
[report by the federal
government](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/28/us/states-report-virus-response-july-26.html)
because of the substantial number of new virus cases reported there each
day.

If the presumptive Democratic nominee and former vice president, Joseph
R. Biden Jr., wins the states won by Hillary Clinton four years ago,
many combinations of [any three of six swing
states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/trump-swing-voters.html)
would be enough to defeat Mr. Trump. In addition to the four swing
states labeled “red zones,” the list includes
[Michigan](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/michigan-coronavirus-cases.html)
and
[Pennsylvania](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/pennsylvania-coronavirus-cases.html),
which have not seen major spikes in cases in recent weeks.

Already many states are revisiting their mail-in voting policies, so
that voters will not have to go to polling stations and risk infection.
The six swing states have either always allowed relatively easy mail-in
voting or have recently made it easier. [Currently, eight
states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/vote-by-mail-states/)
allow mail-in or absentee ballots only with an approved excuse. The
issue continues to be a point of contention between Democrats and
Republicans.

[Mr. Trump on
Thursday](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1288818160389558273)
raised the idea of delaying the election until people could “properly,
securely and safely vote???”[The president, however, does
not](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/us/politics/kushner-election-november.html)
have the authority to delay Election Day, which by law [takes place the
Tuesday after the first Monday in
November](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/28th-congress/session-2/c28s2ch1.pdf).

A [recent New York Times
analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/upshot/polling-trump-virus-election.html)
also suggests that the increasing number of virus-related deaths is
damaging Republican support in some
communities.

[A
study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952)
published on Thursday introduced an unwelcome wrinkle into the narrative
about how young children are affected by the virus. Infected children
have at least as much of the virus in their noses and throats as
infected adults, according to the research.

Indeed, children younger than 5 may host up to 100 times as much of the
virus in the upper respiratory tract as adults, the authors found.

That measurement [does not necessarily prove children are passing the
virus to
others](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html).
Still, the findings should factor into the debate over reopening
schools, several experts said.

“I’ve heard lots of people saying, ‘Well, kids aren’t susceptible, kids
don’t get infected.’ And this clearly shows that’s not true,” said
Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital.

The researchers analyzed samples collected with nasopharyngeal swabs
from March 23 to April 27 at drive-through testing sites in Chicago and
from people who came to the hospital for any reason, including symptoms
of Covid-19.

They looked at swabs taken from 145 people: 46 children younger than age
5; 51 children ages 5 to 17; and 48 adults ages 18 to 65. Older children
and adults had similar levels of genetic fragments of the virus, by one
important measure. Children younger than 5 had significantly lower
levels. Still, the upper limit of the range was comparable to that of
older children and adults.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The study is not without caveats: It was small, and did not specify the
participants’ race or sex, or whether they had underlying conditions.
The tests looked for viral RNA, genetic pieces of the coronavirus,
rather than the live virus itself. (Its genetic material is RNA, not
DNA.)

Still, experts were alarmed to learn that young children may carry
significant amounts of the coronavirus.

The World Health Organization on Thursday announced that it had formed a
“behavior group,” an international panel of scientists from fields like
psychology, economics and anthropology, to advise people on how best to
influence and sustain habits that prevent the transmission of the
coronavirus.

In a conference call with reporters, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the
W.H.O.’s director general, said the group included 22 experts from 16
countries and would be led by Cass Sunstein, a legal scholar at Harvard
Law School who has studied and written widely about mass behavior
change.

At a time when coronavirus cases are surging in many communities where
people were ignoring mask requirements and social-distancing rules,
understanding what drives healthy decisions is crucial, Dr. Ghebreyesus
said. “We are learning what works and what doesn’t,” he said, “and
that’s why behavioral science is so important — it helps us know how
people make these decisions.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Sunstein, appearing by video at the conference, said: “One of the
few things we know, which is quite important, is that habits are
persistent even if they’re not healthy. But habits can be altered, and
that can save lives.”

Asked to be specific about potential measures, Mr. Sunstein demurred.
“There are data points and evidence” to inform the best approaches, he
said, “but there are 22 people looking at those now,” adding, “We do
have great precedents, significant successes, where public health
messages have changed lives.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Outbreaks have swept through three Alaska fish-processing facilities and
a factory trawler in recent weeks, stressing an industry already facing
an unstable market for seafood.

Roughly 26,000 processing workers head to plants in Alaska each year,
the bulk of them in the summertime. Many work the red salmon season out
of Bristol Bay, the largest red salmon fishery in the world and the
source of most of America’s wild-caught salmon.

Conditions in fish plants mirror those in meat-processing plants, with
people living together and working long shifts in close quarters. Alaska
put in place strict procedures and required monitoring, quarantining and
testing out of concern that processing workers and fishermen, many who
come from out of state, [would spread the virus into Alaskan
communities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/us/coronavirus-alaska-fishing-copper-river.html).

Alaska’s case total stayed low until July. But as cases began to spike
in recent weeks, resident workers — not those from other states —
brought the virus into fish plants, said Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief
medical officer. “It unfortunately has taken off pretty quickly,” she
said. “It’s so hard to mitigate the spread once you get it in the
plant.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Alaska has had 20 deaths and about 3,500 cases, [according to a New York
Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/alaska-coronavirus-cases.html).

At the Copper River Seafoods plant in Anchorage, 76 out of 135 people
had tested positive as of Wednesday, Dr. Zink said. In Seward, a small
town south of Anchorage, 139 out of 252 workers tested positive. And the
American Triumph, a factory trawler that docked in Dutch Harbor, had 85
cases out of the 119 people on board, she said.

Outbreaks at plants force production to cease while facilities are
cleaned and workers are tested, further pressing a salmon industry that
analysts say is facing decreased restaurant demand and a glut in the
retail
sector.

Australia has recorded its deadliest day since the pandemic began, with
13 deaths reported on Wednesday, all in the southern state of Victoria,
which also had 723 new cases. A total of 21 new cases were recorded in
other states, as the authorities tightened borders and local
restrictions.

The record numbers are largely the result of outbreaks in nursing homes,
as well as people going into work while symptomatic, the authorities
said.

“This is incredibly serious. And every time somebody doesn’t do the
right thing, every time somebody contributes to the spread of the virus,
then that means that another family will be having to plan a funeral,”
Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, told reporters at a news
conference on Thursday.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Unless everyone plays their part, this lockdown will not end anytime
soon,” he added.

While Australia’s figures pale in comparison to the tens of thousands of
new cases each day in the United States, they are significant in a
country that had appeared to contain the virus to manageable levels
before an outbreak in early July, which [is thought to have spread from
hotel
quarantine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/world/australia/melbourne-coronavirus-outbreak.html)
facilities in Melbourne.

Masks, which the health authorities had advised only for those
experiencing symptoms, have since become mandatory in the city. Starting
on Sunday they will be enforced across the state of Victoria, where
[restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/world/australia/melbourne-lockdown-readers.html)
on private gatherings have also increased.

“We have now been in this lockdown now for some weeks, and we are not
getting the results we would hope for,” Australia’s prime minister,
Scott Morrison, told reporters in Canberra. The high rates of community
transmission, he added, were of “great
concern.”

On Wednesday, she went home from the hospital.

“I’m pretty sure that if I had been at another center, they would have
just ended care and let me die,” she said in an interview on Wednesday.

Ms. Ramirez is one of a small but growing number of patients whose lungs
have been destroyed by the coronavirus, and whose only hope of survival
is a lung transplant.

The surgery is considered a desperate measure, and is reserved for
people with fatal, irreversible lung damage. Doctors do not want to
remove a person’s lungs if there is any chance they will heal. Over all,
only [about 2,700 lung
transplants](https://unos.org/data/transplant-trends/) were performed in
the United States last year.

Patients must be sick enough to need a transplant, and yet also strong
enough to recover from the operation. With a new disease, doctors are
still learning how to strike that balance.

“It’s such a paradigm change,” said Dr. Ankit Bharat, who operated on
Ms. Ramirez. “Lung transplant has not been considered a treatment option
for an infectious disease, so people need to get a little bit more of a
comfort level with it.”
