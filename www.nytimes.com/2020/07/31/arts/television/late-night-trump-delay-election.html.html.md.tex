About?'}\label{jimmy-fallon-to-trump-how-long-a-delay-are-we-talking-about}}

Fallon wonders just how far back he wants to push the election:
``Months, like your response to Covid? Years, like your response to
Putin? Or decades, like a hug for Don Jr.?''

Trailing badly in the polls, President Trump on Thursday
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-delay-2020-election.html}{floated
the idea of postponing the election} (which he can't do), claiming on
Twitter that voting by mail would cause major problems (for which
there's no evidence).

\begin{quote}
With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020
will be the most INACCURATE \& FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will
be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can
properly, securely and safely vote???

--- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)

``It's the presidential election. It's not the release date for `Bill \&
Ted 3,''' Jimmy Fallon said on ``The Tonight Show.'' He compared Trump
to ``that friend who's been crashing at your house for a while but keeps
dropping hints he might need some more time.''

\begin{quote}
``If he can't deny it, pretty soon he'll be like, \emph{{[}as Trump{]}}
`Republicans should all vote on Nov. 3, but we'll have Democrats vote at
a later date T.B.D.''' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``Americans were like, `How long a delay are we talking about here?
Months, like your response to Covid? Years, like your response to Putin?
Or decades, like a hug for Don Jr.? Just give us a hint.''' \emph{---
JIMMY FALLON}

``I'm not even sure that Trump understands what an alarming proposal
this is. Because this is basically the move of a dictator. Trump is just
casually throwing it out there with a tweet with a bunch of question
marks, like he's in a group text to bail on happy hour. *{[}as Trump{]}
`*Hey, y'all, Nov. 3rd's not great for me --- maybe we reschedule to
2021?'' \emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``And by the way, media, yes, there are some Republicans saying the
election will happen on time. Stop giving them credit for that. That's
not a courageous stand. It's just the bare minimum. Just because the bar
is all the way on the floor doesn't mean we have to give them credit for
stepping over it. It's like if your burnout son gets an `F' on a history
final and you say, `Look who showed up and took the test. I'm so proud
of you, Scooch!''' \emph{--- SETH MEYERS}

\begin{quote}
``So with the economy in crisis mode and deaths continuing to soar,
obviously this is all bad for President Trump's re-election hopes. And
today, Trump came up with a brilliant new strategy for the election:
Just don't have one.'' \emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}

``President Trump on Twitter this morning suggested postponing
November's presidential election, but just until the Republican Party
can find a viable candidate.'' \emph{--- SETH MEYERS}

``That's right, Trump isn't actually allowed to delay the election.
Although not being allowed to do something has never stopped him
before.'' \emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}

``No, he can't reschedule the election. For starters, both candidates
are like 200 years old --- I mean, we gotta keep things moving.''
\emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}

``When they saw Trump's tweet, JetBlue was like, `Trust us --- when he
says delayed, he means canceled.''' \emph{--- JIMMY FALLON}

``We'll still have the election on Nov. 3, but he'll probably just add a
hundred days to August. And sure, maybe the court overturns it, but that
might not happen until August 73rd.'' \emph{--- TREVOR NOAH}
