**BIOGRAPHY OF RESISTANCE**

In “Biography of Resistance,” Zaman considers antibiotics as the major
weapon for killing bacterial pathogens — and the ways in which this war
has backfired. Bacteria and fungi have been producing antibiotics for
many hundreds of millions of years. Relatively recently, humans figured
out that they could co-opt some of these to control pathogenic bacteria.
Doing so saved millions of lives. But it also increased the commonness
of resistant bacteria, that is, bacteria that are impervious to
antibiotics and, as a result, difficult to kill. “Biography of
Resistance” profiles these bacteria, but also the people who study them.
It is a useful, engaging opus.

There are now resistant strains of the bacteria that cause tuberculosis
and other disease, but also resistant malaria protists, bedbugs, head
lice, crop pests and even garden weeds. Zaman tells the stories of
researchers working to understand the evolution, and to a lesser extent
ecology, of bacterial resistance and when and why it emerges. Resistance
is ancient (resistant bacteria can be found deep in caves beyond the
reach of human influence), but it has taken on new forms and dynamics in
light of the ways in which we have wielded antibiotics.

Zaman’s book includes histories of key moments in microbiology,
reminders of how fast our perspectives on the microscopic world have
evolved. When Anton van Leeuwenhoek first discovered microbial life in
the 1600s, he imagined it to be wondrous and mostly beneficial. Once
Louis Pasteur discovered that microbes could both make us sick and make
beer, he came to see some species as dangerous but others as beneficial.
Then once we developed antibiotics, scientists began to talk more often
about a “war on germs,” in which germs were understood to be faceless,
dangerous creatures all around us. With these increasingly resistant
strains, the germs now seem to be taking this war seriously.

Zaman considers the impact of microbes globally. Meanwhile, Hamblin’s
new book, “Clean,” is an ode to the invisible world laid out between his
toes and in his armpits. Hamblin focuses on the skin, including that of
his own body. Just as Pasteur and others revealed that some microscopic
species could be dangerous, and long before antibiotics were discovered
in the early 20th century, it became clear that lives could be saved
through simple interventions that helped reduce the abundance of those
dangerous species.

Hand washing has saved hundreds of millions of lives, as has the
availability of drinking water that is free of pathogens (conversely,
the lack of access to such drinking water endangers millions still
today). The goal of these interventions is not to make hands sterile
(one can’t) and to make water sterile (almost none is), but instead to
control problem pathogens. But the cosmetics industry and other
purveyors of solutions and creams came to recognize, as Hamblin
documents, an opportunity to sell products and lifestyles that not only
removed all germs but, just to be on the safe side, offered total and
complete cleanliness as a goal. This, Hamblin concludes, actually just
made us rashy and sick in new kinds of ways. And so begins the odyssey
upon which Hamblin embarked.

While trying to understand his own skin, Hamblin stopped bathing, though
he did still wash his hands and drink clean water. He does not use his
personal experiment as evidence, so much as a way to drive the
narrative. The writing is fun, interesting and credible, that of a
science journalist trying to make sense of the biology of bodies and how
they work in daily life. If Zaman’s book is about war, Hamblin’s is more
about finding ways to make peace, not with pathogens but instead with
our own bodies and the majority of species on and in them, species on
which, he comes to see, we depend for survival and well-being. That
peace can include “products,” just more carefully chosen ones.
Tellingly, the cover of Hamblin’s book bears a fancy soap dispenser that
appears to be dispensing dirt.

**THE SENSITIVES**

Just as some biological environments are more healthful than others, so
too are some chemical environments better for us than others.
Understanding just which combinations of chemicals are good and which
are bad and at what concentrations is challenging. Fortunately, many
thousands of toxicologists, sociologists, epidemiologists and biologists
have made it their lives’ work to try to get to some answers. And,
unfortunately, many people don’t trust them.

In “The Sensitives,” Broudy zeros in on a group of people who have
decided, on their own, that all of the chemistry associated with modern,
industrial life is making them sick. These individuals are “sensitive”
to everything from plastic to perfume, which they have deemed toxic, and
have abandoned science and the medical system to find places where they
feel well — something akin to the paleodiet but for chemistry.

“The Sensitives” is at its best when Broudy is chronicling the very real
challenges of his subjects. Sensitives are united by the belief that
they are suffering from “Environmental Illness.” E.I. is not recognized
as a disease by any major medical organization. Those who self-diagnose
with the disease suffer a grab bag of debilitating symptoms and are
united by struggles to find clinicians able to help them. Broudy’s book
is moved along by a kind of medical travel narrative as Broudy searches
with one sensitive, James, for another, Brian, who has found a haven
from what he believes to be the toxins of the world. Broudy’s writing
inspires real empathy for the individuals he chronicles, individuals who
can’t seem to get well or get help.

Where the book fails is in its implied conclusions. Broudy leaves the
reader feeling as though in dealing with E.I. or any set of mysterious
symptoms, science and self-diagnosis are just the same. At a moment when
our collective well-being depends upon the public’s trust in experts, in
their knowledge about pathogens and the civilization-saving value of
vaccines, this is a very dangerous sentiment.
