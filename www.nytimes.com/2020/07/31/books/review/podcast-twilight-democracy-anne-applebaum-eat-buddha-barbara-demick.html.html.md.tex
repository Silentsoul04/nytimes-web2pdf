In her new book,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/books/review/twilight-of-democracy-anne-applebaum.html}{``Twilight
of Democracy,''} Anne Applebaum writes about the ``seductive lure of
authoritarianism'' in democracies. And she considers the role of
writers, television producers, spin doctors and others in helping to
enable that seduction in places like Poland, France, Britain and the
United States.

``None of these situations are identical,'' Applebaum says. ``What I
wanted was for the different countries I look at in the book to kind of
echo one another, rather than being the same. You can see some elements
of similarity. For example, almost all of these radical right movements
are born out of something that I describe as cultural despair or
sometimes as a kind of apocalyptic pessimism. The intellectuals behind
them are often people who are disappointed with the country that they
live in and the civilization as it is now.''

Barbara Demick visits the podcast to talk about her new book,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/books/review/eat-the-buddha-barbara-demick.html}{``Eat
the Buddha: Life and Death in a Tibetan Town.''} Among other things,
Demick, the former Beijing bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times, talks
about what draws her to a subject.

``My previous book had been about North Korea, and I guess I'm attracted
to mysteries,'' she says. ``I feel that so much of the world we know
about from Google Earth and Maps and YouTube, and we feel like we can
see everything everywhere, but Tibet was just such a mystery to me. It
was difficult to travel to, it was difficult to get permission to go to
the Tibetan areas, and the culture was so unfamiliar to most Westerners;
Westerners like me, who are not Buddhist. It challenged me and it
intrigued me.''

Also on this week's episode, Alexandra Alter talks about the books
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/books/hilary-mantel-booker-prize-longlist.html}{longlisted
for this year's Booker Prize}; and Tina Jordan and John Williams talk
about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
