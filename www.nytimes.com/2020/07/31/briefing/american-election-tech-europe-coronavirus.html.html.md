## England had the worst surge in virus deaths

A government report released on Thursday found that [Britain had the
highest rate of excess deaths of any European
country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/world/europe/UK-deaths-coronavirus-europe.html)
during the pandemic — even worse than hard-hit nations like Italy and
Spain.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The grim analysis comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put many
other countries under a travel quarantine, highlighting their struggle
to control new infections.

Critics said Mr. Johnson was trying to deflect attention from his
initial sluggish response to the pandemic, which they said had left the
country equally vulnerable to a resurgence.

**Details:** Mr. Johnson has linked Britain’s high death toll to
record-keeping variances among nations. But the statistics office, which
produced the report, said it had avoided those pitfalls by examining
mortality rates across Europe from all causes from January to June and
then comparing them to previous years.

**In other news:**

## The economy worsens, and Trump suggests election delay

Trailing badly in the polls and facing an economic meltdown, President
Trump [suggested on Thursday that the November election be
delayed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html),
something he has no authority to order. Only the U.S. Congress can
determine the timing of the election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president made the suggestion in a tweet, repeating his false claim
that widespread mail-in voting would result in a “fraudulent” result.

**Context:** Minutes before his tweet, data was released showing that
the G.D.P. [fell 9.5 percent during the three months ending June 30 —
the largest quarterly drop on
record](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).
On Wednesday, the U.S. death toll from the pandemic reached 150,000, the
world’s highest. Polls show Mr. Trump trailing Joe Biden, the former
vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee.

**The response:** None of Mr. Trump’s allies agreed. “Never in the
history of the country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War,
have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time,” Senator
Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said. “And we’ll find a way to do
that again this Nov.
3.”

## Europe’s new tactics to limit tech giants

Europe’s lawmakers and regulators have moved to a new stage in [their
battle to limit the power of the world’s biggest tech
companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/europe-new-phase-tech-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html).
Existing antitrust laws and multibillion-dollar penalties have not gone
far enough, officials say.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, the bloc’s leaders are pursuing a new law that would make it
illegal for Amazon and Apple to push their products over those sold by
rivals on their online stores.

British officials are working on laws that would make Facebook’s
services work more easily with rival social networks and would push
Google to share search data with smaller competitors. And the German
authorities are debating a rule that would let regulators halt certain
business practices at tech companies during an antitrust investigation.

**Context:** Europe has started its legal blitz just as momentum is
growing in the United States for the authorities there to flex their own
tech regulatory muscles — a double whammy for tech giants. If the
proposed laws in Europe are enacted, the policies could lead to an
overhaul of the region’s digital
economy.

would be withheld is modest, the exclusion of the towns was intended to
have a deeper symbolic resonance.

### And now for the Back Story on …

## Theater for beginners, and below

*Alexis Soloski, a theater critic, missed going to shows so much that
she enrolled in online classes to see if she could develop her theater
skills at home. She spent two weeks in a homemade theater training
program. Here’s an* [*excerpt from her essay about
it*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/theater/theater-classes-at-home.html)*.*

I started with vocal work, arranging a voice lesson via Broadway Plus, a
concierge service that used to arrange V.I.P. access to Broadway
performances and has since pivoted to online meet-and-greets and private
lessons.

After polling friends about a good song for a nice lady with a
Playbill-slim range and a shaky grasp of pitch, I picked “Sonya Alone,”
from “[Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet
of 1812](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/theater/natasha-pierre-and-the-great-comet-of-1812-review.html).”
I rehearsed when I could — in the shower, cooking dinner, under my
breath at various playgrounds. By the time the lesson came around, I had
it down.

Though I once won a limbo contest at a classmate’s bar mitzvah, dance
has also never been my thing. Still, I figured that Beginner Theater
Dance, which I signed up for through Ailey Extension, couldn’t be so
hard. I figured
wrong.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We warmed up to selections from “The Lion King” and “The Prince of
Egypt.” I even learned a Fosse hip roll. But as we danced to “No Day but
Today,” the “Rent” finale, the ballet terms — passé, coupé, rond de
jambe — proliferated and the eight counts came worryingly fast. Though I
had positioned my laptop camera so that it showed me only from the rib
cage up, I couldn’t even fake the arms.

Maybe that’s because, as I soon learned, a level exists even below
Beginner. That level is Basic. So am I. The following week, I tried
Steps on Broadway’s Basic Theater Dance.

The instructor, Tera-Lee Pollin, a Broadway veteran with inhuman
exuberance, guided a handful of students through “Waterloo,” the curtain
number for “Mamma Mia\!” and a song about defeat. Together, delightedly,
we ponied, we swam, we grapevined. No jambes were ronded.

So, yes, any amateur with enough time and resilience and discretionary
income can probably learn theater basics remotely. The alchemy of live
acting before a live audience almost comes through onscreen — but not
quite. Until it can, I will think of the thousands and thousands of
people in their homes, practicing their pentameter, arabesques and key
changes, waiting for curtains to rise.
