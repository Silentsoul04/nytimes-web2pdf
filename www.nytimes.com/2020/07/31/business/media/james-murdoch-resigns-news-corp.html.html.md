# James Murdoch Resigns From News Corp, Ending Role in Family Empire

</div>

While his elder brother, Lachlan Murdoch, rises in the family business,
James Murdoch has grown more distant from his father’s companies.

James Murdoch wants the world to know he is out of the family business.

Once considered a potential successor to Rupert Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch on
Friday resigned from the board of the newspaper publisher News Corp,
severing his last corporate tie to his father’s global media empire.

“My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content
published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic
decisions,” Mr. Murdoch, 47, [wrote in his resignation
letter](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/james-murdoch-s-resignation-letter/5d16f07153370f9d/full.pdf),
which News Corp disclosed in a filing shortly after the close of
business on Friday.

The two sides began discussing Mr. Murdoch’s departure from the News
Corp board earlier this year, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter.

But his terse resignation note belied the behind-the-scenes drama that
has brought Mr. Murdoch to this point in his life and career. And it
widened the schism that has emerged between James and his 89-year-old
father and his older brother, Lachlan, once a dynastic triumvirate that
for years held sweeping influence over the world’s cultural and
political affairs.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A political outlier in his conservative-leaning family, James Murdoch
has sought to reinvent himself as an independent investor with a focus
on causes more closely associated with liberals, like environmentalism,
which he and his wife, [Kathryn
Murdoch](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/climate/kathryn-murdoch-climate-change-voting.html),
have long championed.

He has also taken public stands against President Trump, who has counted
Fox News, a prime Murdoch asset, among his closest media allies.

Weeks ago, James and his wife jointly contributed more than $1 million
to a fund-raising committee for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden
Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. And in February,
as [wildfires
raged](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/australia/fires-size-climate.html)
across Australia — his father’s birthplace — Mr. Murdoch issued a rebuke
of his own family’s media properties,
[criticizing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/business/dealbook/james-murdoch-environment.html)
how Murdoch publications have covered climate change.

Such public gestures came after a period when James Murdoch’s hopes of
succeeding his father at the helm of a worldwide empire had been all but
extinguished.

He had already departed the Fox Corporation, the family’s television and
entertainment arm, which was mostly dismantled after his family
transferred many of its assets to the Walt Disney Company in [a
blockbuster
sale](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/business/media/disney-fox-merger-vote.html)
that was completed last year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His last formal link to the family business was through News Corp, which
publishes influential broadsheets like The Wall Street Journal as well
as powerful tabloids, including The Sun of London and The New York Post.
The company also oversees several other papers in Britain and
publications in Australia.

The London-born, Harvard-educated Mr. Murdoch remains a beneficiary of
his family’s trust, meaning he will continue to financially benefit from
the profits of Rupert Murdoch’s news and information assets.

And although his resignation letter cited “certain editorial content,”
Mr. Murdoch did not speak specifically about Fox News, the hugely
profitable cable channel where prime-time hosts like Sean Hannity and
Laura Ingraham openly cheerlead for Mr. Trump.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Murdoch declined to comment further on the reasons
for his departure, saying the letter “speaks for itself.”

Rupert, who holds the title of executive chairman at News Corp, and
Lachlan Murdoch, the co-chairman, said in a joint statement on Friday:
“We’re grateful to James for his many years of service to the company.
We wish him the very best in his future endeavors.”

James Murdoch’s drift from his family began in earnest during the early
part of the Trump era, around the time Lachlan was consolidating power
and becoming seen more widely as their father’s preferred successor.

There had been discussions about James Murdoch taking a powerful new
role at Disney after the completion of the Fox sale, but those talks
came to nothing. His 48-year-old brother was named the executive
chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Corporation, which includes
Fox News, Fox Business and the Fox sports networks.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

James Murdoch was the chief executive of 21st Century Fox from 2015
until it was sold to Disney, and he netted $2 billion from the sale. He
opened his own investment firm and named it Lupa Systems. (In Roman
mythology, Lupa is the wolf goddess who nurtured Romulus and Remus, the
twin brothers who became the founders of Rome.)

The firm specializes in early stage start-ups and has focused on
sustainability projects, extending efforts that Mr. Murdoch made at Sky,
the European satellite giant that was [formerly part of the Murdoch
empire](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45654792), and his financial
support of the National Geographic Society’s endowment fund.

Mr. Murdoch has also taken a starkly different tack with his media
investments. In October, he [bought a small stake in Vice
Media](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/business/media/james-murdoch-vice-media.html),
the irreverent — and decidedly liberal — news brand focused on youth and
entertainment. He has been less interested in traditional media
businesses.

In August, Mr. Murdoch led a consortium of investors to buy a
controlling stake in Tribeca Enterprises, which owns the Tribeca Film
Festival as well as a production studio. He also put money into
[Artists, Writers &
Artisans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/arts/awa-comic-books-publisher.html),
a new comics publisher founded by former Marvel executives.

In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was a chief figure in the [phone hacking
scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/british-phone-hacking-scandal-leveson-report)
that led to the closure of News of the World, one of the Murdochs’
flagship properties, and strained his relationship with his father. At
the time, Mr. Murdoch was in charge of the family’s holdings across
Europe, including the British newspapers that were behind the hacks.

Called before a Parliamentary committee investigating the matter, he was
confronted with an email that appeared to show his knowledge of the
hacking; Mr. Murdoch said he had not read the entire email chain. The
committee chided James and his father for “willful blindness” about the
company’s behavior.

The scandal dinged Mr. Murdoch’s credibility in London, and he soon
relocated to New York to help run his father’s businesses there, where
he focused on the Fox television empire and made investments in digital
ad technology.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This latest twist in the Murdoch saga is likely to show up in the myriad
pop culture products that depict the family’s corporate and personal
dramas. The 2019 film “Bombshell” portrayed the Murdoch brothers pushing
out Roger Ailes, the founder of Fox News, after revelations of sexual
harassment and abuse at the network. In Britain, a new BBC documentary
series, “The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty,” has offered a searing review
of the family’s exploits.

Perhaps best known is the HBO series
“[Succession](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/business/media/hbo-succession-business.html),”
which chronicles a Murdoch-like media family led by an aging patriarch
who pits his children against one another, sometimes in cruel ways.
Asked in an email exchange last year if he was a fan of the show, James
Murdoch pleaded ignorance.

“I’ve never watched it,” he wrote.
