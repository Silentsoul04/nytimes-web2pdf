Hello and welcome to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/column/five-weeknight-dishes}{Five
Weeknight Dishes}. Somehow, we have arrived at July 31, the month gone
in a flash. Let's keep things low-key this week: That sweet and drowsy
August feeling is about to set in. Ideas? Thoughts? You can find me at
\href{mailto:dearemily@nytimes.com}{\nolinkurl{dearemily@nytimes.com}}.

Here are five dishes for the week:

\textbf{1.}

Chicken}}

A four-ingredient recipe (not counting salt and pepper) is a weeknight
gift. This one, by Ali Slagle, uses the same mayo-marinating technique
that
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/dining/mayo-meat-marinade.html}{J.
Kenji López-Alt wrote about} to bolster the lime and ginger flavors ---
and no, you won't taste the mayo.

Bean and Avocado Salad With Garlic Oil}}

This salad, by Corinne Trang, is a simple, light and very fast
vegetarian dinner built on canned beans. Take care when you're cooking
the garlic: You don't want it to truly brown in the oil, and that will
happen quickly. If you want to add more heft, toss in shredded chicken
or smoked salmon or trout.

Shrimp Scampi With Tomatoes and Corn}}

The shrimp scampi we know in the United States is an Italian technique
adapted for American ingredients; Ali Slagle has adapted it further by
tossing sweet corn and cherry tomatoes into the pan. An ideal
high-summer dinner.

Baked Feta With Broccolini, Tomatoes and Lemon}}

A genius vegetarian supper from Yasmin Fahr: Roast slices of feta with
an array of vegetables, the tangy, bright cheese a contrast to all those
other hues and textures on the pan. Serve over orzo or farro, the
vegetables whole or cut up.

Sausage Sandwiches}}

We had something very much like this Melissa Clark recipe for dinner on
Wednesday, with a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014851-tomato-and-watermelon-salad}{tomato
salad} on the side. It was so good I had to tell you about it. The
sausages could be grilled, roasted or pan-fried. You could skip the
cheese if you're not using the oven, or melt it in the roll on the
grill.
