Living in a picturesque farmhouse on many acres of land may sound like a
dream to some. But many couples who live and work on fully functioning
farms know it's anything but glamorous. Tending to the day-to-day
demands of a farm, including caring for several different animals, can
take a toll on any relationship.
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/style/modern-love-spending-tenderness-on-animals.html}{In
this week's Modern Love essay}, Bethany Groff Dorau, a writer who grew
up on a farm, questions whether her city slicker husband is cut out for
the rural life. Then they decide to adopt three sheep.

In the five decades since the legalization of interracial marriage in
the United States, many interracial couples,

Renee Knake and Wallace B. Jefferson}, thank Mildred Loving and Richard
Loving, who effectively challenged interracial marriage laws in the
1960s.

Ms. Knake and Mr. Jefferson were married July 4 outside of the Michigan
governor's summer residence on Mackinac Island, Mich., where they paid
homage to the Lovings during their ceremony by sharing statements
dedicated to their fight for interracial marriage. ``I can't imagine
what it would be like to be so profoundly and deeply in love as I am
with this man and to have to feel like I was committing a crime,'' Ms.
Knake said.
