Shakuntala Devi (1929-2013) was best known as “the human computer” for
her ability to perform lengthy calculations in her head, swiftly. One
example of this, described in [her New York Times
obituary,](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/world/asia/shakuntala-devi-human-computer-dies-in-india-at-83.html)
took place in 1977, at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where
she extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds. It took
a Univac computer 62 seconds to do the same.

Now, her life story has inspired the Hindi-language film “Shakuntala
Devi,” [streaming on Amazon Prime
Video](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B08D71WWXD/ref=atv_dl_rdr?autoplay=1).
Starring the veteran Bollywood actress Vidya Balan as Devi, the film is
directed by Anu Menon and tells the story of Devi’s life from the
perspective of her daughter, Anupama Banerji. Played by Sanya Malhotra,
Banerji was involved in the making of the film.

Here are five facts about Devi you may not
know.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### **1. Devi holds the** **[Guinness World Record](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/67741-human-computation)** **for “Fastest Human Computation.”**

In 1980, she correctly multiplied two 13-digit numbers in just 28
seconds at Imperial College London. The feat, also included in [her
obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/world/asia/shakuntala-devi-human-computer-dies-in-india-at-83.html),
earned her a place in the 1982 edition of the Guinness Book of World
Records. It was even more remarkable because it included the time it
took Devi to recite the 26-digit solution. (The numbers, selected at
random by a computer, were 7,686,369,774,870 and 2,465,099,745,779. The
answer was 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In one famous interview on the BBC in 1950 ([recreated in the
biopic](https://youtu.be/8q6ekdz30MA)), her answer to a mathematical
question was deemed incorrect, before the host later acknowledged that
in fact, the computer’s answer was wrong and Devi was right.

### **2. She was an ally of L.G.B.T.Q. people.**

In 1960, Devi married Paritosh Banerji. They divorced years later, and
the 2001 documentary “[For Straights
Only](https://youtu.be/jMvfkzgzK0c)” claimed the marriage fell apart
because Banerji was gay. Devi said in the documentary that she set out
to learn more about the challenges faced by L.G.B.T.Q. individuals to
promote wider acceptance. In 1977, she wrote “The World of Homosexuals,”
which featured her research findings, including interviews with same-sex
couples in India and abroad.

“It is not the individual whose sexual relations depart from the social
custom who is immoral — but those are immoral who would penalize him for
being different,” she wrote in the book.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### **3. She applied her mathematical strength to a pursuit of astrology.**

Perhaps because of her fascination with numbers, Devi tried her hand at
astrology, which is highly revered in Indian culture. “Personal
Astrologer of Presidents, Prime Ministers, Royalty, Movie Stars and Top
Business Tycoons of the world is now available for Astrological
Consultations” [a newspaper
ad](https://www.infoqueenbee.com/2013/11/biography-of-human-computer-shakunthala.html)
claimed at the time. She similarly [toured the
world](https://www.nytimes.com/news/the-lives-they-lived/2013/12/21/shakuntala-devi/),
according to a Times article, seeing up to 60 clients a day. They would
give her a date of birth, time of birth and birthplace, and she would
answer three questions about their lives. She also wrote a book called
“Astrology for You.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### **4. She wrote a novel.**

When Devi stopped touring the world doing shows featuring her arithmetic
prowess, she wrote several books on math and her techniques, including
“Puzzles to Puzzle You,” “Super Memory: It Can Be Yours” and
“Mathability: Awaken the Math Genius in Your Child.” But decades
prior, in 1976, Devi also wrote a crime thriller called “[Perfect
Murder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18212970-perfect-murder).”
Written entirely in the first-person, the story explores what happens
when a lawyer, motivated by greed, decides to kill his wife to escape
the marriage.

### **5. She once tried to forge a path into politics.**

In 1980, Devi ran for Parliament, the Lok Sabha, as an independent
candidate from two different localities — Mumbai and Medak (in the
present-day state of Telangana). In Medak, her main opponent was the
former prime minister, Indira Gandhi, whom Devi had openly criticized.
Her fame, however, didn’t translate into votes, and she finished ninth,
while Gandhi went on to win and became prime minister once again.
