<div class="css-53u6y8">

In December, before most of us had directed our attention to the looming
terrors of the coronavirus, Earl Russell was already getting
apprehensive. At 42, he struggled with high blood pressure and was
living in a men’s shelter in Brooklyn. Most people in shelters are there
because all their other housing options have run dry, but Mr. Russell
had somewhere to go — an apartment in the Rockaways where his girlfriend
lived with their 6-year-old daughter, both of whom wanted him home.

The bizarre vagaries of New York state’s parole system were making it
impossible for him to join them, however. Returning to his family would
have been a violation of the terms of his prison release — an action
punishable with jail time.

When Mr. Russell was paroled in 2018, after two years in prison on a
weapons-possession charge in the second degree, he was remanded to the
shelter system, where he was to remain until the fall of 2021, even
though he would be needlessly taking up space in the midst of the city’s
ongoing and epic housing emergencies.

At the end of March, in an effort to curtail the spread of Covid-19
among the incarcerated, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced plans to release
1,100 people from jails around the state, who were being held for
technical violations of their parole. These infractions are not crimes;
they include missing curfew, failing to contact parole officers at
designated times, testing positive for alcohol and living at addresses
other than the ones compelled, among others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two months later, 379 of these technical parole violators had been
released from jails in New York City. But their ranks were soon
replaced. Mr. Russell was among those who found themselves at Rikers,
detained for what logic would concede were minor infractions..

Since March 27, according to new admissions data from the [Vera
Institute of Justice](https://www.vera.org/), 295 people have returned
to city jails because of low-level parole transgressions. The first two
people to die of Covid-19 on Rikers were there precisely for these
reasons: missing parole appointments and failing a drug program. One of
them, a man named [Raymond
Rivera](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/nyregion/rikers-coronavirus-deaths-parolees.html),
had waited months for a final decision on his release and died the day
after it was rendered.

Already, by the end of May, [160 people had been newly sent to
Rikers](https://justicelab.columbia.edu/two-months-later) on
technicalities, leading Vincent Schiraldi, a director of Columbia
University’s Justice Lab and the city’s former probation commissioner,
to correctly predict that some of the gains made by the governor’s edict
would essentially be erased by the middle of the
summer.

“It was bad policy to be incarcerating so many people for noncriminal
violations even before the pandemic,” Mr. Schiraldi told me. “It’s
absolutely ridiculous and dangerous now.”

The policy has been in place for decades. When asked for the rationale
behind it, the State Department of Corrections did not respond for
comment. In the spring, as the decision was made to refrain from issuing
arrest warrants for those who had broken the less egregious rules of
parole, certain exceptions were carved out for those considered at high
risk for offending behaviors.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Given that incidents of domestic violence were sure to rise during the
pandemic, anyone who made contact with a partner he or she had abused in
the past was eligible for re-arrest, an official in the Cuomo
administration explained. So too, was a sex offender who made contact
with a minor.

The modern parole system began in New York State in the 19th century as
a means of helping ex-convicts adjust to society. Parole officers were
volunteers; the whole idea was rooted in a benevolent paternalism.

But in the 1970s, as crime escalated, the system became more punitive
.tThe faith that people who did bad things could transform began to
wane, and the goal shifted to preventing recidivism. While the state has
succeeded in detaining far fewer people on technicalities in recent
years, the policy, exercised at the discretion of corrections officials,
nevertheless remains.

In a speech two years ago, Governor Cuomo acknowledged the problems
inherent in it. “Jails and prisons should not be filled with people who
may have violated the conditions of their parole but present no danger
to our communities,” he said. New York State spends hundreds of millions
of dollars each year enforcing these violations. “Cops troll hospitals
looking for violators,’’ Mr. Schiraldi said. “While the guy is dying,
they slap a technical on him. At a certain point you routinize the
deprivation of people’s liberties so much, you’re just checking a box.”

That routinization comes with all the predictable disparities. In New
York City, [Black people re-enter the jail system on these
technicalities at a rate more than 12 times that of
whites.](https://www.katalcenter.org/lessismoreny)

Before Christmas, Mr. Russell, who had already violated his parole on
other occasions by leaving the shelter and going home to his family,
sent a text to his parole officer explaining that he could not tolerate
his circumstance any longer and might as well be in jail. “With this
being said,” he wrote her, “send me back if that’s what you want to do
because I’m not returning to the shelter.’’ He helpfully provided his
home
address.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

The logic behind sending him to a shelter to serve out his parole, in
the first place, involved a single domestic-violence charge that had
been filed against him years earlier. One evening in 2013, Mr. Russell
and his current girlfriend were drinking on their stoop and began to
argue. According to his recollection, the fight did not get physical,
but a neighbor called the police and once officers arrived, he became
“unruly’' with them, he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a matter of precaution, it is common for the state’s corrections
department to send parolees with any history of domestic incidents to
shelters rather than allow them to go home. In Mr. Russell’s case, it
did not seem to matter that he had received mandated counseling. The
system demands rehabilitation and then all too often denies redemption.
In March of last year, his girlfriend wrote to parole officials asking
them to let Mr. Russell come home. The request was denied.

In mid-June he was taken into custody and spent the subsequent few weeks
in Rikers.

“It was scary. A lot of the corrections officers aren’t wearing masks,”
Mr. Russell told me. “Ninety percent of inmates weren’t wearing masks.
Then you’re shackled next to people when you are transferred,’’ he said.
“Beds were less than a pinkie apart. Sleeping, the guy beneath me, my
foot could have kicked his head.”

The Legal Aid Society eventually got him out. Mr. Russell works as a
porter in a condominium building in the Ozone Park section of Queens,
and his bosses wrote a letter on his behalf explaining that they would
welcome him back if he were released.

When he left Rikers, though, he was sent back to a shelter — a hotel in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, far from his job and his family. Making it back
in time for curfew made it almost impossible to see his partner for
dinner or put his daughter to bed. Because parolees are not allowed to
drive, he is left incurring the risks and lags of public transportation.

A bill currently before the New York State Legislature would loosen many
of the restrictions around parole, making it easier for people exiting
the prison system to reintegrate into the real world. Many prosecutors
across the state support the bill.

Inevitably, there will be those in and out of government fearful of
reform at a moment of rising violence. But diverting technical violators
from the jail system could protect public health without endangering
public safety. Of the 791 parole violators who had their warrants lifted
since the end of March, not one was rearrested for a gun-related crime.
