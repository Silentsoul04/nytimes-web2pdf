<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many New Yorkers are hunkered down in their apartments on scorching
summer days because of the pandemic. Their air-conditioners are
blasting, and that means electricity consumption is soaring, stressing
the city’s power grid.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But over the past couple of weeks, residents in three boroughs have been
urged to conserve energy in an effort to prevent blackouts and
brownouts. Consolidated Edison — the utility company that operates the
grid — and the mayor have suggested that for several hours, tens of
thousands of people not run energy-intensive appliances, like washers,
dryers and microwaves, and limit the use of air-conditioners.

“We’ve got to protect our electricity supply for all New Yorkers,” Mayor
Bill de Blasio said on Thursday. “We’ve got to make sure we avoid any
disruptions.”

Since late winter, [Con Edison has been preparing for an
uptick](https://www.coned.com/en/about-us/media-center/news/20200520/con-edison-invests-for-summer-2020-and-new-yorks-clean-energy-future)
in use in certain residential areas and a decrease in consumption in
commercial districts like [Midtown, which is virtually a ghost
town](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-time-life-building.html)
amid the pandemic.

On Wednesday and Thursday, three cables in Brooklyn overheated and
needed repairs because of the hot weather and increased demand for
electricity. That caused Con Edison to ask some residents to conserve
power. The company also reduced the voltage in the area enough that
customers might have noticed their lights were a bit dimmer.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s not unusual for cables to break down in the summer, when
temperatures rise past 90 degrees and people run air-conditioners round
the clock. Cooling is the biggest energy drain in homes, [my colleague
Henry Fountain has
reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter-energy-bill.html).
It accounted for about one-sixth of residential electricity use in 2019,
[according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=96&t=3).

“Intense heat, humidity and the resulting increase in the demand for
power place stress on electric-delivery equipment,” Allan Drury, a Con
Edison spokesman, said. “Our goal is to keep outages short in duration
and geographically confined.”

The overheating of cables this week — which affected [96,000
customers](https://www.coned.com/en/about-us/media-center/news/20200730/con-edison-asks-customers-in-area-of-brooklyn-to-conserve-energy)
in Bay Ridge, Fort Hamilton, Park Slope, Sunset Park, Dyker Heights,
Borough Park and Gowanus — was the third time this month that the heat
affected electricity delivery in the city. Last week, cables in parts of
Queens and the Bronx also needed to be repaired, and residents there
were also told to limit consumption.

“The equipment problems in these neighborhoods have no effect on the
rest of the Con Edison system,” the company said in a statement on
Thursday.

Last July, [a power failure plunged the west side of
Manhattan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/nyregion/nyc-power-outage.html)
into darkness, stopping concerts, elevators and several subway lines for
about five hours. The failure happened on the 42nd anniversary of the
infamous blackout of 1977, and Con Edison said it was the result of “a
significant electrical transmission disturbance.”

Just a week later, at least [50,000 customers were left without
power](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/21/nyregion/nyc-heat-wave.html)
in New York City and Westchester County on a dangerously hot day.
Overhead lines had been in danger of overloading because of the heat.
So, as a precaution, power was turned off to tens of thousands of
customers so Con Edison could make repairs to “prevent a bigger outage,”
Mr. de Blasio said on Twitter at the time.

A. with the directors Ovsanna Gevorgyan, Eric Shahinian and Michael

## Metropolitan Diary: ‘Try being nice’

Dear Diary:

I had a job at the local supermarket in Bay Ridge. Sal, the manager, and
I would open up every Saturday morning at 8 a.m. In between serving the
occasional customer at the deli or in the produce section, I brought in
and put away the milk. I also worked the register.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of the regular customers, an older man, usually bought about five
items. He would place each one on the counter, watch me ring it up and
then go on to the next item.

After he paid, he would check each item against the receipt and then he
would take out a pencil and make sure it all added up correctly.

Sal sensed my frustration with this routine.

“Try being nice,” he said. “He is probably a lonely old man.”

For the next two weeks, whenever the man came in I would ring each item
up patiently, calling out the price as he placed it on the counter. Then
I would give him a pencil along with his receipt.

The first time he came in the week after that, he put everything on the
counter at once, and I rang him up.

“Sir,” I said as he was leaving, “you forgot your receipt.”

“I don’t need it,” he said.
