MIAMI — A hurricane warning was issued for parts of Florida’s Atlantic
coast on Friday, hours after Hurricane Isaias raked the Bahamas, parts
of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

The National Hurricane Center issued the warning for over 150 miles of
the Florida coastline, stretching from Boca Raton to the northern bound
of Brevard County, according to an
[advisory](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/312049.shtml)
on Friday afternoon. Hurricane warnings are still in effect for portions
of the
[Bahamas](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?start#contents)
through Saturday.

Hurricane watches, tropical storm warnings, a storm surge watch and a
tropical storm watch are in effect for other parts of Florida’s east
coast.

The center forecast that the storm would near southeast Florida Saturday
afternoon and through Sunday, and then travel north up the state’s
eastern coast late Sunday. Isaias threatened strong winds, heavy
rainfall and high storm surges late this weekend.

Isaias, a Category 1 hurricane, is expected to continue to strengthen
Friday night and early Saturday and remain a hurricane for the next few
days, but it is not forecast to strengthen to a Category 2, said Dennis
Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the National Hurricane
Center.

The storm, already the ninth named system of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane
season, approached the Bahamas from the southeast on Friday morning,
with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour. Strong squalls and
possible storm surges, forecast between three to five feet, threatened
the islands, according to the center.

The potential storm surges were “[on top of astronomical
tides](https://twitter.com/NWS/status/1289189099836977152),” the
center’s director, Ken Graham, said on Friday. He described Isaias as
“a very large storm,” with tropical force winds stretching out as far
as 180 miles from the hurricane’s center.

“It’s not just a point, it’s not just a track, it’s a very large area,”
he said.

Across the central Bahamas on Friday, conditions gradually deteriorated
as the storm barreled across new ground. The threat from Isaias to the
Bahamas comes less than a year after Hurricane Dorian [ravaged Abaco and
Grand
Bahama](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/world/americas/hurricane-dorian-abaco-island-bahamas.html),
leaving residents in those areas especially unnerved. Many survivors of
Dorian, who saw homes, schools, banks and [whole communities crushed to
rubble](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/world/americas/hurricane-dorian-bahamas.html),
are still living in tents and unrepaired homes.

The storm hit the Bahamas as it is grappling with a [rapid
increase](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/world/americas/virus-caribbean-hurricane.html)
in the number of coronavirus infections that has only accelerated in
recent days, in what health officials are calling a second wave.

On Thursday night, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis announced the temporary
relaxation of restrictions to give people more time to prepare for the
storm. While there are formal hurricane shelters on Grand Bahama, it was
unclear how officials would ensure social distancing in them.

In an interview with [The Nassau
Guardian](https://thenassauguardian.com/2020/07/31/isaias-stirs-new-fears-among-dorian-survivors/),
Melissa McPhee, 44, said her Grand Bahama home was protected only by a
tarp on her roof, after having sustained significant flood and wind
damage during Dorian. But she said that she had nowhere else to go.

Ms. McPhee said that, as someone with an underlying condition, she was
at a high risk for complications from Covid-19. She was afraid to
venture out to prepare for Isaias, she said, and felt that she could not
chance staying in a crowded hurricane shelter.

Florida has also been grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases. There
were more than 461,000 cases statewide and more than 6,500 deaths as of
Friday since the beginning of the pandemic, [according to a New York
Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/florida-coronavirus-cases.html).
Friday was the third consecutive day that Florida set its record for the
most deaths reported in a single day.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference on Friday that Florida was
“fully prepared for this and any future storm during this hurricane
season.” He said that the division of emergency management had been
working at [its most active
level](https://www.floridadisaster.org/sert/eoc-activation-levels/)
since March, “allowing them to actively plan for hurricane season even
while responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

Mr. DeSantis added that early on, the division had created a protective
equipment reserve for hurricane season, including 20 million masks, 22
million gloves and 1.6 million face shields.

This week, the state’s division of emergency management announced that
state-sponsored coronavirus testing sites in 11 counties would [remain
open](https://twitter.com/FLSERT/status/1288974249194147840), but that
others would close at 5 p.m. Thursday until it was [safe to
reopen](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/FLDEM/bulletins/297ef6d).

At news conferences on Friday, the Miami-Dade and Broward County mayors
said coronavirus testing sites would be closed until [next
week](https://www.miamidade.gov/releases/2020-07-30-mayor-testing-closure.asp).

Meteorologists have forecast a busy Atlantic hurricane season, which
runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, raising fears among emergency managers
about how to handle a potential major [hurricane landing during the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/us/hurricane-pandemic-coronavirus-florida.html).
Evacuation orders typically call people into the close quarters of
emergency shelters, or to crowded distribution centers.

Last week, Hurricane Hanna [hit part of Texas as a Category 1
storm](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/us/hanna-storm-texas.html),
landing near some of the cities and counties that have seen a sudden
spike in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. San Antonio officials
handed out hotel room vouchers for people who fled their homes, and the
mayor of Corpus Christi urged people to wear masks at home if they took
in relatives.

The average hurricane season usually produces 12 named storms, including
three that develop into major hurricanes. This year, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [predicted an above normal
season](https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/busy-atlantic-hurricane-season-predicted-for-2020)
in the Atlantic, with as many as 19 named storms. Up to 10 of those
storms could become hurricanes, and as many as six of those could
develop into Category 3, 4 or 5 hurricanes.

Rachel Knowles Scott contributed reporting from Nassau, the Bahamas, and
Christina Morales from Hialeah, Fla.
