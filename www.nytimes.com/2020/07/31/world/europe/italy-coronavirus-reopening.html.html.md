ROME — When the coronavirus erupted in the West, Italy was [the
nightmarish
epicenter](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-bergamo.html),
a place to avoid at all costs and a shorthand in the United States and
much of Europe for uncontrolled contagion.

“You look at what’s going on with Italy,” President Trump told reporters
on March 17. “We don’t want to be in a position like that.” Joseph R.
Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, used Italy’s overwhelmed
hospitals as evidence for his opposition to Medicare for All at a
presidential debate. “[It is not working in Italy right now,” he
said](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/2020-democratic-debate-live-updates/h_501d1e381370480bd021916a86029534).

Fast forward a few months, and the United States has suffered tens of
thousands more deaths than any country in the world. European states
that once looked smugly at Italy are facing new flare-ups. Some are
imposing fresh restrictions and weighing whether to lock down again.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Friday announced a delay to a
planned easing of measures in England as the infection rate there rose.
Even Germany, lauded for its efficient response and rigorous contact
tracing, has warned that lax behavior is prompting a surge in cases.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And Italy? Its hospitals are basically empty of Covid-19 patients. Daily
deaths attributed to the virus in Lombardy, the northern region that
bore the brunt of the pandemic, hover around zero. The number of new
daily cases has plummeted to “one of the lowest in Europe and the
world,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness
department at the National Institute of Health. “We have been very
prudent.”

And lucky. Today, despite a tiny uptick in cases this week, Italians are
cautiously optimistic that they have the virus in check — even as
Italy’s leading health experts warn that complacency remains the jet
fuel of the pandemic. They are aware that the picture can change at any
moment.

The result is a weekly X-ray of the country’s health upon which policy
decisions are based. That is a long way from the state of panic, and
near collapse, that hit Italy in March.

This week, Parliament voted to extend the government’s emergency powers
through Oct. 15 after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte argued the nation
could not let its guard down “because the virus is still circulating.”

Those powers allow the government to keep restrictions in place and
respond quickly — including with lockdowns — to any new clusters. The
government has already imposed travel restrictions on more than a dozen
countries to Italy, as the importation of the virus from countries is
now the government’s greatest fear.

“There are a lot of situations in France, Spain, the Balkans, which
means that the virus is not off at all,” said Ranieri Guerra, assistant
director general for strategic initiatives at the World Health
Organization and an Italian doctor. “It can come back at any time.”

There is no doubt that the privations of the lockdown were economically
costly. For three months, businesses and restaurants were ordered
closed, movement was highly restricted — even between regions, towns and
streets — and tourism ground to a halt. Italy is expected to lose about
10 percent of its gross domestic product this year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But at a certain point, as the virus threatened to spread
uncontrollably, Italian officials decided to put lives ahead of the
economy. “The health of the Italian people comes and will always come
first,” Mr. Conte said at the time.

Italian officials now hope that the worst of the cure came in one large
dose — the painful lockdown — and that the country is now safe to resume
normal life, albeit with limits. They argue that the only way to start
up the economy is to keep tamping down the virus, even now.

The strategy of closing down completely invited criticism that the
government’s excessive caution was paralyzing the economy. But it may
prove to be more advantageous than trying to reopen the economy while
the virus still rages, as is happening in countries like [the United
States](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html),
[Brazil](https://www.nytimes.com/article/brazil-coronavirus-cases.html)
and
[Mexico](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/world/americas/coronavirus-mexico-reopening.html).

That does not mean that calls for continued vigilance, as elsewhere in
the world, have been immune to mockery, resistance and exasperation. In
that, Italy is no different.

Masks often are missing or lowered in trains or buses, where they are
mandatory. Young people are going out and [doing the things young people
do](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/world/europe/italy-young-people-coronavirus.html)
— and risk in that way spreading the virus to more susceptible parts of
the population. Adults started [gathering at the
beach](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/world/europe/italy-beaches-coronavirus-reopening.html)
and for birthday barbecues. There is still no clear plan for a return to
school in September.

There is also a burgeoning, and politically motivated, anti-mask
contingent led by nationalist Matteo Salvini, who on July 27 declared
that replacing handshakes and hugs with elbow bumps was “the end of the
human species.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At his rallies, Mr. Salvini, the leader of the populist League party,
still shakes hands and wears his mask like a chin guard. In July, during
a news conference, he accused the Italian government of “importing”
infected immigrants to create new clusters and extend the state of
emergency.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This week, Mr. Salvini joined other mask skeptics — nicknamed the
“negationists” by critics — for a protest in the Senate library, along
with special guests such as the Italian crooner Andrea Bocelli, who said
he did not believe the pandemic was so serious because “I know a lot of
people and I don’t know anyone who ended up in an I.C.U.”

But the country’s leading health experts say that the lack of severe
cases is indicative of a decrease in the volume of infections, as only a
small percentage of the infected get very sick. And so far, Italy’s
malcontents have not been numerous or powerful enough to undermine what
has been a hard-won trajectory of success in confronting the virus after
a calamitous start.

Italy’s initial isolation by European neighbors at the outset of the
crisis, when masks and ventilators were hardly pouring in from across
the borders, may actually have helped, Mr. Guerra, the W.H.O. expert,
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective

        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

“There was competition initially, there was no collaboration,” Mr.
Guerra said. “And everyone acknowledged Italy was left alone at that
time.” As a result, he said, “what they had to do at that time because
we were left alone turned out to be more effective than other
countries.”

Italy first [quarantined

and then [the Lombardy
region](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/world/europe/coronavirus-italy.html)
in the north and [then the entire
peninsula](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/world/europe/italy-lockdown-coronavirus.html)
and its islands, despite the near absence of the virus in much of
central and southern Italy. That not only prevented workers in the
industrial north from returning home in the much more vulnerable south,
but it also fostered and forced a unified national response.

During the lockdown, movement was strictly limited, between regions and
towns and even city blocks, and people had to fill in
“auto-certification” forms to prove that they needed to go outside for
work, health or “other necessities.” Masks and social distancing
regulations were enforced by some regional authorities with steep fines.
Generally, if grudgingly, [the rules were
followed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-movement-restrictions.html).

As searing [scenes of human
suffering](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-funerals.html),
empty streets and the [heavy toll on an elderly
generation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-elderly.html)
of northern Italians spread, the transmission rate of the virus quickly
decreased, and the curve flattened, as opposed to other European
countries, [such as
Sweden](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/business/sweden-economy-coronavirus.html),
which pursued an alternative to locking down.

That the initial outbreak was localized in the overwhelmed hospitals
created enormous stress, but it also enabled doctors and nurses to
expedite contact tracing.

Then the country reopened, gradually, expanding liberties at two-week
intervals to respond to the virus’s incubation period.

The lockdown eventually had a secondary effect of decreasing the volume
of virus circulating in society, and thus reducing the probability of
coming in contact with someone who had it. At the end of the lockdown,
the virus circulation had steeply fallen off and in some central and
southern regions, there were hardly any chains of transmission at all.

“It’s always a matter of probability with these pathogens,” said Mr.
Guerra, adding that new early alarm systems such as the monitoring of
wastewater for traces of virus had lowered the probability of infection
even more.

Some Italian doctors say they believe that the virus is now behaving
differently in Italy. Matteo Bassetti, an infectious-disease doctor in
the northwestern city of Genoa, said that during the height of the
crisis, his hospital was inundated with 500 Covid-19 cases at one time.
Now, he said, his intensive care unit, with 50 beds, has no coronavirus
patients, and the 60-bed Covid-19 unit built specially for the crisis is
empty.

He said he thought that the virus had weakened — an unproven view, he
acknowledged, that has nonetheless found an eager audience in Mr.
Salvini and other politicians opposed to extending the state of
emergency.

Most health experts said that the virus still loomed, and as the
government considers a new decree to reopen night clubs, festivals and
cruise ship travel, many of them have implored the country not to let
down its guard.

“Even if the situation is better than in other countries, we should
continue to be very prudent,” said Dr. Rezza of the National Institute
of Health, adding that he thought the question of what Italy had done
right was better posed “at the end of the epidemic.”

“We cannot exclude that we will have outbreaks in Italy in the next few
days,” he said. “Maybe it’s just a matter of time.”
