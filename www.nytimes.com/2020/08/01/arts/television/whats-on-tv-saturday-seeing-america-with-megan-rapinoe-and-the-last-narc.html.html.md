**THE LAST NARC** *Stream on*
[*Amazon.*](https://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Narc-Season-1/dp/B0876N8XXZ)

of Enrique
Camarena](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/07/world/body-of-us-drug-agent-believed-found-in-mexico.html),
a.k.a. “Kiki,” a Drug Enforcement Administration agent working
undercover in Mexico. The fallout from the incident fueled international
outrage, and ultimately unraveled the Guadalajara cartel, [giving
rise](https://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-gallardo-20170824-story.html)
to the regional drug wars in Mexico today. The series explores the many
layers of the case through interviews with Camarena’s widow, Geneva, and
Hector Berrellez, the special agent who led the D.E.A.’s murder
investigation.

**HOST** (2020) *Stream on* [*Shudder.*](https://www.shudder.com/) ** A
séance over Zoom gets seriously spooky in this film directed by Rob
Savage, which was shot and produced remotely. Part horror, part
commentary on how the pandemic has changed our world, “this concise,
entertaining spin on the ghost story proposes that maybe the modern
world is a haunted house now,” Kyle Turner wrote in his [New York Times
review.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/movies/host-review.html)

**SULLIVAN’S TRAVELS** (1941) *Stream on the* [*Criterion
Channel.*](https://www.criterionchannel.com/) ** [This
film](https://www.nytimes.com/1942/01/29/archives/comic-tour-in-sullivans-travels-on-the-paramounts-screen-a-yank-on.html),
which was released after the Great Depression and before America’s
involvement in World War II, feels oddly relevant at a time when
entertainment escapism can feel both necessary and trivial. Joe McCrea
plays John L. Sullivan, a Hollywood movie director who sets out to make
a serious film about “the suffering of humanity,” following his
successful string of comedies. In order to better acquaint himself with
the subject matter, Sullivan goes undercover to experience life as a
vagrant (trailed closely by Hollywood insiders), only to end up truly
destitute, trapped in the grim reality he was hoping his film would
depict. [Preston
Sturges](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/movies/sturgess-travels-a-screwball-tale.html)’s
film cleverly plays with “the perennial question in Hollywood of
escapism vs. engagement,” A.O. Scott said in [an episode of the video
series Critics’
Picks](https://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/1194826561460/critics-picks-sullivan-s-travels.html).
“There are plenty of movies that do one or the other — that make us
laugh away our troubles or that make us face our troubles — but there
aren’t very many that do both.”
