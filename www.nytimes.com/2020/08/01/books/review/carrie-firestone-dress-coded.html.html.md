The Connecticut town where 14-year-old Molly Frost is surviving the end
of her eighth-grade year has a bear problem. Bears have taken to
wandering into people’s backyards and through the woods near the middle
school, forcing the local school board to address the issue and
prompting Molly, the main character in Carrie Firestone’s **DRESS CODED
(Putnam, 320 pp., $17.99; ages 10 and up),** to sometimes carry a bear
stick for protection.

But there are other hazards in the lives of Molly and her classmates
that, while not as overtly threatening as a large animal, are a source
of fear and anxiety. In fact, they may be more terrifying than the
bears.

This timely middle grade debut by the author of two best-selling young
adult novels is made up of short chapters, lists, letters and
transcripts of a podcast that Molly starts to bring attention to a
sexist, vague dress code enforced by several power-hungry administrators
at her school (one of whom is known only as Fingertip, because she
insists a girl’s shorts must be at least as long as the wearer’s
fingers). Molly is prompted to start the podcast after observing a
classmate get in trouble for wearing a tank top: “When Mr. Dern and Dr.
Couchman were yelling at her … I witnessed a piece of her soul leave her
body.” Molly’s project, recorded in the same treehouse where she once
enjoyed younger, more carefree days, sparks a revolution.

While unfair dress coding of female students is the central indignity
suffered in this novel, Firestone has a knack for capturing the other
agonies of middle school; indeed, adult readers might find the book more
painful, as they are sure to have buried some of their own difficult
memories down deep. Social isolation, peer rejection, puberty (whether
it’s happening too fast or not at all), unrequited crushes, bizarre
teaching methods and anxious, embarrassing parents all make the list,
each expertly depicted for maximum realism. Modern horrors such as the
fear of school shootings and social media debacles are also mentioned.
One chapter, entitled “The Bully Box,” about a box for sharing anonymous
concerns with school officials, is a blunt, two-page portrayal of the
hypocrisy of the adult world that most young teenagers are eventually
forced to face.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But this novel, while brutal in its honesty, is also quite funny and
full of hope. Molly is a spunky, utterly delightful narrator, a witty
but still believable 14-year-old whose amusing observations of daily
middle school life often balance out the heavy subject matter. (“Navya
eats all the cheese off Bea’s pizza, and Bea eats Navya’s crusts. That’s
some serious friendship.”) In addition to dealing with dress code drama
at school, Molly faces her own struggles at home. Her kind but
stressed-out parents are preoccupied with Molly’s older brother, an
angry 17-year-old addicted to vaping, but the reader never doubts Molly
is cared for and loved. It’s refreshing to read a novel with fully
fleshed-out adult characters who are sure to ring true for young people
navigating the fraught years of adolescence and their impact on
parent-child relationships.

As the popularity of Molly’s podcast and its accompanying movement
against the dress code grows, a rich cast of characters joins the fight.
The representation is diverse, with young teenagers of many different
races, cultures and sexualities represented. The tentacles of the dress
code capture certain girls more frequently than others, including a
Black character who is dress-coded for “tall hair.” A character living
with cerebral palsy plays a prominent role and is particularly well
drawn. Such wide-ranging inclusiveness might have felt like someone
marking a checklist, but in Firestone’s capable hands the varied group
of students is totally believable.

For all its realism, the novel ends with almost cinematic success for
Molly and her friends. Some may find the ending too perfect. But never
mind that. To young teenagers in 2020, this book is a much-needed
reminder that certain fights are worth fighting, that while bears of all
types may prowl unsettlingly close, fear can be faced down and victories
achieved, especially with strength in numbers.
