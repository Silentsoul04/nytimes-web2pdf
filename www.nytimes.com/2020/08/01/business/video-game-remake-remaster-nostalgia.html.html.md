Nostalgia has always been a powerful source of revenue for Hollywood.
Turns out, it’s equally lucrative for video games.

From its beginnings with the likes of Pong, a two-dimensional table
tennis game, the video game industry has grown into a [$120
billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/video-game-industry-120-billion-future-innovation-2019-9)
business. Over the years, memorable games have garnered strong
followings. Like Hollywood remakes or remasters old movies, video game
publishers are overhauling and rereleasing games to tap into ready-made
fan bases for popular franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Crash
Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and World of Warcraft.

“I think nostalgia is the major driving force for the success of a
remake,” said Doug Clinton, managing partner for the venture capitalist
firm Loup Ventures, which focuses on emerging technology and gaming.
“Any game that doesn’t have meaningful nostalgic value isn’t likely to
be successful.”

In May, Activision Blizzard, the developer behind World of Warcraft,
announced that two games from the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater series,
originally released in 1999, would be [brought back later this
year](https://www.barrons.com/articles/activision-is-bringing-back-tony-hawks-skateboarding-games-51589364900).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The remake trend isn’t extending only to the most highly rated games
either. Children (and adults) who received SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle
for Bikini Bottom in Christmas of 2003 can now buy a “rehydrated”
remake, which hit stores in June. Though the game received decent
reviews when it was first released, it was by no means a classic. But
the remastering shows how nostalgia is driving publishers’ decision
making.

“Because you can actually revisit those virtual spaces, it’s a more
powerful type of nostalgia,” said Alyse Knorr, assistant professor of
English at Regis University and author of the book “[Super Mario
Bros. 3](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/super-mario-bros-3-by-alyse-knorr).”
“It’s the same when you go back to it; it’s the same as it was when you
were 7.”

That sentimentality does not necessarily lead to instant sales. Some
titles that have been rereleased or remastered in hopes of cashing in on
cult status fall back into obscurity, like 2017’s Constructor HD or
White Day: A Labyrinth Named School. Generally, games that have high
review scores and strong followings tend to be safe financial bets for a
second look.

“When you’re taking a game that you know has a Metacritic of 90-plus,
the only thing you can do at that point is screw it up,” said Marco
Thrush, president of Bluepoint Games, a studio known for developing high
quality remasters and remakes.

Initially, publishers capitalized on the nostalgia trend by curating
games from the 1990s on plug-and-play devices. Nintendo’s [NES
Classic](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/technology/nintendo-nes.html),
which offered 30 games like Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong packaged
in a replica of the original Nintendo Entertainment System console, [was
a huge
hit](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/27/business/nintendos-new-console-may-feed-your-nostalgia-if-you-can-get-one.html)
when it came out in 2016, selling out almost immediately. Other
developers like Sega and Sony [quickly followed
suit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/business/retro-video-games.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

But developers saw an opportunity to make even more money by investing
in substantial upgrades. One of the biggest this year was the release of
Final Fantasy VII Remake.

In 1997, Square Enix released the original Final Fantasy VII, a
futuristic cyberpunk epic with multiple characters and twisting
plotlines that became one of the most beloved titles in the Final
Fantasy series.

Visually, however, the creators had to make do with the technology at
the time. For example, the game had blocky-looking characters, no voice
acting and no 3-D backgrounds.

After years of teasing, Square Enix remade the game to match a modern
experience. Final Fantasy VII Remake used entire teams of voice actors,
artists, animators, engineers and producers to create a game that could
stand up to any contemporary release.

The strategy paid off: It became the best-selling game of April,
according to data from the NPD Group, a research firm that covers the
video game industry.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Fans have largely been receptive to the reimagined game, and its modern
systems have made it accessible to new players, who found the original
mechanics difficult.

“I tried the Final Fantasy VII remaster on Xbox; it was a little too far
gone for me,” said Preston Bakies, 27, of Findlay, Ohio. “But when the
remake came out — I’ve put a lot of time into it. It’s been a lot of
fun.”

The original Final Fantasy VII cost[$40 million to
make](https://www.polygon.com/a/final-fantasy-7), which was considered a
high sum for a video game in the ‘90s. Given the technological demands
of modern games, costs have grown considerably more expensive, experts
say.

“I haven’t come across a single game which took more than $100 million
in Japan” to get made, said Atul Goyal, a managing director at
investment bank Jefferies & Company, who pegged the budget for Final
Fantasy VII Remake at up to $140 million.

Others felt it was even higher. “If we assume the number of sales for
Final Fantasy VII Remake is six million units, $144 million is the
budget,” said Yuhsuke Koyama, a professor at Shibaura Institute of
Technology in Tokyo and author of “[A History of the Japanese Video Game
Industry](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4409241079/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_NWONEbES7SRZ9).”

In a twist, Square Enix has broken Final Fantasy VII Remake into
multiple parts, although it would not say how many. There are risks
associated with this strategy, including irking fans who have to shell
out more money for the other parts of the game.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We are writing in our reports that it will be a two-part series. Not
three, not four, not 10,” Mr. Goyal said. “And the subsequent chapter
will be coming out soon in the next fiscal
year.”

Square Enix is not the only publisher capitalizing on this trend.
Capcom, the publisher behind Street Fighter and Mega Man, has also been
rummaging through its back catalog. Last year, it released Resident Evil
2, a remake of the 1998 PlayStation original. Not only was the remake
loved by critics, it has sold [6.5 million
units](http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e200413.html) as of
April.

The success prompted Capcom to greenlight a Resident Evil 3 remake,
which was released in April.

Capcom declined to comment for this article, but it did
[reveal](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/resident-evil-2-remake-dev-team-size-over-800/)
in a Japanese documentary that at least 800 developers worked on
Resident Evil 2.

Mr. Goyal estimates that Resident Evil 2 likely did not cost more than
$100 million to remake. And given that Resident Evil 3 reused some
assets from its predecessor, and clocks in at a shorter run time, it
likely cost Capcom even less.

The savings for Resident Evil 3 would have been significant, said
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who follows the video
game industry.

“The level design is the complicated part, art is relatively
inexpensive, probably 30 percent of the cost of the game,” he said. “If
they reused 20 percent of the art, it’s a 6 percent savings.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Resident Evil 3 was not the same breakout success that [Resident Evil 2
was](https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/20/january-2019-npd-sales-down-as-kingdom-hearts-tops-charts/)
in 2019, but it still landed at a respectable sixth place in April,
according to NPD. Capcom did confirm that it shipped two million units.

Remastering and remaking have become so common that some studios are
dedicated to bringing old games to modern hardware. Bluepoint Games in
Austin, Texas, has a reputation for creating some of the highest quality
updates in the industry. In 2018, it released a high-definition remake
of Shadow of the Colossus, which originally came out in 2005 by
Sony.

costs of remaking the game.

“We revitalize an older game, somebody’s baby,” said Mr. Thrush. “New
