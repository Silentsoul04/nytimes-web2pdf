Cardinals}\label{more-games-postponed-with-4-more-coronavirus-cases-for-cardinals}}

Three staffers and one player for the St. Louis Cardinals tested
positive for the virus, prompting the postponement of a game Saturday
and a doubleheader Sunday against the Brewers in Milwaukee.

Major League Baseball's sputtering effort to play in a pandemic took
another discouraging turn on Saturday when one St. Louis Cardinals
player and three team staffers
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/sports/baseball/mlb-coronavirus-outbreak.html}{tested
positive for the coronavirus}, forcing
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/sports/baseball/cardinals-twins-coronavirus-mlb.html}{the
postponement of their weekend series in Milwaukee}.

After deciding earlier Saturday to postpone the game for that night,
M.L.B. announced several hours later that it had called off the Sunday
doubleheader, meaning that the teams will not play any games in their
series unless they can be made up elsewhere during the densely scheduled
60-game season. The Cardinals' Monday game in Detroit was also
postponed, but the league said it would be made up as part of a
doubleheader later in the week.

The Cardinals, who also had two players receive positive tests on
Friday, now have six positives in their traveling party and have become
the second team, with the Miami Marlins, to experience an outbreak less
than two weeks into the truncated M.L.B. season. The Marlins have had 20
people, including 18 players, test positive since last Sunday.

With the Cardinals-Brewers postponements, six teams --- comprising 20
percent of the league --- have been shut down this weekend for reasons
related to the virus.

Marlins} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/baseball/phillies-blue-jays-postponed-coronavirus.html}{the
Phillies} have not played since last Sunday, when the Marlins learned of
their outbreak before a game in Philadelphia. With those teams out of
action, their scheduled opponents for this weekend, the Washington
Nationals and the Toronto Blue Jays, have also been off.

The Phillies are scheduled for now to play the Yankees for four games
this week, and M.L.B. said Saturday that the Marlins would play a
four-game series with the Orioles in Baltimore starting Tuesday. The
league also said that two of three cases among Phillies staffers were
likely false positives, a welcome sign along with no Philadelphia
players testing positive since playing the Marlins.

The Marlins' personnel who tested positive embarked on a bus trip from
Philadelphia to Miami on Friday as the team scrambles to make trades and
sign free agents to fill out a competitive roster. Isan Diaz, a Marlins
second baseman, opted out of the season on Saturday morning.

``This has been a tough week to see so many of my teammates come down
with this virus, and see how quickly it spreads,'' Diaz posted to
Instagram, adding later, ``This has been a decision that I have
discussed with my family, and I feel it's the best one for me and my
overall well-being.''

\href{https://twitter.com/Brewers/status/1289605514196729856}{The
Brewers said Saturday} that center fielder Lorenzo Cain had also opted
out.

For now, M.L.B. still plans for its teams to play 60 games apiece --- or
as close to 60 as possible --- in a regular season scheduled to end on
Sept. 27, before a postseason of four rounds through the end of October.
But the complications of travel, and the failure by at least some of the
Marlins to adhere to safety protocols on a preseason trip to Atlanta,
have put the season in peril.
