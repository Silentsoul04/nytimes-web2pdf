<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — It was one of the few issues on which President Barack
Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. disagreed — how far to go
in limiting the influence of lobbyists in government.

The vice president privately complained that his boss’s [effort to slam
shut the revolving
door](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/us/politics/22obama.html)
between K Street and the administration would deprive it of experienced
talent, and he bristled when Mr. Obama’s aides tried to block him from
hiring a well-connected Washington operator who had lobbied for
pharmaceutical and insurance companies, credit agencies and others.

Eight years later, that same confidant, Steve Ricchetti, is helping to
run Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign. Also involved to varying degrees
are other advisers, operatives, fund-raisers and allies with deep
connections to Washington’s lucrative lobbying, communications and
strategic consulting industry.

That puts Mr. Biden at odds with powerful elements of his party’s
liberal base. Increasingly, they are expressing concern that the
military contractors, Wall Street banks and other major corporations
that paid members of Mr. Biden’s inner circle while they were out of
government could hold disproportionate power in a Biden administration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Politically, it could limit Mr. Biden’s ability to cast himself as the
antidote to the anything-goes [access
peddling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/us/politics/trump-recording-donors.html)
that has proliferated in [President Trump’s
administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/climate/trump-cabinet-lobbyists.html).
Under Mr. Trump, lobbyists and campaign donors have not only enjoyed
[access to the highest levels of the
administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-lobbyists-swamp-campaign.html),
but have been tapped to lead cabinet departments and have exerted
remarkable influence over policies of intense interest to their former
employers.

“It’s worrisome, broadly speaking, that a Biden administration could end
up abiding by the unfortunate bipartisan norms of putting people in
posts where they oversee industries or employers they just left,” said
David Segal, co-founder of the liberal group Demand Progress.

His organization was among those that [sent a
letter](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/to-rebuild-public-trust-close-the-revolving-door/)
to the Biden and Trump campaigns this week asking them not to appoint
anyone to senior administration positions overseeing interests they
served in the private sector. The letter called out Mr. Trump’s
administration for taking that dynamic “to new extremes,” but Mr. Segal
added that Mr. Biden’s orbit includes “some folks with troubling track
records.”

Mr. Biden has pledged to, if elected, “[expand on and
codify](https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/)” the Obama
administration [lobbying executive
order](https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Executive%20Orders/A70F962587DAC28F85257E96006A90F2/$FILE/23a5e4eeaffd4e14b4387b40b0eae5963.pdf?open)
— the same policy he had privately complained about. That plan barred
lobbyists from going to work for agencies they had tried to influence
within the previous two years, and [barred departing officials from
lobbying](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/us/politics/22obama.html)
until the end of the administration.

With scrutiny intensifying, some Biden allies are now distancing
themselves from their corporate work to better position themselves for
official roles with the campaign, transition team or in a potential
Biden administration.

Mr. Bates said Mr. Biden was “deeply proud” of the ethics policies
enacted in the Obama administration, and of his work in the Senate
before that “to curtail the influence of lobbyists, money and special
interests in government.”

But after eight years as vice president and decades in the Senate, Mr.
Biden maintains extensive ties to Washington’s permanent political class
of policy and political experts who move between government and private
sector positions.

Mr. Ricchetti spent years as a registered lobbyist, and through a
company called [Ricchetti Consulting
Group](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7010940-Biden-s-Campaign-Chairman-Formed-a-Consulting.html)
is being paid by both [the Biden
campaign](https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202007209260662530)
and AT\&T, his only corporate client over the last nine years. Anita
Dunn, Mr. Biden’s chief campaign strategist, was also still doing work
for AT\&T last month.

As of Saturday Ms. Dunn is taking “an official leave” from her firm,
which had been paid millions in recent years to help an airline advocacy
group, while also providing communications advice to an [Israeli spyware
firm](https://www.fastcompany.com/90326297/despite-ban-on-spyware-ads-google-allows-ad-blitz-by-hacking-firm-nso-group)
and the [fugitive Nissan executive Carlos

It ended all those client relationships in the past year.

A leading candidate to become defense secretary, [Michèle A.

None of these advisers are registered as lobbyists, reflecting a trend
in which major corporate and foreign players hire former officials as
consultants, or as legal counsel, allowing them to use their connections
and expertise, while avoiding the notoriety and disclosure requirements
that come with formal lobbying. This phenomenon was exacerbated by Mr.
Obama’s lobbying policy.

Mr. Biden’s more liberal challengers for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts, both campaigned against K Street, in part, to
differentiate themselves from the candidate they now support.

Ms. Warren
[proposed](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-to-end-washington-corruption-554c7f01aaa5)
a plan that would expand the definition of lobbying to include
consultants and lawyers who try to influence government, while barring
corporate lobbyists from joining the government for six years.
Supporters of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren [are pushing Mr. Biden’s team
to go
further](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/30/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-convention-389226)
than he has on those issues.

Mr. Ricchetti — a self-effacing fixer likely to occupy a top position if
Mr. Biden is elected — personifies the prevalence of influence industry
veterans in Mr. Biden’s orbit that concerns progressives.

He rose to prominence as a liaison to the Senate under President Bill
Clinton. He left the White House in 1995 and opened a lobbying shop
where he specialized in health care, with a goal, a person close to him
said, of getting back into government once he had set up his family
financially.

He was recruited to return to the White House in 1998 by the then-White
House chief of staff, John D. Podesta. Mr. Ricchetti sold his firm to
Mr. Podesta’s brother Tony, [until
recently](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/politics/john-tony-podesta-mueller-russia-investigation.html)
one of the town’s best-known lobbyists.

Within two years, he had compiled a client list that included General
Motors, Experian, the American Hospital Association, AT\&T, Eli Lilly,
Nextel, Novartis, Pfizer and Fannie Mae, the quasi-governmental mortgage
lender whose late entry into the subprime housing market exacerbated the
2008 financial crisis.

When Mr. Ricchetti backed Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign,
aides to her rival for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Obama, seized on
Mr. Ricchetti’s $120,000-a-year contract with General Motors. The Obama
campaign connected his work to an $8 million earmark Mrs. Clinton
secured for the company’s New York operations as a senator, a claim Mr.
Ricchetti has denied.

But Mr. Ricchetti, whose discursive and regular-guy style mirrors Mr.
Biden’s, was viewed with skepticism in the Obama White House even after
he had satisfied the two-year lobbying cooling-off period required by
Mr. Obama’s policy. When Mr. Biden settled on Mr. Ricchetti to help run
his office in late 2011, the White House aides Jim Messina and David
Plouffe flatly rejected the idea, according to people close to the
situation.

A short, intense scrap ensued, ending only when Mr. Obama gave into Mr.
Biden’s argument that he had the “right” to pick his own top deputy,
several former aides recalled.

Mr. Ricchetti was hired and by late 2013 was officially appointed Mr.
Biden’s chief of staff. Over the next few years, he essentially took
control of Mr. Biden’s post-presidential life, setting up a network of
nonprofits and academic institutions that would serve as a base of
operations, negotiating the former vice president’s lucrative book deal,
and, most important, helping to set up the initial structure of the 2020
campaign, according to aides and Biden associates.

While the campaign’s internal policy allows consultants like Mr.
Ricchetti to continue receiving outside income from approved sources
like his consulting arrangement with AT\&T, some of Mr. Biden’s top
advisers have begun leaving the influence industry to join the campaign,
and possibly a future administration.

On Saturday, Antony J. Blinken, a deputy secretary of state in the Obama

$10,000-a-month for Mr. Keyak’s help waging a public affairs campaign
against the Gulf state of Qatar by Elliott Broidy, a Republican donor
who owns a defense consulting firm. Federal investigators have since
looked into whether [that campaign violated foreign lobbying
laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/politics/elliott-broidy-trump.html),
but Mr. Keyak has not been interviewed by prosecutors, the Biden
campaign said.

Some Democrats argue a Biden administration would be wise not to wall
itself off from people with both government and private sector
experience.

“We can’t all go to think tanks, or into academia, and you wouldn’t want
to fill the government entirely with people who came from ivory tower
institutions that are detached from the mechanics of Washington,” said
James P. Rubin, who had served as a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Biden
in the Senate and then moved to the State Department in the 1990s before
becoming a registered lobbyist.

In an effort to ease potential hurdles to joining a Biden
administration, Mr. Rubin in recent weeks[terminated his lobbying
registrations](https://efile.fara.gov/docs/6415-Short-Form-20200609-122.pdf)
for a range of clients.

Mr. Rubin argued that Mr. Biden’s decades of experience in government
meant aides would be less able to shape his worldview, but he
nonetheless contrasted the years of public policy experience inside and
outside government of many Biden advisers to the relatively less
experienced set of advisers around Mr. Trump.

“I’d like to think that now we have to acknowledge that having expertise
is good,” he said.
