Adam Max, an investment manager who became a leading patron of Brooklyn
cultural institutions, notably the [Brooklyn Academy of
Music](https://www.bam.org/), where he had been board chairman since
2017, died on July 27 at his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 62.

The cause was bile duct cancer, his wife, Diane Max, said.

Mr. Max was captivated by the venerable Brooklyn Academy after he and
Ms. Max were given a gift subscription as a wedding present in 1985. The
couple’s gifts to BAM would become the largest by individual donors in
its history, according to the academy (though it declined to divulge the
amount).

Mr. Max went on to be a major benefactor of [St. Ann’s
Warehouse](https://stannswarehouse.org/), the performance space now in
Brooklyn Bridge Park. And he and his wife were instrumental in the
establishment of the New-York Historical Society’s [Center for Women’s
History](https://www.nyhistory.org/womens-history), which opened for
research and exhibitions at the society’s headquarters in Manhattan in
2017. The couple also sponsored the Diane and Adam E. Max Conference on
Women’s History there.

Originally an aspiring actor, Mr. Max taught children’s theater as a
Brown University student in Providence, R.I., performed as a mime during
a gap year with a theater group, and inveighed against British taxes as
a costumed character on a Boston Tea Party tourist attraction ship
before joining [the Jordan Company](https://www.thejordancompany.com/),
a New York private equity firm, in 1986.

“In a moment of self-realization,” he once said, “I decided the role of
enthusiastic audience member suited me best.”

Adam Edward Max was born on July 18, 1958, in Manhattan to Herbert B.
Max, a lawyer, and Dorothy (Seletsky) Max. As a child he attended
performances at the Brooklyn Academy with his mother. After graduating
from the Collegiate School in Manhattan, he earned his bachelor’s degree
in literature and society at Brown in 1981.

He married Diane Peterson, a former chairwoman of Planned Parenthood of
New York City, in 1985. She survives him, along with their children,
Hannah, Jonah and Ezra; and his brothers, Daniel and Eric.

Mr. Max joined BAM’s board in 2003 and became vice chairman in 2008.
Katy Clark, the Academy’s president, described him as “voracious in his
appetite for solving problems.”

He was credited with playing a significant role in the opening last fall
of [BAM
Strong](https://blog.bam.org/2019/03/a-first-look-at-bam-strong.html),
an expansion, including a visual art exhibition space, designed to unify
the academy’s facilities, along Fulton Street in the Fort Greene
section.

Mr. Max and his wife headed the Next Stage Campaign, which raised more
than $30 million for its endowment as BAM celebrated its 150th
anniversary.

But Mr. Max’s affinity for BAM was about more than bricks and mortar or
balance sheets. He even appeared briefly in a performance of [Geoff
Sobelle’s](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/theater/geoff-sobelles-the-object-lesson-at-bam.html)
“Home,” which [The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/theater/home-geoff-sobelle-review.html)
described as a “hallucinatory performance piece” at BAM’s Harvey Theater
in 2017, when he answered a call from the stage for volunteers in the
audience to join the cast.

Mr. Sobelle said he felt indebted to Mr. Max. “I’ve never had anyone
seek me out, to begin a meaningful conversation with me, to actively
take a vested interest in my life as a performing artist, and do all of
that on their own accord,” he wrote in an email. He added, “He told me
that he saw in me a path that he hadn’t taken.”
