\section{Taylor Swift's `Folklore' Is No. 1 With a Blockbuster Debut
Week}\label{taylor-swifts-folklore-is-no-1-with-a-blockbuster-debut-week}}

The singer and songwriter's surprise album had the equivalent of 846,000
sales in the United States, a total beaten only by her own last two LPs.

A new Taylor Swift album usually arrives with a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/business/media/taylor-swift-maximizes-use-of-social-media-in-release-of-new-album.html}{monthslong
marketing rollout}: radio singles,
\href{https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/swifts-red-tops-a-million-sales-in-week-1/}{corporate
tie-ins}, a string of media appearances --- all carefully choreographed
to send her to No. 1.

For her latest release, ``Folklore,'' Swift threw out almost her entire
playbook, yet still rocketed to the top with sales that most artists can
only dream of.

``Folklore,'' which came out on July 24 with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/arts/music/taylor-swift-kanye-west.html}{less
than 24 hours' notice}, opened at No. 1 on Billboard's latest album
chart with a whopping 846,000 sales in the United States, according to
Nielsen Music. That's the
\href{https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9428290/taylor-swift-folklore-billboard-200-number-1}{third-highest}
weekly total for any album in four years, beaten only by Swift's last
two albums: ``Reputation'' (1.2 million in 2017) and ``Lover'' (867,000
a year ago).

By comparison, Drake's ``Scorpion,'' a monster streaming hit, opened
with the equivalent of
\href{https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8464342/drake-scorpion-debut-no1-billboard-200-chart-sets-streaming-record}{732,000
sales} in 2018, while Kendrick Lamar's ``DAMN.'' notched
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-damn-billboard-debut.html}{603,000}
the year before that.

Selling more than one million copies in a single week ---
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/arts/music/taylor-swift-lover-sales.html}{once
a Swift specialty} --- may no longer be possible in the streaming era,
but through canny marketing Swift has kept her numbers as high as almost
anyone can. (One exception: Adele, who had
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/business/media/adele-shatters-music-industry-truisms-by-going-against-the-grain.html}{stratospheric
numbers} the last time around, and has a new album in the works.)

``Folklore'' may also be one of the last blockbuster releases to take
full advantage of one of Nielsen and Billboard's
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/media/billboard-charts-bundles.html}{most
contested rules}, over the so-called bundling of albums --- selling a
copy of an album along with another item, like merchandise or a concert
ticket. Billboard is set to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/arts/music/billboard-ticket-merchandise-bundles.html}{stop
counting} most of these deals in October.

When her album was announced, Swift's website was fully primed to
deliver her album in an array of deals for items like a
\href{https://twitter.com/bybrianbyrne/status/1289312401360187392}{\$49
cardigan} and a \$15 phone stand. In addition, Swift sold
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/arts/music/juice-wrld-taylor-swift-billboard.html}{17
physical versions} of ``Folklore'' --- eight CDs, eight LPs and a
cassette tape --- that surely lured large numbers of collectors and
fans. Swift's 846,000 sales total is a composite number that includes
615,000 copies sold as a full album.

Yet Swift's surprise release strategy brought its own momentum, and in
the days after its release it was a legitimate sensation online --- as
well as a
\href{https://www.metacritic.com/music/folklore/taylor-swift}{critics'
favorite},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review.html}{for
the most part} --- that drew 290 million streams. The ``Folklore''
single ``Cardigan'' also debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100.

Swift did manage to avoid one piece of potential competition in her
opening week. Kanye West, her eternal celebrity nemesis, had announced a
new album,
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/arts/music/taylor-swift-kanye-west.html}{Donda:
With Child},'' for the same day, but so far it has not materialized.

Also this week, Logic's ``No Pressure'' opened at No. 2 with the
equivalent of 221,000 sales. Juice WRLD's ``Legends Never Die'' falls to
No. 3 after
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/arts/music/juice-wrld-taylor-swift-billboard.html}{two
weeks at the top}, and another posthumous rap album, Pop Smoke's ``Shoot
for the Stars Aim for the Moon,'' is No. 4. The ``Hamilton'' Broadway
cast album is No. 5.
