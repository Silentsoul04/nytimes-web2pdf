More than 100 current and former chief executives called for more aid to
small businesses in the United States in a letter sent to Treasury
Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday.

\href{https://www.howardschultz.com/lettertocongress/}{The letter} was
organized by the former \textbf{Starbucks} chief Howard Schultz with the
support of Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, and Senator
Todd Young, Republican of Indiana. It is signed by the likes of
\textbf{Walmart's} Doug McMillon, \textbf{Alphabet's} Sundar Pichai and
\textbf{Disney's} Bob Chapek.

The letter states:

\begin{quote}
``We cannot stress enough the urgent need to act. Every day that passes
without a comprehensive recovery program makes recovery more difficult.
By Labor Day, we foresee a wave of permanent closures if the right steps
are not taken soon. Tens of millions of Americans have already lost
their jobs in this pandemic. Allowing small businesses to fail will turn
temporary job losses into permanent ones. By year end, the domino effect
of lost jobs --- as well as the lost services and lost products that
small businesses provide --- could be catastrophic.''
\end{quote}

The chief executives call for ``federally guaranteed loans, at favorable
terms, that will enable small businesses to transform and sustain
themselves through 2020 and well into 2021.''
