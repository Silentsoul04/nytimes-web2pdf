The coronavirus has made it more difficult for entrepreneurs to raise
money. But for many companies --- from established businesses to smaller
start-ups --- the pandemic hasn't prevented them from
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/business/dealbook/tiktok-microsoft-takeover.html}{finding
investors willing to open their wallets}.

\textbf{TransferWise} recently raised \$319 million in a secondary deal,
in which existing shareholders will sell some of their holdings in the
European fintech company.
\href{https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/}{The
transaction} values TransferWise at about \$5 billion, a
\href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2019/05/22/transferwise-valued-at-35-billion-as-founders-sell-stake/}{nearly
43 percent bump} from last year. Kristo Kaarmann, the company's chief
executive, said that TransferWise, which was founded in 2011, didn't
\emph{need} to raise money, since it has been profitable for three years
now. But it saw an opportunity for older investors and long-tenured
employees to sell some of their stakes.

Smaller companies aren't afraid to embark on fund-raising either, even
if the pandemic has changed the way they court potential investors.
\textbf{Ro}, a telehealth start-up, said last week that it had raised
\$200 million in new funding. \textbf{Gro Intelligence}, which uses
artificial intelligence to gather agricultural data, is in the process
of raising an ``opportunistic'' Series B round with a target of \$50
million, its founder and chief executive, Sara Menker, said.

It has taken time for investors to get comfortable, well, investing.
Venture deals in the second quarter in the United States, Europe and
Asia were all down from the same time last year, but up from the
previous quarter,

to PWC and CB Insights}. ``There's obviously a lot more gun-shyness,''
Ms. Menker of Gro Intelligence said, with many venture capitalists
initially focused on protecting existing portfolio companies rather than
striking new deals.
