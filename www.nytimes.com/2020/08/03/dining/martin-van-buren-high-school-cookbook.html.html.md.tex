There's a story to be told about Martin Van Buren High School in Queens
Village. Less than a decade ago, the graduation rate at the school was
46 percent. With the arrival of a new principal, Sam Sochet, the
situation began to improve. Last year, the rate was nearly 80 percent,
and the curriculum has been bolstered with programs in law, engineering,
robotics, science and humanities. Now, the alumni are raising money to
support students' families --- in partnership with CommonPoint of
Queens, a social service organization --- through a digital cookbook:
``Comfort Food From Around the World: Recipes by Students, Staff, Alumni
and Friends of MVB.'' The global collection of 168 recipes includes one
from the chef Yotam Ottolenghi, and can be downloaded for free, though
there is an appeal for donations. It has raised nearly \$40,000 from
individuals and corporate sponsors since it was released on June 11.
Steve Wilson, an alumnus who is spearheading the campaign and edited the
book, said that they would soon release the current edition in Spanish,
and that they were planning for a second volume. Some of the recipes in
the current book include Filipino lumpia, Egyptian mulukhiyah soup,
Finnish meat pies, and kugel.
