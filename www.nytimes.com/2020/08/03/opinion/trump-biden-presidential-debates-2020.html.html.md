Nervous managers of the [scheduled 2020 presidential
debates](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_debates,_2020) are
shuffling the logistics and locations to deal with the threat of the
coronavirus. But here’s a better idea: Scrap them altogether. And not
for health reasons.

The debates have never made sense as a [test for presidential
leadership](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/opinion/presidential-debate-alternatives.html).
In fact, one could argue that they reward precisely the opposite of what
we want in a president. When we were serious about the presidency, we
wanted intelligence, thoughtfulness, knowledge, empathy and, to be sure,
likability. It should also go without saying, dignity.

Yet the debates play an outsize role in campaigns and weigh more heavily
on the verdict than their true value deserves.

Perhaps the most substantive televised debate of all was [the first
one](https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/septe-26-1960-first-televised-presidential-debate/),
between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, which Nixon was considered to
have won on substance on the radio, while the cooler and more appealing
Kennedy won on television. Since these weren’t true debates, the concept
of “winning” one of these odd encounters was always amorphous. (To be
sure, many questions by panels of journalists were designed less to
stimulate debate than to challenge one of the candidates.)

Over time, the debates came to resemble professional wrestling matches,
and more substantive debates were widely panned in the press. Points
went to snappy comebacks and one-liners. Witty remarks drew laughs from
the audience and got repeated for days and remembered for years.

Some of them have been less than hilarious, but they did the job of
dominating reaction to a debate. Whatever substance existed was largely
ignored. In 1980, when Ronald Reagan debated the incumbent Jimmy Carter,
Carter made a serious point about Reagan’s position on Medicare, and
Reagan’s riposte, [“There you go
again,”](https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/28/on-this-day-there-you-go-again/)
a non-answer if ever there was one, brought down the house and that was
that.

In the first 1984 debate, Reagan, seeking re-election and at 73, the
oldest person to be nominated for the presidency, seemed tired and
tended to wander off mentally at times. His lackluster performance
caused panic among his staff. Democratic supporters of former Vice
President Walter Mondale saw an opening.

But another debate soon followed. Thoroughly prepared, Reagan [got off
the
crack](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1844704_1844706_1844612,00.html),
“I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to
exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and
inexperience.”

The audience roared and Mr. Mondale feigned a laugh, knowing he was
cooked. Not even Reagan’s ending of that debate, reminiscing about
driving along the Pacific Coast and musing about time capsules, was
enough to undermine his political prospects. Reagan’s “joke” aimed at
nullifying the age issue dominated the post-debate chatter.

But what is the point or relevance of the carefully prepared one-liner?
It’s as spontaneous as a can of sardines. It’s usually delivered from a
memory chip in the mind, having been fashioned and rehearsed with aides.
When is a president called upon to put down an interlocutor, be it a
member of Congress or a foreign leader?

This, by the way, isn’t written out of any concern that Donald Trump
will prevail over Joe Biden in the debates; Mr. Biden has done just fine
in a long string of such contests. The point is that “winning” a debate,
however assessed, should be irrelevant, as are the debates themselves.

The better way to pay attention to and choose among the presidential
candidates is to follow the long campaign that so many complain about.
The reason for such moaning has always been a mystery, because unless
the campaign is taking place in your living room, you can simply switch
it off.

The key words are “pay attention to,” because over the stretch of
2015-2016 it wasn’t impossible to see the implications of a Trump
presidency. Not just the vulgarity but the ignorance and insensitivity
and extreme narcissism were apparent more than a year before Election
Day.

Moreover, we didn’t need the debates to tell us that Trump had chosen to
be the P.T. Barnum of American politics. For him, it was (and still is)
all about the show, about distracting the public from reality. It was
obvious that Mr. Trump had no real affinity for the working-class people
whose votes he was chasing. Nothing in his life suggested that his heart
was with struggling workers and farmers. It wasn’t impossible to know
that he wasn’t the skilled businessman he professed to be. His
bankruptcies and shady business practices and discrimination against
Black tenants were no secret.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The debates took us nowhere nearer the realities about arguably the most
disastrous president in our history. They became simply another tool in
his arsenal.

The party conventions, also vestigial organs of a political system that
no longer exists, are close to being done away with, if not for the
reasons they should be. There’s no reason not to throw the presidential
debates on the trash heap of useless (at best) rituals that are no help
in our making such a fateful decision.
