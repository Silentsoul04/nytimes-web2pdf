Budgeting is never an easy task, but keeping tabs on your money has
become especially difficult over the past few months. About 30 million
Americans are [collecting jobless
benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/23/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#coin-shortage-united-states-mint),
and more than a million new people [file for
unemployment](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) each week.

In response, the federal government amped up unemployment benefits,
granted loan deferrals and sent out a one-off stimulus jolt that kept
finances afloat until states started to open back up. But Congress most
likely won’t extend the [$600 unemployment
lifeline](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/24/business/economy/600-unemployment-benefits.html),
and those affected will need to adjust, once again, to a harsh financial
reality.

Too often we abandon our financial plans, or avoid planning altogether,
because budgets can be complicated and our lives are unpredictable. But
there are simple actions you can take to get your financial budgets in
order. Here’s a four-step, totally achievable plan that can help you
attain a sense of control.

## Step 1: Cancel something

Sometimes the task of monitoring and planning your saving and spending
feels too big, and the trick is to break down what you’re trying to
achieve into smaller parts before starting with the easiest one.

This strategy, called “small victories” or “snowballing,” is best known
for dealing with credit card debt. You want to go after the card with
the smallest balance, rather than the lowest interest rate, to garner
positive momentum, [according to
research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20125.pdf).

But the principle can be applied to your budget more broadly. To earn a
small win, comb through your credit card and bank statements to find one
small recurring charge you no longer need and cancel it. Consider that
TV streaming service you don’t actually watch, for instance, or ax a
travel or airline credit card with a large annual fee. You can even try
calling the bank to downgrade your credit card to the no-fee version.
(Speaking with a real person almost always yields better results than
sending an email or chatting with a bot.)

## Step 2: Establish your spending number

No matter your income, you probably don’t enjoy setting a budget. In
fact, just one in three households endeavor to track how much they earn
or spend in a given month, per a 2013 [Gallup
survey](https://news.gallup.com/poll/162872/one-three-americans-prepare-detailed-household-budget.aspx).

A simple trick is to recast how you think of a budget. Rather than
accounting for every dollar spent and arranging expenditures by category
(dining out, home improvement, etc.), most people would be better off if
they were to set a number they could safely spend each month on
everything, no matter where or how.

Simplifi, [Wirecutter’s favorite budgeting
app](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/money/best-budgeting-apps-and-tools/?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wcsmarterliving&utm_content=covid-budget),
offers exactly such a service with its Spending Plan. Once you connect
your accounts, the app estimates how much you’ll earn in a month and
then subtracts how much you owe in recurring costs (like debt payments
or your Netflix account). From there, you enter how much you want to
save, and Simplifi helps calculate a custom amount to spend for the rest
of the month without going into debt. Spending Watchlists also let you
keep track of categories where you tend to overspend. While the app
costs $3 per month for a subscription (or $30 for a year), we think its
interface and features are worth it for people looking to take charge of
their finances.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Step 3: Create a reasonable emergency fund

A safe-to-spend number won’t work well for everyone, especially if you
don’t have a stable, predictable paycheck.

Take the couple identified as Becky and Jeremy Moore (their real names
were changed for privacy’s sake), whom the authors Jonathan Morduch and
Rachel Schneider followed for months for their book “[The Financial
Diaries](https://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/book).” Jeremy, an
Ohio-based long-haul truck mechanic, earned most of his salary in the
summer and winter months when the weather was bad and trucks would get
beat up. When it was more temperate, he took home as little as $300 a
week. And the couple is not alone: About half of households, according
to a [2015 Pew Charitable Trust
study](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/Assets/2015/01/FSM_Balance_Sheet_Report.pdf),
see at least a 25 percent gain or loss of income from one year to the
next.

Financial planners would say the Moores should simply dip into their
emergency fund (a pot of money consisting of six months’ worth of
essential expenses in a savings account) when times get tight. But this
commitment can run into the tens of thousands and is a nearly impossible
feat for families with volatile earnings, and difficult even for higher
earning households.

If you can’t save up for an emergency fund, try just saving a regular
percentage of your paycheck (or any windfall, like a tax refund) in a
checking or savings account to help you smooth over income spikes and
dips throughout the
year.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

This type of emergency fund is easier to achieve than the traditional
six-month fund for a few reasons. You don’t need to save as much money,
because the goal is to level off temporary income dips rather than cover
half a year of necessary spending.

And according to Sharif Muhammad, a New Jersey-based certified financial
planner, since you’re saving for something tangible (lower-earning
months that you know will arrive), rather than an undefined, unknown
terrible event, you may find motivation easier to come by.

## Step 4: Save the money that you’re not spending

With vacations canceled, bars closed and gyms out of the question,
you’re probably spending less money than you were pre-Covid. Most
people have pared back their swiping. [Chase credit card
customers](https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-outlook-credit-card-spending-data-recovery-stalling-recession-jpmorgan-2020-7),
for instance, are charging about 10 percent less than they did a year
ago. Fewer available ways to spend money can ultimately be a good thing.
Nearly [70 percent of credit
card](https://www.comparecards.com/blog/credit-card-confidence-index/)
borrowers, according to CompareCards.com, are totally confident they’ll
pay off their balance in full this month, an almost 10 percentage point
increase from this time last year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Of course, skipping all the ways you used to spend money — on flights,
boozy dinners or nights at the movies — only helps your bottom line if
you continue to spend prudently. Sure, you’re saving money by not going
out, but use that money on groceries rather than shelling out $50 on
Wednesday night Grubhub. You might not be going on vacation this summer,
but stash that money away rather than blow it on a luxury purchase.

With nowhere to go and no one to see, spending less and saving more —
