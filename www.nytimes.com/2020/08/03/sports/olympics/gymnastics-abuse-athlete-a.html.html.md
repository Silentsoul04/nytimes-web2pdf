# Gymnasts Worldwide Push Back on Their Sport’s Culture of Abuse

</div>

On Instagram and other social networks, gymnasts have tagged posts with
\#GymnastAlliance to share their own experiences in the wake of a new
documentary that highlights verbal and physical abuse by coaches.

A culture in gymnastics that has tolerated coaches belittling,
manipulating and in some cases physically abusing young athletes is
being challenged by Olympians and other gymnasts around the world after
an uprising in the United States.

Many current and former competitors, emboldened by their American peers,
have broken their silence in recent weeks against treatment they say
created mental scars on girls that lasted well into adulthood.

[One gymnast, who is just 8 years
old](https://www.itv.com/news/2020-07-07/girl-8-describes-bullying-by-gymnastics-coaches-as-review-is-pledged),
said a coach tied her wrists to a horizontal bar when she was 7 and
ignored her as she cried out in pain.

At a time when the Tokyo Olympics would be in session, had they not been
[postponed
until 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/sports/olympics/coronavirus-summer-olympics-postponed.html)
by [the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus), gymnasts have
been sharing horrific stories of coaches body-shaming them, stifling
their emotions, using corporal punishment on them and forcing them to
train with injuries, using the pursuit of medals as a way to rationalize
shameful behavior.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Chloe Gilliland, 29, a former member of the Australian national team,
recalled her coaches telling her that [she was “a bad child” and “a
danger”](https://7news.com.au/sport/gymnastics/how-fat-shaming-drove-aussie-gymnast-to-breaking-point-c-1186590)
to her own body because she was too heavy. At 17, she thought of killing
herself because, she said on Instagram, “I felt like it was easier to
end my own life than to give in to what they wanted me to be.”

Catherine Lyons, 19, once a top junior competitor for Britain, said
coaches would hit her and harass her about her weight, and when she was
7 or 8 she would cry so hard that coaches would shut her inside a
cupboard until she composed herself. Later, she said, she learned she
had post-traumatic stress disorder because of the treatment. [She told
ITV
News](https://www.itv.com/news/2020-07-22/truth-gives-power-to-abused-gymnasts):
“I wasn’t worth anything. I wasn’t a human. I was a commodity rather
than a child.”

Other gymnasts have simply said on social media, “I am one of them.”

The stories from gymnasts in all levels of the sport are part of a
coordinated effort, similar to the \#MeToo movement, calling for the
sport’s leaders to eradicate existing norms that in reality are not
normal at all.

“I was told many times that gymnasts should be seen and not heard
because the sport is all about being the good little gymnast,” said Lisa
Mason, a 2000 British Olympian who was among the gymnasts to speak out
recently.

Mason, 38, said her coaches threw shoes at her and scratched her when
she did not perform perfectly. Once she was made to stay on the uneven
bars until her hands were blistered and ripped, only for a coach to pin
her hands down and pour rubbing alcohol into her raw wounds, she said
Friday in an interview.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Looking back, Mason called the atmosphere “insane,” especially because
gymnasts who start training seriously at a very young age are often left
alone with coaches.

“So many of us are done with normalizing the abuse that we were told was
needed to make champions,” Mason said. “We want change, and it’s
incredible that so many of us are coming together to demand it.”

The gymnasts have made an impact. National gymnastics federations in
Britain, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium have begun
investigations or requested inquiries into alleged abuse, with the Dutch
federation saying it would suspend its entire women’s national team
program as it looked for answers.

[Jennifer Pinches, a 2012 British
Olympian](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gymnastics/2020/07/08/culture-fear-permeating-whole-gymnastics-has-stop/),
said on Friday that this most recent global push to change the sport was
sparked by [a Netflix documentary, “Athlete
A,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/movies/athlete-a-review.html)
which depicts the harrowing training of American elite gymnasts and the
cover-ups that surrounded [U.S.A. Gymnastics’s sexual abuse
scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/sports/olympics/biles-gymnastics-settlement-nassar.html?searchResultPosition=3)
involving [its longtime doctor, Lawrence G.
Nassar](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000005698488/larry-nassar-gymnastics-sex-abuse.html?searchResultPosition=7).

“It was a tipping point that enabled this movement to happen,” said
Pinches, who saw the film when it was released in late June and
persuaded more than 30 British gymnasts, including Mason, to post [a
joint statement](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCBs9R1DPFh/) on social
media condemning “the culture that didn’t put athlete health and
well-being first and allowed Nassar to act.” Mason, who had already
posted a scathing Instagram commentary on the sport’s culture, suggested
that the group use the hashtag \#GymnastAlliance. Now, there have been
more than 700 posts with related tags on Instagram alone.

Back in the United States, [Jennifer Sey, a 1986 national
champion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/sunday/how-gymnastics-culture-breeds-sexual-abuse.html)
and one of the producers of [“Athlete
A,”](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/athlete-a-movie-review-2020)
was stunned that the film prompted so many athletes to come forward
about their experiences, especially when athletes had so many previous
chances to speak up.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over the past 25 years, there have been several books about abuse in the
sport, [including one by Sey
in 2008](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90105904).
There also were [Nassar’s sentencing hearings
in 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/video/sports/100000005686677/gymnasts-confront-larry-nassar-over-sexual-abuse.html?searchResultPosition=8),
during which [more than 150 girls and women spoke
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/sports/rachael-denhollander-nassar-gymnastics.html?searchResultPosition=28)
about his molesting them. Many said the sport’s culture of fear and
silence made them vulnerable to Nassar’s abuse.

In April, Maggie Haney, who coached the Olympian Laurie Hernandez and
other gymnasts, [was suspended for eight years by U.S.A.
Gymnastics](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/sports/maggie-haney-gymnastics-abuse.html)
for verbally abusing and mistreating athletes. It was among the first
times — if not the first — that [a top American coach had been
punished](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/sports/gymnastics-coach-banned-maggie-haney.html)
for that kind of abuse.

Yet gymnasts saw this moment in 2020 as a perfect time to bring
worldwide change to nonsexual abuse in the sport.

“This time, you can’t say the accusations are against just one bad
apple, one bad coach or one bad system, and then dismiss them,” Sey
said. “I think a lot of these women who came forward continued to suffer
because of their coaches’ cruel treatment, and they don’t want to suffer
anymore. They don’t want future generations to suffer,
either.”

The timing makes sense to Cheryl Cooky, an associate professor at Purdue
and sociologist who studies gender and sports.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“People have been more reflective of their lives during this pandemic,
and for athletes, it’s not a time for the Olympics or a time to just
focus solely on your sport,” she said. “They can take time to step back
and think about some important philosophical or existential questions.”

In speaking up, some athletes have been forced to process some dark
memories.

“Athlete A” prompted Olivia Vivian, [an Australian
star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WZPvwQf9AU) of the reality
competition “Ninja Warrior” and a 2008 Olympian, to surface troubling
memories of her gymnastics career that, according to an Instagram post,
she had packed away “deep, deep down.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was the first time she thought about the culture of fear in
gymnastics, she said Sunday in a telephone interview, and she was
overwhelmed because she always considered the mistreatment to be normal.
She said her coaches often yelled and threatened her, saying the gym
would lose funding if she didn’t make the world team. She recalled them
using her as an example to younger girls of what it takes to be a hard
worker, bringing them to her so they could see her torn-up, bleeding
hands. They would say, “You need to push through like Olivia pushes
through,” she said.

The pressure and stress broke Vivian after the 2008 Olympics, she said,
and it took the positivity of gymnastics at Oregon State and the “Ninja
Warrior” community to build her back up. Still, since “Athlete A,”
Vivian has turned to a psychologist to work through her sadness and
guilt over not speaking up sooner so she could have saved other
gymnasts.

“It’s going to take a bit of time for me to work through this,” Vivian
said. “But I’m glad I told my story for the sake of the sport and maybe
give other gymnasts the strength to stand up.”

One person familiar with the abuse gymnasts like Vivian have described
is Gerrit Beltman — because he used to coach that way. In 2013, Beltman
was the subject of a book that accused him of tyrannical behavior while
coaching the Dutch national team. He has also coached elite teams in
Canada, Belgium and Singapore.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in late June, as part of [an
investigation](https://www.noordhollandsdagblad.nl/cnt/dmf20200724_98276713/turncoach-gerrit-beltman-verbreekt-stilzwijgen-over-zijn-onmenselijke-trainingsmethoden-ik-mishandelde-en-vernederde-jonge-turnsters-om-medailles-te-w?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic)
by the Dutch newspaper Noordhollands Dagblad, Beltman apologized for his
actions and said he was “ashamed.” Ten current and former Dutch national
team gymnasts [came forward with
accusations](https://nltimes.nl/2020/07/25/top-gymnastics-coach-acknowledges-history-abuse-mistreatment)
of abuse in that report.

“It was never my conscious intention to beat them, to yell at them, to
hurt their feelings, to belittle them, to gag them or make constant
derogatory remarks about their weight,” Beltman said in Dutch. “But it
did happen. I went too far because I thought it was the only way to
instill a winning mentality in them.”

He said he copied techniques from colleagues and previous coaches who
had delivered many champions. When coaching in Canada, he said in the
newspaper report, he realized that his style needed to change.

Now Beltman says a shift in the sport is “a matter of bitter urgency,”
and his daughter Reina agrees. She was an alternate on the Dutch Olympic
team for the 2016 Rio Games and coached by her father when she was
young. She was among many Dutch gymnasts who posted on social media
about past abuse, later explaining in an interview that she has
struggled with low self-confidence as a result. When asked about her
father’s coaching, she declined to comment.

Reina Beltman did say, however, that her father’s decision to speak
about his past means there is hope for the sport.

“The best thing that could happen right now is for coaches to be honest
and apologize for what they’ve done, so the gymnasts and the sport can
move on,” she said. “We just have to have this conversation and, of
course, changes won’t be made over one night, but it’s a beautiful thing
to take responsibility and try to make things better.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The next step, said Mason, the British Olympian, is for the sport to
create a way for athletes to report abuse to an independent organization
without fear of retribution by their federation or coaches, who have the
power to keep them off top teams, including a national or Olympic team.
Many athletes who recently came forward told Mason they did not trust
leaders in the sport to investigate coaches.

It is no wonder they are skeptical: Some athletes and leaders still
doubt that emotional abuse is real.

Liubov Charkashyna, a former Belarusian rhythmic gymnast, is the
president of the athletes’ commission at the International Gymnastics
Federation, the world’s governing body for the sport. One of her jobs is
to listen to athletes’ concerns and fight for athletes’ rights inside
the federation. But
[in 2019](http://eng.gymnovosti.com/charkashyna-on-sexual-abuse-in-sports-its-america-they-know-how-to-make-money/),
she said the number of women who said they were abused by Nassar was
exaggerated because some women were just trying to get revenge on their
former coaches or earn money.

And less than two weeks ago, the former gymnast Svetlana Khorkina of
Russia, a three-time Olympian and 20-time medal winner at the world
championships whose voice is still powerful in the sport, [told Sport
Express](https://www.sport-express.ru/artistic-gymnastics/reviews/chto-dumaet-olimpiyskaya-chempionka-svetlana-horkina-o-harrasmente-v-sportivnoy-gimnastike-1694484/)
that the recent wave of abuse allegations is silly.

“There are certain things in the profession that are necessary for
success,” she said in Russian to the sports newspaper, and asked why the
gymnasts just didn’t quit the sport, leave the coaches or file lawsuits.
“It’s just self-promoting, ugh\!”

Athletes hesitated out of fear and uncertainty because abuse was so
normalized, Mason said. She said she was disappointed, but not
surprised, to hear Khorkina’s comments because “when you tell a
difficult truth there will always be people trying to discredit you.”

Still, Mason expects even more gymnasts to call for changes in the
sport. She said she had heard from many gymnasts training for the Tokyo
Games who would not come forward until the Olympics were completed. They
do not want to jeopardize their chances of being chosen for their team,
she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Those competitors are just some of the many women who have reached out
to Mason since she first posted about “Athlete A,” to share their
experiences and vent. They say they no longer feel so scared and alone.

“We have a great chance at changing the sport because so many of us are
finally being heard,” Mason said. “There’s so many of us and we’re so
loud that you can’t ignore us.”
