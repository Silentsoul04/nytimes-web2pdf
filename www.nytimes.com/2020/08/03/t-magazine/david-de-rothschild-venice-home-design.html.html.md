Within a storied Los Angeles studio complex, Karina Deyko and David de
Rothschild have built an eclectic, freewheeling space in which to live

While the British environmentalist [David de
Rothschild](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/profile-in-style-david-de-rothschild/)
was at sea in the spring of 2010, crossing the Pacific Ocean on the
[Plastiki](https://theplastiki.com/) — a 60-foot catamaran built
primarily from recycled bottles — to raise awareness about the climate
crisis, the actress Karina Deyko, his wife, made her own voyage of
discovery. She had recently met, through a mutual friend in Los Angeles,
the actress Kelly Reilly and the photographer Guy Webster, who helped
establish the tenets of rock ’n’ roll portraiture in the 1960s with his
images of Jim Morrison and the Rolling Stones. Reilly had been renting a
small apartment within Webster’s sprawling studio complex in Venice
Beach but would soon be traveling to London to make a film. Webster
wondered if Deyko wanted to come see the space and possibly sublet it.
At the time, she was living in Echo Park, on the east side of the city,
and “I knew that when David was done with the Plastiki he’d want to be
by the beach,” Deyko says. So she took Webster up on his offer.

Webster’s building, a 3,000-square-foot compound set within an
early-20th-century industrial depot just four blocks from the ocean, and
divided into a handful of distinct studio spaces, had served as a shed
for storing boats in the 1910s. Although Deyko didn’t learn this history
until later, she immediately sensed it would be a good place for the
couple, who travel widely and often, to drop anchor for a while. She was
drawn, foremost, to the sense of creativity that seemed to emanate from
the gently weathered structure itself, with its worn concrete floors and
high wood-beam ceilings, and from the intriguing people who drifted in
and out of the space. As Venice evolved from a resort town in the 1910s
to a short-lived hub for oil production in the 1930s to a waning
industrial and entertainment district over the following decades, when
its vacant warehouses were repurposed by artists and designers — [Ray
and Charles
Eames](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/arts/ray-charles-eames-artists.html)
established their practice on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in 1943, and the
architects Thom Mayne and Frank Gehry lived and made work in the
neighborhood in the ’70s and ’80s — so too did the building transform,
from a storehouse to a mechanic’s shop to a crash pad for Webster’s
circle of artist and musician friends. And the building’s past lives are
still preserved in its architecture: Low-slung and partially wrapped in
sheets of faded sky-blue corrugated iron, from the street it could
easily be mistaken for a garage (there is even a peeling Texaco logo
painted on the facade). “Energetically,” says Deyko, “I felt it. It was
just an amazing space.” She sublet the studio, Reilly never returned to
live in Los Angeles (she met her future husband during that film shoot
in England) and Deyko and de Rothschild have now lived part-time in the
building for 10 years.

During that decade, the couple purchased the studio and also acquired
two of the neighboring units within the complex when friends moved out.
Today, they inhabit a warren of interconnected spaces that hug a central
paved courtyard and together comprise not only living quarters but also
an office for [the Lost Explorer](https://thelostexplorer.com/), the
environmentally conscious clothing and travel company that de Rothschild
founded in 2015. When they moved in, it was the first home the pair had
shared together and “we’ve made our own history here,” says Deyko. The
interiors, which are featured in the designer, store owner and T
contributor Alex Eagle’s new book “[More Than Just a
House](https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847867714)” (out in October
from Rizzoli), have evolved with the couple, developing not according to
any conscious plan but as a scrapbook might, being added to as the pair
**** acquire souvenirs from their travels and source and hand-build
furniture to suit their changing needs. They favor objects that, in
keeping with their home, bear the marks of unusual histories. On the
white wall above the simple poured-concrete counter of the kitchen off
the main living area, Deyko has pinned baglike woven jute fishing nets
she bought on a trip to Japan. And nearly every accent or piece of
furniture that they didn’t make themselves — “Karina is the kind of
person who will discover some amazing vintage Japanese indigo fabric and
turn it into bean bags,” says Eagle — the couple found at a flea market
or secondhand store, and chose for its faded upholstery, chipping paint
or time-warped wood. The idea behind Eagle’s book, which offers a look
into some of her friends’ living spaces, is “to document homes through
their objects, the things that people collect and that make them tick,”
says Eagle. But while many of its subjects acquire art and design pieces
— whether midcentury Italian lamps or Nike sneakers — with the
doggedness of a true obsessive, Deyko and de Rothschild’s accumulation
of stuff appears more Zenlike, as if their desire is not to own their
possessions but simply to appreciate them, add to their stories and then
pass them on.

And they inhabit the space with a similarly laid-back spirit. Before the
pandemic hit, guests and collaborators would come and go throughout the
day and occasionally crash on a sofa. In the evenings, the couple would
host lively dinner parties and movie nights. And there is a rusted 1950s
candy machine in the kitchen by the living room that their friends know
is always filled with snacks for the taking if they’re nearby and
hungry. “You never know how your day’s going to go or who’s going to
turn up at the door,” says Deyko. While this place is their home for
now, they are aware, too, that they are merely among the stewards of the
building, one whose history will extend beyond them. Though Webster left
Venice in 2014, after suffering a stroke, “the energy here was always
driven by Guy,” says de Rothschild, “It was his photography studio. It
was his place to be creative, and I think it emanated out of that.” They
have thought recently, as they enter their 10th year here, about whether
it might be time “for someone else to come in and put their imprint on
it,” Deyko says. “But I think it will happen organically,” she adds, as
if the couple might simply drift out the door one day and never come
back, allowing a new chapter to begin.
