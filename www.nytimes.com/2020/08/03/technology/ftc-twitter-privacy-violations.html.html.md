OAKLAND, Calif. — Twitter said on Monday that it was under investigation
by the Federal Trade Commission for potentially misusing people’s
personal information to serve ads, adding that it faced fines of $150
million to $250 million.

In a [corporate
filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000141809120000158/twtr-20200630.htm),
Twitter disclosed that the F.T.C. began the investigation last October
after it had linked a database of its users’ personal information, which
it had for security purposes, with a system used by advertising
partners.

The action, which Twitter said was inadvertent, may have violated a 2011
agreement that the company signed with the F.T.C. over consumer privacy.
At the time, Twitter had agreed to a [settlement with the
agency](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/03/ftc-accepts-final-settlement-twitter-failure-safeguard-personal-0)
after hackers had gained administrative control of the social media
service on multiple occasions. Under the agreement, Twitter was
restricted from misleading people about the measures it took to protect
their security and privacy.

An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on the investigation.

Brandon Borrman, a Twitter spokesman, said the company was contacted by
the F.T.C. after it reported quarterly financial results on July 23. The
investigation was disclosed in accordance with “standard accounting
rules” and was included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, he added.

Twitter encourages people to provide their phone numbers so that it can
add a second step to the login process, called two-factor
authentication, which ensures that users receive a text message before
gaining access to their own account. But the phone numbers also ended up
in a system that allowed advertisers to tailor their ads to specific
audiences, the company said. It was unclear how many people were
affected, Twitter said.

“When an advertiser uploaded their marketing list, we may have matched
people on Twitter to their list based on the email or phone number the
Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes,” the
company said in an October [blog
post](https://help.twitter.com/en/information-and-ads) that disclosed
the incident. “This was an error and we apologize.”

Twitter’s security practices have recently been under scrutiny for other
reasons. Last month, [hackers took over dozens of Twitter
accounts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/technology/twitter-hack-bill-gates-elon-musk.html)
and sent tweets from the accounts of prominent individuals, including
former President Barack Obama and the reality TV star Kim Kardashian
West, to gain Bitcoin. Three people, including a Florida teenager whom
authorities have called the “mastermind,” have been [arrested and
charged](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/twitter-hack-arrest.html)
with the breach.

Twitter is not the only social media company to fall under F.T.C.
scrutiny for using information that people had provided for security
reasons for advertising.

Last year, the agency fined Facebook [$5
billion](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions)to
settle several privacy violations, including the use of people’s phone
numbers, which had been provided for security purposes, for its
advertising business. Facebook agreed that it would no longer use
telephone numbers obtained in the name of security for advertising.
