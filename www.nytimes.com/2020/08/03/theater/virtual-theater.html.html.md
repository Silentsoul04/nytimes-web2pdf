As the pandemic has sent most art forms scurrying into mole holes, some
have had to adapt more than others. In the theater, the change has been
especially pronounced, amounting to a complete upside-down flip: Big
players can’t squeeze themselves into the new accommodations, but little
ones feel right at home.

So the experimental, the fringe and the avant-garde, which have never
depended on lavish funding or popular attention, are not only surviving
in their online digs but also, at least by contrast, thriving. My diet
as a theater critic has likewise flipped. Temporarily relieved of
Broadway jukebox musicals and 16-week revivals, I am taking in more
offbeat stuff than ever, and finding more to like in it.

Or more to learn from it, at least.

Last week alone, I watched a slapstick adaptation of [a science fiction
classic staged in a
closet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/theater/the-7th-voyage-of-egon-tichy-review.html)
by Theater in Quarantine, a [nearly wordless shadow-puppet
show](http://manualcinema.com/watch/) from Manual Cinema and [a Zoom
pandemic
drama](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/theater/in-these-uncertain-times-review.html)
devised by Source Material. On Saturday I added an in-your-face
autobiographical memoir about a wheelchair and a multimedia memory play
produced, in part, by an academic think tank.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mind you, offbeat material, by its nature, is not always as coherent or
as charming as the polished commercial kind. Nor is everything offbeat
always so fresh; though some of what I saw was making its debut via
livestream, some of it was recorded. (Manual Cinema’s show, “[Lula del
Ray](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/theater/lula-del-ray-a-spectral-parade-of-fantastical-images.html),”
is part of [the company’s 10th anniversary
retrospective](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/theater/manual-cinema-puppets-retrospective.html).)
Furthermore, like moles everywhere, online experimental productions can
be hard to catch: They pop up pretty suddenly and disappear fast.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But it’s worth the effort to track them down because they are doing the
important work that the avant-garde has always done, only now on your
computer and often for free. They push theater toward new content and
forms.

Accessibility is a key theme in Athena Stevens’s play “Scrounger,” which
was recorded in front of a live audience in January at the 50-seat
[Finborough Theater](https://finboroughtheatre.co.uk) in London. ([The
recording can be streamed on YouTube through 7 p.m. Eastern on Aug. 3,
and again on Aug. 31.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8jvP5djME)) It
is hardly experimental in concept: It’s basically a monologue, performed
by Stevens, with Leigh Quinn assisting in a variety of small roles. But
it is, unfortunately, avant-garde in its concerns, advancing a woefully
belated discussion about [making people with disabilities welcome in the
theater](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/theater/under-the-radar-festival-neurodiversity.html)
both as audiences and artists.

Stevens, [a Chicago-born playwright now living in
England](https://www.athenastevens.com/), has cerebral palsy.
“Scrounger,” directed by Lily McLeish, is the galling true story of
how she was kicked off a British Airways flight from London to Glasgow
because the plane crew could not fit her motorized wheelchair into the
cargo hold — and subsequently “trashed” it. Neither the regulations of
the European Union nor a social media campaign that drew thousands of
supporters seemed to help; she remained all but trapped in her apartment
for weeks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It says a lot about Stevens’s mordant tone that she named the play (and
her character) for the insult online haters flung at her, as if she were
perpetrating a scam instead of trying to regain her independent
mobility. Also part of her strategy is a total lack of ingratiation, not
only to authorities, but also to her boyfriend and even to the audience.
She begins the play by congratulating us for being so “delightfully
progressive” as to watch “a borderline freak show” in order to brag
about it later.

“You’ll say how hard it was to watch me,” she predicts witheringly, “but
you stuck through the awkward moments because you are a good person
waiting for a poor outsider like me to be a vibrator to your ego.”

That part was in fact hard to watch, and hear; the captioning was of
little help in interpreting some of Stevens’s speech. (It often rendered
“Scrounger” as “grandeur.”) But the difficulty was apt: Disability or
not, people don’t readily understand one another. And there was no
mistaking the impact of the play’s shift from anecdote to insight, as
all of Scrounger’s paths to recourse reach a dead end. “We can’t see
what we want in the law, what we think ought to be there when it really
isn’t,” she says mournfully.

Mainstream works won’t typically tell you, as “Scrounger” does, that
optimism is just another privilege only a few can afford. But
experimental works by Black playwrights, now beginning to reach wide
audiences, have been showing us that for a while. Stevens, who is white,
says she has been influenced by writers of color like [Branden
Jacobs-Jenkins](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/magazine/branden-jacobs-jenkins-isnt-writing-about-race.html)
and [Arinzé
Kene](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/27/arinze-kene-interview-misty-death-of-a-salesman),
at least in figuring out how do write about disability [without writing
a “disability
play.”](https://www.larktheatre.org/blog/athena-stevens-box-ticking-narrative-control/)
What I think she’s missed from those playwrights, at least in
“Scrounger,” is the form-busting spirit that often accompanies the
expansion of
content.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Virginia Grise’s “a farm for meme” has the form-busting down. A
20-minute meditation on growth, death and rebirth, it mixes box puppets,
shadow play, live film and archival footage into a gorgeous
mise-en-scène that feels theatrical in its purposefully homemade
aesthetic. Arms are made of red construction paper; flower stems, of
measuring tapes.

Like Grise’s earlier work, including [the award-winning
“blu,”](https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/yale-drama-series-prize-awarded/)
the story itself is poetic and symbolic — perhaps too much so, even in
such a short piece. But it is anchored in the reality of the 14-acre
[South Central Farm](https://www.southcentralfarm.org/about-us) that
arose after the 1992 uprisings in Los Angeles. As a child draws his
memories of that Eden after it is bulldozed, a woman (Marlene Beltran)
tells the story of the queer family and vibrant Chicano culture that
flourished among its walnut trees.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Directed (“virtually”) by Elena Araoz, “a farm for meme” was produced by
a consortium that includes [Cara Mía
Theater](https://www.caramiatheatre.org/) of North Texas and
[Innovations in Socially Distant
Performance](https://www.sociallydistantperformance.com/), an academic
research program Araoz leads at Princeton University. We are going to
need those innovations, though it’s hard to say whether all of the ones
I heard about in a companion seminar are viable. Plays on eBay? Ghost
audiences?

But that’s the point, really. Ideas bubble up from underground during
crises, thanks to people who couldn’t find a platform before. Now that
they’re suggesting new kinds of stories and new ways of telling them,
can we hope that, soon enough, the rest of the theater will start
putting them together?
