## Back-to-school outbreaks

The school year is underway in some parts of the United States — and
we’re already seeing [how fraught reopening classrooms can
be](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#link-4c85ed64):

  - On Saturday, the superintendent of the Elwood Community School
    Corporation in Central Indiana sent a note thanking students and
    parents for “a great first two days of school\!” But several staff
    members then tested positive, and the high school was forced to
    close its doors.

  - Just hours into the first day of classes at Greenfield Central
    Junior High School, also in Indiana, the county health department
    notified the school that a student had tested positive. The student
    was isolated, and others who had been in proximity were forced to
    quarantine for two weeks.

  - At a high school in Corinth, Miss., someone also tested positive
    during the first week back, and exposed students there were asked to
    stay home for 14 days.

These scattered outbreaks are exactly what you would expect given [the
high levels of viral transmission in many U.S.
states](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html),
as we reported on Friday. And there are surely many schools that opened
without a hitch, at least so far. But over the next few weeks, we will
undoubtedly see many more outbreaks — and that could push districts
teetering on the question of whether to allow in-person teaching right
off the edge.

**In other school coronavirus developments:** Gov. Larry Hogan of
Maryland [issued an emergency
order](https://twitter.com/GovLarryHogan/status/1290330304830246912)
counteracting Montgomery County’s health department, which on Friday
said that all private schools needed to [start the year teaching
remotely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/montgomery-county-health-officials-tell-private-schools-to-start-school-online/2020/08/01/64552b9e-d3fd-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html).
Montgomery County is home to some of the nation’s most prestigious
private schools, including St. Andrew’s Episcopal School, attended by
Barron Trump, the president’s youngest child.

## Show us your coronavirus bills

Debbie Krebs went to the hospital in March with lung pain and a cough,
and a doctor swabbed her nose for the coronavirus. A week later, the
laboratory called with her results: negative. But when the hospital bill
arrived, the coronavirus test was missing. Without it, Ms. Krebs didn’t
qualify for protections Congress had put in place that barred insurers
from charging patients for visits meant to diagnose the coronavirus. She
was told she owed $1,980.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Across the United States, Americans like Ms. Krebs are receiving
surprise bills for coronavirus care. Tests for the virus can cost $199
to $6,408 at the same location. A coming wave of treatment bills could
be hundreds of times
higher.

This patchwork of medical billing is one reason our colleague Sarah
Kliff, an investigative reporter who covers health care, is starting
something new today: She’s asking readers to send in copies of medical
bills for coronavirus testing and treatment. She told us that the prices
hospitals and insurers negotiate are kept secret from the public, and
patients often don’t know the price until they get a bill.

“It’s a very inefficient method to ask people to send in their bills,
but it’s the best strategy we’ve got,” Sarah told us. “My hope is to
really shine a light on how this is affecting patients. And then, people
can make decisions about where to be treated, and legislators can decide
if something should be done to change this.”

If you’re interested in participating in Sarah’s reporting, you can

**Related**: More than two million Americans, already hit hard
economically by the pandemic, have also recently lost their health
insurance, [according to a new
analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-2dcb9c03)
of census data.

## Resurgences

  - President Rodrigo Duterte of the **Philippines** ordered Manila and
    its suburbs [to re-enter lockdown for two
    weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-284aa099)
    after 5,032 new cases were reported.

  - Despite a lockdown that began a month ago, officials in
    **Melbourne**, Australia, [announced stricter measures to stem an
    outbreak](https://www.dw.com/en/australia-melbourne-enters-tough-new-lockdown-and-curfew/a-54408689).
    For six weeks, residents will be under curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.,
    with exemptions for work or giving and receiving care.

  - **New Jersey** will [again restrict indoor
    gatherings](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html#link-6c117b4e)
    as cases have risen in the state. Gatherings will be limited to a
    maximum of 25 people, down from 100 people.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

## What else we’re following

  - Government data [leaked to the
    BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53598965) suggests
    Iran is covering up the true toll of the virus. Nearly 42,000 people
    there have died, the data shows, which is three times as many as the
    publicly announced total.

  - More than 40 people on a cruise ship from Norway [tested positive
    for the
    virus](https://news.yahoo.com/outbreak-hits-norway-cruise-ship-101611509.html),
    The Associated Press reports. Health authorities fear the ship may
    have spread the virus to dozens of towns and villages along its
    route.

  - The governor of California says the state [has achieved
    “stabilization.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#link-450dc05c)

  - With a focus on the coronavirus, other deadly diseases [like
    tuberculosis, H.I.V. and malaria are making a
    comeback](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html).

  - Some scientists are worried about political pressure from the White
    House [to deliver a vaccine before the election in
    November](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html).

  - Muzzles. Germ shields. Dirt traps: During the influenza panic of
    1918 and 1919, masks played a role in political and cultural wars,
    [and some people resisted wearing
    them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/mask-protests-1918.html).
