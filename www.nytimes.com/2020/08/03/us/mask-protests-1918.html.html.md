# The Mask Slackers of 1918

As the influenza pandemic swept across the United States in 1918 and
1919, masks took a role in political and cultural wars.

The masks were called muzzles, germ shields and dirt traps. They gave
people a “pig-like snout.” Some people snipped holes in their masks to
smoke cigars. Others fastened them to dogs in mockery. Bandits used them
to rob banks.

More than a century ago, as the 1918 influenza pandemic raged in the
United States, masks of gauze and cheesecloth became the facial front
lines in the battle against the virus. But as they have now, the masks
also stoked political division. Then, as now, medical authorities urged
the wearing of masks to help slow the spread of disease. And then, as
now, some people resisted.

In 1918 and 1919, as bars, saloons, restaurants, theaters and schools
were closed, masks became a scapegoat, a symbol of government overreach,
inspiring protests, petitions and defiant bare-face gatherings. All the
while, thousands of Americans were dying in a deadly pandemic.

## 1918: The infection spreads.

The first infections were identified in March, at an Army base in
Kansas, where 100 soldiers were infected. Within a week, the [number of
flu cases grew
fivefold,](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/pandemic-timeline-1918.htm)
and soon the disease was taking hold across the country, prompting some
cities to impose quarantines and mask orders to contain it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By the fall of 1918, seven cities — San Francisco, Seattle, Oakland,
Sacramento, Denver, Indianapolis and Pasadena, Calif. — had put in
effect mandatory face mask laws, said [Dr. Howard
Markel](http://chm.med.umich.edu/about/howard-markel-m-d-ph-d/), a
historian of epidemics and the author of
“[Quarantine\!](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/quarantine)”

Organized resistance to mask wearing was not common, Dr. Markel said,
but it was present. “There were flare-ups, there were scuffles and there
were occasional groups, like the Anti-Mask League,” he said, “but that
is the exception rather than the rule.”

At the forefront of the safety measures was San Francisco, where a man
returning from a trip to Chicago apparently carried the virus home,
according to [archives about the pandemic at the University of
Michigan.](http://www.influenzaarchive.org/cities/city-sanfrancisco.html)

By the end of October, there were more than 60,000 cases statewide, with
7,000 of them in San Francisco. It soon became known as the “masked
city.”

to be four layers thick.

## Masks that looked like ‘slabs of ravioli’

Resisters complained about appearance, comfort and freedom, even after
the flu [killed an estimated 195,000 Americans in October
alone.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/pandemic-timeline-1918.htm)

Alma Whitaker, writing in The Los Angeles Times on Oct. 22, 1918,
reviewed masks’ impact on society and celebrity, saying famous people
shunned them because it was “so horrid” to go unrecognized.

“The big restaurants are the funniest sights, with all the waiters and
diners masked, the latter just raising their screen to pop in a mouthful
of food,” she
wrote.

The San Francisco Chronicle said the simplest type of mask was of folded
gauze affixed with elastic or tape. The police went for gauze masks,
which resembled an unflattering “nine ordinary slabs of ravioli arranged
in a square.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There was room for creativity. Some of the coverings were “fearsome
looking machines” that lent a “pig-like aspect” to the wearer’s face.

## Mask court

The penalty for violators was $5 to $10, or 10 days’ imprisonment.

On Nov. 9, 1,000 people were arrested, The San Francisco Chronicle
reported. City prisons swelled to standing room only; police shifts and
court sessions were added to help manage.

“Where is your mask?” Judge Mathew Brady asked offenders at the Hall of
Justice, where sessions dragged into night. Some gave fake names, said
they just wanted to light a cigar or that they hated following laws.

Jail terms of 8 hours to 10 days were given out. Those who could not pay
$5 were jailed for 48
hours.

## The ‘mask slacker’ of San Francisco is shot.

On Oct. 28, a blacksmith named James Wisser stood on Powell and Market
streets in front of a drugstore, urging a crowd to dispose of their
masks, which he described as “bunk.”

A health inspector, Henry D. Miller, led him to the drugstore to buy a
mask.

At the door, Mr. Wisser struck Mr. Miller with a sack of silver dollars
and knocked him to the ground, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.
While being “pummeled,” Mr. Miller, 62, fired four times with a
revolver. Passers-by “scurried for cover,” The Associated Press said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Wisser was injured, as were two bystanders. He was charged with
disturbing the peace, resisting an officer and assault. The inspector
was charged with assault with a deadly weapon.

## In Los Angeles, ‘To Mask or Not to Mask.’

That was the headline for a report published in The Los Angeles Times
when city officials met in November to decide whether to require
residents to wear “germ scarers” or “flu-scarers.”

Public feedback was invited. Some supported masks so theaters, churches
and schools could operate. Opponents said masks were “mere dirt and dust
traps and do more harm than good.”

“I have seen some persons wearing their masks for a while hanging about
their necks, and then apply them to their faces, forgetting that they
might have picked up germs while dangling about their clothes,” Dr. E.W.
Fleming said in a Los Angeles Times report.

An ear, nose and throat specialist, Dr. John J. Kyle, said: “I saw a
woman in a restaurant today with a mask on. She was in ordinary street
clothes, and every now and then she raised her hand to her face and
fussed with the mask.”

## In Illinois, the right to choose, and to reject.

Suffragists fighting for the right to vote made a gesture that rejected
covering their mouths at a time when their voices were crucial.

At the annual convention of the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association, in
October 1918, they set chairs four feet apart, closed doors to the
public and limited attendance to 100 delegates, the Chicago Daily
Tribune
reported.

But the women “showed their scorn” for masks, it said. It’s unclear why.

Allison K. Lange, an associate history professor at Wentworth Institute
of Technology, said one reason could have been that they wanted to keep
a highly visible profile.

“Suffragists wanted to make sure their leaders were familiar political
figures,” Dr. Lange said.

## ‘Four weeks of muzzled misery’

San Francisco’s mask ordinance expired after four weeks at noon on Nov.
21. The city celebrated, and church bells tolled.

A “delinquent” bent on blowing his nose tore his mask off so quickly
that it “nearly ruptured his ear,” The San Francisco Chronicle reported.
He and others stomped on their masks in the street. As a police officer
watched, it dawned on him that “his vigil over the masks was done.”

Waiters, barkeeps and others bared their faces. Drinks were on the
house. Ice cream shops handed out treats. The sidewalks were strewn with
gauze, the “relics of a torturous month,” The Chronicle
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected

        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their

        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may

      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The spread had been halted. But a second wave was on the horizon.

By December, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors was again proposing
a mask requirement, meeting with testy
opposition.

Around the end of the year, a bomb was defused outside the office of San
Francisco’s chief health officer, Dr. William C. Hassler. “Things were
violent and aggressive, but it was because people were losing money,”
said Brian Dolan, a medical historian at the University of California,
San Francisco. “It wasn’t about a constitutional issue; it was a money
issue.”

By the end of 1918, the death toll from influenza had reached at least
244,681, mostly in the last four months, according to government
[statistics.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsushistorical/mortstatsh_1918.pdf)

## 1919: A new year

In January, Pasadena’s city commission passed a mask ordinance. The
police grudgingly enforced it, cracking down on cigar smokers and
passengers in cars. Sixty people were arrested on the first day, The Los
Angeles Times reported on Jan. 22, in an article titled “Pasadena Snorts
Under Masks.”

“It is the most unpopular law ever placed on the Pasadena records,” W.S.
McIntyre, the chief of police, told the paper. “We are cursed from all
sides.”

Some mocked the rule by stretching gauze across car vents or dog snouts.
Cigar vendors said they lost customers, though enterprising aficionados
cut a hole in the cloth. (They were still arrested.) Barbers lost
shaving business. Merchants complained traffic dropped as more people
stayed home.

Petitions were circulated at cigar stands. Arrests rose, even of the
powerful. Ernest May, the president of Security National Bank of
Pasadena, and five “prominent” guests were rounded up at the Maryland
Hotel one Sunday.

They had masks on, but not covering their faces.

## The Anti-Mask League.

As the contagion moved into its second year, so did the skepticism.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Dec. 17, 1918, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors reinstituted
the mask ordinance after deaths started to climb, a trend that spilled
over into the new year with [1,800 flu cases and 101 deaths reported
there in the first five days of
January.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/pandemic-timeline-1918.htm)

That board’s decision led to the creation of the Anti-Mask League, a
sign that resistance to masks was resurfacing as cities tried to
reimpose orders to wear them when infections returned.

The league was led by a woman, E.J. Harrington, a lawyer, social
activist and political opponent of the mayor. About a half-dozen other
women filled its top ranks. Eight men also joined, some of them
representing unions, along with two members of the board of supervisors
who had voted against masks.

“The masks turned into a political symbol,” Dr. Dolan
said.

On Jan. 25, the league held its first organizational meeting, open to
the public at the Dreamland Rink, where they united behind demands for
the repeal of the mask ordinance and for the resignations of the mayor
and health officials.

Their objections included lack of scientific evidence that masks worked
and the idea that forcing people to wear the coverings was
unconstitutional.

On Jan. 27, the league protested at a Board of Supervisors meeting, but
the mayor held his ground. There were hisses and cries of “freedom and
liberty,” [Dr. Dolan wrote in his paper on the
epidemic.](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5q91q53r)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Repeal came a few days later on Feb. 1, when Mayor Rolph cited a
downturn in infections.

But a third wave of flu rolled in late that year. The final death toll
reached an estimated 675,000 nationwide, or 30 for every 1,000 people in
San Francisco, making it one of the worst-hit cities in America.

Dr. Dolan said the story of the Anti-Mask League, which has drawn
renewed interest now in 2020, demonstrates the disconnect between
individual choice and universal compliance.

That sentiment echoes through the century from the voice of a San
Francisco railway worker named Frank Cocciniglia.

Arrested on Kearny Street in January, Mr. Cocciniglia told the judge
that he “was not disposed to do anything not in harmony with his
feelings,” according to a Los Angeles Times report.

He was sentenced to five days in jail.

“That suits me,” Mr. Cocciniglia said as he left the stand. “I won’t
have to wear a mask there.”
