Jersey}\label{navy-investigates-video-of-dogs-attacking-man-in-kaepernick-jersey}}

The Navy condemned the video, which it said was taken at an
``independent organization's event'' last year. A filmmaker said it took
place at a museum dedicated to the SEALs.

The U.S. Navy command that oversees the SEALs is investigating a video
of dogs attacking a man in a Colin Kaepernick jersey at a 2019 event in
Florida, the authorities said this week.

The Naval Special Warfare Command on Sunday condemned the incident,
which it described as ``a military working dog demonstration'' that took
place at an ``independent organization's event'' last year.
\href{https://twitter.com/BillyCorben/status/1289961836264095744}{A pair
of videos} of the event surfaced on social media over the weekend, and
the recordings were soon seen more than four million times. The Naval
Special Warfare Command said it had become aware of the footage on
Sunday.

In one video, four dogs attack a man wearing protective equipment and a
red and white football jersey with Mr. Kaepernick's name and number when
he played quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. Another man can be
heard describing the dogs leaping at and biting the man in the style of
a play-by-play announcer.

``The inherent message of this video is completely inconsistent with the
values and ethos of Naval Special Warfare and the U.S. Navy,'' the
command
\href{https://twitter.com/us_navyseals/status/1290034412218802176}{said}
in a statement on Twitter on Sunday responding to the video. ``We are
investigating the matter fully and initial indications are that there
were no active-duty Navy personnel or equipment involved with this
independent organization's event.''

In \href{https://twitter.com/BillyCorben/status/1289979415879798784}{the
second video}, a dog can be seen biting the man in the red jersey, now
lying on the ground. As someone approaches him with a weapon, the man in
the jersey says, ``Oh, man, I will stand,'' an apparent joke about Mr.
Kaepernick's gesture of kneeling during the national anthem in protest
against racism and police brutality. In the video, spectators laugh.

The Miami filmmaker Billy Corben, one of the people who shared the video
over the weekend, said it took place at the National Navy UDT-SEAL
Museum, also known as the National Navy SEAL Museum, in Fort Pierce,
Fla.

The UDT-SEAL Museum Association,
\href{https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-the-navy-seal-museum/the-origin-of-the-national-navy-udt-seal-museum}{a
nonprofit organization}, did not immediately respond to a request for
comment on Monday. The museum describes itself as ``the only museum
dedicated solely to preserving the history of the U.S. Navy SEALs and
their predecessors.''

A dog called Raven is named in one of the videos, and listed on the
museum's website as trained by the company Baden K-9. The company did
not immediately respond to a request for more information.

Since 2016, kneeling has become
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/sports/football/george-floyd-kaepernick-kneeling-nfl-protests.html}{a
symbol in nationwide demonstrations against racism}, and Mr. Kaepernick
and other players have faced
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/sports/nfl-colin-kaepernick-protests-timeline.html}{intense
backlash by some fans and conservatives}, including President Trump, who
have accused them of being unpatriotic. Mr. Kaepernick, 32,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/sports/football/free-agent-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest.html}{left
the 49ers in 2017} and has not been signed by any team since.

It was not immediately clear who had filmed the event the Navy was
investigating. Mr. Corben, the filmmaker who shared the videos, said
that his followers had alerted him about the videos weeks ago, but he
only shared them Sunday.

``It just seemed like another disturbing Florida novelty for a Sunday
afternoon,'' he said. ``I did not anticipate this 19-month-old video to
be as newsworthy as it has become.''

Mr. Corben, who is known for sharing viral videos and breaking new
stories about Florida, said he began doing so because it felt ``like an
extension for what I do for a living, making documentaries that are
Florida-centric in most cases.''

He said that social media ``enables me to share eccentric Florida
stories that I would never get a chance to make a documentary about''
but were ``worth people's time and attention.''
