He would be wise to remember that Barack Obama didn’t pick him simply

When it comes to the vice presidency, Joe Biden has a perfect candidate
in mind: himself.

Well, if he were *Josephine* R. Biden Jr., of course.

In comments about his search for a running mate, Mr. Biden has made
clear he wants someone with the characteristics that he believes made
him the perfect pick for Barack Obama in 2008 — someone who is loyal, is
ready to govern “on Day 1” and is, as Mr. Biden has said, “simpatico
with me, both in terms of personality as well as substance.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Of course, self-perception isn’t always accurate. Sure, Mr. Obama wanted
someone he could work alongside. And, as his strategist David Axelrod
later recounted, [early
chemistry](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2015/02/10/biden-vice-president-bayh-axelrod/81211852/)
between the two men helped finalize the selection of Mr. Biden.

But at the start, the Obama-Biden relationship was hardly the bromance
immortalized in the Democratic memes that followed. People close to Mr.
Obama’s 2008 campaign have said they had real concerns about Mr. Biden,
most centrally about his ability to stay on message and his propensity
for political gaffes.

[As the race against John McCain
tightened](https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/08/13/mccain-obama-race-enters-dead-heat/)
that August, the thinking of those in Mr. Obama’s orbit was that they
needed a white man on the ticket, preferably an “[older
guy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/politics/biden-obama-history.html)”
who could reassure voters worried about taking a chance on a young,
barrier-breaking
senator.

People involved in the process, The New York Times [reported in the
immediate aftermath of the
announcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/us/politics/24deconstruct.html?_r=1&hp=&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1219585399-mopoNQ9Taivokt1V0PHsig),
attributed Mr. Obama’s decision to Mr. Biden’s appeal among white
working-class voters and his compelling personal story. Another plus: At
Mr. Biden’s age, then a spry 65 years old, Obama advisers didn’t expect
him to run for the presidency (LOL).

“You are the pick of my heart, but Joe is the pick of my head,” [Mr.
Obama told Tim
Kaine](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/politics/biden-obama-history.html),
then the governor of Virginia, after he made his choice.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So Mr. Biden’s idealized version of his own vice-presidential process
clearly involves a bit of revisionist history.

He has already made at least one politically strategic choice by
limiting the candidates to women. Limiting the prospects by gender
eliminates a lot of Mr. Biden’s most loyal and presumably “simpatico”
allies — a group that largely comprises white men. As [one racial
justice activist politely put
it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-under-pressure-to-shatter-cement-ceiling-by-naming-a-black-woman-to-be-his-running-mate/2020/07/19/7dfb9dcc-c06f-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html):
“Even his set of relationships, I’m quite sure, are geared toward his
world.”

Picking a woman isn’t about personal loyalty; it’s about energizing
female voters and recognizing the momentum that women — particularly
Black women — have given the Democratic Party during the Trump era.

Given his age, Mr. Biden also needs to reassure voters that there’s
someone who can take over if he can no longer serve as president — a
reason there aren’t many older women on the list.

I suppose this is a really long way of guiding you, dear readers,
through the blizzard of vice-presidential speculation blanketing the
political conversation.

Mr. Biden said he would announce his pick in early August, so the
forecast this week is for more hot takes, rumors and backbiting. Because
the field is all women, there will probably be a touch of sexism in the
mix as well, as we’ve already seen in
[reports](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/kamala-harris-biden-vp-381829)
detailing largely anonymous concerns from donors [who say Kamala
Harris](https://twitter.com/feliciasonmez/status/1288587415813345282) is
“too ambitious” for the job. (I’ve never met an unambitious politician,
but perhaps that’s a subject for a whole other column.)

Don’t get too caught up in the leaks and the counterleaks, the “close
Biden allies” and the chattering donors. Sure, picking a running mate is
complicated. Sure, personal relationships and trust matter. But you know
who doesn’t care about chemistry? Losing presidential candidates.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the end, there’s one strategic imperative that outweighs all of the
others.

Winning.

We asked for your thoughts on the vice-presidential pick. Here’s some of
what you had to say:

> It should be Kamala Harris for several reasons: 1) She will have Mike
> Pence crying out for Mommy before the end of the V.P. debate. 2) When
> attacked by the Republicans for her gaffes as California’s attorney
> general, she’ll shame them as white nationalists trying to destroy
> another Black woman. 3) She has a winning smile. Think Reagan. Think
> W. Think Clinton. Think Obama. 4) Who else has an anagram of her name
> close to “I Alarm Shark”?

— Tom Woodward

> The first — and most important — question the nominee has to ask of
> her/himself is: “Who would be the best president?” Susan Rice passes
> that test with all her experience, understanding, temperament and
> grace. And she’ll adapt easily to campaign mode.

— Tim Hulbert

> Tammy Duckworth would be a strong vice-presidential candidate for the
> following reasons: She has campaign experience. She has congressional
> experience. She represents a seemingly forgotten constituency: the men
> and women actually fighting a war that can’t be won and apparently
> will never end. She juggles daily the responsibilities of motherhood
> with those of her political career.

— Elisabeth Martensen

And there were at least a few names not on Mr. Biden’s list …

> I suggest Condoleezza Rice. As a former secretary of state, she has a
> strong background in world affairs, speaks Russian and could help
> repair the damage done by Trump around the world. Although she has not
> run for office, I think she would be an articulate speaker and
> candidate. Since she has served a Republican president, I think she
> would be appealing to the many Republicans like me who will be voting
> for Joe Biden.

— Irene McAllister

> Michelle Obama. She has more experience and ability than all of them,
> including Biden.

— Jerry McCann
