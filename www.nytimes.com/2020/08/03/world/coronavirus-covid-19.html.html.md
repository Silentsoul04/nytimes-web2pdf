## Fauci defends Birx after she is criticized by Trump.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist,
agreed on Monday with his colleague Dr. Deborah Birx that the United
States has entered a “new phase” of the coronavirus pandemic, in which
the virus is now spreading uncontrolled in some states by asymptomatic
people — comments that drew fire from President Trump.

Dr. Fauci said Dr. Birx had been referring to the “inherent community
spread” that is occurring in some states, adding: “When you have
community spread, it’s much more difficult to get your arms around that
and contain it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Speaking during a news conference with Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut,
Dr. Fauci called the community spread “insidious” and noted that it was
happening outside of confined spaces like nursing homes and prisons.

In backing up Dr. Birx, the Trump administration’s coronavirus response
coordinator, Dr. Fauci indirectly put himself at odds with the
president. Earlier on Monday, Mr. Trump had called Dr. Birx “pathetic”
on Twitter and suggested that her comments about a “new phase” were an
effort to curry favor with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At an evening news conference, Mr. Trump appeared to temper his comments
about Dr. Birx. “She’s a person I have a lot of respect for,” he said,
while defending his administration’s response to the virus.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. [responded to Mr. Trump in a
tweet](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1290350721515139072) on
Monday afternoon. “It’s hard to believe this has to be said, but if I’m
elected president, I’ll spend my Monday mornings working with our
nation’s top experts to control this virus — not insulting them on
Twitter,” Mr. Biden said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But other Republicans piled on. “Dr. Birx, like Dr. Fauci, has been
wrong much more than she has been right on COVID-19, & their destructive
prescriptions have led to the devastation of countless American lives,”
Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1290297517582610433?s=20).

Dr. Birx had warned during an appearance on the CNN program “State of
the Union” on Sunday that the United States was entering a “new phase”
in its fight against the pandemic, and that rural communities would not
be spared. “It is extraordinarily widespread,” she said.

On Monday morning, shortly after Mr. Trump tweeted about her, Dr. Birx
told governors on a weekly briefing call that a lack of masks at large
gatherings in homes was “a critical issue,” pointing to spikes in many
Southern states.

Mr. Trump has also criticized Dr. Fauci, despite his claims that the two
have a “very good relationship.” In [a tweet on
Saturday](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1289633359681839105)
responding to news reports that Dr. Fauci had linked the recent surge in
cases to inadequate lockdowns, Mr. Trump tweeted: “Wrong\!”

In a [livestreamed
conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PgmAWgiL1A&feature=youtu.be)
on Monday with Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of The Journal
of the American Medical Association, Dr. Fauci said that as communities
around the country struggle to decide whether and how to reopen schools,
scientists “really need to be humble.”

There are significant gaps in knowledge about how likely children are to
contract the coronavirus, become ill and transmit the disease, Dr. Fauci
said. A [recent
study](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html?searchResultPosition=1)
found that young children carried high levels of the virus in their
noses and throats, for example, but did not prove they were contagious.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Fauci said he hoped some questions about the risks to children and
their role in transmission would be answered by a new [government
study](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/study-determine-incidence-novel-coronavirus-infection-us-children-begins)
that involves 6,000 people and seeks to find the rate of infection in
children and their
families.

Mr. Trump on Monday hurled insults at Democratic leaders who were
huddling with his top advisers in search of a compromise economic
recovery package, threatening to act on his own to ban evictions as he
again undercut negotiations to reach a broader deal.

Mr. Trump floated the possibility of using an executive order to address
an expired federal moratorium on evictions, even though a $1 trillion
Republican aid proposal did not include such a pause. He said he
remained “totally involved” in stimulus talks, even though he wasn’t
“over there with Crazy Nancy,” a reference to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of
California.

But the president has been notably absent from the negotiations on a
sweeping economic stabilization package, even as tens of millions of
Americans have been cut off from enhanced jobless benefits they have
depended on for months during the coronavirus pandemic.

At the same moment that Mr. Trump was blasting her, Ms. Pelosi met on
Capitol Hill with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority
leader, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and Steven
Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, in search of a compromise. It was the
fifth such meeting in eight days, following a staff policy call on
Sunday and a rare Saturday session with the four negotiators.

At the White House, Mr. Trump accused Democrats of being single-mindedly
focused on getting “bailout money” for states controlled by Democrats,
and unconcerned with extending unemployment benefits.

“All they’re really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical
left governors and radical left mayors like in Portland and places that
are so badly run — Chicago, New York City,” Mr. Trump said.

Democrats have proposed providing more than $900 billion to
cash-strapped states and cities whose budgets have been devastated in
the recession, but it is Republicans who have proposed slashing the
jobless aid. Democrats have refused to do so, feeding the stalemate.

While White House officials and Democratic leaders reported some
progress over the weekend in their talks, they [still have substantial
differences](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-jobless-aid.html).
Democrats are pushing a $3 trillion rescue plan that would include
restoring $600-per-week jobless aid payments that expired on Friday and
extending them through January, while Republicans have proposed a $1
trillion package that would slash the unemployment payments
considerably.

More than 47,800 new cases and more than 600 new deaths were reported in
the United States on
Monday.

## The deadline for 2020 census counting has been moved up by a month.

The census is constitutionally required to count all residents of the
United States every 10 years, but the 2020 effort has
[faltered](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-census.html)
amid the pandemic. In recent weeks, the Trump administration and Senate
Republicans [appeared to signal that they wanted the census finished
well ahead of
schedule](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/trump-census.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Census data is enormously important. It is used to reapportion all 435
House seats and thousands of state and local districts, as well as divvy
up trillions of dollars in federal aid.

“Under this plan, the Census Bureau intends to meet a similar level of
household responses as collected in prior censuses, including outreach
to hard-to-count communities,” the Census Bureau said in its
[statement](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/delivering-complete-accurate-count.html).

Critics said the move was pushed by the White House and motivated by
partisanship.

“We’re dealing with a census that’s been really challenged by Covid-19,”
said Vanita Gupta, a former head of the Justice Department’s civil
rights division who is now the [president of the Leadership Conference
on Civil and Human
Rights](https://civilrights.org/about/our-staff/vanita-gupta/). “And in
the middle of this pandemic, the administration has tried to sabotage
the census for partisan gain, to move its anti-immigrant agenda and to
silence communities of color.”

She added that rural communities could be badly hurt by an undercount.

On Monday night, the White House referred questions to the Commerce
Department, which oversees the Census Bureau. It did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.

In 2010, census takers worked from May to August to count hard-to-find
households. This spring, the bureau said it was pushing back the start
to August, ending on Oct. 31.

The population totals, required to reapportion the House of
Representatives, are traditionally delivered to the president on Dec.
31, but this year the bureau had asked Congress for a [four-month
extension of the statutory
deadline](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/census-coronavirus-delay.html?searchResultPosition=9).
The White House backed the extension at the time. The House approved the
delay; the Senate has not.

Congress could still act to extend census statutory deadlines as part of
the next [coronavirus relief
package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-jobless-aid.html).

## As some students and teachers go back to school in the U.S., they’re bringing the virus with them.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new academic year is underway in some parts of the United States,
with the first few days of school showing just how fraught reopening
classrooms can be. Already in some states, schools that decided to open
for in-person classes are quarantining staff members and students, and
even closing temporarily as positive cases are found.

Traditionally, [about 14 percent of the nation’s
children](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/14/back-to-school-dates-u-s/)
go back to school by the second week of August, mostly in the South and
Midwest, although this year, some districts in those areas have
postponed classes by a week or two, or plan to start the year online.

Many schools in Indiana started on Thursday. On Saturday, the
superintendent of the Elwood Community School Corporation in the central
part of the state sent a note thanking students and parents for [“a
great first two days of
school\!”](https://www.facebook.com/ElwoodCommunitySchools/photos/pcb.1875944365880857/1875944205880873/?type=3&theater)

But the optimistic tone quickly gave way: Staff members had tested
positive, and the high school was forced to close its doors and move all
students in seventh through 12th grades to online learning for at least
a week.

And similar developments occurred across the country. Just hours into
the first day of classes at [Greenfield Central Junior High
School](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/us/schools-reopening-indiana-coronavirus.html),
also in Indiana, the county health department notified the school that a
student had tested positive. The student was isolated, and others who
had been in proximity were forced to quarantine for two weeks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At a high school in Corinth, Miss., [someone also tested
positive](https://www.facebook.com/corinthschooldistrict/?tn-str=k*F)
during the first week back, and exposed students there were asked to
stay home for 14 days. And in the Atlanta area, [more than 200 employees
of a single school
district](https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/covid-cases-exposure-have-260-gwinnett-school-employees-not-working/RVZP4UFBPFHDNJJ73MNUFIKEPY/)
in Gwinnett County tested positive or were in quarantine last week
before classes even resumed.

Gwinnett County Public Schools is the largest school system in Georgia,
with more than 180,000 students. Teachers returned to work last
Wednesday, in preparation for starting classes remotely on Aug. 12. But
as of Thursday, about 260 employees had been excluded from work because
they tested positive or had potentially been exposed to the virus.

Other key developments in education:

  - Gov. Larry Hogan of **Maryland** on Monday [issued an emergency
    order](https://twitter.com/GovLarryHogan/status/1290330304830246912)
    counteracting Montgomery County’s health department, which on Friday
    said that all private schools needed to [start the year
    remotely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/montgomery-county-health-officials-tell-private-schools-to-start-school-online/2020/08/01/64552b9e-d3fd-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html)
    in the fall, just as public schools in the region plan to.

  - **In New Jersey**, face coverings will be required for all students
    inside a school building, unless doing so would adversely affect a
    student’s health, the governor said.

  - **The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill** is planning to
    fully reopen next week, but 30 tenured faculty members wrote an open
    letter to students published Friday in The Charlotte Observer
    pushing for virtual learning and encouraging students to stay
home.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hurricane Isaias made landfall in the Carolinas on Monday night, at a
time when many people in the Southeast are already beleaguered by the
coronavirus outbreak.

Disruptions in testing, in transporting samples and supplies, in and
staffing labs could complicate efforts to gauge virus transmission in
states that have struggled to contain it.

In Florida, for example, 43 state-run [testing
sites](https://floridadisaster.org/covid19/testing-sites/) were forced
to close on Friday as Isaias, then a tropical storm, headed for the
state’s east coast. The number of lab results [received daily by
Florida’s Health
Department](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf),
which had generally been in the 90,000 range in the past two weeks, fell
on Sunday to about 61,000.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Isaias made landfall in southern North Carolina late Monday night after
strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to travel up
the East Coast. Testing sites have been closed [as far north as
Maryland](https://patch.com/maryland/baltimore/tropical-storm-isaias-closes-14-md-coronavirus-testing-sites)
in anticipation.

Officials have told residents in the storm’s projected path to prepare
themselves, and businesses are concerned about how much damage it will
bring.

“It’s a wait-and-see game,” said Jay Slevin, the manager of a pizzeria
about a mile from the shore in Myrtle Beach, S.C., southwest of where
Isaias made landfall.

Officials are also changing how they run shelters and advising residents
to regard them as a last resort, [out of fear that the virus could
spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/virus-texas-storm.html) in
crowded indoor spaces.

At a
[briefing](https://www.ncdps.gov/storm-update?fbclid=IwAR3gtINKPXqQdsJixuf1kwBKbAtEMz62wzyoDHlu7FDBN1HTarDlw8FlVwQ)
on Monday afternoon, Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina advised residents
in vulnerable areas to stay with friends or family or to go to a hotel.
But he added that shelters would open for those who need them, with
health screenings, social distancing and cleaning protocols.

“I know that North Carolinians have had to dig deep in recent months to
tap into our strength and resilience during the pandemic, and that
hasn’t been easy,” he said. “But with this storm on the way, we have
to dig a little deeper.”

## Italian sex workers face poverty and illness during the pandemic.

In Italy, prostitution is not illegal, nor is it regulated as an
official occupation, making the country’s 70,000 sex workers largely
ineligible to receive economic relief. Many have been forced to take
their chances by returning to work in order to avoid poverty.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In May, organizations that promote the rights of Italian sex workers
sought to draw the government’s attention and get support, arguing that
the pandemic showed the harm of forcing sex work underground.

In March, Regina Satariano, a 60-year-old sex worker in Tuscany, started
hearing about colleagues who hadn’t eaten and a landlord who had
threatened to evict a group of 17 housemates, all sex workers who were
out of work because of the pandemic.

Ms. Satariano put together her savings and bought bags of pasta, tomato
sauce, chicken and soap to distribute to her colleagues. But without
support from the state, she said, many sex workers will continue to go
hungry. If officials don’t change things now, she added, “they never
will.”

In other European countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, sex
workers can enter formal contracts with their clients. During the
lockdown, those who were officially registered with the government were
eligible for economic relief.

Scotland also included sex workers in its relief programs. In Greece,
where prostitution is legal and regulated, brothels were allowed to
reopen on June 15, provided that sex workers kept their clients’ names
and contact details for four weeks for tracing purposes.

In Italy, [various charities and associations have raised
money](https://www.produzionidalbasso.com/project/covid19-nessuna-da-sola-solidarieta-immediata-alle-lavoratrici-sessuali-piu-colpite-dall-emergenza/)
for groceries, medicines, bills and rent to benefit the country’s sex
workers. But for the most part, Italian sex workers, who are often from
immigrant communities, have had to fend for themselves.

A recent report by the Sex Workers’ Rights Advocacy Network and the
International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe showed
that many sex workers defied lockdown rules in order to work, putting
both themselves and their clients at
risk.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A newly married couple from New Zealand who were stranded for months in
the remote Falkland Islands have managed to return home — by catching a
ride for more than 5,000 nautical miles on an Antarctic fishing boat.

The couple, Feeonaa and Neville Clifton, were honeymooning in the south
Atlantic archipelago, about 300 miles off the coast of Argentina, as
South America’s coronavirus epidemic began to escalate in March. After
their flights home via Brazil were canceled, they remained in lockdown
with an aunt in the Falklands, where Mr. Clifton was born.

The couple have been together more than 25 years and raised three
children, but decided only recently to marry and take a honeymoon. Ms.
Clifton said they spent their time in lockdown rekindling old hobbies,
like playing card games.

“I think maybe I fell in love with him just a little bit more,” she
added of her husband.

That was the easy part.

Ms. Clifton, 48, said that when they began planning their escape from
the Falklands, one of their only options was a military transport
through Africa and Britain.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“At the time we were being told Latam might fly next month, and then
again the next month after that,” she said, referring to Latam Airlines,
a major carrier in the region. “Unfortunately the deadline kept getting
further and further pushed back.”

They explored other travel options, but each seemed complex and likely
to put them at increased risk of contracting the virus.

Eventually, they settled on the San Aotea II, a fishing boat that was
heading their way. The only catch was that the journey would take 29
days and traverse the notoriously treacherous Southern Ocean.

But Ms. Clifton, who had never spent a night on a boat, said the trip
was surprisingly calm, and that the crew helped pass the time by playing
cards with them.

The couple arrived in New Zealand on Tuesday morning after testing
negative for the virus. Ms. Clifton said in a telephone interview a few
hours later that they still felt “extremely wobbly” — to the point where
a shopkeeper they came upon during the drive home thought they were
dancing.

“We were just trying to stand up straight,” she
said.

New York’s economy has been cratered by the outbreak. The city is slowly

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in

        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is

        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,

The St. Louis Cardinals’ outbreak has swelled to at least 13 players and
staff members, in yet another blow to the rocky start of the Major
League Baseball season. The Cardinals’ outbreak comes after the Miami
Marlins reported an outbreak last week: 18 players and two coaches.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Cardinals have been quarantined since Thursday at their hotel in
Milwaukee, where their three-game series with the Brewers was postponed
last weekend after St. Louis’s first cases were confirmed.

“I think everyone is trying to look for someone or something to blame,
and there isn’t one person or one thing to blame,” said Derek Jeter, the
Marlins’ chief executive. “This is a health crisis that we’re all
dealing with — a health crisis that not only our country is dealing
with, but our world is dealing with.”

Baseball wants to insulate itself from that world, but its 30 teams are
traveling throughout the United States to stage a 60-game season. The
league determined that a so-called bubble approach was impractical, and
the areas it considered months ago to carry out a season in a contained
environment — Arizona, Texas and Florida — have since become hot spots
for the virus. Yet road trips have increased the risk of infection.

Mr. Jeter said the Marlins had been unfairly maligned for playing in
Philadelphia on July 26 after they learned of four positive tests; in
fact, he said, the Phillies and M.L.B. were also aware of those test
results. He also disputed that the Marlins had acted recklessly in
Atlanta, where they played two exhibitions.

Mostly, Mr. Jeter said, the Marlins were careless, failing to adhere
strictly to mask wearing and social distancing. While there was “no
salacious activity” in Atlanta, he said, some players did leave the
hotel for coffee or shopping.

## White House staff will be randomly tested for the virus.

White House officials have been told they will be randomly screened for
the coronavirus starting on Monday, according to a person who received
the email.

The new policy is a change for the White House, where the testing
requirement had previously been only for people in proximity to Mr.
Trump.

It was unclear what exactly prompted the change. An employee in the
White House complex [cafeterias recently tested
positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/white-house-employee-covid-19.html)
for the virus, prompting the closing of the dining halls. And last week,
Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, [Robert C. O’Brien, tested
positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/politics/robert-obrien-virus.html)
after experiencing minor symptoms. Mr. O’Brien is the most senior White
House official known to have contracted the virus. He typically works
from an office steps away from the Oval Office.

[Public health
experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/health/dr-birx-coronavirus-phase.html)
have been concerned about the high levels of asymptomatic transmission
across the country. Even employees who do not work in proximity to the
president could be seeding chains of infection.

The email made clear that anyone who does not comply with assignments
for testing would be seen as refusing to be tested, according to the

Over the past few months, millions of people have relied on video or

last?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The answer largely depends on [whether Medicare and private health
insurers will adequately cover virtual doctor
visits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/covid-telemedicine-congress.html)
once coronavirus outbreaks subside.

Medicare’s coverage of a broad range of services is slated to end when
the coronavirus no longer poses a public health emergency. Private
insurers, which followed the federal government’s lead, could revert to
paying doctors for virtual visits at a fraction of the cost for
traditional visits, if anything at all.

“The concern everyone in the industry has is that reimbursement is in
jeopardy,” said Dr. Mia Levy, the director of the cancer center at Rush
University Medical Center in Chicago, which treated patients virtually
during the height of the pandemic.

On Monday, President Trump described telehealth as a “very, very big
priority” after he signed an executive order aimed at making permanent
some of the changes in Medicare policy that his administration adopted
during the pandemic. The order focuses in part on finding ways to ensure
access to medical care for people in rural areas.

While there is broad bipartisan support for telehealth coverage,
Congress would have to pass specific legislation to make some of
Medicare’s changes permanent. Some lawmakers favor permanently expanding
Medicare payment for a broad range of telemedicine services, but others
are concerned about the technology’s cost and potential for fraud.

Many patients enjoy the convenience of telemedicine. And it is
particularly valuable for those vulnerable to the virus, like Susan
Varak, 45, who has breast cancer. “I don’t think it’s absolutely
necessary to be face-to-face every couple of weeks,” she said.

But for some patients, telemedicine is not a substitute for in-person
care. Jorge Cueto, who is in his mid-20s, said a virtual visit is often
an additional step before going to the doctor’s office for, say, a sore
throat.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s another fee, it’s another gating mechanism,” he said.

Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical
School, argues that the goal of telemedicine should not be to lower
health care costs over all. One of its main benefits, he said, is
improving patients’ access to care, adding that it would be foolish to
expect savings if more people also get treatment. “Those don’t
reconcile,” he said.

New Jersey will again restrict indoor gatherings as cases have risen in
the state, Gov. Philip D. Murphy said Monday. Gatherings will be limited
to 25 percent of a room’s usual occupancy limit, with a maximum of 25
people, down from 100 people.

The new guidance will not apply to weddings, funerals, or memorial
services, he said, nor will it affect religious or political activities
protected under the First Amendment. Those events will still be capped
at 100 people, or 25 percent maximum occupancy.

The governor reiterated that officials believed that indoor house
parties and other gatherings were contributing to the resurgence of the
virus in New Jersey, which made significant progress battling its
outbreak in April and May.

The rate of virus transmission, a rough measure of the spread of
infection, in the state rose significantly in July, Mr. Murphy said. As
of Saturday, the first day of August, [the rate was
at 1.48](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1290335172446097409/photo/2),
according to the state, meaning that each person with the virus infected
an average of 1.48 people. Just one month ago, Mr. Murphy said, the rate
was at 0.87. The rate is a rough estimate, because many infections are
undetected for a variety of reasons, including asymptomatic infections
and testing issues.

Students in Mexico will exclusively take classes broadcast on television
or the radio when the school year begins later this month, in an effort
to avoid further coronavirus outbreaks, the government announced on
Monday. Schools will only reopen when authorities determine that new and
active infections, which remain high across the nation, decline enough
for a safe return to the classroom.

“We would like to return to face-to-face classes, but it is neither
possible nor prudent,” said the education minister, Esteban Moctezuma
Barragán, in a news conference. Mr. Moctezuma said he wanted to avoid
the fates of “Israel, South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, to name a
few examples, who reopened their schools and had to close them again.”

The announcement is one of the first signs of caution in the nation’s
approach to reopening the economy in the face of the pandemic.
Restaurants, hotels and factories have all been allowed to restart
operations, even though the country has not managed to get the virus
under control. Over the weekend, Mexico surpassed the United Kingdom to
become the country with the third highest coronavirus deaths worldwide.

Four television companies will air classes to 30 million students on
broadcast channels, in Spanish, sign language and 20 Indigenous
languages, the education minister said. The government will distribute
free textbooks to students who can’t afford them.

$150,000.

For nearly 70 years, the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief
program has helped companies recover from catastrophe. But it has never
faced anything like this.

Besieged by more than eight million applicants — and operating in the
shadow of the hastily assembled [Paycheck Protection
Program](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/business/ppp-small-business-loans.html)
— the disaster relief effort has given out more money in the past few
months than it had in its entire history.

But the demand has created a problem that is hobbling hundreds of
thousands of applicants: The agency, afraid of running out of cash,
capped its coronavirus loans at a fraction of what companies can
normally borrow — even though the program has handed out less than half
the $360 billion it can lend.

The cap has left many borrowers with loans that they fear will not be
enough to keep their businesses afloat. Nearly 400,000 businesses have
run into the $150,000 limit, according to [the agency’s
data](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/economic-injury-disaster-loans#section-header-5).
S.B.A. representatives declined to comment on the cap or why it was
imposed.

“Without the extra capital, it will be very difficult for us to
survive,” Caroline Keefer, a clothing designer in Los Angeles, wrote
in an appeal to the agency after her loan was capped.

The cap has been just one problem with the program, officially called
the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. Applicants faced [long
delays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/smallbusiness/small-business-disaster-loans-coronavirus.html),
confusing procedures and communication lapses. And on Tuesday, the
agency’s internal watchdog said that hundreds of millions of dollars
handed out through the program [may have been fraudulently
obtained](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/28/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#thieves-are-targeting-small-business-relief-programs-a-watchdog-says).

In New York City, an expanding universe of distinctive small businesses
— from coffee shops to dry cleaners to hardware stores — that give its
neighborhoods their unique personalities and are key to the city’s
economy [are starting to
topple](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-small-businesses-closing-coronavirus.html).
When the pandemic eventually subsides, roughly one-third of the city’s
240,000 small businesses may never reopen, [according to a
report](https://pfnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/actionandcollaboration.pdf)
by the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group. So
far, those businesses have shed 520,000 jobs.

On Monday, more than 100 current and former chief executives called for
more aid to small businesses across the country in a letter sent to
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

“Allowing small businesses to fail will turn temporary job losses into
permanent ones,” states [the
letter](https://www.howardschultz.com/lettertocongress/), which was
organized by the former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz with the support
of Senators Michael Bennet, a Democrat, and Todd Young, a Republican. It
was signed by the likes of Walmart’s Doug McMillon, Alphabet’s Sundar
Pichai and Disney’s Bob Chapek.
