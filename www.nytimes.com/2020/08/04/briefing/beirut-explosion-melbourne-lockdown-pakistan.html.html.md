## Dozens killed in massive Beirut explosions

Two huge [blasts rocked the center of the Lebanese
capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-blast.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
on Tuesday, damaging buildings in several neighborhoods and sending a
giant pink cloud skyward near the city’s port. At least 30 people were
killed and 2,500 were injured, Lebanon’s health minister said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With the wounded still streaming into hospitals and the search for
missing people underway, the figures were likely to go higher. The
governor of Beirut, Marwan Abboud, could not say what had caused the
explosions. Breaking into tears, he called it a national catastrophe.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab declared a national day of mourning for
Wednesday.

**What caused it:** “Highly explosive materials,” seized by the
government years ago, were stored near where the explosions occurred,
said Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, the head of Lebanon’s general security
service. He warned against speculating about a terrorist
act.

## Melbourne fights a second wave

Australia’s second-largest city has now imposed some of the toughest
restrictions in the world to beat back a new wave of coronavirus
infections. Officials are promising a “[shock and awe” attack on the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/australia/coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown.html)
that will last at least six weeks.

A door-to-door campaign to check in on 3,000 people who had Covid-19
found that 800 of them were not at home. The police are facing
opposition. On at least four occasions in the last week, they smashed
the windows of cars and pulled people out after they refused to provide
their names and addresses.

**The second wave**: Australia was seen as a shining example for beating
the virus, and it was thought that Melbourne had done so as of late
June. But the city’s hotel quarantine program broke down, with travelers
passing the virus to security guards, who carried the contagion into
their neighborhoods.

**Details:** The latest lockdown will close stores, return schools to
at-home instruction, order restaurants to be takeaway or delivery-only,
and child care centers will be available only with special permission.
An 8 p.m. curfew is in place. The outbreak in Victoria state peaked at
753 new cases on July 30 and has hovered at around 500 a day ever since.

In other developments:

  - Recent studies of [patients with severe cases of
    Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html)
    found that their immune systems launch a misguided barrage of
    weapons that can wreak havoc on healthy tissues.

  - The World Health Organization urged Russia to follow guidelines for

    after Moscow announced a vaccination program set for October that
    has raised concerns that inoculations would begin before its product
    was fully tested.

  - Two preliminary studies of an experimental vaccine in the U.S. have
    [yielded encouraging
    results,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/coronavirus-cases.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage#link-1228a480)

## Converting to Islam to survive

Hindus living in Pakistan often face discrimination in housing, jobs and
access to government programs. Now, Hindu community leaders say there’s
[been an uptick in conversions to
Islam](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/asia/pakistan-hindu-conversion.html),
brought on by economic hardship.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dozens of Hindu families converted in June in the Badin district of
Sindh Province in southern Pakistan. Video clips of the ceremony went
viral across the country, delighting hard-line Muslims and weighing on
Pakistan’s dwindling Hindu minority.

**Quotable:** “What we are seeking is social status, nothing else,” said
Muhammad Aslam Sheikh, whose name was Sawan Bheel before he converted to
Islam with his family. “These conversions,” he added, “are becoming very
common in poor Hindu communities.”

**A few figures:** At independence in 1947, Hindus composed 20.5 percent
of the population of the areas that now form Pakistan. In the following
decades, the percentage shrank rapidly, and by 1998, Hindus were just
1.6 percent of Pakistan’s population. Most estimates say it has further
dwindled in the past two
decades.

Among the horror stories: Chloe Gilliland, 29, a former member of the
Australian national team, said she considered suicide as a teenager
after her coaches said she was “a bad child” because she was too heavy.
Catherine Lyons, 19, once a top junior competitor for Britain, said
coaches would hit her and harass her about her weight, and, when she was
7 or 8, she would cry so hard that coaches would shut her inside a
cupboard until she composed herself. Above, Lisa Mason, a 2000 British
Olympian, has encouraged fellow gymnasts to speak out.

The stories from gymnasts are part of a broader push, empowered by the
\#MeToo movement and by a parallel outcry in the U.S. gymnastics world.
National federations in Britain, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium
say they are trying to curb abuses.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

**What we’re reading:** This [essay in Harper’s
Magazine](https://harpers.org/archive/2020/08/all-my-pronouns-the-singular-they/)
on the use of they/them as gender neutral pronouns. “This beautifully
written essay, with its deep insight into the history of pronouns and
their usage and its gentle humor helped me to accept and understand the
beauty of “they” in its singular form,” Melissa Eddy, our Berlin
correspondent,
writes.

### And now for the Back Story on …

## What’s behind that coronavirus bill

*Americans have been battling surprise coronavirus bills for nearly as
long as they’ve been fighting the disease itself, according to Sarah
Kliff, our investigative reporter on health issues.*

*So, she started a project that uses those bills, sent by readers, to
examine the cost of testing and treatment. We’ll be sharing these
stories as we explore how the virus outbreak is changing health care in
the U.S. Here’s* [*what she wrote about the
project*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/reader-center/coronavirus-medical-bills.html)*.*

I’m a reporter who has been writing articles about those bills since
mid-February. My first story focused on an American man and his
3-year-old daughter who faced more than $3,900 in bills for care
received during a government-mandated
quarantine.

“I assumed it was all being paid for,” [Frank Wucinski, the
patient](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/upshot/coronavirus-surprise-medical-bills.html),
said at the time. “We didn’t have a choice. When the bills showed up, it
was just a pit in my stomach, like, ‘How do I pay for this?’”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since then, my colleagues and I have written about $2,315 coronavirus
tests and $401,886 bills for treatment. We’ve discovered that the price
of a coronavirus test can vary by 2,700 percent within the same
emergency room.

I’ve run similar projects that have inspired legislation and demystified
American medical billing. Because health care providers keep their
prices secret, bills play a critical role in helping us understand how
Americans are grappling with medical costs during the health crisis.
