More than 800 craft distillers across the United States leapt into
action to help in the first wave of the pandemic by producing hand
sanitizer, urged on by federal agencies. But with demand for sanitizer
fluctuating, distillers have faced unforeseen costs and excess supplies
that they could not get rid of.

Their conundrum shows how life has become more complicated as the
pandemic has persisted. What had been a no-brainer good Samaritan
decision to help local communities and nurture a new business has
instead devolved into a messy financial calculus as the hardships of the
crisis continue piling up.

``It feels a little bit like no good deed is going unpunished right
now,'' said Spencer Whelan, the director of the Texas Whiskey
Association, a trade group representing some of the state's distillers.

The prospect of replacing liquor revenue with sanitizer sales piqued the
interest of Jonathan Eagan, the co-owner of the
\textbf{\href{https://azdistilling.com/}{Arizona Distilling Company}} in
Tempe., Ariz. He spent \$50,000 on alcohol to produce the disinfectant
in the spring, and said he quickly sold enough of it to make up for two
months in lost liquor sales.

That money was crucial, given that bars, restaurants and tours --- the
distillers' main sources of income --- were hobbled. But even as
distillers ramped up sanitizer production, that lifeline also started
petering out. As panic-buying of the disinfectant leveled off and
production among larger companies stabilized, ``the business just kind
of dried up'' in the last few weeks, said Mr. Eagan.

Now as Arizona deals with
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/09/us/coronavirus-cases-reopening-trends.html}{new
virus cases}, much of his remaining 1,000 gallons of sanitizer has sat
idle.
