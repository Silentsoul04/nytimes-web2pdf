The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday proposed changes that
\textbf{Boeing} must make to the 737 Max, potentially clearing the way
for
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/business/boeing-737-max-return.html}{the
plane to start flying again} by the end of the year.

The changes include updating the plane's flight control software,
revising crew procedures and rerouting internal wiring. Once formally
published, the proposal will be open to public comment for 45 days,
after which the agency will issue a final ruling.

The agency concluded in a related report published on Monday that its
proposal was in line with Boeing's recommendations. The report said the
company's recommendations had sufficiently addressed the problems that
contributed to two fatal crashes, resulting in the worldwide grounding
of the jet.

``The F.A.A. has preliminarily determined that Boeing's proposed changes
to the 737 Max design, flight crew procedures and maintenance procedures
effectively mitigate the airplane-related safety issues that
contributed'' to crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346
people, the agency said.

The Max has been grounded since March 2019,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/boeing-737-max-costs.html}{costing
Boeing billions} of dollars.

Once the F.A.A.'s proposal is official, Boeing can begin to make the
changes and ready the planes for flight, a process that could take more
than a week per jet and involves system checks, deep cleaning and
software updates. The company will have to do that for hundreds of
planes that customers have already received and hundreds more that
Boeing has made but not delivered.

Several other obstacles remain before the F.A.A. lifts its grounding
order on the plane, including the development of pilot training
requirements and the review and filing of additional documentation.
