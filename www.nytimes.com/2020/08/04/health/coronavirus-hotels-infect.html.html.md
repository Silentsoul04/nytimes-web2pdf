Hilton has partnered with Lysol, Four Seasons with Johns Hopkins

When Beau Phillips checked into a hotel near Toledo recently, a table in
front of the counter barricaded him from getting too close to the clerk,
who wore a mask and stood behind a plastic window.

“The key is gently tossed at you from three feet away,” said Mr.
Phillips, a public affairs executive who was staying at a Radisson
Country Inn & Suites while visiting family.

The hotel’s breakfast buffet was gone, the fitness center closed,
elevators limited to two riders. And to reduce the risk of an in-person
visit, after Mr. Phillips left his room each day, no housekeeper came in
to make the bed.

The pandemic has plunged the hotel industry into a historic downturn.
Average hotel occupancy dipped as low as 22 percent in late March, and
had risen to a still miserable[48.1 percent the week ending
July 25,](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-results-week-ending-25-july)[](https://str.com/press-release/str-canada-hotel-results-week-ending-4-july)according
to STR, a market research firm. So hotels nationwide have embarked on a
transformation of the most basic ways they run their business**,** aimed
at showing would-be travelers they understand where they’re at:
terrified.

Some [new research suggests travelers might have a

scheduled for publication in September in the journal Emerging
Infectious Diseases — but already made public by the Centers for Disease

the coronavirus shed it on pillow cases, duvet covers, sheets, light
switch and bathroom door and faucet handles.

Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, in its new “[Count on
Us](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/about-us/count-on-us)” pandemic
marketing campaign, heralds the use of “hospital grade” cleaning
products. It is putting on overt shows of sanitation: Housekeepers now
linger and clean around the lobby, conspicuously wiping down public
areas, luggage carts, door knobs, and the
counter.

“In the past, we may have cleaned hotels in the overnight because you
didn’t necessarily want to see people cleaning,” said Lisa Checchio, the
chief marketing officer of Wyndham, the franchise parent of Wyndham,
Days Inn, Super 8, La Quinta and more than a dozen other major brands
among its 6,000 domestic hotels.

Hilton new program (marketing name:
“[CleanStay](https://www.hilton.com/en/corporate/cleanstay/)”)
includes a partnership to use Lysol cleaning products that requires
individual hotels to use the company’s products and display the Lysol
logo “prominently.” Room cleanings include extra time spent on
“high-touch areas” that included light and climate control switches,
handles and knobs, telephones and clocks. And, or course, the remote
control “which has one of the highest ick factors or perceived ick
factors,” said Phil Cordell, Hilton’s global head of new brand
development.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He recalled that one guest had wrapped the plastic lining from the ice
bucket around the remote control before using it.

“People are understandably freaked out or hyper aware,” Mr. Cordell
said.

The new research looked at the virus residue left by two
“pre-symptomatic” patients there who were quarantined in China in
March — students who had returned from overseas and were placed in
hotels during a mandatory waiting period.

Their rooms were swabbed for evidence that the virus lingered after the
students had been there 24 hours, but before the rooms were cleaned. The
researchers said the study shows that hotel rooms must be rigorously
cleaned between guest stays and done so with an eye to how the virus
spreads.

“To minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, we
recommend that used linens not be shaken upon removal,” the study said,
“and that laundered items be thoroughly cleaned and dried to prevent
additional
spread.

To show they are, indeed, rigorous in their cleaning, several chains are
heralding the consulting they are getting from big-name medical
institutions. Four Seasons said it signed a consulting agreement with
Johns Hopkins Medical International as part of an effort “to inform
health and safety decisions based on the latest scientific knowledge,”
while Hilton retained counsel from the Mayo Clinic to develop “enhanced
cleaning standards.”

All the attention to sanitation has created other issues. Since the
masks employees are required to wear shroud smiles, Hilton, which has
hotels throughout the world, has been experimenting with hand gestures
to express warmth and welcome. “One is a very simple wave. In some
cultures, it could be a bow,” Mr. Cordell said. “It could be hats off
but with no hat — but that could look kind of weird — or a hand over
heart.”

Choice Hotels, a conglomerate that owns brands including Quality Inn and
EconoLodge, found in surveys that travelers wanted prepackaged
breakfasts, not buffets, and that any fruit should be the kind that
peels — bananas or oranges instead of, say, apples or strawberries. It
also found that would-be guests wanted outdoor space and so it [revamped
websites](https://www.choicehotels.com/california/el-segundo/cambria-hotels/cad84)
of its upscale Cambria brands to highlight photographs of pools and
rooftop decks.

(Some hotels are requiring reservations for the pool to keep density
low.)

Given the industry’s dire economic crisis, some of the changes it’s
adopting cost little, or even save money, said Bjorn Hanson, former dean
of hospitality at New York University who has also spent years working
inside the industry. For instance, he said, hotels can save money on
housekeeping by not cleaning rooms every night, or by promising not to
put guests in adjoining rooms, as some hotels have done (in reality,
there’s not enough occupancy to have high density
anyway).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“Safety doesn’t necessarily cost money,” he said. “It could be an excuse
for saving money,”

Some would-be travelers say they’re just not ready to return, no matter
the assurances.

“I’ve stayed at nice hotels in the past and found something sticky. If I
found something sticky and smudgy now, it would send me to the moon,”
said Kevin Mercuri, chief executive of a New York public relations firm.
He and colleagues recently decided against visiting a client in Georgia
partly to avoid hotels. His concern about hotels, in a nutshell: “Fear
of infection.”

The C.D.C. has recommended that people who stay at hotels check in
online, choose properties where staff wear masks and that regularly
clean or remove shared-touch items, like pens or phones, and disinfect
doorknobs, ice and vending machines, among other things.

Charles Gerba, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies
hotel cleanliness, said hotels do not pose significant risk of
transmission of Covid-19 so long as they clean with products known to
kill the virus.

His own prior research has shown that housekeepers can carry viruses
with them from room-to-room and guests can carry them from public areas,
like conference rooms. Proper use of cleaning products, the research
showed, sharply cut risk of
transmission.

“If a product is EPA approved and you’re not using it right, it isn’t
doing me any good,” he said, meaning that cleaning must be thorough and
not taken lightly. He said he’d feel comfortable staying at a hotel, but
would decline daily maid service, and bring his own hand sanitizer and
wipes.

Other public health researchers said that the risk of a hotel stay
depended heavily on an the customer’s own commitment to wearing a mask
or remaining socially distant.

“You need to an make informed decision to maintain your space,” said
Eyal Oren, an associate professor in the Division of Epidemiology and
Bioinformatics at the San Diego State University School of Public
Health. He said hotels do offer the prospect of such distancing, “which
I’d distinguish from an airplane.”

For people who choose to travel, one perk comes at the expense of the
hotels: the price. STR, the market research firm,[projects the average
cost of a
nightly](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-demand-not-expected-fully-recover-until-2023)stay
in 2020 will wind up at $103, down from $131 a year ago. (In July, the
average rate was $97).

There are other savings too. Mr. Phillips always leaves a tip for the
cleaning crew and did so again during his recent stay at the Country Inn
& Suites outside of Toledo.

“The first day, I left a $20 for the housekeeper like I always do,” he
said. “It was still there when I got back. No one had come in.”
