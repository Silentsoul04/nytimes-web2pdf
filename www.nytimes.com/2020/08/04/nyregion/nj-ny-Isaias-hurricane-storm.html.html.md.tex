Tropical Storm Isaias swept into New Jersey and New York on Tuesday,
leaving more than a million customers without power as it brought nearly
hurricane-force winds and tornadoes to the northeastern United States.

Just after 2 p.m.,
\href{https://poweroutage.us/area/state/new\%20jersey}{more than a
million customers} in New Jersey were reported by utility companies to
be without power, and, in New York City and the nearby downstate area,
that number was
\href{https://poweroutage.us/area/state/new\%20york}{over 230,000}. It
was not immediately clear how long the outages were expected to last.

``This storm is escalating quickly, and the numbers are rapidly
changing,'' Gov. Philip D. Murphy
\href{https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1290684560326512650}{said}around
noon on Twitter in reference to the outages.

The storm, which made landfall in North Carolina as a hurricane,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/isaias-storm-updates.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage\#link-34e5d4e4}{has
been swiftly moving up the East Coast}. In the Carolinas, Virginia and
other coastal states, there were reports of damaged buildings, power
outages and downed trees.

At least two people were killed after a tornado touched down in Bertie
County, N.C., and caused significant damage to a neighborhood there.

The National Weather Service said on Tuesday afternoon that ``strong and
damaging winds are spreading northward into the New York City
metropolitan area that could knock down trees and power lines.''

The Weather Service said that tornadoes were forming in northern New
Jersey, but did not immediately specify where.

Patrick O'Hara, a meteorologist with the Weather Service, said it was
tracking reports of at least two tornadoes on Tuesday: one in
Strathmere, in southern New Jersey, where heavy damage was not
immediately reported; and another near Dover, Del.

and
\href{https://twitter.com/DKDRinc/status/1290688365830995969}{videos}
posted on social media showed trees snapped and pieces of buildings
blown on top of vehicles in Dover.

Mr. O'Hara said his office, which covers most of New Jersey, has
received multiple reports of street flooding and trees blocking roads.
Heavy rains had caused flash flooding along creeks and roads in
southeastern Pennsylvania, Mr. O'Hara said.

Strong winds, with gusts of more than 73 miles per hour, were possible
into the evening along the New Jersey and Delaware coasts, according to
the Weather Service. The rain was expected to taper off in the late
afternoon.

Before the storm hit, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement on
Tuesday that some inland areas in New York State could see up to six
inches of rain.

He said the state had deployed rescue teams, with boats and high-water
vehicles, to areas that could be hardest-hit by the storm. The state had
also sent out water pumps, chain saws, sandbags and bottled water.

Officials in New York City urged residents to be vigilant for heavy wind
and rain and to expect power loss. And on Tuesday afternoon, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority said some aboveground subway
service, the Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road were all
temporarily suspended. Beaches were closed on Tuesday.

Juliana Kim contributed reporting.
