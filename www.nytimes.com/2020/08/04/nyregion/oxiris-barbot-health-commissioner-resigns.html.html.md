# N.Y.C. Health Commissioner Resigns After Clashes With Mayor Over Virus

The resignation of Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the commissioner since 2018, came
after Mayor Bill de Blasio stripped her agency of a key virus-tracing

New York City’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, resigned on
Tuesday and voiced her “deep disappointment” with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s
handling of the pandemic, renewing scrutiny of his leadership during the
crisis just as the city faces pressing decisions about how quickly to
reopen schools and businesses.

Dr. Barbot’s departure came after [escalating
tensions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/nyregion/coronavirus-de-blasio-mitchell-katz.html)
between City Hall and top city health department officials, which had
begun at the start of the coronavirus outbreak in March, burst into
public view and raised concerns that the feuding was undermining crucial
public health policies.

“I leave my post today with deep disappointment that during the most
critical public health crisis in our lifetime, that the health
department’s incomparable disease control expertise was not used to the
degree it could have been,” Dr. Barbot said in her resignation email
sent to Mr. de Blasio, a copy of which was shared with The New York
Times.

“Our experts are world renowned for their epidemiology, surveillance and
response work. The city would be well served by having them at the
strategic center of the response not in the background.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The mayor on Tuesday morning immediately announced a replacement for Dr.
Barbot, and later pushed back against any suggestion that she had
resigned in protest.

After a day of news coverage highlighting her departure, the mayor’s
office abruptly released a statement at 8:30 p.m., saying that Dr.
Barbot had been told over the weekend that “the administration was
moving in a different direction.”

At a hastily called news conference after her resignation earlier in the
day, Mr. de Blasio had defended his handling of the outbreak, saying
that the city had made ”extraordinary progress.”

The virus took a devastating toll in the spring, killing more than
20,000 residents, but it has largely ebbed in recent weeks. On Monday,
for example, only 316 people in the city tested positive out of more
than 30,000 tested.

Still, the turnover in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene comes
at a pivotal moment: Public schools are scheduled to partially open next
month — which could be crucial for the city’s recovery — and fears are
growing that the outbreak could surge again when the weather cools.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It had been clear in recent days that it was time for a change,” Mr. de
Blasio said about Dr. Barbot. “We need an atmosphere of unity. We need
an atmosphere of common
purpose.”

The mayor’s new health commissioner is Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, a former
senior leader at Health + Hospitals, the city’s public hospital system.

At no point in the statement about Dr. Chokshi’s appointment did the
mayor thank — or even mention — Dr. Barbot, who had served in his
administration since the start of his first term in 2014. Mr. de Blasio
did acknowledge her service during the news conference.

The speed of the appointment and the robustness of the announcement —
Mr. de Blasio had lined up [a former surgeon
general](https://wayback.archive-it.org/4765/20170106172109/https:/www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/vadm-vivek-murthy/index.html)
to speak highly of Dr. Chokshi — indicated that Dr. Barbot’s resignation
had not occurred in a vacuum.

Dr. Chokshi, who has also worked for health department in Louisiana and
as a health adviser to the United States secretary of Veterans Affairs,
received praise from the former surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, who
called him an “extraordinary public health leader who both sees the
forest and the trees.”

Still, former city health officials said the mayor should have done more
to listen to and support Dr. Barbot.

“It’s a bad day for the city. She’s a very qualified commissioner of
health,” said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, a former deputy mayor of health
under Mr. de Blasio who worked with Dr. Barbot. “There’s another woman
of color that goes down. I think it’s a really regrettable thing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is not a position you can put anybody just because. It’s the
premier public health agency in the country,” Ms. Barrios-Paoli added.
“It’s just a shame that she did not feel that she was supported by the
mayor.”

Current and former health officials said the departure of Dr. Barbot
reflected Mr. de Blasio’s [history of
distrust](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/nyregion/coronavirus-bill-de-blasio.html)
in his health department. From early in the coronavirus outbreak, he has
clashed with the department on testing, public messaging and how quickly
to shutter schools.

Mr. de Blasio has been faulted for resisting calls to close down schools
and businesses, which some epidemiologists believe worsened the
outbreak.

Once he decided on closures, Mr. de Blasio pushed for the state to
authorize further restrictions, a move ultimately made by Gov. Andrew M.
Cuomo. And in the intervening months, the mayor has moved cautiously in
reopening the city, guarding the progress that has been made in
controlling the virus.

But even as the outbreak began to ebb in late May, tensions with Dr.
Barbot mounted.

Some public health officials had bristled at the mayor’s decision to
place the city’s contact-tracing program inside Health + Hospitals. The
health department has performed such tracing for decades; the public
hospitals have not.

Dr. Barbot disagreed with the move, but kept her disapproval private.

Yet the behind-the-scenes tensions flared into the public eye in May,
when an article appeared in The New York Post about a conflict months
earlier between Dr. Barbot and a police commander who wanted personal
protective gear that had been set aside for health workers to be given
instead to the police. [The Post
quoted](https://nypost.com/2020/05/13/nyc-health-commissioner-wouldnt-supply-nypd-with-masks/)
Dr. Barbot as saying at one point, “I don’t give two rats’ asses about
your cops.” Police unions and some elected officials called for her
ouster.

At that point, Dr. Barbot began to make fewer public appearances. And
Mr. de Blasio seemed to be looking elsewhere for public health guidance,
turning to a new senior adviser, Dr. Jay Varma, and to Dr. Mitchell
Katz, the public hospitals chief.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio made clear that he did not believe that Dr.
Barbot was a team player.

“It’s never about one agency,” he said at one point. He used the words
“teamwork” or “team” 15 times in a 38-minute news conference.

New York City’s health department is regarded as one of the best
municipal health agencies in the world. But during the epidemic, the
mayor has repeatedly ignored the advice of its top disease-control
experts and sidelined the
department.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid

“I think this is the culmination of months of conflict between the
health department and City Hall,” said Councilman Mark Levine, who heads
the Council’s health committee. “This reflects enormous frustration that
global experts in infectious disease are being marginalized in the
middle of a pandemic.”

Most recently, senior health department officials disagreed with Mr. de
Blasio on what to do when staff or students in city schools test
positive for the virus, according to a person with knowledge of the
officials’ thinking.

Mr. de Blasio announced on Friday that a given school building could
close, in some cases for 14 days, when two positive cases emerged and
were not linked to the same classroom. The plan gives disease
investigators some discretion on closure. But even with only 1 percent
of tests coming back positive, as is the case in New York City now,
health officials are still worried that the thresholds will lead to many
schools closing at some point in the academic year, the person said.

Perhaps the most consequential debate inside City Hall over the
coronavirus came during the second week in March. The city had a small
number of positive cases, but its public health system was flashing a
warning about the unchecked spread of a flulike virus.

Dr. Barbot and one of her top deputies began urging more restrictions on
gatherings. Mr. de Blasio for a time sided instead with Dr. Katz, who
had been [advising City Hall against ordering
shutdowns.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/nyregion/coronavirus-de-blasio-mitchell-katz.html)

Some officials inside the health department [talked about
quitting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/nyregion/coronavirus-bill-de-blasio.html)
that week, or staging a walkout to force action. Eventually, top
officials and the mayor agreed on the need to lock down the city to stop
the spread of the virus. Mr. de Blasio ordered schools closed on March
15.

Outside of the administration, some blamed Dr. Barbot for the delays and
confusion, citing her shifting public statements on the virus from late
January to early March. A few elected officials [called for her to be
fired](https://nypost.com/2020/04/04/nyc-pols-urge-de-blasio-to-oust-health-commissioner-over-coronavirus-response/)
in early April.

The turmoil at the top of the city’s health agency worsened in May over
the mayor’s decision to locate the city’s contact-tracing efforts within
its public hospital system and not in the health department.

Under Health + Hospitals, the city’s contact-tracing program got off to
a rocky start. Lacking the capability to hire and manage 3,000 new
workers, it outsourced much of the day-to-day management of the call
center at the core of its operations to Optum, a billion-dollar
subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group.

So far, [fewer than
half](https://hhinternet.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/2020/07/test-and-trace-data-metrics-20200727.pdf)
of New Yorkers who have tested positive for the coronavirus — some
20,000 people since the program began on June 1 — have shared their
contacts.

“Right now, cases are popping up all over the place and we are not
linking them to known contacts except in a small proportion of cases,”
Dr. Neil Vora, the director of the trace effort, said at an internal
town-hall-style meeting for tracers last month, a recording of which was
provided to The Times.

Even with the new tracing program, the health department has been called
on to handle more intricate aspects of so-called disease detective work,
particularly in group settings like homeless shelters and nursing homes.
That expanded to include restaurants and other social gatherings last
month.

The mayor said on Friday that outbreaks in schools would also be handled
by the health department, in coordination with the city’s new corps of
contact tracers.
