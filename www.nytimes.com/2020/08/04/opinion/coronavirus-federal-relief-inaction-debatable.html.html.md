*This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can* [*sign up

Tuesdays and Thursdays.*

On Tuesday, as congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin headed into yet another round of negotiations over a new
pandemic relief package, the sides remain locked in a stalemate, or a
game of chicken.

“Every day the script is the same,” Senator [Mitch McConnell, the
majority leader,
said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-04/pelosi-mnuchin-signal-first-halting-progress-on-stimulus-deal).
“And the script is we had a pleasant conversation, but we don’t feel
like making a deal.”

In the meantime, tens of millions of Americans are being battered
financially, if not physically, by the virus. Whatever agreement
Congress and the Trump White House come to is likely to be the last
major item they tackle before this November’s presidential election.
Rarely in Washington do the policy stakes get higher.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So, via Slack, I reached out to my colleague Binyamin Appelbaum, a
member of the editorial board and a former Washington correspondent for
The Times, who has covered economic debates for years, to get a firmer
grip on what’s going on, what may happen next and how the emergency aid
that has been enacted so far could shape policymaking in the coming
years.

-----

**T.J.S.:** So, Binya, the country has just gone through its worst
economic quarter in over half a century. States and cities are
experiencing budget shortfalls just as bad or worse than the crunch they
faced during the Great Recession. And emergency unemployment insurance
for as many as 30 million Americans has expired. Oh, and the pandemic is
surging through the country again.

Without putting too fine a point on it — though feel free — what is
Congress doing?

**B.A.:** Well, we probably shouldn’t talk about Congress as a unit. The
original package of coronavirus aid, passed in March, has mostly run
out. Democrats, who control the House, passed a perfectly serviceable
extension and expansion of those aid programs in May. Republicans, who
control the Senate, insisted until recently that they didn’t see the
need for another bill, so they ignored it. Senator Mitch McConnell, the
majority leader, now says he’d like to do something but a) his plan is
much narrower than what Democrats favor and b) a lot of Senate
Republicans are not onboard and c) the White House can’t seem to make up
its mind.

**T.J.S.:** What, if any, workable theories are there for the Senate’s
inaction so far?

**B.A.:** I think some Republicans genuinely don’t understand how the
economy works. They’ve taken legitimate observations about the limits of
government’s powers and turned them into religious principles about the
futility of any government intervention. Others, including McConnell,
may simply be playing a game of chicken, trying to see how much
Democrats are willing to concede on Republican priorities — notably,
legal protections for businesses whose workers get sick.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The most cynical interpretation — which isn’t to say that it’s wrong —
is that Republicans expect to lose power in November. During the early
years of the Obama administration, Republicans sabotaged economic
stimulus efforts because they thought it would help them return to
power. And it worked — although only at the expense of millions of
Americans.

**T.J.S.:** Of course, there is a certain someone — President Trump —
who has every reason, if he wants to do all he can to get re-elected, to
push Mr. McConnell and other Senate Republicans into passing a package
of moderately generous emergency aid extensions through November. But by
Trumpian standards, he seems to have barely made a peep.

**B.A.:** Trump does seem to be sabotaging his own re-election
prospects. I’m not going to try to climb inside the president’s head,
but I would note that it can be misleading to think of the presidency as
a single person sitting there making autonomous decisions. A president
is encrusted in advisers who filter what he hears and who inform what he
decides. So the reasons for the Senate’s inaction may well apply to the
White House too.

**T.J.S.:** If only we could climb inside the president’s head.

Moving on from the palace intrigue, I recently read [a fascinating essay
in
Barron’s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-best-part-of-the-cares-act-is-dying-it-should-live-again-51596067632)
by Matthew Zeitlin. He observes how the $600 weekly payment that
Congress approved for the unemployed — many of whom are now bringing in
more than they did from their previous jobs — has provided an informal
case study of government aid. As he puts it, “even with a limited run,
the benefit has provided a wealth of data, insight, and experience that
should reshape how we think about unemployment benefits and social
policy.”

Because of the benefits these payments have provided to the economy, he
says, “they — or something like them — could be a permanent feature of
U.S. economic policy.”

It’s definitely bold, and only something elected Democrats, and those to
their left, would even consider. But vote-counting aside, what do you
make of the ideas he covers in the piece, like wage subsidies or a mini
universal basic income on the merits?

**B.A.:** It’s one of the few things that has gone right since the
crisis started. For me, the $600 payments really underscore that we need
two different kinds of unemployment benefits, one for normal times and
one for bad times. In normal times, the state only replaces a portion of
lost wages because we want to encourage people to go back to work. In
bad times, when work is hard to find, it makes sense to give people more
money. And we could switch automatically between those two kinds of
programs based on the level of unemployment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The details, though, get a little tricky. The average weekly
unemployment benefit is a little less than $400. Congress added the $600
because the combination replaces the wages of an average worker. That
meant a lot of people were making more than they did while they were
working, which drove Republicans crazy. But they acquiesced because the
Labor Department told them states didn’t have the necessary systems to
calculate actual wage replacement.

But there’s another big problem. Benefits vary widely by state. In
Florida, the maximum is $275; in Massachusetts, it’s $873. If you move
to a system where the federal government is covering the difference
between state benefits and full wage replacement, you’re basically
subsidizing Florida’s stinginess.

I do have reservations about viewing expanded unemployment benefits as a
proof-of-concept for U.B.I. The rationale for providing people with
money during economic downturns is very different than the rationale for
providing a constant subsidy. This probably isn’t the place to get into
the details.

**T.J.S.:** All fair points. In the spirit of this being a relatively
informal place, not fit for all the details, here’s a question based
purely on speculation: Assuming the polls hold relatively steady and
President Trump loses re-election, what is the first economic policy
that a hypothetical Joe Biden administration should pursue?

**B.A.:** My answer is baby bonds, actually. The basic idea is that
every kid gets a $2,000 government savings account when they’re born,
and then additional annual contributions based on family income. To me,
one of the defining challenges facing our society is to give kids a
better chance to succeed. Right now, it matters way too much how much
money your parents have — and those wealth inequalities really map onto
racial lines.

Giving every kid a nest egg is a very powerful idea: It would improve
every kid’s opportunities. It’s like Social Security, but for the
beginning of life.

**T.J.S.:** Indeed. I think that’s a good place to leave it. Thanks,
Binya.

**B.A.:** Thank you.

### WHAT YOU’RE SAYING

*Here’s what readers had to say about the last debate:* [*Fascism: A
Concern*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/fascism-us.html)*.*

Peter from Truro, Mass.: “I feel one part of my understanding of fascism
that seems left out is the corporate/business cooperation that certainly
existed in European fascism in the ’30s and ’40s. Hitler needed
cooperation from many German and U.S. corporations to support his
existence and war effort. Our corporations certainly have incredible
influence through donations and are rewarded with business-friendly
policies now and historically.”

Erik from Chicago: “A fascist politician or leader is one who is a
product of a nation with extreme capitalism (wealth inequality) who
demonizes minorities to gain or maintain power.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“In a sense, fascism is the next evolution of extreme capitalism. This
is not 1939, so fascism today will be a little different than fascism in
the past. For example authoritarians of all stripes today maintain
trappings of democracy; Russia, Iran and North Korea, for example, all
have sham elections.

“Let’s not sugarcoat it by debating how it may or may not be fascism.
The takeaway of having the fascism debate at all is that we’re living in
incredibly extreme times.”
