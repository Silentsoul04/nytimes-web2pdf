\section{BlackRock, on Argentina's Debt
Accord}\label{blackrock-on-argentinas-debt-accord}}

The firm says its role is consistent with its commitment to stakeholder
capitalism. Also: Transgender service members; a paucity of
conversation; second-home owners.

\textbf{To the Editor:}

``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/argentina-debt.html}{BlackRock
Faces Test of Principles}'' (Business, Aug. 1) questioned whether our
firm's role in Argentina's debt restructuring was consistent with our
commitment to stakeholder capitalism. The answer is a resounding yes.

\href{https://www.economia.gob.ar/en/argentina-and-three-creditor-groups-reach-a-deal-on-debt-restructuring/}{Argentina
announced} early Tuesday that it had reached agreement with its major
creditors. The breakthrough in negotiations, led by BlackRock, will
provide Argentina with \$23 billion in upfront cash relief, virtually
eliminating contractual payments during the next four years. This will
give Argentina significant space to develop a credible plan to stabilize
its economy and create an environment where investment and employment
can thrive.

BlackRock, like other asset managers in our bondholder group, invested
in Argentina on behalf of millions of people around the world saving for
retirement. We are fiduciaries to our clients and seek outcomes that
benefit all stakeholders, including the countries in which we invest.
With this new agreement in place, we have successfully navigated that
outcome.

Using media and other third parties as a mechanism in negotiations is a
bad formula for a successful outcome. We are pleased that, in the end,
all parties engaged directly and constructively to achieve a consensual
outcome. Most important, with fair restructurings now in place,
Argentina (and Ecuador) can better address vital social needs posed by
Covid-19.

\textbf{To the Editor:}

``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/military-transgender-trump-biden.html}{Biden
Could Quickly End Transgender Military Ban}'' (news article, July 23)
says President Trump's ban on open transgender military service ``does
not affect people who are already serving.''

First of all, the ban prohibits transgender service members who have not
already received a diagnosis from transitioning to live openly as who
they are. Second, although the ban conditionally grandfathered those
service members who already transitioned, it stamps them with a badge of
inferiority, marks them out as an exception to the rule and forces them
to serve under the constant threat of being summarily discharged for who
they are.

Transgender service members have proved time and time again over the
last four years that they are as competent and capable as their peers.
They have proved themselves in the most austere environments and have
deployed worldwide. We applaud the effort to move quickly to eliminate
the ban so that transgender service members can continue serving our
country without looking over their shoulders.

Re
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/well/family/the-benefits-of-talking-to-strangers.html}{The
Weak Ties That Bind},'' by Jane E. Brody (Personal Health, Aug. 4):

Talking to strangers is part of the rich texture of city life. During
these highly uncertain and socially distanced times, in addition to
missing loved ones, I miss talking to strangers I would formerly
encounter in the subway, and on street corners. I miss talking with
unknown babies and children, and trying to make them smile or laugh.

And I especially miss those ``known strangers'' I would see in coffee
shops and while doing errands; I worry about workers I would talk with
in these venues, and hope that they are healthy and are able to survive
economically.

Alas, given the need to maintain social distancing to protect everyone's
health, I regret that these joyful daily encounters will not return for
a long while, especially as many people ignore the mask mandate. As a
result, one now feels safer limiting in-person contact, particularly
with strangers.

One hopes that with time this will change.

Re
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/realestate/coronavirus-second-homes-.html}{Second
Home, Full Time}'' (Real Estate, July 26), about families who have
retreated to their weekend homes:

I usually look forward to reading the Real Estate section, even during
this pandemic. But the cover story focusing on those who have fled New
York City and are worrying about how to make adjustments to their
``summer home'' just hit me in the gut.

I don't begrudge those who are fortunate enough to be able to have the
luxury of owning two homes and the ability to escape the isolation and
tension that exist in the city, but I just found this article to be
totally insensitive by focusing on renovations when people are suffering
across the country.

Millions of people lost their additional \$600-a-week unemployment
benefits at the end of July. Is this the appropriate moment for The
Times to devote prime real estate coverage to those who are concerned
about renovations rather than those who are trying to determine where
are they going to find money to pay August's rent?
