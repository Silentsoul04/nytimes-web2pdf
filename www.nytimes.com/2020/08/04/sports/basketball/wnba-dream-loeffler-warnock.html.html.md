# W.N.B.A. Players Escalate Protest of Anti-B.L.M. Team Owner

</div>

Led by the members of the Atlanta Dream, players have begun wearing
T-shirts supporting a political opponent of Senator Kelly Loeffler, who
co-owns the Dream and has spoken against the Black Lives Matter
movement.

Players for the Atlanta Dream and other teams across the W.N.B.A. have
begun a public show of defiance by wearing T-shirts endorsing the
Democratic opponent of the Dream’s co-owner Senator Kelly Loeffler,
Republican of Georgia, who is in a tightly contested race for her seat
and has spoken disparagingly of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Images of players, including the nine-time All-Star Diana Taurasi,
wearing the shirts endorsing Dr. Raphael G. Warnock flooded social media
on Tuesday ahead of a nationally televised matchup between Atlanta and
the Phoenix Mercury.

Across the chest of the black T-shirts were two words “Vote Warnock,” a
reference to the Atlanta pastor who is one of the top Democrats running
against Loeffler [in a special election in
November](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/politics/kelly-loeffler-georgia-senate-arizona.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was the latest escalation in a conflict that has roiled the W.N.B.A.
in recent weeks. Loeffler, who owns 49 percent of the team, has publicly
and frequently derided the league for dedicating its season [to the
Black Lives Matter
movement](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/sports/basketball/kelly-loeffler-atlanta-dream-protests.html),
provoking sharp criticism from some of the league’s most high-profile
figures. The players’ union has [called for her
ouster](https://twitter.com/TheWNBPA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor),
but W.N.B.A. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert [told CNN in
mid-July](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVaI_-G8Nd0) that Loeffler
would not be forced to sell the team.

Elizabeth Williams, who has played for the Dream since 2016, said in an
interview on Monday that the players plan to “vocally support” Warnock
in the coming weeks, and that players have had “several” conversations
with him.

“When we realized what our owner was doing and how she was kind of using
us and the Black Lives Matter movement for her political gain, we felt
like we didn’t want to feel kind of lost as the pawns in this,” Williams
said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is just more proof that the out of control cancel culture wants to
shut out anyone who disagrees with them,” Loeffler said in a statement
late Tuesday. “It’s clear that the league is more concerned with playing
politics than basketball, and I stand by what I wrote in June.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Warnock, in an email, said he was “honored and humbled by the
overwhelming support from the W.N.B.A. players.”

“This movement gives us the opportunity to fight for what we believe in,
and I stand by all athletes promoting social justice on and off the
court,” Warnock said. “Senator Loeffler and those like her who seek to
silence and dismiss others when they speak up for justice have planted
themselves on the wrong side of history.”

Williams said the idea to publicly endorse Warnock came from Sue Bird,
the 11-time All-Star guard for the Seattle Storm. Both Williams and Bird
are executives in the players’ union. Top players also consulted with
Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who lost a close race for the Georgia
governor’s seat in 2018 to Brian Kemp, a Republican. Abrams joined [the
players’ union board of advocates](https://wnbpa.com/about/board/) last
summer.

In planning the demonstration, the players thought it was important that
the T-shirts debuted during a game that was nationally televised.
Tuesday’s game between the Dream and Mercury was scheduled to be
broadcast on ESPN 2. Williams said that the Dream players will continue
to wear the T-shirts in upcoming games, and other teams have agreed to
do so, too.

“We can’t really do anything about her ownership,” Williams said,
referring to Loeffler. “That’s not something we can control. We can
control who we vote for.”

The teams’ coaches were made aware of the demonstration, Williams said,
but she was unsure whether Mary Brock, the philanthropist who owns the
other 51 percent of the Dream, was told ahead of time. Brock thus far
has not publicly addressed the conflict between Loeffler and the
W.N.B.A. players.

This level of public protest — players on a team openly campaigning
against their own owner — is virtually unheard of in professional
sports. But it is not out of character for players in the W.N.B.A., a
league that has frequently shown a willingness to tackle social justice
issues publicly. In 2016, W.N.B.A. players were among the first
professional athletes in the United States [to demonstrate against
police
brutality](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/sports/basketball/liberty-show-solidarity-with-black-lives-matter-in-rare-public-stance.html),
also with T-shirts. The W.N.B.A. initially fined those players before
rescinding the fines.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was not immediately clear whether the league would take action
against the players for Tuesday’s demonstration. Representatives for the
league did not immediately return a request for comment.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Recently, the league has waded deeper into politics, in large part
because of its players’ willingness to do the same. In 2018, the
W.N.B.A. [partnered with Planned
Parenthood](https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-take-a-seat-take-a-stand-women-girls-2018-season/)for
an initiative called “Take a Seat, Take a Stand,” which sent a portion
of ticket proceeds to multiple groups including Planned Parenthood.
Since then, W.N.B.A. players have often been spotted at the front lines
of demonstrations, especially recently after the deaths of George Floyd
and Breonna Taylor, who were killed by the police.

The initial response to Loeffler, who is not involved in the day-to-day
operations of the team, came after she wrote a letter in early July to
Engelbert, saying, “I adamantly oppose the Black Lives Matter political
movement, which has advocated for the defunding of police.” Loeffler
also accused the movement of promoting “violence and destruction across
the country.”

One of the most high-profile rebukes came [from Dream
players](https://twitter.com/moniquebillings/status/1281713112949850113?s=21),
who issued a collective statement on July 10: “It is not extreme to
demand change after centuries of inequality. This is not a political
statement. This is a statement of humanity.”

Loeffler has since made a cause celebre of criticizing the W.N.B.A.’s
commitment to social justice, frequently conducting interviews painting
herself as a victim of so-called “cancel culture” as a result of the
backlash from players.

In her Senate race, Loeffler is fighting to remain in the seat she was
appointed to late last year after Johnny Isakson stepped down because of
health problems. To win, a candidate must get 50 percent of the vote. If
no candidate reaches that mark, the top two candidates will have a
runoff, which is widely expected to be the outcome. The other top
candidate in the race is Representative Doug Collins, a Republican and
ardent supporter of President Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Collins and the W.N.B.A. players have one thing in common: They want
Loeffler to sell her stake in the team. But Collins’s reasoning was
different. On July 7, he issued a statement that said Loeffler should
“get out of the liberal agenda advocacy business,” in reference to the
Dream.

Asked if she was bothered that the W.N.B.A. was not forcing Loeffler to
sell her stake, Williams said: “Honestly, I think that she wants the
league to push her out. She wants that to be part of this statement that
she’s making that, ‘Oh, Black Lives Matter is divisive. They pushed me
out because they feel differently, blah blah blah.’

“So I think, ironically, playing this kind of wait and see game is more
frustrating for Kelly than it is for us,” Williams said.
