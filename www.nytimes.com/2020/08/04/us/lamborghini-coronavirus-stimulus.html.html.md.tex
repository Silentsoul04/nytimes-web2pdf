\section{Second Person Used Covid Relief Money to Buy a Lamborghini,
Prosecutors
Say}\label{second-person-used-covid-relief-money-to-buy-a-lamborghini-prosecutors-say}}

A Houston man who received more than \$1.6 million bought a 2019
Lamborghini Urus, prosecutors said. Last week, a Miami man bought a
Lamborghini Huracán, according to the authorities.

A Texas man this week became the second person in less than two weeks to
be accused by federal prosecutors of using Covid-19 relief money to buy
a Lamborghini.

The man, Lee Price III, 29, of Houston, received more than \$1.6 million
under the federal Paycheck Protection Program after he submitted five
applications in May and June with fraudulent information to numerous
banks claiming to employ dozens of people, prosecutors in Houston said
on Tuesday.

In response to two of those applications, a pair of banks that officials
did not identify deposited money into bank accounts controlled by Mr.
Price, according to a criminal complaint filed in the Southern District
of Texas.

With that money, Mr. Price went on a lavish spending spree, according to
the complaint. On June 26 ---~the day Mr. Price received \$937,500 in
response to one request ---~he purchased a \$14,000 Rolex watch, the
complaint stated. The next day, it said, he bought a 2019 Lamborghini
Urus, for \$233,337.60.

And over the next three days, he spent more than \$700 at a liquor
store, around \$2,000 at a strip club and more than \$2,500 at two
Houston nightclubs, according to the complaint.

In response to another application, Mr. Price received \$752,452, the
prosecutors said. That money went toward the purchase of a 2020 Ford
F-350 pickup truck and the lease for a luxury apartment in midtown
Houston, the prosecutors said.

Mr. Price was arrested Tuesday and charged with wire fraud, bank fraud,
making false statements to financial institutions and engaging in
prohibited monetary transactions, the prosecutors said.

A person who answered a telephone number listed for Mr. Price
immediately hung up on Tuesday night. A federal public defender was
assigned to represent Mr. Price, according to court records. An email
message sent to the public defender's office on Tuesday night was not
immediately returned.

Last week, prosecutors in Florida arrested and charged David T. Hines of
Miami with three felonies, accusing him of having used Covid-19 relief
money to a blue Lamborghini Huracán, the authorities said.

Mr. Hines's lawyer, Chad Piotrowski, said in a statement that his client
was ``a legitimate business owner who, like millions of Americans,
suffered financially during the pandemic'' and ``is anxious to tell his
side of the story when the time comes.''
