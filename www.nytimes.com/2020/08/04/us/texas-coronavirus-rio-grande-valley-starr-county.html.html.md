# ‘Like a Horror Movie’: A Small Border Hospital Battles the Coronavirus

</div>

The hospital in Starr County, Texas, had no I.C.U. at all, and only one
doctor on duty for each shift. Then the coronavirus began surging
through the Rio Grande
Valley.

RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas — A tense rescue scene has been unfolding for
weeks outside a small rural hospital on the Mexican border that has been
the first line of defense against one of the most voracious coronavirus
outbreaks in the country.

Nearly every day, a crew at Starr County Memorial Hospital prepares a
patient whom its doctors are unable to help, loads the gurney into a
helicopter and stands back as the aircraft roars into the country sky.

“Very, very unfortunately, of all of the patients we have transferred,
none have come back alive,” said Dr. Jose Vazquez, the health authority
in Starr County, a remote section of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas that
before the coronavirus outbreak did not have a single I.C.U. bed.

There was a time not long ago when the pace was a lot less frantic at
Starr County Memorial, whose 45 beds were once sufficient for the
roughly 65,000 people spread out along the border near Tamaulipas,
Mexico. The county is dotted with tiny villages, long stretches of open
road, cattle ranches and the occasional small town.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On an average day before the outbreak, a handful of doctors and nurses
treated patients at the hospital for “infections, pneumonia, heart
conditions, and roughly, that’s it,” said Joseph Panlilio, one of the
hospital’s head nurses.

But the new wave of coronavirus infections has been as swift as it has
been merciless, with more than 2,110 cases in the county and nearly 70
deaths that are suspected of being linked to Covid-19, local officials
said.

Nearby counties in the valley are also battling surges in infections,
but Starr County lacks the medical staffing and facilities of its more
populated neighbors. On a good day, about 12 full-time doctors serve the
entire county.

“To say we are overwhelmed, it’s an understatement,” said Dr. Cruz
Alberto Bernal, who until recently was the only doctor on duty during
his shifts at the hospital.

Facing an overwhelming number of cases, the hospital said in July that
it would convene an ethics committee to help make difficult decisions
about which patients to treat, which to medevac to better-equipped
hospitals, and which to send home to die.

“The time of rationing medical care is a time that we all have feared
from the beginning, but it looks like we are getting to that point now,”
Dr. Vazquez [said last
month](https://www.themonitor.com/2020/07/19/starr-county-form-ethics-committee-responsible-virus-resources/).

Ultimately, Dr. Vazquez said in an interview later, the final decision
rests with the next of kin, in a region where close-knit families may
prefer to take a terminally ill patient home, rather than leave a loved
one to die alone in a hospital room. “We are not deciding who lives or
dies,” he said. “We are not creating death
panels.”

Hospital officials said the community needed to understand that so small
a facility could not treat everyone on its own.

“We were not built for a situation like this,” said Eloy Vera, the

Starr County, [one of the poorest in the
nation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/01/25/poorest-counties-in-the-us-median-household-income/38870175/),

Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00581),
warning of a stark disparity in the availability of critical care
facilities in the midst of the pandemic, found that nearly half of the
nation’s communities with a median income of $35,000 or less had no
intensive care beds at all, compared with 3 percent of the
highest-income communities.

“Unfortunately, there will be a lot of unnecessary suffering and deaths
from Covid-19 because of the lack of I.C.U. capacity in these low-income
areas,” said Genevieve Kanter, an assistant professor at the University
of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and one of the study’s
authors.

The crush shows no signs of abating. On a recent afternoon, doctors and
nurses rushed in and out of the clinic’s improvised Covid-19 unit,
roughly the size of one and a half tractor-trailers.

It was put together behind a makeshift wall of plywood, heavy plastic
and duct tape to separate coronavirus patients from those in the rest of
the hospital.

Doctors and nurses, most of them wearing several layers of protective
gear, fanned themselves desperately during their rounds. Any hint of
cool air sputtering from the hospital’s overburdened air-conditioning
system was quickly overcome by the unforgiving Texas heat seeping
through the walls.

“The A.C. is working,” Dr. Bernal said. “It’s overworked, just like us.”

Most of the patients in the Covid-19 unit were older, and were grappling
with pre-existing conditions including obesity, hypertension and heart
conditions.

Roger Garcia, 38, said his mother, Martha Ramos de Garcia, 65, had
contracted the virus in late July while she was undergoing chemotherapy
for breast cancer.

For a while, the family held off sending her to Starr County Memorial,
he said. “We knew it was a small hospital. They don’t have enough of
everything.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But one blistering day, she was unable to breathe on her own, and a
responding paramedic only needed a quick look. “Se ve malita” — she
looks a bit sick, he told Mr. Garcia, his words minimizing what they all
knew was a grave situation. His mother died a few days later in the
makeshift Covid-19 unit.

“They tried, but couldn’t save her,” Mr. Garcia said. “It feels like a
horror movie. People are dying
everywhere.”

Residents are still trying to understand how the situation became so
serious as suddenly as it did.

The surge was slow to arrive. After neighboring counties began reporting
an explosion of infections in the spring, 21 days passed before a single
case was detected in Starr County, Dr. Vazquez said.

poverty and chronic disease. [Large family

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

The coronavirus, he said, was everywhere.

“I’m not sick. Neither is my family. But I’m afraid it’s a matter of
time.”

Aid from the state and from the Navy has staved off some of the
casualties that might otherwise have occurred, hospital officials said.
Medical specialists and much-needed medical supplies and equipment —
including ventilators, oxygen support and IV pumps — were welcomed with
a huge sense of relief by the small hospital staff.

“We can use any help we can get,” Mr. Vera said.

As is the case at most hospitals during a pandemic, visitors are not
allowed. But that did not stop dozens of local residents from flocking
to the hospital grounds last week, peering in at patients through the
windows. They resembled Victorian suitors defying orders to stay away
from a forbidden love, throwing air kisses and heart hand signs their
way.

Inside, the doctors made their way among the roughly 30 patients in the
ward — it was filled to capacity — walking in and out of quaint rooms
adorned with country flowered curtains.

Dr. Bernal, who graduated from medical school three years ago, said that
when he took the job at the rural hospital, he never thought he would be
facing the pace of a big-city facility.

“Before the pandemic, I was signing three to four death certificates a
year,” he said. “These days I have been signing at least six a week. And
that’s just me.”

A nurse wearing a face shield delivered news that the doctor had dreaded
but expected — a 72-year-old woman, already suffering from severe
obesity, had succumbed to the virus moments
earlier.

Not far away, his colleagues were trying to save the lives of several
other patients who were fading fast.

Mr. Panlilio, the nurse in charge, watched closely as three other nurses
wrapped bandages around the knees of a woman in her 60s who was
connected to a ventilator. Her treatment at the hospital, he said, had
run its course.

“She needs a higher level of care than we can provide,” he said. “We
need to open her throat and clear her airways. We simply don’t have the
necessary tools to do that here.”

He ordered an air transfer to a bigger hospital in another city
—<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>anywhere that would take
her, he said.

Wasting no time, another nurse stabbed a phone’s keypad with her finger.
“We are trying to make it happen as soon as possible,” Mr. Panlilio
said.

But there was no answer.

Mr. Panlilio stood and watched as his colleague tried another phone
number, and another, and another.
