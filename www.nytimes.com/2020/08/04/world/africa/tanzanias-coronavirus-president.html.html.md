# Tanzania’s President Says Country Is Virus Free. Others Warn of Disaster

Tanzania hasn’t reported a single coronavirus case in three months, even
as the African continent is expected this week to cross the threshold of
one million reported cases.

NAIROBI, Kenya — More than [88 days have
passed](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200804-covid-19-sitrep-197.pdf?sfvrsn=94f7a01d_2)
since Tanzania reported even a single new coronavirus case — far longer
than any other African country. Tanzania’s president has declared the
scourge “absolutely finished” and encouraged tourists to come back.

The problem is that, outside of Tanzania, people are skeptical. And
inside Tanzania, few dare stand up to the president, John Magufuli, who
has become increasingly autocratic since he was elected five years ago.

Mr. Magufuli has said that the power of prayer helped purge the virus
from the country, even as the African continent is expected this week to
cross the threshold of one million reported cases.

The Tanzanian president has promoted an unproven herbal tea from
Madagascar as a cure. He has disparaged social distancing and mask
wearing. And his government has not disseminated any recent data to the
World Health Organization. The group last heard from Tanzania on April
29, when the country reported 509 cases and 21 deaths from Covid-19.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Magufuli stood before government and security officials in the
capital, Dodoma, on July 20 and praised them for restoring safety in the
east African nation of nearly 60 million. “Our enemies will say a lot,
but here in Tanzania we are safe,” he said. “We put God first, and God
heard us.”

Outside of Tanzania, doubt about the conspicuous absence of new cases or
deaths has only been reinforced by Mr. Magufuli’s behavior over the past
few months.

In May, the head of Tanzania’s national laboratory was dismissed after
Mr. Magufuli [questioned the efficacy of testing
kits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbSZd8oyaGE) supplied by the
Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mr. Magufuli claimed
that the kits had returned positive results on samples secretly taken
from a goat and a pawpaw fruit. The Africa C.D.C. and the W.H.O. [both
rebutted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=cwrW2Ksg-6Q&feature=emb_logo)
those allegations, saying the tests were reliable.

With limited reporting, critics have [accused the government of a
cover-up](https://medium.com/@actbrief/president-magufuli-must-commit-to-full-transparency-334919f76260),
especially after videos of [night
burials](https://twitter.com/fatma_karume/status/1254657286179520517)
with attendants [wearing protective
gear](https://twitter.com/ngurumo/status/1255204084182810629) surfaced
online.

In neighboring Kenya, lawmakers have [expressed
concern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1PeaFeAxGM) about Tanzania’s
handling of the pandemic. The Kenyan authorities denied entry to dozens
of Tanzanian truck drivers who had tested positive at border points.

In May, the United States Embassy also
[warned](https://tz.usembassy.gov/health-alert-u-s-embassy-dar-es-salaam-may-13-2020/)
of an “exponential growth” of infection in Tanzania, saying the risk of
contracting the virus in the commercial port city of Dar es Salaam was
“extremely high.”

Mr. Magufuli’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic “has been nothing
short of an irresponsible disaster,” said Tundu Lissu, an opposition
leader who [fled the country in 2017 but recently
returned](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/07/27/world/africa/ap-af-tanzania-opposition-leader-returns.html)
to run for president. “His attitude has been Covid-19 will somehow go
away if we all stop talking about it.”

Officials in Tanzania say they have enforced internationally recommended
measures, whether dealing with public gatherings or [arriving
tourists](https://twitter.com/MsigwaGerson/status/1279145467297894403),
and that they continue to work with the W.H.O. and other countries to
curb the spread of the virus.

At the same time, said Hassan Abbas, a government spokesman, the world
should not “shy away” from emulating what he called the country’s best
practices.

“We have something to teach the rest,” he said.

The W.H.O. has said it continues to engage Tanzania through its
membership in various technical committees and has advised the country
to scale up surveillance. Negotiations were also underway between the
Ministry of Health and the W.H.O. regarding sharing information, Zabulon
Yoti, the W.H.O. acting Africa director for emergency preparedness and
response, said in a statement.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the organization has not overtly questioned Tanzania’s lack of
reporting. Other international public health officials are far more
blunt in their skepticism.

John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa C.D.C., said he was “very
worried” Tanzania had not disclosed any information for months,
hindering the agency’s ability to help coordinate and guide the
continent’s response in the
pandemic.

“The best way to deal with this is good information, good data and good
science,” Dr. Nkengasong said, adding that governments like Tanzania’s
should be cognizant “that any infection anywhere will be infections
everywhere in Africa.”

“None of our countries is an island,” he said.

Mr. Magufuli rose to power in 2015 on an anti-corruption platform,
promising to deal with the graft that had plagued the nation for years.
A former lawmaker and cabinet minister, he gained the nickname “The
Bulldozer” while serving at the ministry of works.

After assuming office as president, he purged the public payroll of
so-called ghost workers — fictitious employees created for dishonest
purposes. He channeled funds intended for national celebrations to
health operations and began holding public officials and contractors
accountable by paying them [surprise
visits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lDfz7s2HDQ).

He also undertook efforts to revive the national airline and cut foreign
travel budgets for civil servants. When farmers complained that big
corporate buyers were offering low prices for cashews, a major export in
Tanzania, the president [sent in the
army](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46180098) to buy the cashews
at a higher price.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But these popular efforts did not last long. His administration soon
began to [crack down on the media](https://cpj.org/africa/tanzania/),
ban the collection of statistics and data without government approval
and pass laws that [placed
restrictions](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/tanzania-authorities-rushing-to-pass-bill-to-further-repress-human-rights/)
on human rights organizations.

The moves surprised those who had hoped Mr. Magufuli would change the
country’s direction for the better. “Magufuli looked like a fresh
start,” said Maria Sarungi Tsehai, director of Kwanza TV, which was
[suspended](https://cpj.org/2020/07/tanzania-bans-kwanza-online-tv-for-11-months-citing-misleading-instagram-post-on-covid-19/)
for 11 months after reporting on a Covid-19 health alert from the United
States
Embassy.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?

        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Several doctors, health advocacy groups and nongovernmental
organizations in Tanzania declined to comment for this article for fear
of reprisals.

“The only voices left are very few of us,” Mr. Tsehai said. “And that’s
actually becoming a very scary scenario.”

While Mr. Magufuli endeared himself to supporters early on, critics say
his policies are increasingly undermining the fabric of a nation once
considered a paragon of stability in the region.

Some say his intolerance is a throwback to the nationalistic ways of
[Julius
Nyerere](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/world/julius-nyerere-of-tanzania-dies-preached-african-socialism-to-the-world.html),
Tanzania’s founding father and an icon of anti-colonialism in Africa.

While there are many dissimilarities, “Magufuli presents his leadership
as a wholesale return to Nyerere,” said Dan Paget, a politics professor
at the University of Aberdeen in Britain.

His plans to resuscitate the national airline, launch a modern railway
and revive work on a hydroelectric dam first proposed in the 1970s
exemplify that vision, Mr. Paget said.

The president’s actions also reflect the behavior of a ruling party that
seeks to stay in power at whatever cost, said Fatma Karume, a rights
lawyer in Dar es Salaam.

The party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or Party of the Revolution, has
controlled Tanzania since its creation, in 1977, but its victories at
the polls have been progressively reduced since multiparty politics was
restored in 1992.

“It’s centralization of power,” said Ms. Karume, referring to Mr.
Magufuli’s actions. “Because when you have civil society, you have the
press, you have opposition. Your power is not concentrated,” she said.

Health experts warn that Mr. Magufuli’s denial around the coronavirus
could be calamitous.

“With no testing data or clinical surveillance information, Tanzania
will be late in detecting and dealing with a potentially delayed
explosion of severe clinical cases,” said Frank Minja, a Tanzanian
doctor who is an associate professor of radiology and biomedical imaging
at the Yale School of Medicine.

The opposition is hoping to use the government’s handling of the
pandemic [to rally voters
against](https://twitter.com/zittokabwe/status/1259467054014500864) Mr.
Magufuli in October. Despite the president’s clampdown on political
organizing and what is said about the virus, the opposition party,
Chadema, has registered millions of new members, said Mr. Lissu, the
opposition candidate who fled the country in 2017.

October could be a “make or break election” in Tanzania’s history, said
Mr. Lissu. “We stand on the brink of disaster,” he said. “But we are
also on the brink of a miracle.”
