\section{More U.S. Troops Will Leave Afghanistan Before the Election,
Trump
Says}\label{more-us-troops-will-leave-afghanistan-before-the-election-trump-says}}

The president's assertion undercuts diplomats who have said withdrawals
will depend on the Taliban's commitment to its peace deal with the
United States.

President Trump said that there would be fewer than 5,000 American
troops in Afghanistan by Election Day in November, signaling that the
United States would continue to withdraw troops from the country despite
limited progress toward the start of peace negotiations between the
Afghan government and the Taliban.

``We're going down to 4,000, we're negotiating right now,'' Mr. Trump
said in an
\href{https://www.axios.com/full-axios-hbo-interview-donald-trump-cd5a67e1-6ba1-46c8-bb3d-8717ab9f3cc5.html}{interview
with Axios} that was filmed on July 28 and released in full Monday
night.

The president's statement seems to undercut U.S. diplomats' repeated
assertions that any further troop reductions in Afghanistan would be
based on the Taliban's commitment to the Feb. 29
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/us-taliban-deal.html}{peace
agreement} signed with the United States. After the signing, the U.S.
military is supposed to completely withdraw from Afghanistan in 14
months, a move that senior military officials have called
``aspirational.''

Mr. Trump's drive to pull U.S. forces from war zones, especially
Afghanistan, has often put the White House at loggerheads with the State
Department, as American negotiators and military officials have tried to
keep an already shaky peace process on track.

In the interview, Mr. Trump called the U.S. involvement in the Middle
East ``the single biggest mistake in the history of our country.''

The agreement with the Taliban ``calls for additional conditions-based
troop withdrawals as the peace process evolves,'' Maj. Rob Lodewick, a
Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. ``The president's direction on
the issue has been clear, and the department is moving to effectively
implement that guidance in consultation with Congress and in close
coordination with our NATO and partner nations.''

The Taliban continues to attack Afghan troops, and the United States
military has bombed the insurgent group dozens of times in their defense
since the agreement. The American-led mission has refused to publicly
acknowledge the strikes. The Taliban have agreed not to attack American
and NATO coalition forces, but Afghan forces continue to be targeted
despite hopes that there would be a reduction in violence after the
deal.

This summer, the Pentagon prepared several options for further troop
reductions, including a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Afghanistan before Election Day, a move that would most likely abandon
any hope of a U.S.-moderated peace settlement in the country.

Senior military officials had anticipated a politically motivated
decision by Mr. Trump, much like his
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/world/middleeast/winners-losers-syria-trumps-troops.html}{moves
to pull troops out of Syria}.

The president's decision to move to about 5,000 troops **** from 8,600
was the Pentagon's preferred option of those proposed, defense officials
said. The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/coronavirus-military.html}{effect
of the coronavirus pandemic} has already greatly restricted U.S.
military operations in the country, making some troops already deployed
there next to useless because many of their roles require in-person
training with Afghan forces.

As part of the February agreement, the U.S. military cut its numbers in
Afghanistan to about 8,600 from 12,000 and closed several bases.
Negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban were supposed
to start months ago but have been held up over a prisoner exchange
between the two sides.

Also part of the deal is a public declaration from the Taliban to
denounce and split from Al Qaeda, the terrorist group responsible for
the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and a longtime ally of the insurgent
group. There has been little indication that has changed after the
agreement, according to military officials.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke on Monday with the Taliban's chief
negotiator, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, regarding the prisoner exchange,
Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban spokesman,
\href{https://twitter.com/suhailshaheen1/status/1290350620210163712}{said
on Twitter}.

Both sides ``emphasized that the release of the remaining prisoners are
essential for commencement of intra-Afghan negotiations,'' Mr. Shaheen
said.

The U.S.-Taliban deal called for the Afghan government to free 5,000
Taliban prisoners in exchange for 1,000 Taliban-held members of the
Afghan security forces. While the Taliban has released the Afghan
prisoners, Afghanistan's president, Ashraf Ghani, has been reluctant to
release 400 Taliban prisoners accused of serious crimes.

On Sunday, militants stormed a prison in eastern Afghanistan, leaving 29
people dead. The attack, in the waning hours of a brief cease-fire
between the Taliban and the Afghan government, was claimed by the
Islamic State affiliate in the country.
