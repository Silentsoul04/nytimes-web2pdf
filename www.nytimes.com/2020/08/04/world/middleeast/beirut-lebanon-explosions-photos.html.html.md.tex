that ripped through

Lebanon's capital, on Tuesday evening killed more than 100 people and
wounded thousands of others. The second, much larger blast devastated a
wide area, knocking people down, overturning cars and enveloping much of
the central city in dust and smoke. Windows miles away were blown out,
leaving streets looking like they had been ``cobbled in glass,''
according to a resident.

The injured, who numbered more than 4,000, were soon streaming into
local hospitals. Many arrived on foot or carried by others, with the
streets impassable to cars and ambulance services overwhelmed. The
damage to St. George Hospital, one of the city's biggest, was so severe
that it had to shut down and send patients elsewhere. ``Every floor of
the hospital is damaged,'' said Dr. Peter Noun, its chief of pediatric
hematology and oncology. ``I didn't see this even during the war. It's a
catastrophe.''

The
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-what-happened.html}{cause
appeared to be the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium
nitrate}, a chemical used in fertilizer and bombs. Officials said it had
been stored in a port warehouse since 2014, when it was confiscated from
a cargo ship. As of Tuesday night, the possibility of a deliberate
attack had not been ruled out, but Prime Minister Hassan Diab hinted
that neglect had led to the blast.

Lebanon's government had already been facing large protests over an
economic collapse, mismanagement and corruption. ``Those responsible
will pay a price for this catastrophe,'' Mr. Diab said. ``This is a
promise to the martyrs and wounded people. This is a national
commitment.''

The destruction stirred memories of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war and its
aftermath. For all its economic and other woes, Beirut had been
relatively peaceful in recent years.
