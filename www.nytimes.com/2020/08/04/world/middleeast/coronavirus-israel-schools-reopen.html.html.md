JERUSALEM — As the United States and other countries anxiously consider
how to reopen schools, Israel, one of the first countries to do so,
illustrates the dangers of moving too precipitously.

Confident it had beaten the coronavirus and desperate to reboot a
devastated economy, the Israeli government invited the entire student
body back in late May.

Within days, infections were reported at a Jerusalem high school, which
quickly mushroomed into the largest outbreak in a single school in
Israel, possibly the world.

The virus rippled out to the students’ homes and then to other schools
and neighborhoods, ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers
and relatives.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Other outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close. Across the country,
tens of thousands of students and teachers were quarantined.

Israel’s advice for other countries?

“They definitely should not do what we have done,” said Eli Waxman, a
professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and chairman of the team
advising Israel’s National Security Council on the pandemic. “It was a
major failure.”

The lesson, experts say, is that even communities that have gotten the
spread of the virus under control need to take strict precautions when
reopening schools. Smaller classes, mask wearing, keeping desks six feet
apart and providing adequate ventilation, they say, are likely to be
crucial until a vaccine is available.

“If there is a low number of cases, there is an illusion that the
disease is over,” said Dr. Hagai Levine, a professor of epidemiology at
Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health. “But it’s a complete
illusion.”

“The mistake in Israel,” he said, “is that you can open the education
system, but you have to do it gradually, with certain limits, and you
have to do it in a very careful way.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The United States is facing similar pressures to fully reopen schools,
and President Trump has threatened to withhold funding for districts
that don’t reopen. But the U.S. is in a far worse position than Israel
was in May: Israel had fewer than 100 new infections a day then. The
U.S. is now averaging more than 60,000 new cases a day, and some states
continue to set alarming records.

Israel’s handling of the pandemic was considered successful at first.
The country of nine million quickly closed its borders, shuttered
schools in mid-March and introduced remote learning for its two million
students. In April,
[Passover](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/middleeast/coronavirus-passover-israel.html?searchResultPosition=1)
and
[Ramadan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/world/middleeast/ramadan-coronavirus-al-aqsa.html?searchResultPosition=1)
were celebrated under lockdown.

By early May, infection rates had fallen from more than 750 confirmed
cases a day to double digits. The youngest students, grades three and
under, and older students taking final exams returned in small groups,
splitting the week to take turns using classrooms.

Then, emboldened by the dropping infection rates, the government
completely reopened schools on May 17, the day a new government was
sworn
in.

In his inaugural speech, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [promised a
new
budget](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gantz-government.html)
that would deliver three things: “Jobs, jobs, jobs.” His new education
minister, Yoav Gallant,
[said](https://www.facebook.com/YoavGallant/photos/a.621695154643450/2149523848527232/?type=3&theater)
that the school system’s “immediate mission” was to allow parents to
return to work with peace of mind.

Inna Zaltsman, an Education Ministry official, said administrators also
wanted “to return the children to routine as much as possible, for their
emotional and pedagogic well-being.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shopping malls, outdoor markets and gyms had already reopened, and soon
houses of worship, restaurants, bars, hotels and wedding halls did too.
Mr. Netanyahu told Israelis to grab a beer and, while taking
precautions, “Go out and have a good time.”

In hindsight, that advice [was wildly
premature](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/middleeast/israel-virus-protests-netanyahu.html?searchResultPosition=2).

That same day, a mother phoned a teacher at Jerusalem’s historic
Gymnasia Ha’ivrit high school. Her son, a seventh-grade student there,
had tested positive for the virus.

By the next day, the school confirmed another case in the ninth grade.
Ultimately, Israeli officials said, 154 students and 26 staff members
were found to be
infected.

“There was a general euphoria among the public, a sense that we had
dealt with the first wave well and that it was behind us,” said Danniel
Leibovitch, Gymnasia’s principal. “Of course, that wasn’t true.”

The Education Ministry had issued safety instructions: Masks were to be
worn by students in fourth grade and higher, windows kept open, hands
washed frequently and students kept six feet apart whenever possible.

But in many Israeli schools, where up to 38 children squeeze into
classrooms of about 500 square feet, physical distancing proved
impossible.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Unable to comply with the rules, some local authorities ignored them or
simply decided not to reopen at full capacity.

Then a heat wave hit. Parents complained that it was inhumane to make
children wear masks in steaming classrooms where open windows nullified
the air conditioning.

In response, the government exempted everyone from wearing masks for
four days, and schools shut the windows.

That decision proved disastrous, experts say.

“Instead of canceling school in those days, they just told the kids ‘OK,
well you have to stay in the class with the air conditioning on and take
your masks off,’ so you have no ventilation really,” said Dr. Ronit
Calderon-Margalit, a professor of epidemiology at Hebrew
University-Hadassah Braun School of Public Health. “You have the ideal
circumstances for an outbreak.”

The Gymnasia became a petri dish for
Covid-19.

When the first case was discovered, the student’s classmates, teachers
and other contacts were quarantined. After the second case, which was
not directly linked to the first, the school was closed and everyone was
instructed to quarantine for two weeks. All students and staff were
tested, often waiting in line for hours.

About [60 percent of infected students were
asymptomatic](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.29.2001352?mc_source=MTExMDY2Ojo6OTgxM2NkZDM4OGRjNGFlM2JhY2RhNWIyZTNlODhkOTE6OnYzOjoxNTk2NDc1MjIzOjox#html_fulltext).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Mr. Leibovitch, the principal, said he had no knowledge of any teacher
coming in with symptoms.

Seeking to contain the contagion, the Education Ministry vowed to shut
any school with even one Covid-19 case. It ultimately closed more than
240 schools and quarantined more than 22,520 teachers and students.

When the school year ended in late June, the ministry said, 977 pupils
and teachers had contracted Covid-19.

But the Health Ministry, lacking the infrastructure and resources, did
not make contact tracing a priority. In the Gymnasia case, Professor
Waxman said, nobody even identified which buses the students had ridden
on to school.

Proms were canceled, but graduating seniors in the central city of
Ra’anana held an underground prom party anyway. Dozens contracted the
virus.

Outside school walls, the coronavirus returned with a vengeance. Covid
wards that had closed with festive ceremonies in late April began
filling again, with confirmed infections spiraling to about 800 a day by
late June and more than 2,000 a day by late July.

Some blamed the hasty school reopening as a major factor in the second
wave. Siegal Sadetzki, who [resigned in
frustration](https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-health-ministry-official-quits-warns-israel-heading-down-dangerous-path/)
last month as Israel’s director of public health services, wrote that
insufficient safety precautions in schools, as well as large gatherings
like weddings, fueled a “significant portion” of second-wave infections.

But others said singling out schools was unfair when the real problem
was that everything reopened too quickly.

“The single super-spreader event in the Gymnasia just happened to be in
a school,” said Dr. Ran Balicer, an Israeli health care official and
adviser to the prime minister on the pandemic. “It could have happened
in any other setting.”

Now Israel is confronting the same questions as other countries, trying
to learn from its mistakes in planning for the school year that begins
Sept. 1.

Public health experts worldwide have coalesced around a set of
guidelines for reopening schools.

A major recommendation is to create groups of 10 to 15 students who stay
together in classrooms, at recess and lunchtime, with teachers assigned
to only one group. Each group has minimal contact with other groups,
limiting any spread of infection. And if a case of Covid-19 emerges, one
group can be quarantined at home while others can continue at school.

Other key recommendations include staggering schedules or teaching older
students online, keeping desks several feet apart, sanitizing classrooms
more frequently, providing ventilation and opening windows if possible,
and requiring masks for staff and students old enough to wear them
properly.

Israel has already moved in that direction.

The government recently appointed a coronavirus czar, Dr. Ronni Gamzu,
who transferred responsibility for virus testing and investigation from
the Health Ministry to the military. “This is an operation, not
medicine,” he declared.

On Sunday, the government approved plans for returning only grades two
and lower to school in full-size classes in the fall. Younger children
are less likely to become seriously ill, and some studies have suggested
that they are less likely than adults and teenagers to transmit the
virus to others.

The plans also call for splitting older students into capsules of 18 and
for mostly online instruction for grades five and above. Principals will
have flexibility to adjust their school’s policies based on local
conditions.

Even those measures may not be enough.

Menashe Levy, president of the Israeli High School Principals
Association, arranged desks six feet apart in a standard classroom. It
could accommodate 14 students, not 18.

But Israel is plunging ahead. Only one option has been ruled out:
closing the schools.

“This is a long-term pandemic,” said Dr. Nadav Davidovitch, a pandemic
policy adviser to the government. “We cannot close schools for a year.”

Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Pam Belluck from the United
States.
