# Jimmy Fallon: Trump’s Latest Interview Made His Briefings Look Good

</div>

The “Axios on HBO” interview was “such a disaster, at one point FEMA
showed up and wrapped Trump in a foil blanket,” the “Tonight Show” host
said.

*Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s
highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy.
We’re all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the* [*50 best movies
on Netflix right
now*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/arts/television/best-movies-on-netflix.html)*.*

## ‘Adult Content, Child Language, Brief Stupidity’

With most of late night taking the week off, Jimmy Fallon and Seth
Meyers stayed busy with what President Trump has been up to — notably an
[interview on “Axios on
HBO,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/politics/trump-john-lewis-axios.html)
in which Trump fared poorly under questioning by the Australian reporter
Jonathan Swan. Fallon said it “was so bad it made his coronavirus
briefings look good.”

## The Bits Worth Watching

For his “Really\!?\!” segment, Seth Meyers took on a Norwegian cruise
line that reopened for business, only to shut down after a predictable
Covid-19 outbreak. He got some expert help from the Sea Captain, the
talking painting at his in-laws’ house.
