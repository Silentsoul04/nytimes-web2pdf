OK, people, I know you’re feeling a little wan and helpless these days.
Sure does seem like a long time until November.

So let’s take an early vote and pick Donald Trump’s Worst Cabinet
Member. The competition is intense this year. Some days it feels as if
everybody in the administration is trying to grab the grand prize. That
they’re running around with a list in their pocket titled Things to
Screw Up.

**Vice President** **Mike Pence** has been a faithful hanger-on from Day
1. He’s now doing double duty as Trump’s coronavirus czar. In which
capacity he predicted on April 24 that the epidemic would be “behind us”
by Memorial Day weekend.

[Last season’s
winner](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/trump-cabinet-worst.html),
**Attorney General William Barr,** certainly hasn’t been resting on his
laurels. At a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing, he had to be
prodded twice before acknowledging that presidential candidates aren’t
supposed to accept foreign assistance. When asked if he agreed with
Trump’s [shocking
suggestion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/elections/biden-vs-trump.html)
that a president could move Election Day, Barr said, “I’ve never looked
into it.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Secretary of State Mike Pompeo** came in second-most-awful [last time
around](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/trump-cabinet-worst.html).
Can he make the big leap? He got a boost recently from my colleague Tom
Friedman, who hinted at his opinion in a piece called [“Mike Pompeo Is
the Worst Secretary of State
Ever.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/opinion/mike-pompeo.html)

Nothing like the tried-and-true Trump veterans when it comes to
top-notch terrible. But there’s new talent, too, thanks to all the
shuffling that keeps going on. **Chad Wolf**, **the acting head of
homeland security,** is the [fifth person to lead the
department](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/16/us/politics/all-the-major-firings-and-resignations-in-trump-administration.html)
in the current administration. If he can hang on until after the
election, he’ll have racked up more than a year on the job — a Trump
administration achievement that is no doubt due to all the prior
experience Wolf had [as a travel industry
lobbyist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/how-chad-wolf-became-trumps-favorite-dhs-chief/2020/08/01/221604ec-d45c-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html).

The **postmaster general** is no longer officially in the cabinet, for
reasons way too dense to explain. But we’re going to leave **Louis
DeJoy** in the mix because of his vigorous efforts to wreck the postal
system — a goal that we’re sure has nothing to do with the president’s
hatred of voting by mail. DeJoy’s top qualification for the job appears
to be [more than $2 million in
donations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-republican-fundraiser-and-trump-ally-to-be-named-postmaster-general-giving-president-new-influence-over-postal-service-officials-say/2020/05/06/25cde93c-8fd4-11ea-8df0-ee33c3f5b0d6_story.html)
to Republican causes during the Trump regime.

Did we mention his wife has been nominated to be ambassador to Canada?

The Worst contenders keep on coming: **Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross
Jr.,** [another previous
winner](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/opinion/trump-cabinet-wilbur-ross.html),
has been relatively quiet recently. Literally, since he reportedly keeps
[dozing off at
meetings](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/wilbur-ross-falling-asleep).
The man is 82 — what do you expect? But he’s still plugging away at the
administration’s priorities, like [shutting down the census
count](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/2020-census-ending-early.html)
four weeks early.

**Interior Secretary David Bernhardt** is a former lobbyist for the oil
and gas industries, a résumé you will notice crops up frequently. This
has given him the in-depth understanding that allowed him to take a lead
in the administration’s massive financial [relief package for oil and
gas
companies](https://readsludge.com/2020/07/15/trump-admin-bails-out-oil-and-gas-companies-that-gave-millions-to-gop-groups/).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bernhardt also seems to have been one of the central administration
players in the drama of Lafayette Square, when protesters were [ejected
by military
police](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/floyd-protests-live.html)
to make way for Trump and his Bible.

But he’s not volunteering any information. “The Babe Ruth of
stonewalling,” said Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon who’s
been following Bernhardt’s career for a long time. Bernhardt traveled
recently to Wyden’s home state where he met with Native American tribes
— and [refused, Wyden noted, to wear a
mask](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/508803-democrats-bernhardt-refusing-mask-meeting-tribes-oregon).

If you’re into the environment and want another option, there’s **E.P.A.
head Andrew Wheeler**, a former lobbyist for — wait for it — energy
companies. His latest crusade is [extending the
life](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/509792-epa-rule-extends-life-of-toxic-coal-ash-ponds)
of gigantic pits of coal sludge.

Or how about **U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer?** He’s not
in the news as much as some of the others, but we’ll always remember
[his speech defending Trump’s China
wars](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3092578/us-negotiator-robert-lighthizer-says-i-dont-know),
revealing, “I don’t know what the end goal is.”

More\! How about h**ealth and human services head Alex Azar**? He’s been
on the job a couple of years now, which by Trump standards makes him a
hardened veteran. When he’s not busy failing to respond to the pandemic,
one of his other missions is overseeing the administration’s attempts to
gut the Affordable Care Act and replace it with … [some other
thing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-28/azar-suggests-no-obamacare-replacement-plan-before-election?sref=Q23PdzcT).

You don’t have to reward splashy bad behavior if you prefer the more
modest figures who prefer to screw everything up from behind the scenes.
Like **Education Secretary Betsy DeVos**, whose [standing in the Worst
poll
soared](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/opinion/betsy-devos-trump-worst-cabinet-member.html)
when people realized they had a secretary of education who didn’t like
public schools.

**Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao** may not have done much for
infrastructure, but she sure is connected. Wife of Mitch McConnell, Chao
is also a member of a wealthy and powerful family that’s [deeply into
shipping
contracts](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/us/politics/elaine-chao-china.html).
That [got up to $1
million](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/07/firm-run-elaine-chao-and-mitch-mcconnells-family-got-federal-ppp-loan/5390273002/)
from our government’s recession-fighting Paycheck Protection Program.

So — who’s your favorite? Send me a Worst Cabinet Member pick in the
comments. Voting’s open until midnight Eastern time on Sunday, and we’ll
announce the winners next week.
