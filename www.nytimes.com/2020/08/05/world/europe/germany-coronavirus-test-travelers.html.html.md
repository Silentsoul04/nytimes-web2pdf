BERLIN — When she returned to Germany last week from a vacation in
Serbia, one of the first things Snjezana Kirstein did was to stop at a
pop-up coronavirus testing center at Berlin’s Tegel Aiport.

Whereas such tests can be hard to find in the United States, with
[unpredictable
costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/upshot/coronavirus-tests-unpredictable-prices.html)
and results two weeks in coming, Ms. Kirstein was on her way in a matter
of minutes after having her nose and throat swabbed. She expected an
answer in 24 to 48 hours. The test was not only swift, it was free.

“I think it is super,” Ms. Kirstein said. “It was so easy to find, and
best of all, it didn’t cost me a thing.”

As of Saturday, Germany will require that same simple test for all
citizens or residents, like Ms. Kirstein, and other travelers who enter
the country from coronavirus “hot spots,” again making it a leader in
using testing as a firewall against the spread of the virus.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I am very aware that this is an intrusion in personal freedom,” Jens
Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said at a news conference Thursday.
“But freedom always comes with responsibility for myself and for
others.”

As Europe reopens, cases have begun ticking up nearly everywhere, to a
greater or lesser extent, leaving countries in a constant, seesaw battle
to tamp down outbreaks before they undo months of hard-won progress made
during costly lockdowns this spring.

Germany is no exception. This week it recorded 1,045 new coronavirus
infections in a single day, part of a rising trend that has begun to
worry officials as people return from trips abroad during the summer
vacation season.

One of the biggest concerns in Germany and across the continent is that
travelers will carry the virus with them. Until now, Germany, like other
countries, has relied on quarantining newly arriving travelers. But such
measures are not always enforced, or strictly followed.

Since the start of the pandemic, Germany has made [testing a primary
tool in its
battle](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/world/europe/with-broad-random-tests-for-antibodies-germany-seeks-path-out-of-lockdown.html?searchResultPosition=29)
against the virus. Now it is turning to that approach again to head off
a potential second wave of infections. Its capacity to make testing
efficient, affordable and available has distinguished it among
industrialized nations.

In January, doctors at the Charité research hospital in Berlin developed
one of the world’s first diagnostic tests for the new coronavirus. They
quickly made it available to the country’s public hospitals and research
laboratories, as well as a nationwide network of about 200 privately
owned labs. Everyone focused on making test kits.

The World Health Organization later approved the kits and distributed
instructions for developing them worldwide. At that time, the [Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention were still
struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html)
to develop test kits in the United States.

While nearly 90 percent of Germany’s population of 83 million is covered
by public insurance, people can also opt for private insurance that
either competes with the public system, or provides top-up coverage.

By May, the German authorities required all insurance companies to cover
the cost of testing. Initially it was limited to those with symptoms,
but today it is available to just about everyone, with the government
agreeing to help cover the costs.

“We have had a very important principle since the beginning of the
pandemic — that testing in Germany is not a question of money,” Mr.
Spahn<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>said. “That is a big
difference to many other countries that have failed to test enough over
many months.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Early on, the government also ordered hospitals and labs to reduce all
but necessary treatments to free resources to process coronavirus tests,
earmarking millions to support the effort and ensuring speedy results.

These measures allowed Germany to ramp up testing at a pace that
prevented the country’s hospitals — well equipped in any case, with one
of the world’s highest ratios of intensive care beds per capita and a
centralized system to transfer patients between them — from becoming
overwhelmed.

By March, Germany was one of the highest testers per capita in the
world. Other countries have since overtaken it, in part because Germany
has been so effective in targeting tests and following up on positive
results to isolate those infected and shut down chains of infection
before they get out of control.

So while Germany can carry out as many as 1.2 million tests per week,
according the health ministry, it is only currently testing half that
many people. That gives it the bandwidth to easily expand testing to
incoming travelers, while still maintaining readiness should a big
second wave arrive.

The United States has a capacity of 4.5 million tests per week,
according to the Rockefeller Foundation, but its population is also
roughly four times the size of Germany's, and results can take five to
14 days.

The United States also lacks comprehensive contract-tracing, another
factor that has left it struggling to contain the spread of the virus.
Germany has had fewer than 10,000 deaths attributed to the virus, the
United States more than 150,000.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Those awaiting test results in Germany are required to self-quarantine,
and are released from the obligation immediately if the result is
negative. They must also leave contact information in case they have a
positive result and need to be traced.

The speed of the results, then, is critical to the containment effort.
People are more likely to abide isolation for two days than for two
weeks, and even if they don’t they still have less time to [wander
around and potentially expose
others](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/rand-paul-coronavirus-test-reckless/608593/).
Germany’s shorter turnaround also reduces the time that healthy people
are taken out of productive roles in society.

Those who refuse a test must remain in quarantine for two weeks, unless
they can provide a negative test less than 72 hours old. Under current
E.U. travel restrictions, foreigners from outside the bloc are allowed
to enter the country only if they have the right to live and work in
Germany, with few exceptions.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Germany’s wide availability of testing has not made everyone happy,
however, and not all agree on the benefits.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen

        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),

        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

Some experts warn that it could overwhelm laboratories and threaten the
country’s readiness to deal with a resurgence of the virus when colder
temperatures push people back indoors.

“It is questionable whether the general testing of travel returnees
offers an appropriate balance between benefit and expense,” said Dr.
Michael Müller, head of the Association of Medical Labs, which
represents more than 200 labs across the country.

Others have questioned whether it is fair to saddle taxpayers with the
burden of paying for the tests for those who willingly risk traveling
outside Europe, despite warnings by government health authorities.

The requirement for travelers includes those coming from [130
countries](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikogebiete_neu.html)
and regions, including the United States and three districts in Spain,
which the German authorities consider high-risk for spread of the virus.

But Mr. Spahn rejected the idea that only the wealthy were traveling,
citing people with families in Turkey or elsewhere in Europe whom they
visited.

“I know the saying, ‘Whoever can afford a ski trip can pay for their
broken leg,’ but when you think that idea through, then especially in a
pandemic, it compromises solidarity in society,” Mr. Spahn said. “So
testing will remain cost-free.”

While Germans are normally quick to decry any encroachment on their
personal privacy, the threat of the virus returning appears to frighten
them more, and there has been little pushback to the proposed
requirement for travelers.

On the second day after a testing station was set up at Tegel Airport,
dozens of people pushing luggage trolleys stacked with suitcases or
young children in strollers waited patiently for their turn to submit a
voluntary test.

“It is an unbelievable hassle to set it up and organize it, but if it
gives passengers back a sense of security when traveling, then it is
worth it,” said Hannes Stefan Hönemann, spokesman for the airport’s
operator.

The requirement for travelers include those coming over land as well if
they have visited a hot zone. Health authorities in the southern state
of Bavaria, the gateway for people returning by car from vacations on
the Mediterranean coasts, set up test centers at three highway rest
stops near the border, as well as at airports and major train stations.

Over the weekend, before the requirement went into effect this week,
about 18,000 people were tested voluntarily, they said.

Bavaria made free testing available to all residents on July 1. The
government invested 200 million euros, about $235 million, to expand
laboratory capacity, both public and private, as well as personnel and
working hours. Today it has the capacity for about 27,000 tests a day,
state health minister, Melanie Huml, said.

“Test, test, test is the name of the game in Bavaria,” she said. “Our
goal is to recognize infections as quickly as possible to stop chains of
infection as early as early as possible.”

She estimates they can test as many as 2,000 travelers each day, the
same capacity as expected in Berlin’s airports. Those who test positive
will be alerted immediately, as will the public local health office, so
it can follow up on care and contact tracing.

“Corona is not over and does not forgive any lack of vigilance,” Ms.
Huml said. “We have to be careful to prevent a second wave from creeping
up on us.”
