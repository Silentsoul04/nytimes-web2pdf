A pair of explosions, the second much bigger than the first, struck the
city of Beirut early Tuesday evening, killing at least 100 people,
wounding more than 4,000 and causing widespread damage.

The second blast sent a billowing, reddish plume high above the city’s
port and created a shock wave that shattered glass for miles. On
Wednesday morning, despite a huge search operation, dozens were still
missing in the city, the capital of Lebanon on the eastern coast of the
Mediterranean Sea.

As the authorities piece together what happened, here is a look at what
we know and what we don’t.

## What caused the explosions?

The exact cause remains undetermined. The first blast may have been in a
fireworks warehouse at the port. Officials say the second, more
devastating explosion most likely came from a nearby 2,750-ton stockpile
of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical often used as
fertilizer, which Prime Minister Hassan Diab said had been stored in a
depot for six years.

Investigators will try to determine whether the blasts were accidents or
intentionally triggered. Beirut was engulfed in civil war from 1975 to
1990 and has seen bombings and conflict since then, raising fears of a
possible return of violence. But Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, the head of
Lebanon’s general security service, warned against speculating about
terrorism before the facts were known.

## Where did it happen?

The blasts caused severe damage to buildings, warehouses and grain silos
in the port, in the north of the city. Beyond the industrial waterfront,
the explosions tore through popular nightlife and shopping districts and
densely populated neighborhoods. [More than 750,000 people live in the
parts of the city that were
damaged](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-damage.html).

Even before the explosions, Lebanon had been suffering from a series of
crises, [including the plunging value of its
currency](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/world/middleeast/lebanon-protests.html),
an influx of refugees from neighboring Syria and the coronavirus
pandemic. Since last fall, waves of protesters have taken to the streets
to vent anger with Lebanon’s political elite over what they consider the
mismanagement of the country.

## How big were the blasts?

The second explosion was like an earthquake, witnesses said, and was
felt in Cyprus, more than 100 miles away.

Ammonium nitrate explosions have caused a number of disasters. A ship
carrying about 2,000 tons of the compound caught fire and exploded in
Texas City, Texas, in 1947, killing 581 people. About two tons of the
chemical were used in the 1995 terrorist bombing of the federal building
in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people.

## How bad was the damage?

Ceilings collapsed, walls and windows were blown out and debris was
found far as two miles from the port. Cars were flipped, and rubble from
shattered buildings filled city streets.

Several hospitals, already strained from the coronavirus pandemic, were
severely damaged. At the Bikhazi Medical Group hospital in the center of
the city, a ceiling fell on some patients, the hospital director said.

The 400-bed St. George Hospital was so extensively damaged that it had
to discharge patients and close.
