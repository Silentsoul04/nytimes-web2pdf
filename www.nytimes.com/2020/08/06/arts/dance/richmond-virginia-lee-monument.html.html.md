# In Richmond, Black Dance Claims a Space Near Robert E. Lee

Black dancers, musicians and artists have invigorated what had long been
considered a whites-only space.

RICHMOND, Va. — Janine Bell lived in Richmond for 35 years without
visiting Monument Avenue. But that changed in July, when Ms. Bell threw
a gathering honoring Emmett Till under the shadow of a statue of Robert
E. Lee.

Standing at the base of the three-story pedestal supporting the
Confederate general’s likeness, Ms. Bell, the artistic director of the
Elegba Folklore Society, welcomed a small sea of drummers, dancers and
bystanders banging on plastic buckets to an event she called the
Reclamation Drum Circle.

“We are not playing today,” she said, and invited all present to move
and sway to the music. And so began an extended jam session at a park
long considered a whites-only space. The drum circle, held on what would
have been Emmett Till’s 79th birthday, was the latest in a series of
dance happenings — some spontaneous, some thoughtfully choreographed —
drawing Black dancers to the Lee statue.

“My grandfather never could have imagined this,” a sweaty Lito Raymondo
said after performing a solo in the circle’s center. “This is a
revelation.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The gathering united a disparate group of dancers: community organizers
who take African dance classes, modern dancers and self-taught dancers
like Mr. Raymondo, whose style fuses African, hip-hop and the martial
arts. He said he regularly comes out to “do his part” with the Folklore
Society, a group that promotes African culture in a city with a robust
Black dance community.

The festivities have been going on since early June, when Richmond’s
mayor and Virginia’s governor vowed to take down the huge statues of
Civil War leaders erected along Monument Avenue. Four of those statues
are now being stored at the city’s wastewater treatment plant. But
multiple lawsuits and court injunctions have prevented the bronze Robert
E. Lee and his horse Traveler from joining them.

While the judges deliberate, Black artists and residents have been
invigorating the space. “Whether it’s Black people playing basketball or
musicians or dancers, life is happening,” Ms. Bell said. “And when life
happens, there is optimism for the future.”

Some dancers go to make political statements; some want memorable
photos. Maggie Small, a longtime star of Richmond Ballet, said dancers
were drawn to the general’s shadow because they are living in a time
when “articulating your thoughts with words” could be overwhelming. So
they are using the vocabulary they have, because “dance is a universal
form of communication, of expression and of catharsis.”

It was a dance moment that went viral: Photos of two young dancers, Ava
Holloway and Kennedy George, both 14, turned out and on their toes, each
raising a fist against the backdrop of the statue’s graffiti-covered
pedestal. Among those who reposted on Instagram: Beyoncé’s mother. “This
is art,” the Black activist and author Shaun King said in an Instagram
post, accompanied by a fire emoji.

Ms. Holloway and Ms. George, who study at the Central Virginia Dance
Academy, had run into each other while posing at the monument for family
photos. At the request of Marcus Ingram, a photographer in Richmond,
they returned to the statue the next day, on June 5, for a more formal
shoot, which was also captured by a freelance photojournalist.

The girls became famous beyond the James River, accepting appearance
requests from, among others, the “Today" Show and a John Legend music
video. Both said they remain crushed that they had to miss out on their
eighth grade graduations, final dance competitions and spring recitals.
Instead they got horrible blisters from running barefoot on asphalt
while “Today” show cameras rolled. (“I thought I’d never dance again,”
Ms. George said, pulling out her phone to display a photo of a giant
purple welt on her foot.)

They said they understood why pictures of them balancing on point became
symbols of the Black Lives Matter movement, and why other dancers want
to be photographed at the site. The words scrawled on the monument
reflect a world “that is tough and hard and scary,” Ms. George said.
“But it’s reality, and people have to deal with it.”

Among the copycats who have won their approval: Morgan Bullock, a
20-year-old Richmonder who does Irish dance, and who last year became
one of the first Black dancers to finish in the top 50 at the World
Irish Dance Championships. The Guardian photographed Ms. Bullock jumping
off the Lee statue’s pedestal, arms at her side and hair flying, her
white blouse and billowy leggings in sharp contrast to the colorful
expletives graffitied on the plinth behind her.

“She is the very definition of an angel,” Ms. George said. Ms. Holloway
added, “It’s like she’s floating.”

When Ira Lunetter White, a dancer in Richmond Ballet, visited the
statue, he wore a white T-shirt and black pants, similar to the classic
uniform of a male dancer in a [“black-and-white” ballet by George
Balanchine](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/arts/design/new-york-city-ballets-balanchine-black-and-white.html),
the founding choreographer of New York City Ballet. Mr. White, who has
performed several of those works in Richmond, traversed the statue
platform adopting signature Balanchine positions. He and the
photographer Meghan McSweeney called their series “Ode to Arthur
Mitchell,” in honor of [City Ballet’s first Black principal
dancer](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/arts/design/new-york-city-ballets-balanchine-black-and-white.html).

In one of Ms. McSweeney’s favorite images, the words “Uplift Black
Voices” appear beneath Mr. White’s feet. “That is literally what Ira has
been trying to do his entire life,” she said. Mr. White, 27, was
introduced to dance through Minds in Motion, a program that sends
Richmond Ballet ambassadors into fourth-grade classrooms. He’s now in
his sixth season with the senior company, one of five dancers of color
out of 17. He’s always been fortunate, he said, to have Black mentors
and colleagues, but recognizes that in ballet beyond Richmond that’s not
always the case.

“Now is when we need more voices, more faces being seen and being
heard,” he said.

Chief among local role models is Ms. Small, a biracial dancer who became
Richmond Ballet’s first Black Clara in “The Nutcracker” 23 years ago,
and went on to have a long career with the company.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Small retired from Richmond Ballet last year, at 34, and now serves
as the company’s grant writer. Last fall she sent out an email offering
to visit Virginia dance studios as a master class teacher, and was
shocked when every single school said yes. “So much for finally having
weekends off,” she said, with a laugh.

A critically lauded dancer who landed on the cover of Dance Magazine,
Ms. Small never made race her calling card. “There is not a single
narrative to capture what it is to be a Black dancer,” she said. “I was
homegrown; that was my narrative.”

It’s wrong, Ms. Small said, to assume that the Black dancers at regional
companies remain there because they aren’t good enough for bigger
companies in New York or Europe. Over summers Ms. Small made it a point
to seek out-of-town opportunities, including at the National
Choreographer’s Initiative in California and with Jessica Lang Dance in
New York, but always came out thinking, “Richmond was the place that fed
my soul,” she said. “I felt comfortable to be the dancer I wanted to
be.”

And it’s not lost on her that in this particular moment of history,
dancers from her hometown have become symbols of a national movement.
Ms. George and Ms. Holloway, both honors students, aren’t sure yet if
they’ll pursue professional careers in dance. But they are proud to
train at a supportive, diverse studio in a city that elevates Black
dancers.

“Richmond,” Ms. Holloway said, shaking her head. “If Richmond can do it,
in our city of Confederate statues, than any other city can, too.”
