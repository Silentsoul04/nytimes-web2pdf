# For Three Suffragists, a Monument Well Past Due

Across the country, monuments honoring racist figures are being defaced
and toppled. In New York’s Central Park, one statue is taking shape that
aims to amend not only racial but also gender disparities in public art:
A 14-foot-tall bronze monument of Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth and
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, three of the more prominent leaders in the
nationwide fight for women’s right to vote.

Called the Women’s Rights Pioneers Monument, it is to be unveiled Aug.
26 to commemorate the 100th anniversary this month of the constitutional
amendment that finally guaranteed women that right. The sculpture
depicts the three figures gathered around a table for what seems to be a
discussion or a strategy meeting. Anthony stands in the middle, holding
a pamphlet that reads “Votes for Women”; Stanton, seated to her left,
holds a pen, presumably taking notes; and Truth appears to be in
midsentence.

“I wanted to show women working together,” said [Meredith
Bergmann](https://monumentalwomen.org/sculptors-page/), the sculptor
chosen from dozens of artists to create the statue. “I kept thinking of
women now, working together in some kitchen on a laptop, trying to
change the world.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It will be the park’s first — and only — monument honoring real women,
located on Literary Walk. In its 167-year history, the park has been a
leafy, lush home to about two dozen statues of men, mostly white, and
fictional or mythical female characters (Alice in Wonderland,
Shakespeare’s Juliet, and [the Angel of the Waters, the winged woman
atop Bethesda
Fountain](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/obituaries/emma-stebbins-overlooked.html))
but no historical women.

New York City as a whole hasn’t been very inclusive either: Of the 150
statues honoring historical figures, only [five depict
women](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/nyregion/women-statues-nyc.html),
according to [She Built NYC](https://women.nyc/she-built-nyc/), the
city’s official campaign, started last year, to increase female
representation in public art. And in 2011, just over seven percent of
the nearly 5,200 public outdoor statues across the country represented
women, according to the [Smithsonian American Art Museum’s Art
Inventories Catalog](https://americanart.si.edu/research/inventories).

“The fact that nobody, for a long time, even noticed that women were
missing in Central Park — what does that say about the invisibility of
women?” said Pam Elam, president of Monumental Women. “There is a
responsibility to not only create a beautiful work of art but to have
that art reflect the reality of the lives of all the people who see it.”

In 2014, a group of volunteers created Monumental Women (initially
called the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Statue Fund
Inc.), a nonprofit with a mission of campaigning and raising funds for
the suffragist statue in Central Park. Though the journey from concept
to creation ended up being a long and winding one, filled with
criticisms and setbacks.

Ms. Bergmann said it was “pretty humbling” to be making such a
monumental work, adding that every single creative decision was
carefully considered.

In the research phase, Ms. Bergmann, who in 2003 created the [Boston
Women’s
Memorial](https://www.boston.gov/departments/womens-advancement/boston-womens-memorial),
featuring Abigail Adams, Phillis Wheatley and Lucy Stone, read a lot,
she said, and spoke to Stanton’s great-great-granddaughter, [Coline
Jenkins-Sahlin](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/style/woman-suffrage-movement-descend.html),
for more insight.

She then spent months creating clay models of the monument, getting them
approved and then creating various different molds for the molten metal.

For their faces, she drew from multiple sources. “I never copy a
photograph,” she said, “but I take all the photographs available and
study them and try to come up with a face that will express more than
one moment in the life of this person, with hints of their youthful
face, their old face, their angry face and their happy face.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Their outfits carry Easter eggs — symbols and clues that speak to the
social context or their personalities, Ms. Bergmann explained.
[Sunflower
motifs](https://www.nps.gov/articles/symbols-of-the-women-s-suffrage-movement.htm)
are carved into Stanton’s dress because she had used the pseudonym
Sunflower when writing editorials for The Lily newspaper in Seneca
Falls, N.Y., Ms. Bergmann said. Anthony has a cameo around her neck
depicting Minerva — the Roman goddess of strategy and wisdom. Truth
wears her signature shawl — the tassels appear to be blowing in the wind
— and a striped brocade jacket with laurel wreaths woven in to symbolize
victory and honor.

That they are all attired in long skirts and dresses is significant too.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, women fighting for social
reforms — including Stanton — adopted what came to be known as [the
“Bloomer
costume,](https://www.nytimes.com/1939/12/31/archives/bloomer-and-she-was-a-feminist-not-a-fashion-designee.html)”
knee-length dresses worn over trousers, which offered freedom and
respite from the more constricting corsets and floor-length dresses that
were standard at the time.

“Stanton once said how wonderful it was to be able to climb a flight of
stairs holding a baby in one arm and a candle in the other without
having to hold up 10 pounds of wool skirt and petticoats,” Bergmann
noted.

But the outfits were such radical departures from the norm that they
invited [intense
mockery](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/american-suffragists-bloomers-pants-history/591484/)
and distracted from broader conversations about women’s rights, so the
suffrage fighters gave them up. Ms. Bergmann said this informed her own
choice to have the statues in voluminous skirts.

Though the campaign to install the statue took more than six years
(seven if you include the months of discussions that took place before
the nonprofit was formed), Monumental Women selected Ms. Bergmann’s
design in 2018, giving the artist two years — a short time in the
sculpting world, she noted — to bring the suffragists to life.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The proposal that was approved consisted of Anthony and Stanton, and a
long scroll cascading from their work desk containing quotations from
more than 20 other suffragists.

“The initial commission was to create statues of these two women,” Ms.
Bergmann explained, and the scroll, which included quotations from 11
women of color (including the educator [Anna Julia
Cooper](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anna-julia-cooper/) and the
journalist [Ida B.
Wells](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked-ida-b-wells.html)),
was a way to also recognize the many other suffragists of the movement.

The original callout for the commission noted that the sculpture should
“honor the memory of others, besides Stanton and Anthony, who helped
advance the cause of woman suffrage over the 72 -year battle.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But when the city’s Public Design Commission approved Ms. Bergmann’s
design last March, it wanted her to nix the scroll and just focus on
Anthony and Stanton, Ms. Elam said. The design was also heavily
[criticized for placing only white
women](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/nyregion/is-a-planned-monument-to-womens-rights-racist.html)
on the pedestal — essentially continuing the [erasure of Black women’s
contributions to the suffrage
movement](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/opinion/central-park-suffrage-monument-racism.html).

“Everything about this,” Ms. Elam said, “was not easy. It started with
the parks department, then it went to the Central Park Conservancy, then
the public design commission, then the Landmarks Preservation Commission
and all the community boards that surround Central Park. It shouldn’t
have been so hard.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last August, in the wake of the controversy, Monumental Women shifted
gears and decided to include a third figure — Truth, the
African-American abolitionist and suffragist. The commission approved
the new design in October, giving Ms. Bergmann less than a year to
create the reimagined sculpture. So far the group said they have raised
a total of $1.5 million for the statue, including a combined $135,000 in
funding from the Manhattan borough president, Gale Brewer, and
Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal.

The city’s Public Design Commission declined to comment for this
article.

When Monumental Women unveils the statue later this month (in a ceremony
at 8 a.m. on Aug. 26 that can be streamed at
[monumentalwomen.org](http://monumentalwomen.org/)), the organization
said it plans to issue a challenge to municipalities all over the
country to include more women and people of color in their public
spaces. Part of the nonprofit’s mission is to help other communities
navigate the kind of red tape and bureaucratic hurdles that they
encountered. The nonprofit will also kick off an online educational
campaign and has proposed providing books on women’s history to all of
New York City’s public school libraries.

“For the people who might think ‘OK, you’ve broken the bronze ceiling,
good for you, now your work is done’ — no, absolutely not, we are here
to stay,” Ms. Elam said.
