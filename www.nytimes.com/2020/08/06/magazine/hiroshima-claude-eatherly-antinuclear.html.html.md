Claude Eatherly spent years punishing himself for his role in the first
atomic bombing. His remorse made him an international celebrity.

***The latest article from “*[*Beyond the World War II We
Know*](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/beyond-wwii)*,” a series from
The Times that documents lesser-known stories from the war, looks at
Claude Eatherly, an American pilot involved in the atomic bombing of
Hiroshima. After years of being arrested for petty crimes, he became a
high-profile antinuclear activist.***

The B-29 bomber banked hard to avoid the blast. The explosion lit the
plane’s interior with a brilliant flash, so bright that some of the
aviators momentarily thought they had been blinded. More than one noted
a strange metallic taste in his mouth. A loud clap broke around them as
the first of three shock waves hit, causing the plane’s aluminum body to
vibrate violently. Looking down, they saw the fireball unfurling.

The American airmen who flew the mission to drop the [atomic bomb on the
Japanese city of
Hiroshima](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/world/asia/hiroshima-japan-75th-anniversary.html)
on Aug. 6, 1945, were witnessing a man-made cataclysm unlike anything
seen in the previous history of human warfare. They watched as fire
swallowed the city whole: “It was like no ordinary fire,” a crew member
later recalled. “It contained a dozen colors, all of them blindingly
bright.” Just when it appeared that the explosion was subsiding, “a kind
of mushroom spurted out of the top and traveled up, up to what some say
was a distance of 60,000 or 70,000 feet.”

The atomic bomb was the most ferociously deadly weapon ever created by
human ingenuity — a technology that multiplied the power of these few
men and planes to a degree out of all comprehensible scale. In Hiroshima
alone, some 70,000 people were killed instantly — a horrific deed fit
for gods or monsters — but overhead in their plane the airmen were
normal men in human bodies, no more able than anyone else to fully
comprehend or bear responsibility for the mission they had been chosen
to execute.

In the ensuing decades, only one of the 90 servicemen who flew the
atomic bombing missions, Maj. Claude Eatherly, came forward to publicly
declare that he felt remorse for what he had done. Eatherly, then an
outgoing 26-year-old Texan, piloted the advance weather plane tasked
with assessing target visibility over Hiroshima, giving the go ahead to
drop the bomb that day. His role in the bombing would haunt him for the
rest of his life.

*for more about World War II.*\]

The discrepancy between the tremendous power of humanity’s inventions
and the limited ability of any single person to comprehend, let alone
control the moral and practical implications of that power, is what
Günther Anders, the postwar German-Jewish philosopher and antinuclear
activist, called “the Promethean gap.” Prometheus is a character from
Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. With
fire, humans were launched on the road to evermore powerful inventions —
a cascade of technological advances that would also unleash new forms of
death, destruction and exploitation. In the Greek myth, the gods
punished Prometheus with eternal torment.

For Anders, the U.S. service members tasked with dropping the atomic
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the prime example of people caught
in the Promethean gap. On the one hand, these U.S. servicemen were cogs
in the atomic machine. They were couriers sent to deliver a deadly
message about U.S. capability and commitment to winning the war. If one
of them were to decline the assignment, someone else would have stepped
up to fill his shoes. Under these circumstances, it was possible to be
“guiltlessly guilty.” On the other hand, as participants in and
witnesses to the violence, these men came closer to connecting with the
physical consequences of and responsibility for their actions than any
others.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Once their initial sense of astonishment subsided, most of the airmen
reconciled themselves to the bombings by focusing on their affiliation
to their fellow American servicemen, whose lives they may have saved by
obviating a need for a ground invasion of Japan. Others simply distanced
themselves from the morality of the decision entirely. Col. Paul Tibbets
Jr., who commanded the Army Air Forces unit tasked with delivering the
atomic bombs and piloted the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima,
defended his actions until his dying days. “I made up my mind then that
the morality of dropping that bomb was not my business,” he told an
interviewer in 1989. “I have never lost a night’s sleep on the deal.”

Unlike Tibbets, Eatherly reported suffering from nightmares about the
bombings, and his guilt drove him into a spiral of self sabotage. In
April 1957, Newsweek ran an article: “Hero in Handcuffs,” which reported
that Eatherly was in a jail cell in Fort Worth after breaking into two
post offices in rural Texas. It described a tattered postwar life:
Eatherly had been in and out of psychiatric treatment at a V.A. hospital
in Waco, had served time in a New Orleans jail for forging a check and
had been involved in a series of stickups at small-town grocery stores.
But his crimes were so poorly executed — at least once he fled the
scene, leaving the money behind — that his psychiatrist and one of his
defense attorneys separately reached the conclusion that Eatherly must
have intended to get caught. At his trial for the post-office
burglaries, Eatherly’s psychiatrist testified that his patient suffered
from a guilt complex stemming above all from his role in the bombing of
Hiroshima. In carrying out these petty crimes, what Eatherly actually
wanted was punishment. A jury found him “not guilty by reason of
insanity” and he was released.

Eatherly’s guilt fascinated Anders because it provided him with a
glimmer of hope for humanity — a path forward for nuclear peace
activists through the Promethean gap. For Eatherly, his dutiful service
and the standard justification that the atomic bombings saved lives by
ending the war, were not enough to quiet his conscience. In 1959, Anders
wrote to Eatherly and they struck up a correspondence. Anders was eager
to co-opt the pilot’s story in the service of generating political will
to eliminate nuclear weapons, casting Eatherly as “a symbol of the
future.” For his part, Eatherly quickly developed the hope that Anders
would provide the platform that he lacked. “Through writers like
yourself,” Eatherly wrote in one of his first letters to Anders,
“someone will … give a message that will influence the world toward a
reconciliation and peace. You may be the man, if I can be of any help to
you, count on me.”

In a 1961 interview with reporter Ronnie Dugger, Eatherly explained that
he was not convinced by the orthodox explanation about the atomic bomb
as a war winning weapon; the Japanese were putting up so little
resistance by early August that Eatherly believed the war would have
ended even without the nuclear devastation. Logically, he knew that if
it had not been him, it would have been someone else to give the go
ahead to drop the bomb. Yet, he still appeared to feel, and suffer
under, the enormity of his role in the atomic bombings. Anders saw in
Eatherly’s behavior a person attempting, in his own way, to be held
accountable for his actions rather than finding ways to disclaim or
reject responsibility.

With Anders’ encouragement, Eatherly sent a message to the people of
Hiroshima. “I told them I was the Major that gave the ‘go ahead’ to
destroy Hiroshima, that I was unable to forget the act, and that the
guilt of the act has caused me great suffering,” Eatherly reported to
Anders. “I asked them to forgive me.” Thirty “girls of Hiroshima,” young
hibakusha, or atomic bomb victims, left alive but scarred by the blast,
responded. “We have learned to feel towards you a fellow-feeling,” they
wrote, “thinking that you are also a victim of war like us.”

By the 1960s, Eatherly became something of a cause célèbre, especially
in war-ravaged Europe and Asia where his remorse fulfilled a deep-seated
desire for compassion. In 1961, Anders published his correspondence with
Eatherly, complete with a preface from renowned British philosopher,
mathematician and antinuclear activist Bertrand Russell. In 1962,
Eatherly was one of four people given “Hiroshima Awards” for
“outstanding contributions to world peace” at a major peace
demonstration in New York. NBC made a TV drama based on his story. The
British papers embraced him as a symbol of antinuclear protest. Poets
described his plight in verse.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The more visible Eatherly became as a symbol of peace and disarmament,
the more heated the debate was about the sincerity of his experiences
and feelings. Journalists wrote detailed books and articles examining
his claims and motives. “Is it possible,” investigative reporter William
Bradford Huie asked in his 1965 book, “The Hiroshima Pilot,” “that
Eatherly feigned guilt to attract attention and perhaps profit?” Instead
of guilt, Huie suggested an inferiority complex. ” The truth,” he
concluded, “seems to be that when Claude Eatherly began evidencing
mental illness and ‘turning to crime’, he was a disappointed and
immature man who thought he had been overlooked. … Instead of being the
Hero of Hiroshima, he was a man who was disappointed at having been left
out of the attack on Hiroshima.” Eatherly himself was silenced by throat
cancer and died in 1978, at the age of 59, in a veterans hospital in
Houston.

We are now living in the 75th year of the atomic age. Eatherly’s
experiences deepen our understanding of the human dimensions of what it
means to undertake enormous acts of wartime violence. His remorse
highlighted the ethical quandary of winning a righteous war that
nevertheless cost such a huge toll in human lives. Passing judgment on
whether he was a hero for speaking out about his suffering, or a
malingerer out to capitalize on his wartime experiences became a way to
stake a claim within the debate about nuclear weapons. Eatherly was
aware of his predicament, and it grew into a larger question on the use
of nuclear weapons that would go on to outlast him and his legacy: “I
have been having such difficulty in getting society to recognize the
fact of my guilt, which I have long since realized,” Eatherly lamented
to Anders in one of his letters. “The truth is that society simply
*cannot* accept the fact of my guilt without at the same time
recognizing its own far deeper guilt.”
