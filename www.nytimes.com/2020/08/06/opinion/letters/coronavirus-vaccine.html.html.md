# Needed: A Safe Vaccine, Masks and Face Shields

</div>

Readers say we need to make sure any vaccine is safe, and remind us that
for now masks and distancing are reliable.

Re “[Scientists Fret as White House Rushes
Vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html?searchResultPosition=1)”
(front page, Aug. 3):

While the administration pursues a dangerous rush to approve a Covid-19
vaccine, people need to recognize that a vaccine for this disease must
be effective to be safe.

Inoculating people with a vaccine that does not protect will create a
false sense of security and result in the abandonment of safeguards like
masks and social distancing. The vaccinated will become a new vector,
getting sick themselves and spreading the disease.

Deluded that they are immunized against Covid, too many people will
dismiss symptoms as resulting from less devastating diseases. They will
not self-quarantine, and public health agencies will not be able to
persuade exposed people to limit contact with other, susceptible people.

There are other reasons not to bow to the political pressure and rush a
premature vaccine to market. Wearing masks and distancing work reliably
well.

To prevent the added deaths from an unready vaccine, we need a national
mandate for masks and physical distancing until adequate vaccine testing
is complete.

Carl Selkin  
Pasadena, Calif.

**To the Editor:**

I believe in science. I respect scientists. I have a vaccination record
as long as my arm. And yet I now find myself in the dubious company of
the anti-vaccine crowd as I ponder the safety of anything espoused by
the Trump administration.

And I do not believe that I am alone. Sadly, this is what an
administration built on lies has wrought.

Helen Ogden  
Pacific Grove, Calif.

**To the Editor:**

Major sports teams have essentially unlimited resources for frequent
Covid testing, isolation and tracing, as well as strict protocols. If
they are taking all these precautions but still having problems with
outbreaks, how do you think that opening public schools will work out?

Hoping for the best is not a science-based strategy. It’s immoral.

Gary Price  
Austin, Texas

**To the Editor:**

Front-line workers in emergency rooms wear a face shield on top of a
mask. This protects their eyes from getting infected by coronavirus
droplets and provides added protection if their mask is ill fitting. My
wife and I wear an N95 or KN95 mask and a face shield whenever we leave
our apartment.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a physician I strongly advise everybody who can acquire a face shield
to wear both a mask and a face shield when in public. Clearly teachers
should do so if schools reopen.
