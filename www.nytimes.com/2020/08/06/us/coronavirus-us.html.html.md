Nearly every country has struggled to contain the coronavirus and made
mistakes along the way.

China committed the first major failure, [silencing
doctors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
who tried to raise alarms about the virus and allowing it to escape from
Wuhan. Much of Europe went next, [failing to

enormous outbreaks. Today, many countries — Japan, Canada, France,
Australia and more — are coping with [new increases in
cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
after reopening parts of society.

When it comes to the virus, the United States has come to resemble not
the wealthy and powerful countries to which it is often compared but
instead far poorer countries, like Brazil, Peru and South Africa, or
those with large migrant populations, like Bahrain and Oman.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As in several of those other countries, the toll of the virus in the
United States has fallen disproportionately on poorer people and groups
that have long suffered discrimination. Black and Latino residents of
the United States have contracted the virus at [roughly three times as
high of a
rate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html)
as white residents.

How did this happen? The New York Times set out to reconstruct the
unique failure of the United States, through numerous interviews with
scientists and public health experts around the world. The reporting
points to two central themes.

First, the United States faced longstanding challenges in confronting a
major pandemic. It is a large country at the nexus of the global
economy, with a tradition of prioritizing individualism over government
restrictions. That tradition is one reason the United States suffers
from an unequal health care system that has long produced worse medical
outcomes — including [higher infant
mortality](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html)
and [diabetes
rates](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.DIAB.ZS) and [lower
life expectancy](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN) —
than in most other rich countries.

“As an American, I think there is a lot of good to be said about our
libertarian tradition,” Dr. Jared Baeten, an epidemiologist and vice
dean at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said. “But
this is the consequence — we don’t succeed as well as a collective.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The second major theme is one that public health experts often find
uncomfortable to discuss because many try to steer clear of partisan
politics. But many agree that the poor results in the United States stem
in substantial measure from [the performance of the Trump
administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html).

In no other high-income country — and in only a few countries, period —
have political leaders departed from expert advice as frequently and
significantly as the Trump administration. President Trump [has
said](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-statements-about-the-coronavirus/)
the virus was not serious; predicted it would disappear; spent weeks
questioning the need for masks; encouraged states to reopen even with
large and growing caseloads; and promoted medical disinformation.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent days, Mr. Trump has continued the theme, offering a torrent of
[misleading
statistics](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/08/04/politifact-fact-checking-22-claims-from-donald-trumps-axios-interview/)
in his public appearances that make the situation sound [less dire than
it
is](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-data-briefing.html).

Some Republican governors have followed his lead and also played down
the virus, while others have largely followed the science. Democratic
governors have more reliably heeded scientific advice, but their
performance in containing the virus has been uneven.

“In many of the countries that have been very successful they had a much
crisper strategic direction and really had a vision,” said Caitlin
Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health
Security, who wrote [a guide to reopening
safely](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/)
for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group.
“I’m not sure we ever really had a plan or a strategy — or at least
it wasn’t public.”

Together, the national skepticism toward collective action and the Trump
administration’s scattered response to the virus have contributed to
several specific failures and missed opportunities, Times reporting
shows:

  - a lack of effective travel restrictions;

  - repeated breakdowns in testing;

  - confusing advice about masks;

  - a misunderstanding of the relationship between the virus and the
    economy;

  - and inconsistent messages from public officials.

Already, the American death toll is of a different order of magnitude
than in most other countries. With only 4 percent of the world’s
population, the United States has accounted for [22 percent of
coronavirus
deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).
Canada, a rich country that neighbors the United States, has a per
capita death rate about half as large. And these gaps may worsen in
coming weeks, given the lag between new cases and deaths.

For many Americans who survive the virus or do not contract it, the
future will bring other problems. Many schools will struggle to open.
And the normal activities of life — family visits, social gatherings,
restaurant meals, sporting events — may be more difficult in the United
States than in any other affluent country.

## A travel policy that fell short

In retrospect, one of Mr. Trump’s first policy responses to the virus
appears to have been one of his most promising.

On Jan. 31, his administration announced that it was [restricting entry
to the United States from
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html):
Many foreign nationals — be they citizens of China or other countries —
would not be allowed into the United States if they had been to China in
the previous two weeks.

It was still early in the spread of the virus. The first cases in Wuhan,
China, had been diagnosed about a month before, and the first announced
case in the United States had come on Jan. 21. In announcing the new
travel policy, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human
services, declared that the virus posed “a public health emergency.” Mr.
Trump
[described](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1249519742093864961)
the policy as his “China ban.”

After the Trump administration acted, several other countries quickly
announced [their own
restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus-us-australia.html)
on travel from China, including Japan, Vietnam and Australia.

But it quickly became clear that the United States’ policy was full of
holes. It did not apply to immediate family members of American citizens
and permanent residents returning from China, for example. In the two
months after the policy went into place, almost 40,000 people arrived in
the United States [on direct flights from
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even more important, the policy failed to take into account that the
virus had spread well beyond China by early February. Later data would
show that many infected people arriving in the United States [came from
Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html).
(The Trump administration did not [restrict travel from
Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/anthony-fauci-coronavirus.html)
until March and exempted Britain from that ban despite a high infection
rate there.)

The administration’s policy also did little to create quarantines for
people who entered the United States and may have had the virus.

Authorities in some other places took a far more rigorous approach to
travel restrictions.

South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan largely restricted entry to residents
returning home. Those residents then had to quarantine for two weeks
upon arrival, with the government keeping close tabs to ensure they did
not leave their home or hotel. South Korea and Hong Kong also tested for
the virus at the airport and transferred anyone who was positive to a
government facility.

Australia offers a telling comparison. Like the United States, it is
separated from China by an ocean and is run by a conservative leader —
Scott Morrison, the prime minister. Unlike the United States, it put
travel restrictions at the center of its virus response.

Australian officials noticed in March that the travel restrictions they
had announced on Feb. 1 were not preventing the virus from spreading. So
they went further.

On March 27, Mr. Morrison announced that Australia would no longer trust
travelers [to isolate themselves
voluntarily](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-27/pm-announces-new-quarantine-measures-international-travellers/12097390?nw=0).
The country would instead mandate that everyone arriving from overseas,
including Australian citizens, spend two weeks quarantined in a hotel.

The protocols were strict. As people arrived at an airport, the
authorities transported them directly to hotels nearby. People were not
even allowed to leave their hotel to exercise. The Australian military
helped enforce the rules.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Around the same time, several Australian states with minor outbreaks
shut their own borders to keep out Australians from regions with higher
rates of infection. That hardening of internal boundaries had not
happened since the 1918 flu pandemic, said Ian Mackay, a virologist in
Queensland, one of the first states to block entry from other areas.

The United States, by comparison, imposed few travel restrictions,
either for foreigners or American citizens. Individual states did little
to enforce the rules they did impose.

“People need a bit more than a suggestion to look after their own
health,” said Dr. Mackay, who has been working with Australian officials
on their pandemic response. “They need guidelines, they need rules — and
they need to be enforced.”

Travel restrictions and quarantines were central to the success in
controlling the virus in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia,
[as well as New
Zealand](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/world/australia/new-zealand-coronavirus.html),
many epidemiologists believe. In Australia, the number of new cases per
day fell more than 90 percent in April. It remained near zero through
May and early June, even as the virus surged across much of the United
States.

In the past six weeks, Australia has begun to have a resurgence — which
itself points to the importance of travel rules. The latest outbreak
stems in large part from [problems with the quarantine in the city of
Melbourne](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/how-hotel-quarantine-let-covid-19-out-of-the-bag-in-victoria-20200703-p558og.html).
Compared with other parts of Australia, Melbourne relied more on private
security contractors who employed temporary workers — some of whom
lacked training and failed to follow guidelines — to enforce quarantines
at local hotels. Officials [have
responded](https://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria/numbers-are-too-high-melbourne-faces-stage-four-lockdown-within-days-20200801-p55hm3.html)
by banning out-of-state travel again and imposing new lockdowns.

Still, the tolls in Australia and the United States remain vastly
different. Fewer than 300 Australians have died of complications from
Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. If the United States had the
same per capita death rate, about 3,300 Americans would have died,
rather than 158,000.

Enacting tough travel restrictions in the United States would not have
been easy. It is more integrated into the global economy than Australia
is, has a tradition of local policy decisions and borders two other
large countries. But there is a good chance that a different version of
Mr. Trump’s restrictions — one with fewer holes and stronger quarantines
— would have meaningfully slowed the virus’s spread.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Traditionally, public health experts had not seen travel restrictions as
central to fighting a pandemic, given their economic costs and the
availability of other options, like testing, quarantining and contact
tracing, Dr. Baeten, the University of Washington epidemiologist, said.
But he added that travel restrictions had been successful enough in
fighting the coronavirus around the world that those views may need to
be revisited.

“Travel,” he said, “is the hallmark of the spread of this virus around
the world.”

## The double testing failure

On Jan. 16, nearly a week before the first announced case of the
coronavirus in the United States, a German hospital made an
announcement. Its researchers had developed a test for the virus, which
they described [as the world’s
first](https://www.charite.de/en/service/press_reports/artikel/detail/researchers_develop_first_diagnostic_test_for_novel_coronavirus_in_china/).

The researchers posted the formula for the test online and said they
expected that countries with strong public health systems would soon be
able to produce their own tests. “We’re more concerned about labs in
countries where it’s not that easy to transport samples, or staff aren’t
trained that thoroughly, or if there is a large number of patients who
have to be tested,” Dr. Christian Drosten, the director of the Institute
for Virology at the hospital, known as Charité, in Berlin.

It turned out, however, that the testing problems would not be limited
to less-developed countries.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
developed their own test four days after the German lab did. C.D.C.
officials claimed that the American test would be more accurate than the
German one, by using three genetic sequences to detect the virus rather
than two. The federal government quickly began distributing the American
test to state officials.

But the test had a flaw. The third genetic sequence produced
inconclusive results, so the C.D.C. told state labs to pause their work.
In meetings of the White House’s coronavirus task force, Dr. Robert R.
Redfield, the C.D.C. director, played down the problem and said it would
soon be solved.

Instead, it took [weeks to
fix](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html).
During that time, the United States had to restrict testing to people
who had clear reason to think they had the virus. All the while, the
virus was quietly spreading.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By early March, with the testing delays still unresolved, the New York
region became a global center of the virus — without people realizing it
until weeks later. More widespread testing could have made a major
difference, experts said, leading to earlier lockdowns and social
distancing and ultimately less sickness and death.

“You can’t stop it if you can’t see it,” Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior
adviser to the director general at the World Health Organization, said.

While the C.D.C. was struggling to solve its testing flaws, Germany was
[rapidly building up its ability to
test](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html).
Chancellor Angela Merkel, a chemist by training, and other political
leaders were watching the virus sweep across northern Italy, not far
from southern Germany, and pushed for a big expansion of testing.

By the time the virus became a problem in Germany, labs around the
country had thousands of test kits ready to use. From the beginning, the
government covered the cost of the tests. American laboratories often
charge patients [about $100 for a
test](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/upshot/coronavirus-test-cost-varies-widely.html).

Without free tests, Dr. Hendrik Streeck, director of the Institute of
Virology at the University Hospital Bonn, said at the time, “a young
person with no health insurance and an itchy throat is unlikely to go to
the doctor and therefore risks infecting more people.”

Germany was soon far ahead of other countries in testing. It was able to
diagnose asymptomatic cases, trace the contacts of new patients and
isolate people before they could spread the virus. The country has still
suffered a significant outbreak. But it has had many fewer cases per
capita than Italy, Spain, France, Britain or Canada — and about
one-fifth the rate of the United States.

The United States eventually made up ground on tests. In recent weeks,
it has been conducting more per capita than any other country, according
to Johns Hopkins researchers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But now there is a new problem: The virus has grown even more rapidly
than testing capacity. In recent weeks, Americans have often [had to
wait in long
lines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-test-shortage.html),
sometimes in scorching heat, to be tested.

One measure of the continuing troubles with testing is the percentage of
tests that come back positive. In a country that has the virus under
control, [fewer than 5 percent of tests come back
positive](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html),
according to World Health Organization guidelines. Many countries have
reached that benchmark. The United States, even with the large recent
volume of tests, has not.

“We do have a lot of testing,” Ms. Rivers, the Johns Hopkins
epidemiologist, said. “The problem is we also have a lot of cases.”

The huge demand for tests has overwhelmed medical laboratories, and many
need days — or even up to two weeks — to produce results. “That really
is not useful for public health and medical management,” Ms. Rivers
added. While people are waiting for their results, many are also
spreading the virus.

In Belgium recently, test results have typically come back in 48 to 72
hours. In Germany and Greece, it is two days. In France, the wait is
often 24 hours.

## The double mask failure

For the first few months of the pandemic, public health experts could
not agree on a consistent message about masks. Some said masks reduced
the spread of the virus. Many experts, however, discouraged the use of
masks, saying — somewhat contradictorily — that their benefits were
modest and that they should be reserved for medical workers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We don’t generally recommend the wearing of masks in public by
otherwise well individuals because it has not been up to now associated
with any particular benefit,” Dr. Michael Ryan, a World Health
Organization official, [said at a March 30 news
conference](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-30mar2020.pdf?sfvrsn=6b68bc4a_2).

His colleague Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove explained that it was important to
“prioritize the use of masks for those who need them most.”

The conflicting advice, echoed by the C.D.C. and others, led to
relatively little mask wearing in many countries early in the pandemic.
But several Asian countries were exceptions, partly because they had a
tradition of mask wearing to avoid sickness or minimize the effects of
pollution.

By January, mask wearing in Japan was widespread, as it often had been
during a typical flu season. Masks also quickly became the norm in much
of [South
Korea](https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/7/11/21320058/masks-covid-19-media-utah-governor-inside-the-newsroom-the-culture-south-korea),
[Thailand](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/world/asia/coronavirus-thailand-photos.html?searchResultPosition=2),
[Vietnam](https://saigoneer.com/saigon-culture/18648-already-ubiquitous,-face-masks-become-the-symbol-of-vietnam-s-new-normal),
[Taiwan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7270822/) and
[China](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says).

In the following months, scientists around the world began to report two
strands of evidence that both pointed to the importance of masks:
Research showed that the virus could be transmitted through [droplets
that hang in the
air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html),
and several studies found that the virus spread less frequently in
places where people were wearing masks.

On one cruise ship that gave passengers masks after somebody got sick,
for example, [many fewer people became
ill](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/coronavirus-mask-protection.html)
than on a different cruise where people did not wear masks.

Consistent with that evidence was Asia’s success in holding down the
number of cases (after China’s initial failure to do so). In South
Korea, the per capita death rate is about one-eightieth as large as in
the United States; Japan, despite being slow to enact social distancing,
has a death rate about one-sixtieth as large.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We should have [told people to wear cloth
masks](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent)
right off the bat,” Dr. George Rutherford of the University of
California, San Francisco, said.

In many countries, officials reacted to the emerging evidence with a
clear message: Wear a mask.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada [began wearing one in
May](https://www.deccanherald.com/international/justin-trudeau-puts-on-mask-canadians-urged-to-do-same-840092.html).
During a visit to an elementary school, President Emmanuel Macron of
France wore [a French-made blue
mask](https://apnews.com/fe461ecbffacb67c747a3234300c90de) that
complemented his suit and tie. Zuzana Caputova, the president of
Slovakia, created a social media sensation by wearing [a fuchsia-colored
mask](https://twitter.com/pfarqeu/status/1265154039190151168) that
matched her dress.

In the United States, however, masks did not become a fashion symbol.
They became a political symbol.

Mr. Trump avoided wearing one in public for months. He poked fun at a
reporter who wore one to a news conference, asking the reporter [to take
it
off](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-mocks-those-wearing-face-masks-calling-it-politically-correct/)
and saying that wearing one was “politically correct.” He described
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s decision to wear one
outdoors as “very unusual.”

Many other Republicans and conservative news outlets, [like Fox
News](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/foxs-ongoing-attacks-masks-are-public-health-menace),
echoed his position. Mask wearing, as a result, became yet another
partisan divide in a highly polarized country.

Throughout much of the Northeast and the West Coast, more than 80
percent of people wore masks when within six feet of someone else. In
more conservative areas, like the Southeast, the share was [closer to 50
percent](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html).

A March survey found that [partisanship was the biggest
predictor](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/31/21199271/coronavirus-in-us-trump-republicans-democrats-survey-epistemic-crisis)
of whether Americans regularly wore masks — bigger than their age or
whether they lived in a region with a high number of virus cases. In
many of the places where people adopted a hostile view of masks,
including Texas and the Southeast, the number of virus cases began to
soar this spring.

## The first rule of virus economics

Throughout March and April, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and staff members
held long meetings inside a conference room at the State Capitol in
Atlanta. They ordered takeout lunches from local restaurants like the
Varsity and held two daily conference calls with the public health
department, the National Guard and other officials.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

One of the main subjects of the meetings was when to end Georgia’s
lockdown and reopen the state’s economy. By late April, Mr. Kemp decided
that it was time.

Georgia [had not
met](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/us/coronavirus-states-reopen-criteria.html)
the reopening criteria laid out by the Trump administration (and many
outside health experts considered those criteria too lax). The state was
reporting about 700 new cases a day, more than when it shut down on
April 3.

Nonetheless, Mr. Kemp went ahead. He said that Georgia’s economy [could
not wait any
longer](https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2020-04-20/gov-kemp-updates-georgians-covid-19),
and it became one of the first states to reopen.

“I don’t give a damn about politics right now,” he said at an April 20
news conference announcing the reopening. He went on to describe
business owners with employees at home who were “going broke, worried
about whether they can feed their children, make the mortgage payment.”

Four days later, across Georgia, barbers returned to their chairs,
[wearing face masks and latex
gloves](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/coronavirus-georgia-oklahoma-alaska-reopen.html).
Gyms and bowling alleys were allowed to reopen, followed by restaurants
on April 27. The stay-at-home order expired at 11:59 p.m. on April 30.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kemp’s decision was part of a pattern: Across the United States,
caseloads were typically much higher when the economy reopened than in
other countries.

As the United States endured weeks of closed stores and rising
unemployment this spring, many politicians — particularly Republicans,
like Mr. Kemp — argued that there was an unavoidable trade-off between
public health and economic health. And if crushing the virus meant
ruining the economy, maybe the side effects of the treatment were worse
than the disease.

Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, put the case
most bluntly, and became an object of scorn, especially from the
political left, for doing so. “There are more important things than
living,” [Mr. Patrick said in a television
interview](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-reopening-economy-more-important-things-n1188911)
the same week that Mr. Kemp reopened Georgia.

It may have been an inartful line, but Mr. Patrick’s full argument was
not wholly dismissive of human life. He was instead suggesting that the
human costs of shutting down the economy — the losses of jobs and income
and the associated damages to living standards and people’s health —
were greater than the costs of a virus that kills only a small
percentage of people who get it.

“We are crushing the economy,” he said, citing the damage to his own
children and grandchildren. “We’ve got to take some risks and get back
in the game and get this country back up and running.”

The trouble with the argument, epidemiologists and economists agree, was
that public health and the economy’s health were not really in conflict.

Early in the pandemic, Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago
economist and former Obama administration official, proposed what he
called [the first rule of virus
economics](https://twitter.com/austan_goolsbee/status/1241888950710669313?lang=en):
“The best way to fix the economy is to get control of the virus,” he
said. Until the virus was under control, many people would be afraid to
resume normal life and the economy would not function normally.

The events of the last few months have borne out Mr. Goolsbee’s
prediction. Even before states announced shutdown orders in the spring,
many families [began sharply reducing their
spending](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/11/business/economy/coronavirus-us-economy-spending.html).
They were responding to their own worries about the virus, not any
official government policy.

And the end of lockdowns, like Georgia’s, did not fix the economy’s
problems. It instead led to a brief increase in spending and hiring that
soon faded.

In the weeks after states reopened, the virus began surging. Those that
opened earliest tended to have worse outbreaks, according to a Times
analysis. The Southeast fared especially badly.

In June and July, Georgia reported more than 125,000 new virus cases,
turning it into one of the globe’s new hot spots. That was more new
cases than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Australia combined
during that time frame.

Americans, frightened by the virus’s resurgence, responded by visiting
restaurants and stores less often. The number of Americans filing new
claims for unemployment benefits [has stopped
falling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/economy/unemployment-economy-coronavirus.html).
The economy’s brief recovery in April and May seems to have petered out
in June and July.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In large parts of the United States, officials chose to reopen before
medical experts thought it wise, in an attempt to put people back to
work and spark the economy. Instead, the United States sparked a huge
new virus outbreak — and the economy did not seem to benefit.

“Politicians are not in control,” Mr. Goolsbee said. “They got all the
illness and still didn’t fix their economies.”

The situation is different in the European Union and other regions that
have had more success reducing new virus cases. Their economies have
begun showing [some promising
signs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/europe-economy-recovery-coronavirus.html),
albeit tentative ones. In Germany, retail sales and industrial
production [have
risen](https://www.wsj.com/articles/germanys-economy-suffers-biggest-contraction-on-record-but-green-shoots-emerge-11596101866),
and the most recent unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. In the United
States, it was 11.1 percent.

## The message is the response

The United States has not performed uniquely poorly on every measure of
the virus response.

Mask wearing is more common than throughout much of Scandinavia and
Australia, according to surveys [by YouGov and Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/institute-of-global-health-innovation/ICL-YouGov-Covid-19-Behavour-Tracker_Global_FaceMask_20200609_VF.pdf).
The total death rate is still higher in Spain, Italy and Britain.

But there is one way — in addition to the scale of the continuing
outbreaks and deaths — that the United States stands apart: In no other
high-income country have the messages from political leaders been nearly
so mixed and confusing.

These messages, in turn, have been amplified by television stations and
websites friendly to the Republican Party, especially Fox News [and the
Sinclair Broadcast
Group](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/sinclair-yanked-a-pandemic-conspiracy-theory-program-but-it-has-stayed-in-line-with-trump-on-coronavirus/2020/07/31/5d90a296-d021-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html),
which operates almost 200 local stations. To anybody listening to the
country’s politicians or watching these television stations, it would
have been difficult to know how to respond to the virus.

Mr. Trump’s comments, in particular, have regularly contradicted the
views of scientists and medical experts.

The day after the first American case was diagnosed, he said, “We have
it totally under control.” In late February, he said: “It’s going to
disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” Later, he
incorrectly stated that any American who wanted a test could get one. On
July 28, he [falsely
proclaimed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/trump-nobody-likes-me-walks-out-briefing.html)
that “large portions of our country” were “corona-free.”

He has also [promoted medical
misinformation](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/07/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/)
about the virus. In March, Mr. Trump called it “very mild” and suggested
it was less deadly than the common flu. He has encouraged Americans to
treat it with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, despite a lack
of evidence about its effectiveness and concerns about its safety. At
one White House briefing, he mused aloud about injecting people with
disinfectant to treat the virus.

These comments have helped create [a large partisan
divide](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/)
in the country, with Republican-leaning voters less willing to wear
masks or remain socially distant. Some Democratic-leaning voters and
less political Americans, in turn, have decided that if everybody is not
taking the virus seriously, they will not either. State leaders from
both parties have sometimes created so many exceptions about which
workplaces can continue operating normally that their stay-at-home
orders have had only modest effects.

“It doesn’t seem we have had the same unity of purpose that I would have
expected,” Ms. Rivers, the Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, said. “You need
everyone to come together to accomplish something big.”

Across much of Europe and Asia, as well as in Canada, Australia and
elsewhere, leaders have delivered a consistent message: The world is
facing a deadly virus, and only careful, consistent action will protect
people.

Many of those leaders have then pursued aggressive action. Mr. Trump and
his top aides, by contrast, persuaded themselves in April that the virus
was fading. They have also [declined to design a national
strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html)
for testing or other virus responses, leading to a chaotic mix of state
policies.

“If you had to summarize our approach, it’s really poor federal
leadership — disorganization and denial,” said Andy Slavitt, who ran
Medicare and Medicaid from 2015 to 2017. “Watch Angela Merkel. Watch
[how she
communicates](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/angela-merkel-nails-coronavirus-speech-unlike-trump.html)
with the public. Watch how Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand [does
it](https://theconversation.com/three-reasons-why-jacinda-arderns-coronavirus-response-has-been-a-masterclass-in-crisis-leadership-135541).
They’re very clear. They’re very consistent about what the most
important priorities are.”

New York — both the city and the state — offers a useful case study.
Like much of Europe, New York responded too slowly to the first wave of
the virus. As late as March 15, Mayor Bill de Blasio encouraged people
[to go to their neighborhood
bar](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/bill-de-blasio-had-his-worst-week-as-new-york-city-mayor.html).

Soon, the city and state were overwhelmed. Ambulances wailed day and
night. Hospitals filled to the breaking point. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo — a
Democrat, like Mr. de Blasio — was slow to protect nursing home
residents, and [thousands
died](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/nyregion/nursing-homes-deaths-cuomo.html).
Earlier action in New York could have saved a significant number of
lives, epidemiologists say.

By late March, however, New York’s leaders understood the threat, and
they reversed course.

They insisted that people stay home. They repeated the message every
day, often on television. When other states began reopening, New York
did not. “You look at the states that opened fast without metrics,
without guardrails, it’s a boomerang,” [Mr. Cuomo said on
June 4](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-announces-state-expanding-covid-19-testing).

The lockdowns and the consistent messages had a big effect. By June, New
York and surrounding states had [some of the lowest
rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/coronavirus-northeast-governors.html)
of virus spread in the country. Across much of the Southeast, Southwest
and West Coast, on the other hand, the pandemic was raging.

Many experts now say that the most disappointing part of the country’s
failure is that the outcome was avoidable.

What may not have been avoidable was the initial surge of the virus: The
world’s success in containing previous viruses, like SARS, had lulled
many people into thinking a devastating pandemic was unlikely. That
complacency helps explains China’s early mistakes, as well as the
terrible death tolls in the New York region, Italy, Spain, Belgium,
Britain and other parts of Europe.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But these countries and dozens more — as well as New York — have since
shown that keeping the virus in check is feasible.

For all of the continuing uncertainty about how this new coronavirus is
transmitted and how it affects the human body, much has become clear. It
often spreads indoors, with close human contact. Talking, singing,
sneezing and coughing play a major role in transmission. Masks reduce
the risk. Restarting normal activity almost always leads to new cases
that require quick action — testing, tracing of patients and
quarantining — to keep the virus in check.

When countries and cities have heeded these lessons, they have rapidly
reduced the spread of the virus and been able to move back, gingerly,
toward normal life. In South Korea, fans have been able [to attend
baseball
games](https://time.com/5871901/south-korea-baseball-coronavirus/) in
recent weeks. In Denmark, Italy and other parts of Europe, children have
[returned to
school](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks).

In the United States, the virus continues to overwhelm daily life.

“This isn’t actually rocket science,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who
ran the New York City health department and the C.D.C. for a combined 15
years. “We know what to do, and we’re not doing it.”
