The annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally may attract 250,000 people even
though South Dakota's coronavirus cases have been rising.

For most of the year, Sturgis, S.D., is a relatively quiet city of 7,000
residents tucked beside a 1.2 million-acre forest, with a motorcycle
museum as its signature attraction. But each summer,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/sturgis-motorcyle-rally.html}{Sturgis
transforms as bikers descend for a massive motorcycle rally}.

This year's festival may attract about 250,000 people despite an uptick
in coronavirus cases across the state, city officials say, leading to
fears it could become a super-spreader event.

When the virus upended life across America in the spring, it forced the
cancellation of graduation ceremonies, music festivals, marathons and
other large gatherings. Sturgis, which has hosted the rally since 1938,
pushed ahead with its plans anyway.

The 10-day rally, which begins Friday, may be the country's largest
public gathering since the pandemic began, and it comes amid widespread
opposition. More than 60 percent of residents favored postponing the
event, according to a city-sponsored survey.

``We should have postponed or canceled the rally last March,'' said
Terry Keszler, a Sturgis City Council member, echoing the concerns that
have divided his community.

City officials faced pressure from businesses, people outside the city
and threats of litigation, Mr. Keszler said. Still, they cut back on
advertising and canceled city-sponsored events, including the opening
ceremony.

Over the past week, there has been an average of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/south-dakota-coronavirus-cases.html}{75
coronavirus cases a day} in South Dakota, a 24 percent increase over the
previous two weeks. And some say the surge might grow worse: The city
plans to offer coronavirus testing for its residents once the rally
concludes on Aug. 16.

``Everyone wanted to have this rally whether we wanted it or not,'' Mr.
Keszler said. ``We were boxed into a corner.''

Little could be done to stop the event, said Doreen Allison Creed, the
Meade County commissioner who represents Sturgis. Ms. Creed said the
county lacked the authority to shut down the rally because much of it
takes place on state-licensed campgrounds.

``We are either going to be a great success story or failure,'' Ms.
Creed said. ``I truly believe it could not have been stopped.''

Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, encouraged people to attend the rally in
an interview on Fox News on Wednesday night, saying the state had
successfully hosted other large events --- including
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mount-rushmore.html}{a
Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore} that President Trump
attended --- without seeing a direct increase in virus cases. Plus, she
said, the state's economy benefits when people visit.

The state's Department of Tourism has estimated that the annual festival
generates about \$800 million in revenue. It is quite the sight: When
rallygoers from across the United States and Canada make their annual
pilgrimage to Sturgis, the otherwise quiet stretch of Interstate 90 is
congested with motorcycles, their engines sputtering as they announce
their arrival.

    weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the

    will be remote-only in the fall}, citing concerns that surging
    coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for
    students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some
    825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to
    abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when

    municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your

``We know we could have these events, get people information, let them
protect their health,'' Ms. Noem said, ``but still enjoy their way of
life and enjoy events like the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.''

Health experts say the coronavirus is less likely to spread outdoors,
especially when people wear masks and socially distance. But large
gatherings like the motorcycle rally also increase the number of
visitors inside restaurants and stores.

South Dakota is among several states that did not put in place a
lockdown or a mandatory mask requirement. In April, the Smithfield pork
processing plant in Sioux Falls became what was then the nation's
largest coronavirus hot spot when
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-south-dakota-meat-plant-refugees.html}{more
than 600 employees} were sickened by the virus.

Many bikers stop in Sioux Falls, which is primarily in Minnehaha County,
on their way to Sturgis because it is the last metro area on their way
to the rally, said Jeff Barth, a county commissioner. That worries him,
he said, because it opens residents up to potential exposure.

``We all recognize what is going to happen,'' he said.

Still, Sturgis businesses are preparing for the rush. Rod Woodruff,
owner of the Buffalo Chip, which is outside the city limits of Sturgis
and is used as a campground by motorcyclists, said bikers have begun to
arrive.

``I haven't seen much of a change in attendance so far'' over past
years, Mr. Woodruff said.

Signs outlining guidelines to socially distance are posted, hand
sanitizer has been put out and bandannas will be given to anyone
attending events in the amphitheater, although they will not be
required.

``We told everyone,'' he said, ``if you are worried about it, stay home,
don't come.''
