Reads}\label{11-of-our-best-weekend-reads}}

Welcome to the weekend. I found this week sobering. Did you feel the
same? If your heart broke seeing the devastation in Beirut, you might
want to take a look at
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/world/how-to-help-lebanon-beirut.html}{how
you can help}. Maybe you just need these
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/well/mind/five-minute-coronavirus-stress-resets.html}{quick
stress-reducing strategies} --- I certainly do. Wherever you are, I hope
that you are safe and that the weekend brings you a chance to rest and
recharge. Take care and enjoy some incredible journalism.

Vivian Yee, The New York Times's Middle East correspondent, was hurt in
the explosions in Beirut. In this
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/lebanon-explosion-beirut.html}{first-person
account of what happened}, she describes how people knew what to do,
including helping wounded people they didn't know. You can also
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/podcasts/the-daily/beirut-explosion-damage.html}{hear
her on The Times's podcast ``The Daily.''}
