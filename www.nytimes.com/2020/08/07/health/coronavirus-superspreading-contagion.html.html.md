# Why the Coronavirus Is More Likely to ‘Superspread’ Than the Flu

Most people won’t spread the virus widely. The few who do are probably
in the wrong place at the wrong time in their infection, new models
suggest.

For a spiky sphere just 120 nanometers wide, the coronavirus can be a
remarkably cosmopolitan traveler.

Spewed from the nose or mouth, it can rocket across a room and splatter
onto surfaces; it can waft into poorly ventilated spaces and [linger in
the air for
hours](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/health/virus-aerosols-who.html).
At its most intrepid, the virus can spread from a single individual to
dozens of others, perhaps even a hundred or more at once, proliferating
through packed crowds in what is called a [superspreading
event](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/science/how-coronavirus-spreads.html).

Such scenarios, which have been traced to [call
centers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274_article), [meat
processing
facilities](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-south-dakota-meat-plant-refugees.html),
[weddings](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/9/20-1469_article?deliveryName=USCDC_333-DM28908)
[and
more](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/coronavirus-funeral-albany-georgia.html),
have [helped propel a
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/coronavirus-superspreaders.html)
that, in the span of eight months, has reached nearly every corner of
the globe. And yet, while some people seem particularly apt to spread
the coronavirus, others barely pass it on.

“There’s this small percentage of people who appear to infect a lot of
people,” said Dr. Joshua Schiffer, a physician and mathematical modeling
expert who studies infectious diseases at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle. Estimates vary from population to
population, but they consistently show a striking skew:
[Between 10](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67) and [20
percent](https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr165671) of coronavirus
cases may seed 80 percent of new infections. Other respiratory diseases,
like the flu, are far more egalitarian in their spread.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Figuring out what drives coronavirus superspreading events could be key
to stopping them, and expediting an end to the pandemic. “That’s the
million dollar question,” said Ayesha Mahmud, who studies infectious
disease dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley.

In a paper [posted Friday to the website
medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20169920v1.full.pdf)
that has [not yet been through peer
review](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/science/coronavirus-disinformation.html),
Dr. Schiffer and his colleagues reported that coronavirus superspreading
events were most likely to happen at the intersection where bad timing
and poor placement collide: a person who has reached the point in their
infection when they are shedding large amounts of virus, and are doing
so in a setting where there are plenty of other people around to catch
it.

According to a model built by Dr. Schiffer’s team, the riskiest window
for such transmission may be extremely brief — a one- to two-day period
in the week or so after a person is infected, when coronavirus levels
are at their highest.

The virus can still ** spread outside this window, and individuals
outside it should not let up on measures like mask-wearing and physical
distancing, Dr. Schiffer said. But the longer an infection drags on, the
less likely a person is to be contagious — an idea that might help
experts advise [when to end
self-isolation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/coronavirus-isolation-testing.html),
or how to allocate resources to those most in need, said Dr. Mahmud, who
was not involved in the study.

Catching and containing a person at their most infectious is another
matter, however. Some people stricken with the coronavirus start to feel
unwell within a couple days, whereas others take weeks, and many never
end up experiencing symptoms. The length of the so-called [incubation
period](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/07/sciadv.abc1202),
which spans the time between infection and the onset of symptoms, can be
so variable that some people who catch the virus fall ill before the
person who gave it to them does. That rarely happens with the flu, which
reliably rouses a spate of symptoms within a couple days of infection.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If the coronavirus reaches a peak in the body before symptoms appear —
if symptoms appear at all — that increase might be [very tough to
identify](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/health/coronavirus-testing-viral-spread.html)
without [frequent and proactive
testing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html).
Symptom-free spikes in virus load appear to happen very often, which
“really distorts our ability to tell when somebody is contagious,” Dr.
Schiffer said. That, in turn, makes it all too easy for people to
obliviously shed the pathogen.

“It really is about opportunity,” said Shweta Bansal, an infectious
disease ecologist at Georgetown University who was not involved in the
study. “These processes really come together when you are not only
infected, but you also don’t know you’re infected because you don’t feel
crummy.” Some of these unwitting coronavirus chauffeurs, emboldened to
go out in public, may end up causing a superspreading event that sends
the pathogen blazing through a new population.

This confluence of factors — a person in the wrong place at the wrong
point in their infection — sets the stage for “explosive transmission,”
Dr. Bansal said.

The team’s model also pointed to another important variable: the
remarkable resilience of the coronavirus when it is aloft.

A growing body of evidence now suggests that the coronavirus [can be
airborne in crowded, poorly ventilated indoor
environments](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/health/virus-aerosols-who.html),
where it may encounter many people at once. The virus also travels in
larger, heavier droplets, but these quickly fall to the ground after
they are expelled from the airway and do not have the same reach or
longevity as their smaller counterparts. Dr. Schiffer said he thought
the coronavirus might be more amenable to superspreading than flu
viruses because it is better at
[persisting](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973) in
contagious clouds, which can ferry pathogens over relatively long
distances.

“It’s a spatial phenomenon,” he said. “People further away from the
transmitter may be more likely to be infected.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the

        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

Since the start of the pandemic, many comparisons have been drawn
between Covid-19 and the flu, both of which are diseases caused by
viruses that attack the respiratory tract. But [plenty of differences
exist](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm), and in many
ways the coronavirus is more formidable. “This study adds yet another
layer to how it’s different from influenza,” said Olivia Prosper, a
researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville who uses
mathematical models to study infectious diseases but was not involved in
the study. “It’s not just about how sick it makes you, but also its
ability to transmit.”

Moreover, certain people may be predisposed to be more generous
transmitters of the coronavirus, although the details are “still a
mystery,” Dr. Schiffer said.

But when a superspreading event occurs, it likely has [more to do with
the
circumstances](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/science/how-coronavirus-spreads.html)
than with a single person’s biology, Dr. Schiffer said. Even someone
carrying a lot of the coronavirus can stave off mass transmission by
avoiding large groups, thus depriving the germ of conduits to travel.

“A superspreading event is a function of what somebody’s viral load is
and if they’re in a crowded space,” he said. “If those are the two
levers, you can control the crowding bit.”

Both Dr. Mahmud and Dr. Prosper noted that not everyone has the means to
practice physical distancing. Some people work essential jobs in packed
environments, for instance, and are left more vulnerable to the
consequences of superspreading events.

That makes it all the more important for those who can participate in
control measures like mask-wearing and physical distancing to remain
vigilant about their behavior, Dr. Mahmud said.

“That’s what we should be doing,” she said. “Not just to protect
ourselves, but to protect others.”
