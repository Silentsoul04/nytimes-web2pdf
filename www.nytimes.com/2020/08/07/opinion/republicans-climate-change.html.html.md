It’s been a long time coming, but some Republicans seem to have finally
gotten serious about climate change. In June, a handful of [senators
rolled
out](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/the-long-game/2020/08/04/betting-the-farm-489964)
a bipartisan climate change bill. It is co-sponsored by Debbie Stabenow,
Democrat of Michigan, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.

The bill, the Growing Climate Solutions Act, makes it easier to pay
farmers to capture carbon. It is the latest in a series of actions
Republicans have taken in the past year to combat climate change.

In March, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, [unveiled the
first](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/13/gop-climate-change-kevin-mccarthy-115025)
in a series of three original proposals to help slow the earth’s
warming. The bills aim to help cut emissions by expanding a tax credit
for carbon-capture technology and draw on federal funds for research and
development.

With a growing majority of Americans concerned about the effects of
climate change — [67
percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/21/how-americans-see-climate-change-and-the-environment-in-7-charts/)
say the government isn’t doing enough to combat it — Republicans may
have had a politically expedient change of heart. Better late than
never. The latest legislation offers the parties a common ground where
meaningful change can flourish.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a conservative Christian environmentalist, I’ve witnessed how the
Republican base of Christian voters has helped push its leaders in this
direction. The faith-based world is an overlooked source of activism for
climate policy. When it comes to theology, a growing number of them are
taking the Bible’s Genesis call to care for Creation very seriously, and
younger Christians increasingly seek policies that speak to this.
Republicans have cultivated options that don’t negate the conservative
values they hold dear.

Mr. McCarthy’s approach bypasses government mandates and regulations.
Instead, it focuses on clean energy, carbon capture and conservation.
Conservatives have historically opposed expensive, large-scale federal
policy, but these innovative solutions provide tangible steps without
sacrificing conservative principles. This is the Republican Party’s
bread and butter: creative concepts that don’t require significant
mandates or regulations to meet societal needs.

Other Republicans have followed in his footsteps. This summer, [Senator
Mike
Braun](https://www.braun.senate.gov/energy-202-two-gop-senators-join-democrats-back-bill-help-cut-emissions-farms)
of Indiana joined Mr. Graham on the Growing Climate Solutions Act, and
[Senator Lisa
Murkoswki](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/senators-introduce-bill-to-combat-impacts-of-climate-change-)
of Alaska offered a bipartisan bill (with Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat
of Rhode Island) addressing the impact of oceans in capturing carbon.
These proposals come [as hunting and fishing groups rally
Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/28/energy-202-hunting-fishing-groups-urge-congress-work-together-climate-change/)
to pursue bipartisan efforts that can pass the House and the Senate.

There is also an opportunity for new partnerships, both with younger
Republicans and Christian communities engaged in the climate fight.
Because about 80 percent of Republicans
[identify](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/christians/by/party-affiliation/)
as Christian, political focus on climate policy will draw new interest
from this characteristically passionate, activated group.

“By focusing on mobilizing Christians on this issue, other Christians
will begin to see people like them engaging, and begin to recognize
themselves in that movement,” said Kyle Meyaard-Schaap, a representative
for Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, in a phone interview.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Most churchgoing Christians view scripture as holy. Therefore, earthcare
becomes a sacred act of worship. For the younger generation,
environmental responsibility and combating climate change is both
personal and spiritual.

“We, as Christians, have a responsibility to steward the earth we’ve
been given, and we can’t do that without practical solutions,” Bethany
Bowra, a conservative Christian in her 20s, wrote in an email. “God gave
us a beautiful world that reflects Him at every turn, and my faith plays
a role in the way I view our responsibility to engage on environmental
issues.”

Young Evangelicals for Climate Action is just one of a growing number of
faith-based organizations focused on the environment. [Interfaith Power
and Light](https://www.interfaithpowerandlight.org/) exists to
[mobilize](https://www.interfaithpower.org/about-us/national-interfaith-power-light-campaign/)
“a religious response to global warming,” and the [Evangelical
Environmental Network](https://creationcare.org/) aims to “to be
[faithful stewards](https://creationcare.org/who-we-are/mission.html) of
God’s provision.”

Later this year, a Creation Care Prayer Breakfast, hosted by a group of
evangelical environmental organizations, is scheduled to take place in
Washington and feature a keynote address from Walter Kim, the president
of the National Association of Evangelicals.

The Yale Program on Climate Change Communication [concluded that
Christians
cite](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/engaging-christians-in-the-issue-of-climate-change/)
“protecting God’s creation” as their primary concern. They also found
that presenting environmental concerns in a biblical, “stewardship
frame” revealed “significant increases in pro-environmental and
climate change beliefs.”

Not everyone is welcoming of the conservative plans for the environment.
A writer at The New Republic
[called](https://newrepublic.com/article/156269/republicans-climate-change-plan-big-oils-climate-change-plan)
Mr. McCarthy’s approach “a package only a fossil fuel executive could
love.” The Sierra Club balked at a proposal from the Trump
administration related to logging, denouncing it as [“cynical
exploitation”](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/donald-trump-s-greenwashing-climate-crisis)
and “greenwashing.”

A purity standard on climate action may lead only to more gridlock.
Progressive climate activists might consider the upside of these new
Republican policies: They give environmentalists an “in” with
churchgoers, who are a very powerfully activated demographic. And it’s
something Joe Biden and his Democratic colleagues could work with if
they take the presidency in November.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It might be difficult for progressives to believe in the environmental
transformation of Republicans or the religious. Indeed, conservatives
have generally shunned taking action on climate change. But that is
changing. In 2019, [Senator Graham said Republicans needed to “up our
game](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article232467697.html)”
on climate change, and the party didn’t wait long to move on that.

If polling on what Americans care about is any measure, they won’t be
letting up the fight for conservative climate change policy anytime
soon. It demonstrates that a vocal group of concerned citizens really
can lead their political leaders on the issues they care about.

Democrats have led the way on environmental policy issues before this,
but it’s time for a longer table. Friends from the other side of the
aisle are asking to join.
