Since I stepped into my job **** as acting head of the editorial page in
June, I’ve received a version of this question several times: Does The
New York Times actually believe in publishing a range of opinions?

When I’m asked this, I often think the real question is: Will you
publish conservative or center-right thinkers and writers?

The short answer: of course. Our compact with our readers is to offer
them thoughtful, independent journalism.

We couldn’t honor that commitment if we didn’t challenge readers’ views,
help them think through news and current debates and, ultimately,
develop their own opinions about how the world should be.

In fact, the cover story in this weekend’s Sunday Review is a piece
exploring [the future of the Republican
Party](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/opinion/republican-party-trump-2020.html)
by David Brooks. David argues that even if Trump loses in November, his
views on immigration, trade, foreign policy and more will live on for
decades, shaping the G.O.P. just as Ronald Reagan’s worldview has.

And yesterday we published an episode of “[The
Argument](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/opinion/the-argument-trump-coronavirus-election.html)”
where the pro-Trump conservatives Helen Andrews and Dan McCarthy joined
Ross Douthat to debate the president’s handling of the coronavirus and
whether conservatives should hope for a Trump loss in November.

On Wednesday, Bret Stephens explored what can be lost in the name of
moral betterment in his column on the [Irish-born politician Edmund
Burke](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/opinion/edmund-burke.html) and
cancel culture. (For my money, another essential piece of writing on the
subject of what it means to be “canceled” was Ross’s “[10 Theses About
Cancel
Culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/opinion/cancel-culture-.html).”)

Last week we published essays by [Stuart
Stevens](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/opinion/trump-republican-party-racism.html),
a longtime Republican political consultant; [Steven
Calabresi](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/trump-delay-election-coronavirus.html),
a co-founder of the Federalist Society; and [Jeffrey A.
Rosen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/opinion/federal-death-penalty.html),
the deputy attorney general, who defended the federal death penalty.

Times Opinion has worked hard over the past several years to diversify
in all sorts of ways — in the range of voices we have, the kinds of
reporting we do and the different mediums we use, like podcasts,
graphics and video.

Our report is at its best when we don’t just publish opposing views —
even though it sometimes seems this way, the world isn’t binary,
eternally cleaved between Democrat and Republican. Instead, we aim to
bring many different voices and viewpoints to a topic, enriching the
debate with expertise and people’s lived experiences, especially of
those who are not always heard. That can mean looking at issues through
the lens of race, economics, culture or science.

Politics is important, but it’s only part of the discussion.

*The Times is committed to publishing* [*a diversity of
letters*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html)
*to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of
our articles. Here are some*
