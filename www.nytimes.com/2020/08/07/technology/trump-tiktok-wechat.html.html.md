# Trump Swings Against TikTok, WeChat

</div>

President Trump signed executive orders against two popular China-based
apps. Let me try to explain.

*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up

weekdays.*

The most honest explanation for the White House’s latest move is this:
????? But I’ll do the best I can.

On Thursday, the Trump administration [signed executive
orders](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html)
that seemed to seek a ban on two China-based smartphone apps, TikTok and
WeChat, from operating in the United States or interacting with U.S.
companies. This step was a long time coming, but it still felt
surprising.

The practical significance of these White House mandates and a similar
[State Department policy
statement](https://www.state.gov/announcing-the-expansion-of-the-clean-network-to-safeguard-americas-assets/)
this week aren’t exactly clear yet. Two high-profile apps might be gone
from the United States in 45 days, or not. But the philosophical
implications are concerning.

On paper at least, internet policy in the United States is creeping a
little closer to what happens in countries like Russia and India: The
government makes draconian rules about what technology its citizens are
allowed to use. And it can be hard for people to know if those rules are
based on legitimate national security concerns or expressions of
nationalism.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If you’ve been following this newsletter, you know that some U.S.
officials are [worried about
TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/technology/tiktok-china-ban-model.html)
potentially handing over reams of data collected on Americans to the
Chinese government, and helping spread a Chinese-friendly view of the
world. There are similar fears about WeChat, which is [widely used in
China and also by Chinese people
abroad](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/trump-china-wechat-tiktok.html)
and those who do business there.

What we have now is a series of [just plain weird
things](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-microsoft.html)
that could get even weirder. First, in the case of TikTok, the U.S.
government is effectively negotiating — in public — [a sale between a
foreign
company](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html),
ByteDance, and an American company, Microsoft.

And I don’t know what will happen to WeChat, or how either order would
be enforced. Is the White House going to demand that Apple, Google or
U.S. internet providers prevent people from downloading WeChat and
TikTok? Would this apply to Apple and Google *outside* the United
States, too?

And what happens to video games like League of Legends and Fortnite, and
the carmaker Tesla? WeChat’s parent company, Tencent, owns all or parts
of those properties.

It’s possible none of this will happen: Executive orders sometimes never
become action.

What we’re seeing now is a struggle to figure out the right approach to
U.S. digital security. (At least, I think that’s the goal.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

TikTok is a black box that siphons large amounts of data about users
(like other social networks) and is likely beholden to orders of the
Chinese government.

Chinese security forces have used WeChat to spy on and intimidate
members of the Chinese diaspora. Chinese-backed hackers regularly try to
steal [sensitive digital
information](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/us/breach-in-a-federal-computer-system-exposes-personnel-data.html)
about
[Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/us/politics/equifax-hack-china.html)
and [secret business
information](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/china-hacking-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
of American companies.

The internet, like everything else, should be subject to appropriate
government regulation and rules. I mentioned
[Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/world/europe/russia-telegram-shutdown.html)
and India because those countries sometimes cross the line between
protecting citizens and [cutting them off from the outside
world](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/india-internet-censorship.html).

The United States isn’t threatening to turn off the internet, [as India
sometimes
does](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/kashmir-internet-shutdown-india.html).
But the U.S. government is taking a hard line to cut off apps that
Americans rely on, and it’s not clear how much protection Americans will
gain in return.

It feels like there must be a middle ground — as my colleague [Kevin
Roose recently
suggested](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/technology/tiktok-china-ban-model.html)
— that addresses some of the potential risks of foreign-owned apps
without resorting to extreme measures.

## When antimonopoly memes ruled

There are tempting comparisons between today’s American tech superpowers
and the industrial monopolies of a century ago. What we really need are
the old memes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, industrial conglomerates like
Standard Oil and U.S. Steel were regularly portrayed as octopuses or
other tentacled creatures in illustrations, editorial cartoons and other
visual depictions.

I kept coming across these octopus drawings as I dug into the history of
U.S. antitrust law, which was a response to those old industrial
monopolies. This history is relevant today, of course, because a handful
of American tech superpowers are now being compared to those Gilded Age
trusts.

[Edward
O’Donnell](https://www.holycross.edu/academics/programs/history/faculty/edward-t-odonnell),
the chair of the history department at College of the Holy Cross, said
tentacled monsters were very popular images a century ago to depict
anxieties about big corporations unfairly wielding power and poisoning
food, mistreating workers and bending government officials and
competitors to their will.

The octopus was, yes, [a
meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme).

There’s this famous 1904 illustration of Standard Oil (see above) with
one tentacle wrapped around the U.S. Capitol building, another squeezing
white collar and blue collar workers and others grabbing at depictions
of the shipping, steel and other industries.

“[The Curse of
California](http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/power/text1/octopusimages.pdf),”
which appeared in a satirical magazine in 1882, showed the bosses of the
Southern Pacific railroad in the eyes of a monster that was squeezing
miners, farmers, wealthy power brokers, wheat exports and stage coaches.

Illustrators of the age knew what [teens on
TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/style/memers-are-taking-over-tiktok.html)
and [Russian propagandists on
Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/russia-2016-election-facebook.html)
figured out nearly a century later: A powerful visual can influence
public opinion about important topics.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

You may recognize that the tentacled creature is also a visual used in
anti-Semitic tropes. This is not a coincidence, Dr. O’Donnell said.
Institutions and people who were believed to have achieved power
unfairly and abused it have often been depicted with octopus images.

In addition to Jews and monopolists, subjects that got the tentacles
treatment included [British
imperialism](https://fineartamerica.com/featured/imperialism-cartoon-1882-granger.html)
in the 19th century, the [Soviet Union under
Stalin](https://www.popsci.com/article/technology/brief-history-octopi-taking-over-world/)
and [1940s
Japan](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:3293931). And now,
it seems, [the 21st century technology
superpowers](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a15895746/bust-big-tech-silicon-valley).

## Before we go …

  - **It’s not an election day. It’s election days/weeks:** The
    institutions most responsible for our understanding of government —
    the news media and, yes, social networks — are preparing for how to
    communicate the results of this November’s U.S. elections.
    
    My colleague Ben Smith wrote earlier this week about [news
    organizations planning for voting results to take days or
    weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/business/media/election-coverage.html),
    in part because of heavier use of mail-in voting during the
    pandemic. BuzzFeed News also wrote that some Facebook employees are
    worried that longer ballot counting will create opportunities for
    [people to use Facebook to undermine the legitimacy of the
    election](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-zuckerberg-what-if-trump-disputes-election-results).

  - **The risks of turning mental health care into an app:** Talkspace,
    the app that lets people text and chat with a licensed therapist,
    has made therapy much more accessible, but my colleagues Kashmir
    Hill and Aaron Krolik also found cases in which the company treated
    patient confidentiality cavalierly and prioritized marketing over
    patient welfare.
    
    Their reporting, Kash and Aaron wrote, suggested “that the needs of
    a venture capital-backed start-up to grow quickly can sometimes be
    in conflict with the core values of professional therapy.”

  - **Microsoft Excel is changing our genes (sort of):** Scientists have
    run into trouble when alphanumeric symbols of genes like “MARCH1”
    are misread as dates when they’re typed into Excel spreadsheets. And
    because it’s apparently easier to change scientific nomenclature
    than to change the settings in Excel, the [names of about 27 genes
    have been changed to avoid spreadsheet
    misinterpretation](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates),
    according to The Verge.
