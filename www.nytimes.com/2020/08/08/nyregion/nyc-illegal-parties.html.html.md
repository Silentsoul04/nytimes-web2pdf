<div class="css-53u6y8">

On a humid Saturday night, under a segment of the Kosciuszko Bridge,
which connects Brooklyn and Queens, hundreds of people at an illicit
gathering danced and swayed to the thumps of hip-hop and electronic
music. Some wore masks. Many did not.

Many were attending their first party in months, since the pandemic had
forced many venues to close.

“People were just enjoying themselves,” said one of the attendees, Jimmy
Escobar, 30, of Brooklyn. “People got locked up for so long, and they
finally got to go out.”

New Yorkers, by and large, have adhered to rules mandating social
distancing and mask wearing. The diligence has helped keep the
coronavirus under control in the city even as outbreaks have raged
across the country, primarily in the South and the West.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the summer wears on, however, mounting reports of parties, concerts
and other social events, like the rave attended by Mr. Escobar, are
raising fears that New York’s hard-earned stability may be tenuous.

Over the last few weeks, videos and photos posted on social media — at
bars, at beaches, at warehouses, at pools, at hotels — show densely
packed, mask-free crowds, similar to the Memorial Day weekend gatherings
at [Lake of the Ozarks in
Missouri](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/us/lake-of-the-ozarks-coronavirus.html)
and in states like California and Florida that are now reeling from
virus outbreaks.

The images contrast sharply with the memories of a brutal spring in New
York that left tens of thousands dead, disproportionately ravaging
low-income communities and neighborhoods with high numbers of Black and
Latino people.

“It’s disrespectful,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at a recent news
conference about the partying. “It’s illegal. It not only violates
public health, but it violates human decency.”

Many of the images show how a segment of the nightlife industry, a
crucial piece of New York City’s culture, is desperately trying to
revive itself after having been shut down when the pandemic hit.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But other events, which charge for tickets, drinks or other amenities,
perhaps illustrate how some people are looking to capitalize on the
public’s restlessness.

Osvaldo Chance Jimenez, 44, who has helped organize underground parties
in New York City in the past, said the growing number of events risked
seeding future outbreaks, which would likely disproportionately affect
communities of color, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens where many of
the gatherings are taking place.

Mr. Jimenez has used [his Instagram account,
@hilovenewyork](https://www.instagram.com/hilovenewyork/), to draw
attention to what he sees as reckless behavior. He pointed to yacht
parties where organizers are selling tickets for up to $100, and a
requirement at a day club at the Ravel Hotel in Long Island City,
Queens, that guests pay between $35 and $50 to take a rapid coronavirus
test on site, as examples of what he called “vulture capitalism.”

“It is the arrogance of money,” he said. “These people do not care.”

Lauren Flax, a D.J., producer and artist based in Brooklyn, said people
should not be partying yet. Ms. Flax has lost work and is living off
unemployment checks and other government assistance. But she said that
even thinking about holding a dance party would be irresponsible before
there was a better understanding of the virus and better testing
technology.

“I don’t think any of us should be thinking about our career right now,”
she said.

Asked this week about the rave under the Kosciuszko Bridge, and an
illegal boat party with more than 170 guests that was held over the
weekend, [Mayor Bill de Blasio
said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaaJUcexvog) the authorities had
moved quickly to address a few cases of wrongdoing and that most people
were following the rules.

“But where we see something wrong, we got to go in and stop it
immediately,” the mayor said.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The New York City Sheriff’s Office, one of the city agencies tasked with
enforcing the social distancing rules during the pandemic, has responded
to several reports of illegal parties since the pandemic began,
including the boat party, Sheriff Joseph Fucito said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said the office was trying to take a more proactive approach to stop
the parties before they take place.

Dr. Jay Varma, Mr. de Blasio’s senior adviser for public health, said
the city had not “seen any large clusters specifically associated with
any of these events.” But about 15 percent of people who test positive
in the city, and are interviewed by contact tracers, reported being at
some sort of gathering outside of their home, city officials said.

[City data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page)
indicates that while the parties and other gatherings are on the rise,
the outbreak does not appear to be worsening. The number of new
hospitalizations in a day has not reached 50 in weeks — in March and
April, it was routinely higher than 1,000 per day, according to city
data.

An uptick in cases also did not materialize after thousands of
protesters, many of them wearing masks, gathered for weeks during Black
Lives Matter demonstrations across the city.

But the fear, Mr. Jimenez and others say, is that younger people who get
infected while attending a party, and who may be less likely to be
severely affected by the virus, will spread it to more vulnerable
people.

“Things are only going to get worse,” he said. “I feel for my city. I
pray that I’m wrong.”

Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality
Alliance, said the parties should not come as a surprise.

“People will socialize in nightlife spaces, whether you like it or not,”
Mr. Rigie said. “You could have unsafe, unregulated nightlife. Or you
can do everything you can to have safe, regulated nightlife. But we
can’t act as if it’s not going to exist.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Rigie said that local, state and federal governments should be
providing financial assistance, like rent support, to these businesses
and others affected by the nightlife shutdown, and that there should be
better guidance and research on how to operate safely.

Some businesses, like the Ravel Hotel, have tried to figure that out
themselves, with mixed results. The hotel’s day club, Profundo, which
has an outdoor rooftop pool, reopened in late June at 50 percent
capacity and required guests to be tested for the virus on site.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

The rapid tests used by the hotel were made by Abbott Laboratories,
[according to
Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/profundo-ravel-covid-test-rooftop-pandemic-pool-parties-rage-lic).
The tests, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency
use, were designed to provide results within minutes.

But the F.D.A. had said in May that the tests might be delivering false
negative results, raising questions about safety at Profundo.

Then, on July 4, videos and photos posted on social media showed several
poolside guests at the hotel not wearing masks, and standing and dancing
close together. In a statement, the hotel acknowledged that those guests
were “not following directions,” but said that it had “retrained
security and staff on how to handle these situations moving forward”
with the help of the city.

An F.D.A. spokeswoman said this week that the agency had since worked
with Abbott to improve the test. A spokeswoman for the hotel said this
week that the tests were no longer being administered, but would not
answer questions about why.

Seth Levine, an owner of the Ravel Hotel, said in a separate statement
that the site also provides guests with hand sanitizer, masks and
printed rules about social distancing. A security team makes sure guests
wear masks when moving around the property, he said.

Some guests said they believed that the tests and other measures had
adequately lowered the risk of infection or transmission. Joey Sutera,
who works in marketing, said he went to the rooftop pool on July 4 with
30 friends.

“We look at New York and there’s zero deaths,” he said, referencing a
day last month in which the city [did not initially
report](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/13/health/new-york-city-coronavirus-zero-deaths/index.html)
any coronavirus-related fatalities. “And it’s like, New York has it
under control. So, is the reward greater than the risk when we’re young
and been locked up for so long in solitary confinement? I think people
are willing to take that risk.”

A D.J. [performed at Profundo on
Monday](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDbmjr1Delp/), and the venue was
[beckoning guests to gather](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDggXIED4Yn/)
there this weekend. One of its posts on Instagram offered a free bottle
of rosé to some guests who missed celebrating their birthday because of
the pandemic. A poolside table was listed at $500 on the hotel’s
website.

Mr. Escobar, who attended the party under the bridge, said he was not
worried about contracting or transmitting the virus. He did not have
symptoms, he said, and a sign at the party told people to wear a face
covering. He saw people handing out hand sanitizer and masks.

“If people want to go out and enjoy themselves, regardless of risk, let
them do it,” he said.

But Kristina Alaniesse, 36, who has worked as an event promoter and now
posts images on Instagram of reckless behavior at parties, said the
danger was not only for the partygoers, but the people they interact
with later.

“It’s not a time to celebrate,” she said. “We’re not out of the woods.”
