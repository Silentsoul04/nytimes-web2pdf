Despite its critical role in our daily lives, air is not something most
of us spend a great deal of time thinking about. It’s that easy to take
for granted. Unlike water, we don’t need to fill up a cup to consume it.
If some escapes from the room, more will find its way back in, whether
we open the door or not.

“If you are comfortable, you ignore it,” said [Wade H.
Conlan](https://www.ashrae.org/professional-development/learning-portal/instructor-led-training/ashrae-instructors/wade-h-conlan),
a mechanical engineer who evaluates ventilation systems on behalf of
Hanson Professional Services.

But like so many little luxuries we once took for granted, our days of
blissfully ignoring air may be numbered. Because a growing number of
scientists are convinced that a significant amount of coronavirus
transmission occurs through the air in indoor spaces, and that poor
ventilation magnifies the risk.

Not everyone has the ability or resources to make the changes to a home
or workplace to improve air circulation. But scientists and engineers
say that it’s worth trying to understand the basics of how airflow works
— in case there is a relatively easy tweak that could keep you a bit
safer.

The precise way that viral particles flow through a room when an
infected person talks, sings, exhales or eats is something that
scientists are continuing to investigate. Previous case studies have
shown that it’s complicated. If there is one easy-to-understand
principle that aerosol scientists and engineers have come to agree on,
though, it’s this: The more outdoor air coming into a room, the better
for dispersing that cloud of viral particles that might be lingering.
And one of the most reliable and cost-effective ways to get outdoor air
into a room is to open a window.

“If you don’t know if the place is well ventilated, but you have the
ability to open a window I would do it,” said [Shelly
Miller](https://www.colorado.edu/even/people/shelly-miller), a professor
of mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. That,
she said, or get out quickly if you’re swinging by an indoor location
with other people in it.

The outdoor air that comes in will eventually replace the indoor air,
according to [Jose-Luis
Jimenez](https://www.colorado.edu/chemistry/jose-luis-jimenez), an
aerosol scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder.

“The more outside air you have, the more you dilute the virus,” said Dr.
Jimenez, who was among the scientists and engineers who [sent a
letter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/health/coronavirus-aerosols-who.html)
that pushed the World Health Organization to acknowledge that airborne
transmission of the novel coronavirus is a threat in indoor spaces.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If you want to speed up the flow of outdoor air into a room, you could
also take a box fan, place it in a window and blast it outward, Dr.
Jimenez said. When any amount of air leaves, that same amount of air
returns — it’s a fixed volume. Therefore, the fan should help pull in
the same amount of outdoor air.

## Your type of air-conditioner matters.

### Some pull in outdoor air. Others simply recirculate indoor air.

If you have air-conditioning in your home, no one is saying that you
need to give up on it entirely. When it’s sweltering out,
air-conditioning can be essential not only to help you function but also
to avoid heatstroke.

But if you are going to spend time in a cooled space with other people,
it may be worth understanding a bit more about the cool air you are
breathing. Basically, all air-conditioning falls into one of three
categories.

  - The unit cools both indoor and outdoor air.

  - The unit cools and recirculates only indoor air.

  - The unit relies entirely on pulling in outdoor air. (These are
    uncommon outside hospitals and labs.)

Centralized-air systems, such as those common in office buildings, dorms
and some large apartment buildings, often fall in category one. Dr.
Jimenez and other building scientists involved in coronavirus prevention
are currently advising owners of businesses and buildings with category
one systems to adjust the ratio to pull in more outdoor air, an
enterprise that can be costly. Take a casino in Las Vegas, which is kept
cool enough to keep people gambling inside while it’s 120 degrees
Fahrenheit outside. Cooling that hot outdoor air will be more expensive
than recirculating the already cool inside air. But given that keeping
customers healthy is also a priority, more are willing to revisit their
approach, Dr. Jimenez said.

Few of us have the ability to adjust our air-conditioning in this way.
Most window units sitting with their rears facing the outdoors, for
example, fall into category two. Instead of pulling in outdoor air, they
are dumping heat from the room
outdoors,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>said [William
Bahnfleth](https://iee.psu.edu/content/william-bahnfleth), a professor
of architectural engineering at Penn State’s Institutes of Energy and
the Environment.

If you live alone, or with people you’re sure aren’t infectious, those
units are fine. But if you give in to throwing that birthday dinner for
your parents, or if your teenager has been less than strict about
staying home, it’s worth remembering that “any virus that’s present will
be mixed in” to the recirculating indoor air, Dr. Jimenez said.

And so, if you have to have people over, it may be preferable to revert
to rule one: When in doubt, open the windows. Or better yet, go outside.

## Not all filters are equal.

### But a good filter can be just as effective as pulling in outside air.

So what do you do if you’re stuck with a unit that primarily
recirculates indoor air and it’s unrealistic to open the window? This is
where filters come in. The right filter is just as effective as pulling
in outside air, said Dr. Edward A. Nardell, a professor at Harvard
Medical School who has [written about the
role](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12608) that
air-conditioning plays in spreading airborne diseases.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Along with removing dust, pollen, cooking odors, tobacco smoke and
chemicals, filters can take viral particles from the air. Some filters
go directly in air-conditioning units and central air systems. Others
are designed to stand alone. MERV and HEPA are two widely trusted,
certified types.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

MERV filters are rated on how efficiently they remove particles in a
specific size range from the air.
[ASHRAE](https://www.ashrae.org/about), a professional society of
air-conditioning, heating and refrigerating engineers, recommends MERV
13 and above for filtering out the coronavirus, said Dr. Bahnfleth, who
leads the group’s epidemic task force. It is what Dr. Bahnfleth has in
his own house. Any HEPA filter is even more efficient than the
highest-rated MERV filter, he added, so either should effectively
capture coronavirus particles.

Many central-air systems are designed to incorporate specialized
filters. But not all can handle the most advanced filters. Lower-rated
filters still could be helpful, Dr. Conlan said — it’s not that they
won’t ever catch smaller particles; they just won’t do it as
frequently. Window units are typically designed for comfort, not health,
and have even more filter limitations.

For those who can afford them — or push their employers or landlords to
buy them — a stand-alone HEPA filter is a good option Dr. Bahnfleth
said. Some are designed for bigger spaces than others. The key, Dr.
Jimenez added, is picking one that will filter all the air in the room
at least twice an hour.

Be aware that if an air-filtration system sounds too good to be true,
your instincts may be right. Some of them appear to rely on questionable
marketing and science, Dr. Jimenez said.

## There’s no ‘good spot’ in a room.

### Instead, keep your distance, wear a mask, get out quickly if you can.

Now that you’re an air expert, it may be tempting to think that you know
how to pick the safest position in a restaurant or other indoor space
you might find you have a reason to be in.

But even experts cannot easily eyeball the lowest risk location, said
Andrew Persily, who oversaw the development of an [online
tool](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/fatima) to
estimate exposure to infectious aerosols in rooms and buildings as chief
of the Energy & Environment Division at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology.

“Depending on the airflow pattern and where the aerosols are released,
there may be regions in the room that result in higher exposure than
others,” he said. “It’s tough to predict.”

It’s also hard to gauge how many is too many people in a given space.
After all it only takes one infected person to get other people sick. If
you have a *c*arbon dioxide detector, you could try a technique
previously used to manage the spread of tuberculosis, and use that to
tip you off, Dr. Miller suggests. If CO₂ levels are above 1,000 parts
per one million, you’d be wise to decrease the number of people in the
indoor space, increase the amount of outdoor air or both, she says.

An alternate approach is to look around. Do you see other people? If so,
leave.
