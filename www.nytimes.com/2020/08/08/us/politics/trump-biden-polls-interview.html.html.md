# Trump’s Axios Interview, Kanye West’s Campaign: The Latest in the 2020 Race

</div>

President Trump wants to brand Joe Biden as a doddering gaffe machine.
But the incumbent’s own rhetoric causes so much controversy it is
overwhelming the strategy.

*Welcome to our weekly analysis of the state of the 2020 campaign.*

## The week in numbers

  - [President Trump’s campaign raised more than Joe Biden’s in
    July](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-finance.html),
    announcing a **$165 million** haul for the month along with the
    Republican National Committee. The Biden campaign said it raised
    **$140 million** in July. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee,
    had raised more than Trump in the two previous months.

<!-- end list -->

  - A poll this week showed Trump’s support stabilizing in Iowa. Trump
    led Biden among registered voters [in the Monmouth University
    poll](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_IA_080520/),
    **48 percent** to **45 percent**. Trump appears weaker in the state
    than he was in 2016, when he won Iowa by more than 9 points, but his
    support appears to be holding steady there in recent polling.

  - The Biden campaign spent **$11.8 million** on television ads, and
    the Trump campaign spent **$4.4 million**.

  - On Facebook, Trump again outspent Biden, roughly **$723,000** to
    **$17,000**.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If President Trump and his allies wanted to cast Joe Biden as an
error-prone politician of yesteryear, this week they got some help.

Mr. Biden’s interview with a slew of Black and Latino journalists
produced two clippable comments for Republicans: At one point, Mr. Biden
got testy with a reporter who asked him about taking a mental aptitude
test, suggesting the reporter should be tested for cocaine and asking,
[“Are you a
junkie?”](https://twitter.com/errolbarnett/status/1290940305865400321?s=20)
At another stage of the interview, Mr. Biden contrasted Black and Latino
communities by saying the latter had more diversity.

But both comments, and Mr. Biden’s eventual attempt to walk back his
remarks about Black diversity, were overshadowed by Mr. Trump’s own
statements, a consequence of the president’s lack of discipline in
executing his own campaign strategy. Mr. Trump’s charge that Mr. Biden,
a practicing Catholic, was “against God” drew ire from across the
political spectrum and supplanted Mr. Biden’s comments in the news
cycle.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was a microcosm of Mr. Trump’s current political struggle: He
succeeded in 2016 as advisers “let Trump be Trump.” Now, he can’t seem
to stand down, even when it would be helpful to let Biden be Biden.

## Biden and Trump both loved Trump’s Axios interview

Between his regular appearances in the White House briefing room, his
overactive Twitter feed and his endless interviews with anchors on Fox
News, President Trump can often feel like a leader who is unavoidable
for comment. But Mr. Trump’s [interview last week with Jonathan
Swan](https://www.axios.com/full-axios-hbo-interview-donald-trump-cd5a67e1-6ba1-46c8-bb3d-8717ab9f3cc5.html),
a reporter for Axios, still managed to show the president in a different
light.

“It is what it is,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Swan when pressed about how he
could claim the pandemic was under control with the United States
averaging more than a thousand deaths per day.

The callous statement from a president who has been [unable to
demonstrate empathy in
public](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/donald-fred-trump.html)
throughout the coronavirus pandemic was quickly [promoted by Mr.
Biden](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDe2axiFopA/?igshid=1n57idhulpl2m),
who has been running a campaign based in large part on the simple notion
that the country needs an empathetic leader at this time.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The strange part: Mr. Trump and his aides liked the interview, too. “I
thought it was a good interview,” Mr. Trump said afterward. Many of his
aides deemed [the hoopla over Mr. Trump’s
comments](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/politics/trump-john-lewis-axios.html)
overrated, but did not see the interview as a mistake.

  - In fact, with rallies off the calendar for the foreseeable future,
    Mr. Trump’s aides said they planned to have him do more interviews
    like the one with “Axios on HBO.” They think interviews with Sunday
    show hosts, television network anchors and mainstream news outlets
    are ultimately helpful to Mr. Trump, in addition to his steady diet
    of softball sitdowns with Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity.

  - Mr. Trump is also directing some of the coverage himself, suggesting
    to his aides the reporters he wants to meet with and pushing for
    those interviews himself.

  - Mr. Swan’s interview also underscored the uneven playing field that
    is the briefing room, where Mr. Trump controls the give-and-take
    with journalists. Faced with a well-prepared reporter who had the
    time and space to follow up on his own questions, Mr. Trump appeared
    defensive and flat-footed in his understanding of his own
    administration’s virus response.

The realness of Kanye West’s presidential campaign depends on whom you
ask. The cultural icon and rap artist has filed forms declaring his
candidacy in several states. This week, reports exposed an interesting,
if not surprising, twist: [Republican operatives in swing states were
helping Mr. West’s
efforts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/politics/kanye-west-president-republicans.html),
gathering signatures in places like Wisconsin and Colorado to give the
self-proclaimed Yeezus more legitimacy.

Why are some Republicans helping his campaign? According to [a political
reporter in
Wisconsin](https://twitter.com/patrickdmarley/status/1291029714950389760?s=20),
the state G.O.P. was hoping Mr. West could play the role of spoiler in
November, siphoning votes from Mr. Biden. That is a big bet, riddled
with assumptions and lacking supporting evidence. Here is what we know:

  - There is no evidence Mr. West would win a significant number of
    Black voters. **** In 2018, when Mr. West was included in [a
    national CNN
    poll](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/05/11/rel5x.-.kanye.west.pdf),
    he was viewed favorably by only 20 percent of nonwhite adults, about
    the same as his rating among white adults. And he was viewed more
    favorably by Republicans (35 percent) than by Democrats (12
    percent).

  - The lane for spoiler candidates in 2020 is smaller than in 2016.
    **** In polling, Mr. Biden’s unfavorable ratings are much lower than
    those for Hillary Clinton, the previous Democratic nominee. That
    leaves less room for third-party candidates to capitalize on voters
    who dislike both candidates.

  - Mr. West’s political views are … inconsistent. He has given money to
    and supported progressive Democrats, donned a “Make America Great
    Again” hat, denounced the oppression of Black people and criticized
    abortion. There is no clear ideological home.

## The debate about the debates

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This much is clear: The Trump campaign and the Biden campaign have
agreed to three debates, scheduled for late September and October. This
week, however, the Trump campaign requested a fourth presidential debate
to be held earlier in September. The idea was floated by Mr. Trump’s
confidante and personal lawyer, the former New York City mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani.

The gambit was shot down by the nonprofit commission that governs
presidential debates, but it’s another sign Republicans are desperate to
shake up the race. Mr. Trump’s supporters have crowed for months that in
a one-on-one setting, the president would expose Mr. Biden as feckless
and out of touch. They have tried to paint Mr. Biden as scared to debate
Mr. Trump.

The Democratic presidential primary should be instructive for this
approach. Many of Mr. Biden’s primary opponents also assumed he would
flail on the debate stage, but in key moments he rose to the occasion.
And the predictions that Mr. Biden would be a poor debater lowered the
bar enough that he could clear it. Be careful what you wish for.

## What you might have missed

  - The Democratic National Convention is going all virtual. [Not even
    Mr. Biden will appear in
    Milwaukee](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/joe-biden-milwaukee.html)
    to accept the party’s nomination. It’s a blow to a city that had
    prepared to host thousands and more recently has been ravaged by the
    coronavirus pandemic. In terms of politics, Democrats are hoping
    voters reward them for taking the virus seriously.

  - Vice President Mike Pence thinks Mr. Biden’s decision to stay home
    has created an opportunity for the president’s re-election campaign
    — and has [scheduled his own campaign trip to Wisconsin on
    Aug. 17](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/pence-wisconsin-biden-convention.html?smid=tw-share)
    with the hope of filling the void.

  - Mr. Trump on Friday night called a surprise “news conference” at his
    private club in Bedminster, N.J. There, he said the coronavirus was
    “disappearing, it’s going to disappear,” a return to the kind of
    dismissive attitude toward the virus his aides have tried to
    convince him is hurting his re-election chances.
