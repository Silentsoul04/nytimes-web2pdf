# Coronavirus Spares Gaza, but Travel Restrictions Do Not

</div>

The blockaded Gaza Strip has not recorded any cases of community
transmission of the coronavirus, but new restrictions on movement
continue to make life difficult.

JERUSALEM — There was barely enough space to move on the popular Omar
al-Mukhtar street in Gaza City on the eve of the Muslim celebration of
Eid al-Adha as throngs of Palestinians — almost none with masks —
crowded into colorful clothing shops and huddled around makeshift food
stands.

“If the virus were here, we wouldn’t be so close to each other,” said
Saber Siam, 28, a salesman at a clothing store selling imported items
from China and Turkey. “You wouldn’t find me holding a customer’s arm or
kissing his cheek to encourage him to purchase our clothes.”

The blockaded Gaza Strip might be one of the only places in the world
where no cases of community transmission of the coronavirus have been
recorded — an achievement attributed to the coastal enclave’s isolation
as well as swift measures taken by its militant Hamas rulers.

The pandemic, however, hasn’t left Gaza untouched.

Citing the need to combat the virus, the various governmental
authorities controlling the borders of Gaza have imposed new
restrictions on movement outside the territory. That has exacerbated an
already challenging situation for Palestinians who say they urgently
need to travel to Israel and the West Bank, as well as for those wishing
to escape the bleak economic reality by emigrating by way of Egypt.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In March, fearing the potentially disastrous consequences of an outbreak
in Gaza, Hamas authorities ordered all travelers returning to the
territory by way of Israel and Egypt to enter quarantine facilities for
three weeks. They could not leave quarantine until they had passed two
virus tests.

The system seems to have succeeded, sparing Gaza’s health sector,
already devastated by years of war and conflict, from additional strain.
Medical officials detected all 78 known infections in the territory at
quarantine facilities.

Still, experts did not rule out the possibility of the pandemic
penetrating into the area’s densely populated cities and towns.

“All it takes is one small mistake,” said Gerald Rockenschaub, the head
of the World Health Organization’s mission to the Palestinians. “There’s
no guarantee the virus won’t get inside.”

Mr. Rockenschaub also warned that Gaza lacked the resources to deal with
a widespread outbreak, noting that medical institutions carry only about
100 adult ventilators, most of which are already in use.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hamas initially instituted other restrictions in Gaza. But it later
lifted many of them, enabling residents to follow significant parts of
their daily routines. They have been flocking to beaches, working out at
gyms, eating at restaurants, praying at mosques and shopping in markets,
among other activities.

“We’re glad we haven’t had to confront the death we’ve heard about in
other countries,” said Moath Abed, 29, an unemployed nurse residing in
Gaza City.

Israeli authorities have permitted Palestinians in need of emergency and
lifesaving medical treatment to use the Erez crossing — the sole
pedestrian passageway between Israel and Gaza.

But they have tightened restrictions on movement for others in the
territory, creating problems for people like Munir Sabitan, 53, a
resident of Gaza City who works in kitchen installation.

Mr. Sabitan used to visit his wife and three children, who are Arab
citizens of Israel, with a merchant’s permit. In March, though, Israel
froze those permits as the virus started spreading in its communities.

Now Mr. Sabitan is concerned that he will miss his daughter’s wedding in
the Negev desert region if Israel doesn’t soon grant him permission to
cross the border.

“The wedding was postponed twice, but it won’t be again,” he said,
noting that the new date was Aug. 17. “I feel drained from this
experience. My daughter calls everyday and I tell her I’m still waiting
for permission.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gisha, an Israeli rights group that closely monitors Gaza, appealed to
the Israeli authorities on Mr. Sabitan’s behalf, saying they were
applying “a double standard” to him because they had allowed immediate
family members of other Israelis to fly into the country to participate
in weddings, bar mitzvahs and funerals.

“Israel is effectively tightening its closure on Gaza under the guise of
the pandemic,” the group said.

The authorities have continued to deny Mr. Sabitan entry, pointing to
the pandemic as well as the May decision by the Palestinian Authority,
which governs Palestinians in the West Bank, to halt coordination with
Israel to protest Israel’s threats to annex parts of the West Bank.

Among the matters that the authority will not coordinate on are travel
permits for Palestinians in Gaza, making it harder to apply for them.

The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, the Israeli
Defense Ministry arm responsible for issuing permits to Palestinians,
declined to comment on specific cases. But it said it has been working
“around the clock” to “provide the best and most appropriate response”
for Gaza’s needs.

“We note that the narrowing down of movement through the Erez crossing
for exceptional medical and humanitarian cases is solely meant to
prevent the spread of the coronavirus,” it said.

There are tens of thousands of active cases in both Israel and Egypt,
while there are more than 6,000 among Palestinians in the West Bank.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Iyad al-Bozom, the spokesman for the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, said
that since the pandemic, authorities in Gaza have allowed Palestinians
with valid Israeli permits and “urgent travel needs” to leave the
enclave through Erez. He said that if Mr. Sabitan receives a permit, he
would be able to exit the territory.

For the same reasons, Neveen Zanon, 41, a resident of Rafah, has also
not been able to get permission to visit her father in Nablus, where he
is suffering from esophageal cancer.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 6, 2020

  - #### Why are bars linked to outbreaks?
    
      - Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s
        definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear
        your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations
        about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of
        a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise,
        then, that [bars have been linked to outbreaks in several
        states.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/coronavirus-bars.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Louisiana health officials have tied [at least 100 coronavirus
        cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge.
        Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state.
        [In
        Idaho](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0),
        health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting
        clusters of infections among young adults who had visited
        several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in
        [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [Texas and
        Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of
        newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after
        Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis
        [ordered them to
        close](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/).

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now, [that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

She said that when her mother was ill in 2011, she wasn’t able to
receive a permit until after her funeral took place.

“I don’t want to go through such a painful experience again,” said Ms.
Zanon, who lives in a cramped two-room apartment with her husband and
six children.

In March Egypt and Hamas sealed the Rafah crossing between Egypt and
Gaza for people trying to leave Gaza. Mr. al-Bozom of the Interior
Ministry said Hamas was concerned that quarantine facilities could
become overburdened if too many Palestinians exited Gaza through Rafah
and then returned shortly thereafter.

But the new restriction has complicated the plans of many young
Palestinians hoping to flee the poor living conditions in Gaza, where
youth unemployment is more than 60 percent and poverty is rampant.

Nidal Kuhail, 26, had intended to quit his job at a restaurant in Gaza
City, where he earns $13.22 per day, and move to Europe to either study
or work. Now his plans are on hold.

“There’s no future or horizon here,” said Mr. Kuhail, who has been
studying German at a cultural institute in Gaza. “The jobs are so few
and so many people are despairing. I feel like I have no other choice
but to immigrate.”

In Gaza, 32 percent of Palestinians said they want to emigrate because
of the economic, political and social situation, according to a June
poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.

Egypt opened Rafah in May 2018 after years of keeping it largely closed,
and thousands, and perhaps tens of thousands, of Palestinians in Gaza
have moved abroad.

Mr. Kuhail, who has only left Gaza once in his life, said he still was
hopeful he would find a way to Europe.

“I’ll eventually make it,” he said. “I know when I do, I’ll be in a
place where there are opportunities to build a decent life.”

Adam Rasgon reported from Jerusalem and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City.
