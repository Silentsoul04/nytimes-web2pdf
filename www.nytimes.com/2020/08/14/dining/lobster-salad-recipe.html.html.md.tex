\section{A Summer Lunch That Feels Like a
Splurge}\label{a-summer-lunch-that-feels-like-a-splurge}}

A lobster salad doesn't have to be relegated to special occasions, David
Tanis argues.

A pandemic has many downsides. And the lobster industry is among the
many sectors it's taken a toll on.

If you're in the business of selling lobster, you currently
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/maine-lobster-summer-virus.html}{have
a lot of lobster available} and a dearth of wholesale customers, not the
ideal situation.

But there can be some bright spots, depending on how you look at it.

If you're a home cook, you'll be glad to know that lobsters are cheaper
than ever --- less than \$6 a pound at many supermarkets. So, in theory,
at these prices, you could be having lobster once or twice a week, not
just for special occasions. Look at it this way: The more lobster we
eat, the more we support the beleaguered lobster industry.

A well-stuffed lobster roll on a grilled bun, whether you're a
mayonnaise or butter person, is thrilling summer fare. It's a treat to
be served dockside with an ocean view, if possible, but don't let
location deter you.

Or what about steamed lobster, on a picnic table lined with newspaper
and the whole family around it, each person shell cracking and
meat-picking and sucking every last sweet morsel from every nook and
cranny. To drink? Cold beer.

Then again, a somewhat more-structured summer lunch is fun, too.

This menu, designed for a small outdoor celebration among friends, skews
Provençal. It starts with savory goat cheese toasts, moving on to a
showstopping main-course lobster salad and ending with a refreshing
fruit bowl splashed with sparkling rosé, accompanied by tender buttery
cornmeal cookies.

Best of all, this is a no-cook meal or, rather, a
cook-in-advance-and-assemble meal, perfect for summer entertaining. The
only real chore is steaming the lobster and removing the meat. But even
that can be done ahead, freeing you to enjoy the day.

These little toasts go well with drinks, and simply require roasting a
red pepper and marinating slices of goat cheese with thyme, rosemary and
olive oil. Do that the day before, then set up the toasts and pop them
into the oven to warm just before serving. They're more-than-one-bite
hors d'oeuvres, quite satisfying, and taste best at room temperature or
just barely warm.

The lobster salad is niçoise-ish, but more luxurious, with a
basil-infused vinaigrette. It makes a fine celebratory lunch or supper
and takes advantage of summer vegetables. Now, of course, is when they
are at their best. Choose the smallest green beans and new potatoes you
can find, and the sweetest, most colorful tomatoes. A dab of aioli on
the side is a welcome option, too.

A fresh fruit bowl always makes a perfect dessert, especially in summer
months when stone fruit and berries are in season. Feel free to use
whatever you like in this wine-drenched fruit salad: peaches,
nectarines, plums, apricots, cherries, to name a few. Use any dry white
or rosé, but this Macedonia is especially good with sparkling wine, and
particularly sparkling rosé. Serve in wide glasses so guests can sip the
juice. Top up with more bubbly, if you wish. Here, a bit of optional
lavender perfumes the fruit, but lemon verbena or mint leaves would also
be nice.

Light and buttery, these tender cookies have a subtle corn flavor and a
texture similar to ladyfingers or madeleines. They keep well and are
just as delicious with a pot of tea. You make the dough into logs and
cut into slices to bake. Keep it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or
freeze for up to a month.
