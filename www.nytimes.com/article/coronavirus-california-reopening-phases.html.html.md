California was [the first

to [order all residents to stay
home](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/california-newsom-bars-home-isolation.html)
to slow the spread of the coronavirus. On May 18, Gov. Gavin Newsom
announced that state health officials would [relax their
criteria](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Gov-Gavin-Newsom-eases-reopening-requirements-15278477.php)
for counties that wanted to reopen their economies faster, provided that
they [met public health
guidelines](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/us/california-reopening.html).

With cases surging, Mr. Newsom announced one of the most sweeping
[rollbacks of any state’s reopening
plans](https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1282752861835649024?s=20),
closing indoor operations statewide for restaurants, wineries, movie
theaters, and requiring card rooms and bars to close all operations,
effective July 13.

And in at least 30 of the hardest hit counties, some businesses will be
forced to close indoor operations.

Things are changing quickly.

## Which California counties are reopening?

Each county will have to file documentation showing that it qualifies
for a variance from the statewide order, including by instituting
sufficient testing for communities and by proving that hospitals can
accommodate a 35 percent increase in Covid-19 cases.

On July 13, Mr. Newsom ordered indoor operations for fitness centers,
places of worship, noncritical offices, hair salons and barbershops, and
malls to close in 36 of the state’s hardest-hit counties, including Los
Angeles, Orange and San Diego.

A list of all 36 counties [can be found
here](https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties/).

## When can California gyms reopen?

State officials had directed local officials to decide [when the time
was right to reopen
gyms](http://www.oesnews.com/california-public-health-officials-provide-covid-19-update/).
The state had also released [guidelines for
reopening](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-fitness.pdf).
However on July 13, Mr. Newsom ordered fitness centers in 30 counties to
close indoor operations.

## What are the phases for reopening?

In April, state leaders unveiled a timeline for how California plans to
reopen schools, businesses and public spaces. The framework, which
consists of four phases, lays out how the state will inch toward those
goals. Counties that were approved for a variance from the statewide
order can [move further into
Stage 3](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx),
including opening hair salons, casinos and gyms, with strict
modifications.

  - **Stage 1,** which the state has passed, means government and
    private organizations are working to make it consistently safer for
    essential workers, like grocery employees or nurses. Those workers
    need more protective equipment and a more robust testing and tracing
    system.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Stage 2,** which California entered in early May, is when some
    lower-risk businesses and public spaces can reopen, with strict
    modifications that allow for social distancing.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Stage 3** will be when higher-risk businesses may reopen, with
    modifications.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Stage 4** will be the end of the state’s stay-at-home order.

## When will California’s beaches reopen?

In L.A. County, where the outbreak has been among the most severe in the
state, the public health department announced the closure of all “public
beaches, piers, public beach parking lots, beach bike paths that
traverse that sanded portion of the beach, and beach access points.”

Currently, [beaches in 11
counties](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/beach-closures/)
are open for some activities. There are four counties whose beaches are
fully open.

Pismo Beach, on the Central Coast, is open,
[except](http://pismobeach.org/938/CovidResponse) for the Pier.

cost?*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-reopening-50-states.html)*\]*

## When can California nail salons reopen?

Nail salons got the go-ahead from Mr. Newsom to reopen on June 19 under
[strict
guidelines](https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/expanded-personal-services.pdf).
The guidance also applied to other personal care services including
aesthetician, skin care and cosmetology services. On July 13, he ordered
businesses that offer personal care services, including nail salons, to
close in 30 of the hardest-hit counties.

## When can California churches reopen?

The state [released new guidelines for how houses of worship could begin
to reopen](https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf).
Houses of worship must get the approval of their county public health
department [to
reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/world/coronavirus-news-cases-deaths.html#link-8d1a66e),
and then limit attendance to 25 percent of their building capacity, or a
maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. On July 13, Mr. Newsom
ordered places of worship in 30 counties to close indoor operations.

## When will California’s hair salons reopen?

Mr. Newsom released safety rules that he said would allow hair salons
and barbershops in most of the state to reopen while mitigating the
spread of coronavirus. The new rules direct hair cutters and customers
to wear face masks, [among other
precautions](https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-hair-salons.pdf). On
July 13, Mr. Newsom ordered hair salons and barbershops in 30 counties
to close all indoor operations.

## When will California casinos reopen?

Some Native American tribal casinos have forged ahead with reopening,
including three in San Diego County.

casinos in the coming

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

“I understand that some tribal governments are planning on reopening
casinos on their lands,” Mr. Newsom wrote. “This deeply concerns me, and
I urge tribal governments to reconsider and instead make those
determinations based on how they align with the current local public
health conditions and the statewide stage of reopening.”

One of the state’s largest tribal casinos, [Viejas Casino &
Resort](https://viejas.com/), reopened with stricter cleaning
procedures. [Sycuan](https://www.sycuan.com/about-us/covid-19-updates/)
announced a Phase 1 reopening for May 20, with limited capacity and
select gaming machines, and [Valley View Casino &
Hotel](https://www.valleyviewcasino.com/) opened its doors on May 22.

Pechanga Resort Casino, one of the largest casinos in America, [reopened
June 1](https://www.pechanga.com/).

Casinos that recently opened: Thunder Valley Casino Resort in Placer
County; Cache Creek Casino in Yolo County; Tachi Palace Casino Resort in
Kings County and Morongo Casino Resort in Riverside County; San Manuel

indoor operations.

## Will California colleges reopen in fall 2020?

that in-person classes at its 23 campuses would be scrapped for the fall
semester, with instruction taking place almost entirely online.

Individual campsues in the state’s other four-year university system,
the University of California, with nearly 300,000 students on 10
campuses, have started announcing plans for fall. U.C. Berkeley
announced on July 21 that it will [begin the fall
semester](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/07/21/uc-berkeley-to-begin-fall-semester-with-remote-instruction/)

[The 60-page
document](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/CDC-Activities-Initiatives-for-COVID-19-Response.pdf),
