<div class="css-53u6y8">

As the coronavirus has spread across the United States, killing hundreds
of people and sickening tens of thousands more, comprehensive data on
the extent of the outbreak has been difficult to come by.

No single agency has provided the public with an accurate, up-to-date
record of coronavirus cases, tracked to the county level. To fill the
gap, The New York Times has launched a round-the-clock effort to tally
every known coronavirus case in the United States. The data, which The
Times will continue to track, is being made available to the public on
Friday.

Individual states and counties have tracked their own cases and
presented them to the public with varying degrees of speed and accuracy,
but those tallies provide only limited snapshots of the nation’s
outbreak. A [publicly available tracker from the federal Centers for
Disease Control and
Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html),
updated five times a week, includes only state-level data. Other
entities have made efforts, including [a notable one by Johns Hopkins
University](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6),
to track cases worldwide or [within the United
States](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en).

In late January, not long after the first known case was reported in
Washington State, The Times began tracking each known U.S. case as
counties and states began reporting results of testing. Such testing,
which had been delayed, gradually became more widely available. For the
last eight weeks, a team of Times journalists has recorded an array of
details — locations, dates, ages and conditions, when possible — about
newly confirmed cases reported by state and local officials.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By Friday morning, The Times had tracked more than 85,000 cases in all
50 states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. There
have been [more known cases in the United States than in China, Italy or
any other
country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/health/usa-coronavirus-cases.html),
and more than 1,200 people have died in the United States. Researchers,
scientists, government officials and business executives have requested
access to the information. The Times is releasing its data publicly in
an effort to broaden understanding of the virus’s toll.

“We hope the data set can help inform the ongoing public health response
to the pandemic and ultimately, save lives,” said Dean Baquet, the
executive editor of The Times. “We believe the data may help reveal how
Covid-19 has spread through communities and clusters; which geographic
areas may be hit the hardest; and how its spread in hard-hit areas may
offer clues for regions that could face wider outbreaks in the future.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The tracking has shown how quickly a single known case can mushroom into
an uncontrolled outbreak, as has happened in
[Louisiana](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/coronavirus-louisiana-new-orleans.html).

The database has shown how the detection of a small cluster in one area,
like New Rochelle, N.Y., can precede the discovery of thousands more
cases in nearby cities and states.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And it has shown, with tragic frequency, how vulnerable older adults are
to the worst of the virus. Public health officials have linked at least
37 deaths to the [Life Care nursing facility in Kirkland,
Wash](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/coronavirus-nursing-home-kirkland-life-care.html).
The Times has also tracked outbreaks at other nursing and senior living
facilities in Washington State, Colorado, Florida and Louisiana.

The goal of the tracking was to compile a historical record, [with as
much detail about individual patients as can be
obtained,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/us/coronavirus-us-cases-spread.html)of
the largest public health crisis in modern American history. By
collecting the data continuously, and from multiple levels of
government, The Times has been able to [map the spread of the
virus](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
with updated information published several times a day.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Times’s database has already informed academic research that showed
[how the virus might be
slowed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus-model-us-outbreak.html),
and [what might
happen](https://www.gainesville.com/opinion/20200325/stephen-j-hagen-and-peter-j-hirschfeld-florida-must-be-locked-down-now)
if it is not. In the weeks and months ahead, it is our hope that the
data can continue to inform researchers, policymakers and journalists as
they seek to understand how this pandemic evaded containment, how it
still might be mitigated and how similar disasters might be avoided in
the future.

The tracking effort grew from a handful of Times correspondents to a
large team of journalists that includes experts in data and graphics,
staff news assistants and freelance reporters, as well as journalism
students from Northwestern University, the University of Missouri and
the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The reporting continues nearly all
day and night, seven days a week, across U.S. time zones, to record as
many details as possible about every case in real time. The Times is
committed to collecting as much data as possible in connection with the
outbreak and is collaborating with the University of California,
Berkeley, on an effort in that
state.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 27, 2020

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some
        of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line.
        But defaults are also up, so if you’re thinking about buying a
        home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

In tracking the cases, the reporting process is labor-intensive but
straightforward much of the time. But with dozens of states and hundreds
of local health departments using their own reporting methods — and
sometimes moving patients from county to county or state to state with
no explanation — judgment calls have sometimes been required.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the federal government arranged flights to the United States for
Americans exposed to the coronavirus in China and Japan, The Times
recorded their cases in the states where they subsequently were treated,
even though local health departments generally did not.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When a [resident of Florida died in Los
Angeles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/coronavirus-deaths-united-states.html),
we recorded her death as having occurred in California, though officials
in Florida counted her case in their own records. When officials in some
states reported new cases without immediately identifying where they
were being treated, our team attempted to add county information later,
once it became available.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This accounting is an attempt to record how and where the coronavirus
has spread across the United States. But it is a product of a fragmented
American public health system in which overwhelmed officials at the
state or local level have sometimes struggled to report accurately and
consistently.

On several occasions, officials have corrected information hours or days
after they first reported it. Or cases have disappeared from a local
database. Or states have created confusing, sometimes duplicative ways
of tracking the cases of people who became ill while traveling. In those
instances, which have become more common as caseloads have increased,
The Times has sought to reflect the most current, accurate information
while ensuring that every known case, [each of them representing
someone’s loved
one](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/coronavirus-deaths-united-states.html),
is counted.
