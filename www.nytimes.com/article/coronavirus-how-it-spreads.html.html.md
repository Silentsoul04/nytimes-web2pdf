*\[This article is part of the developing coronavirus coverage, and may
be outdated.* [*Go here for the latest on the
coronavirus*](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus)*.\]*

A delicate but highly contagious virus, roughly one-900th the width of a
human hair, is spreading from person to person around the world. The
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/coronavirus-news.html),
as it’s known, has already [infected more than 200,000 people in 140
countries](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).

Because this virus is so new, experts’ understanding of how it spreads
is limited. They can, however, offer some guidance about how it does —
and does not — seem to be transmitted.

## If I cross paths with a sick person, will I get sick, too?

You walk into a crowded grocery store. A shopper has the coronavirus.
What puts you most at risk of getting infected by that person?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Experts agree they have a great deal to learn, but four factors are
likely to play some role: how close you get; how long you are near the
person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much
you touch your face. (Of course, [your age and
health](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/health/coronavirus-men-women.html)
are also major factors.)

Also, the larger the number of people in the store — or in any other
situation —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the greater the
chance that you’ll cross paths with an infected person, which is why so
many health officials are now urging people to avoid crowds and to
[cancel
gatherings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html)
large and small.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## What’s a viral droplet?

It is a droplet containing viral particles. A virus is a tiny
codependent microbe that attaches to a cell, takes over, makes more of
itself and moves on to its next host. This is its “lifestyle,” said Gary
Whittaker, a professor of virology at the Cornell University College of
Veterinary Medicine.

A “naked” virus can’t go anywhere unless it’s hitching a ride with a
droplet of mucus or saliva, said Kin-on Kwok, a professor at the Jockey
Club School of Public Health and Primary Care at the Chinese University
of Hong Kong.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

These mucus and saliva droplets are ejected from the mouth or the nose
as we cough, sneeze, laugh, sing, breathe and talk. If they don’t hit
something along the way, they typically land on the floor or the ground.
When the virus becomes suspended in droplets smaller than five
micrometers — known as aerosols — it can stay suspended for about a
half-hour, [research
suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-surfaces-aerosols.html).<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">

To gain access to your cells, the viral droplets must enter through the
eyes, the nose or the mouth. Some experts believe that sneezing and
coughing are most likely the primary forms of transmission. Professor
Kwok said talking face-to-face or sharing a meal with someone could pose
a risk.

Julian Tang, a virologist and a professor at the University of Leicester
in England who is researching the coronavirus with Professor Kwok,
agreed.

“If you can smell what someone had for lunch — garlic, curry, etc. — you
are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their
breath,” he said.

The virus does not linger in the air at high enough levels to be a risk
to most people. But the techniques health care workers use to care for
sick people can generate high levels of aerosols. This is part of why
it’s so important that they have [proper protective
equipment.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/us/virus-health-workers.html)

## How close is too close?

The [Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html)
recommends keeping a distance of six feet from other people to minimize
the possibility of infection. (A useful way to think about six feet is
that it’s roughly twice the length of the average person’s extended
arm.)

Three feet is the distance the W.H.O. emphasizes as particularly risky
when standing near a person who is coughing or sneezing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, other public health experts say that at this crucial moment, when
the world still has an opportunity to [slow the
transmission](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/19/world/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve-countries.html)
of the coronavirus, any number of feet is too close. By cutting out all
but essential in-person interactions, we can help [flatten the
curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html),
they say, keeping the number of sick people to levels that medical
providers can manage.

## How long is too long to be near an infected person?

It’s not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more
risk.

## Will you know a person is sick?

Not necessarily.

[Fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of
breath](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-body-symptoms.html)
may signal that someone has been infected with the coronavirus.
(Covid-19 is the name for the disease caused by the virus.)

But it has become increasingly clear that [people without symptoms can
also infect
others](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic.html).
In some cases, these people may later feel terrible enough to [try to
get
tested](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/nyregion/coronavirus-testing-positive.html),
isolate themselves, [seek
treatment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/science/coronavirus-treatment.html)
and notify friends and colleagues about potential risk. In still other
cases, people with the virus may never experience the physical
discomfort that would tip them off to the fact that they have been a
danger to others.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

## Can the virus last on a bus pole, a touch screen or other surface?

Yes. After numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong
fell ill, the city’s Center for Health Protection collected samples from
the site. Restroom faucets and the cloth covers over Buddhist texts
tested positive for the coronavirus, the agency said.

This coronavirus is just the latest of many similarly shaped viruses.
(Coronaviruses are [named for the
spikes](https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html) that
protrude from their surfaces, which resemble a crown or the sun’s
corona.)

A [recent
study](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-surfaces-aerosols.html)
of the novel coronavirus found that it could live for three days on
plastic and steel. If you are ordering lots of supplies online, you may
be relieved to know that the virus did poorly on cardboard — it
disintegrated over the course of a
day.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>It survived for about four
hours on copper.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Whether a surface looks dirty or clean is irrelevant. If an infected
person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then
touched that surface could pick it up. How much is required to infect a
person is unclear.

But as long as you [wash your
hands](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/health/washing-hands.html)
before [touching your
face,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/well/live/coronavirus-spread-transmission-face-touching-hands.html)
you should be OK, because viral droplets don’t pass through
skin.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated August 4, 2020

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what
        seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these
        patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the
        virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.
        People infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9)
        immune molecules called antibodies, which are [protective
        proteins made in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        last in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief?
    
      - The [stimulus bills enacted in
        March](https://www.nytimes.com/article/small-business-loans-stimulus-grants-freelancers-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those
        eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with
        fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships,
        independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies
        in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered,
        which is being managed by the Small Business Administration,
        includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury
        Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have [not yet seen
        payouts.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are
        draconian, and some are stuck sitting on [money they don’t know
        how to
        use.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/loans-coronavirus-small-business.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected
        or [not hearing anything at
        all.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/business/Small-business-loans-ppp.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)
        with policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        has said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)
        -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the virus.

  - #### Should I refinance my mortgage?
    
      - [It could be a good
        idea,](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        because mortgage rates have [never been
        lower.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),

        and [stunted

        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your
community.

Also, coronaviruses are relatively easy to destroy. Using a simple
disinfectant on a surface is nearly guaranteed to break the delicate
envelope that surrounds the tiny microbe, rendering it harmless,
Professor Whittaker
said.

## Does the brand or type of soap you use matter?

No, several experts said.

## My neighbor is coughing. Should I be worried?

There is no evidence that viral particles can go through walls or glass,
said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.

He said he was more concerned about the dangers posed by common spaces
than those posed by vents, provided there is good air circulation in a
room.

An infected neighbor might sneeze on a railing and if you touched it,
“that would be a more natural way to get it from your neighbor,” he
said.

## Can I get it from making out with someone?

Kissing could definitely spread it, several experts said.

Though coronaviruses are not typically sexually transmitted, it’s too
soon to know, the W.H.O. said.

## Is it safe to eat where people are sick with the coronavirus?

If a sick person handles the food or it’s a high-traffic buffet, then
risks cannot be ruled out — but heating or reheating food should kill
the virus, Professor Whittaker said.

Dr. Jha concurred.

“As a general rule, we haven’t seen that food is a mechanism for
spreading,” he
said.

## Can my dog or cat safely join me in quarantine?

Thousands of people have already begun various types of quarantines.
Some have been mandated by health officials, while others are voluntary
and primarily involve staying home.

Can a cat or dog join someone to make quarantine less lonely?

Professor Whittaker, who has studied the spread of coronaviruses in
animals and humans, said that he had seen no evidence that people who
have the virus could be a danger to their pets.
