## Unemployment Insurance

A giant pandemic [relief
package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html#link-1900f91a)
made significant — but temporary — changes to the way the unemployment
insurance system works. These changes expand the kinds of workers who
are eligible for unemployment, extend the amount of time people can
receive benefits and increase the amount people can receive.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Who is eligible?** The state programs that make up the unemployment
system now cover far more people than usual, including self-employed
people and part-time workers. Those who are unemployed, are partly
unemployed or cannot work for a wide variety of coronavirus-related
reasons will be more likely to receive benefits — and you don’t
necessarily need to lose your job to qualify. For example, if you’re
quarantined or have been furloughed — that is, you’re not being paid but
expect to return to your job eventually — you may be eligible.

**How much will someone get?** States set many of their own rules,
including for benefit amounts, which are generally calculated as a
percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum.
Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically
replaces roughly 45 percent of your lost income.

Whatever your benefit amount, the CARES Act also provides a temporary
increase of [$600
weekly](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-stimulus-coronavirus.html),
but only through July 31.

**How long will it last?** Benefits could last nine months or more,
through a combination of state and federal programs. But the details
depend on your state.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most states pay benefits for 26 weeks, though some offer less. After
that, federal legislation extends benefits by another 13 weeks. (Here’s
a [helpful illustration](https://labor.ny.gov/ui/cares-act.shtm) that
breaks down how the program works in New York State.)

In periods of high unemployment, your state may also offer its own
extended benefit program. Extended benefits usually last for half the
length of the state’s standard benefit period.

**What else should I know?** Being eligible for benefits doesn’t mean
the process is easy.

Many states administering these benefits are relying on [archaic
systems](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/nyregion/coronavirus-pandemic-unemployment-assistance-ny-delays.html),
which have been overwhelmed by the influx of claims. That has left [many
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/florida-coronavirus-unemployment.html)
[beyond
frustrated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/nyregion/unemployment-benefits-ny-coronavirus.html)
because they were locked out, unable to submit applications or wondering
if and when a check would ever arrive. If you’re still encountering
difficulty, try contacting your elected state and federal
representatives for help. [Legal
Aid](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_services/flh-home/flh-free-legal-help/)
is another good resource for lower-income households.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Paid Sick Leave and Family Leave

The CARES Act gives many American workers paid leave if they need to
take time off because of the outbreak, but [there are a lot of
exceptions,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/coronavirus-pelosi-sick-leave.html)
and how the benefits work depends on your
[circumstances](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/upshot/virus-paid-leave-pandemic.html).

**Who is eligible?** Most workers at small and midsize companies, as
well as government employees. And that includes part-time workers.

**How much will they receive?** Eligible employees get two weeks of paid
sick leave if they are ill or seeking care, as long as they’ve been
employed at least 30 days. They can receive their full pay, up to $511 a
day.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some workers can also get 12 weeks of paid leave to care for children
whose schools are closed, or whose child care provider is unavailable
because of the outbreak, but fewer workers qualify for this type of
leave. They can receive two-thirds of their usual pay, up to $200 a day.

Part-time workers will be paid the amount they typically earn in a
two-week period, up to the daily limits. People who are self-employed —
including gig workers like Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers — can
also receive paid leave, but they must calculate their average daily
income and claim it as a tax credit.

**Who is left out?** Employers with fewer than 50 workers can [deny
workers the child-care
leave](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/coronavirus-paid-leave.html)
(but not the sick leave) if it would be hard on their businesses, and
companies with more than 500 employees are excluded from the rules
entirely. [Many workers at big
businesses](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2019/ownership/private/table31a.pdf)
already have paid sick leave, but their employers’ low-wage workers are
the least likely to be covered. The New America Foundation has published
[a detailed
list](https://www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/reports/which-companies-still-arent-offering-paid-sick-days/)
of large employers (mostly consumer-facing companies like retailers,
restaurant chains and hotels) and their policies.

**How long do benefits last?** These changes aren’t permanent — the
leave law expires Dec. 31. You can find out more from the Department of
Labor, which has posted a [fact sheet for
workers](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employee-paid-leave)
and a [Q\&A](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-questions).

## Food Assistance

If you are experiencing food insecurity for the first time, you’re not
alone. If you’ve never used a food pantry, it might help to read [a
few](https://medium.com/wake-up-call/i-went-to-the-food-bank-for-the-first-time-37450c89b959)
[dispatches](https://workingclassstudies.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/a-visit-to-the-food-pantry/)
[from
others](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/06/30/735881297/opinion-being-hungry-in-america-is-hard-work-food-banks-need-your-help)
who started getting groceries at local food banks. Here’s a list of
[myths](https://solvehungertoday.org/blog/visiting-food-pantry-myths-facts/)
about food pantries and
[tips](https://extension.sdstate.edu/tips-visiting-food-pantry) for
visiting them. To find your nearest food pantry, start with the map
[here](https://ampleharvest.org/find-pantry/).

Many people who experience even a temporary loss of income can become
eligible for food stamps but do not realize it. The formal name for the
program is Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and
eligibility may vary by state. Here’s [Ron’s
column](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/your-money/food-stamps-coronavirus.html)
explaining how the system works.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The federal F.A.Q. about SNAP eligibility is
[here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/recipient/eligibility), and you can
learn more about your state’s rules via [this
map](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory). As Tara noted in a
recent
[article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/your-money/food-stamps-snap-coronavirus.html),
it isn’t always possible to use SNAP benefits when buying groceries
online.

## Mortgage Relief

[Millions of
homeowners](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/coronavirus-mortgage-relief.html)
have pressed the pause button on their mortgage payments, a form of
relief extended by the CARES Act. Not all homeowners are covered under
the new law, however, and many borrowers seeking relief have been given
inaccurate information. Here’s what you need to know.

**Who is covered by the law?** Homeowners with mortgages backed by the
federal government are permitted to [temporarily suspend their
payments](https://www.fhfa.gov/Homeownersbuyer/MortgageAssistance/Pages/Coronavirus-Assistance-Information.aspx),
a process called forbearance, for up to a year. This covers about 70
percent of mortgage holders and includes loans backed by Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac, loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (known
as F.H.A. loans) and those guaranteed by the Department of Veterans
Affairs and the Department of Agriculture.

About 30 percent of mortgage holders have loans owned by banks or other
private investors. They are not covered by the new law, but many of
these homeowners have received similar relief, often granted in
three-month increments.

**Who controls my mortgage?** You can search your address on
[various](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-can-i-tell-who-owns-my-mortgage-en-214/)
[government
websites](https://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/get-answers/Pages/get-answers-find-out-mortgage.aspx).

**What happens after forbearance?** You must make up for the payments
you skip. The process will vary depending on your personal circumstances
— and who owns your loan.

If you have a federally backed loan, your servicer should present you
with several ways to become current on your mortgage — and none of them
require you to immediately pay the money back in a lump sum (although
you can if you want to). If you can afford to resume your regular
payments, you may pay the money back over several months, for example,
or settle up when the home is sold, refinanced or when the mortgage term
is up.

People who still cannot afford to make their mortgage payments after the
forbearance period expires will probably have to lower their monthly
payment by modifying their loan, a more formal process that will require
an application.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For mortgage holders with loans owned by banks or private investors,
[the
options](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/coronavirus-mortgage-relief.html)
aren’t always as clear or as accommodating.

**What about foreclosure?** Federal housing officials [recently
extended](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Extends-Foreclosure-and-Eviction-Moratorium-6172020.aspx)
a nationwide eviction and foreclosure moratorium for borrowers with
loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the F.H.A. This includes
foreclosures that are already in progress.

**Where can I get assistance?** If you don’t feel like you are being
treated fairly — or are simply overwhelmed by the process — it might
help to [find a housing
counselor](https://apps.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm). For more
information, check out our short [resource guide
here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/covid-mortgage-forbearance.html).

## Rent Relief

While rent payments nationwide [have not
yet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/business/economy/coronavirus-rent-landlords-tenants.html)
fallen precipitously, every person who can’t pay is in crisis, and fear
remains high that more
[trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/coronavirus-evictions-renters.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
is coming.

**Where can I get help?** ** Here’s Ron’s
[column](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/your-money/coronavirus-eviction-prevention-renters-landlord.html)
on how to prevent your own eviction, and it includes a number of links
with plenty of detail.

If your landlord won’t give you a break and you want to see what legal
options you might have, you can search for a low or no-cost legal
assistance office near you via the Legal Services Corporation’s
[map](https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid). Just Shelter,
a tenant advocacy group formed by Matthew Desmond and Tessa Lowinske
Desmond, also offers
[information](https://justshelter.org/community-resources/) on local
organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress.

**What are governments doing?** ** State and local governments have
offered some eviction protection.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Mr. Desmond, the author of the book
“[Evicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/books/review/matthew-desmonds-evicted-poverty-and-profit-in-the-american-city.html),”
is also the founder of Eviction Lab, which maintains [a
list](https://evictionlab.org/covid-eviction-policies/) of local and
regional actions to pause evictions of renters. It has also published a
[scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/) that
examines state policies and how they’ve changed since the pandemic took
hold.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The CARES Act put a temporary, nationwide [eviction
moratorium](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11320) in
place for any renters whose landlords have mortgages backed or owned by
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the Federal Housing Administration. This will
last through the end of July, and landlords can’t charge any fees or
penalties for nonpayment of rent either. The moratorium applies only to
eviction for nonpayment; tenants can still be evicted for other reasons.

**What about my landlord?** Regulators have also [told
landlords](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Moves-to-Provide-Eviction-Suspension-Relief-for-Renters-in-Multifamily-Properties.aspx)
whose own mortgages are owned by Fannie or Freddie that they can use
forbearance on their own mortgages, just as long as they do not evict
tenants after they pause their mortgage payments. The challenge for
renters is figuring out whether their landlord has such a mortgage. This
information sometimes appears if you look up the address in the
[National Housing Preservation
Database](https://preservationdatabase.org/about-the-database/) or in
[another one](https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums) that the National
Low Income Housing Coalition created.

If the landlord’s mortgage is not in forbearance, renters who skip
payments could be risking eviction if there has not been a local
prohibition.

## Health Insurance

Millions of Americans [most likely
lost](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/eligibility-for-aca-health-coverage-following-job-loss/)
their health coverage along with their jobs. And many others can no
longer afford the policy they were paying for on their own.

If your situation has recently changed,[you have more
options](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/upshot/coronavirus-health-insurance-faq.html)
now than in previous crises. But navigating the [complex
web](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/changes-in-income-and-health-coverage-eligibility-after-job-loss-due-to-covid-19/)
of alternatives and figuring out how to qualify can be a challenge.

**If your income has dwindled to almost nothing.** People earning very
little will most likely be eligible for the federal-state health
insurance program known as Medicaid in 36 states and the District of
Columbia. Because of the Affordable Care Act, most states now allow all
residents to qualify for Medicaid if their household’s monthly income is
below a certain threshold — around $1,400 a month for a single person or
$2,950 for a family of four. That calculation should include any normal
unemployment benefits you are receiving, but not the additional $600 a
week being paid temporarily and not the direct
[stimulus](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/24/business/economy/600-unemployment-benefits.html)
payment authorized under recent [relief
legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**If your income is too high for Medicaid.** Those earning more can
probably buy coverage through the marketplaces established under the
Affordable Care Act — and you may qualify for substantial subsidies. If
you lose your job for any reason, you are permitted to sign up during [a
special enrollment
period.](https://www.healthcare.gov/have-job-based-coverage/if-you-lose-job-based-coverage/)

People who want to buy coverage even in the absence of a job loss might
be able to do so if they live in states that run their own marketplaces;
some of those states have established special enrollment periods. But
the [Trump administration decided in April that it would
not](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/upshot/obamacare-markets-coronavirus-trump.html)
reopen the federal Healthcare.gov marketplaces to new customers. Those
marketplaces are used in 38 states.

If you already have a marketplace plan but have experienced a drop in
income, you can go back into the system — even outside of an open
enrollment period — and adjust your income, which may result in greater
subsidies.

It’s also possible to keep your insurance if you lost your job, but that
tends to be more expensive than buying coverage in the Obamacare
marketplaces.

**I have a job and a workplace plan. What about me?** You may have a
chance to [change your
coverage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/business/employer-health-plans-coronavirus.html)
or add family members outside of an open enrollment period, which
usually isn’t possible. The Internal Revenue Service recently made an
exception, but your employer doesn’t have to offer this option.

For more details on the various coverage options, check out [this
piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/upshot/coronavirus-health-insurance-faq.html)
by Margot Sanger-Katz and Reed Abelson. (At least one health insurance

## Credit Cards and Auto Loans

If you need temporary relief on your credit card or auto loan payments,
many lenders are offering at least some help.

Start with the website for your lenders and read what they have posted.
Some have made their policies more stingy since Ron [first
reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/your-money/loan-waivers-coronavirus.html)
on changes in March.

If you call for help via phone, record the conversation if you can or at
least get written documentation of any changes the lender agrees to.
[This column from
Ron](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/business/coronavirus-financial-help.html)
explains how and why.

Among the options you can ask for are permission to skip payments (with
waived interest charges during the months you skip), the elimination of
late or other fees and a permanently lower interest rate. Ask how any
change might affect your credit score and whether you’ll have to make up
missed payments in one lump sum right after the zero-payment months.

## Mental Health

Financial losses often come with emotional strain, at the very point
when people may be least likely to spend money on care for themselves.

If you are in severe distress, the number for the free, confidential
[National Suicide Prevention
Hotline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/our-crisis-centers/) is
1-800-273-8255. It’s open at all hours. Or text HELLO to
[741741](https://www.crisistextline.org/text-us/).

Many mental health practitioners do pro bono work or charge fees on a
sliding scale. There does not appear to be a national directory of such
providers, but there is no reason not to contact local ones to ask about
low or no-cost services.

The National Alliance on Mental Illness maintains [a help
line](https://nami.org/Support-Education/NAMI-HelpLine/NAMI-HelpLine-FAQs)
that can provide referrals to local resources as well. Its number is
1-800-950-6264.

## More Helpful Advice

  - **Help for the Self-Employed.** The self-employed often have fewer
    protections than employees working for companies and other
    organizations, but two legislative packages extended several new
    benefits to help them cope during the pandemic. Paid sick and family
    leave is now available in the form of a tax credit. Unemployment
    insurance is also newly available to gig workers, independent
    contractors and freelancers who are usually ineligible. And
    self-employed people who can no longer afford their health insurance
    or want to buy new polices may have more options. [Tara’s
    story](https://www.nytimes.com/article/self-employed-workers-unemployment-coronavirus-stimulus-package.html)
    has more details.

  - **You have some flexibility with your federal student loans.** In
    fact, you should have automatically received relief without lifting
    a finger: Borrowers have been placed in so-called administrative
    forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making payments
    until Sept. 30.
    
    No interest will accrue during this period, and borrowers who want
    to continue making loan payments can do so.
    
    The Education Department says that these skipped payments will still
    count toward loan forgiveness for borrowers in income-driven
    repayment and public service loan forgiveness programs, as long as
    the other usual requirements are fulfilled.
    
    If you have more questions, check out the Education Department’s
    Q\&A
    [here](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus#borrower-questions).
    Some private lenders are offering relief programs, too.

  - **Staying in touch.** A number of large companies have agreed not to
    terminate the service of residential or small business customers who
    can’t pay their bills until at least June 30, including AT\&T,
    Comcast, Cox, RCN, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. A [full list of
    companies](https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected#pledges) is
    available on the Federal Communications Commission site.

  - **How to help.** There is no shortage of need right now — and no
    shortage of guides to helping. The New York Times has a [basic
    guide](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-how-to-help-donations-charities.html)
    to coronavirus giving,
    [suggestions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/smarter-living/coronavirus-charity-donations.html)
    on where to donate money, some practical tips on [what not to
    do](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/nyregion/coronavirus-help-healthcare-workers.html)
    and an
    [explainer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/style/self-care/donate-clothes-coronavirus.html)
    on donating clothes.
    
    Ron wrote [a
    column](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/your-money/philanthropy-charity-giving-coronavirus.html)
    about the kind of direct giving that allows you to channel money to
    individuals with immediate cash needs. The New York Times has also
    started [its own
    campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/reader-center/neediest-cases-covid-19-relief-campaign.html)
    as part of its Neediest Cases fund.

  - **Don’t forget about property taxes.** Despite the economic strain
    caused by the virus, in many places, homeowners are still expected
    to make property tax payments by the usual deadlines. If they were
    postponed, they could wreak havoc on local budgets. Our colleague
    Ann Carrns[has a
    story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/your-money/coronavirus-property-taxes.html?campaign_id=12&emc=edit_my_20200413&instance_id=17606&nl=your-money&regi_id=8921505&segment_id=25000&te=1&user_id=1f51a0e7a2edf91cad2fd25cabf8cd78)
    with more information. You can find details on jurisdictions that
    may offer some leeway in [this
    chart](https://www.inmyarea.com/research/covid-property-tax-breaks-by-state#special-relief-program-deadline-extensions).
    
    There are situations where you may get a break. If you have paused
    payments on your federally backed loan and you pay taxes and
    insurance from an escrow account, your mortgage servicer should
    continue to advance those payments as well, according to the Federal
    Housing Finance Agency. But if you don’t use an escrow account for
    taxes and insurance, you will need to continue making those payments
    on your own unless your locality provides some flexibility or
    relief.

  - **Mistaken stimulus payments.** Think you received a payment by
    mistake, say, for a relative who is among the over one million
    deceased individuals to whom the government made payments? Don’t
    spend the money. The Internal Revenue Service may well realize its
    mistake and ask for it back come tax time in 2021.

  - **Financial planners are offering free advice.** [Dozens of
    members](https://www.xyplanningnetwork.com/?_advisor_search=%22coronavirus%20relief%22)
    of the XY Planning Network have offered to help people through phone
    consultations. The Financial Planning Association has [its own
    list](https://www.onefpa.org/Pages/ProBonoPlanning.aspx) of
    volunteer certified financial planners, [as
    does](https://www.napfa.org/find-an-advisor) the National
    Association of Personal Financial Advisors.

  - **What to know about Social Security.** Older workers who have lost
    their jobs and are short on savings may be contemplating whether
    they should file for Social Security earlier than they had
    anticipated. Filing before your [full retirement
    age](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/retirechart.html) has
    serious implications, which may reduce your monthly check
    forevermore. Before you decide, consider [the following
    strategies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/business/retiring-social-security-jobs-coronavirus-pandemic.html).
    (And if you’re eligible for unemployment, you might apply for that
    first.)
    
    The Social Security Administration has mostly closed its 1,200
    offices for routine requests like help with benefit claims. Those
    requests should go through the agency’s toll-free phone line,
    1-800-772-1213, and its
    [website](https://www.ssa.gov/onlineservices/). In-person assistance
    is still available for crucial services, like reinstatement of
    benefits and assistance for those with severe disabilities. Those
    seeking in-person help must call in advance. Mark Miller has details
    [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/retirement/coronavirus-social-security.html).

  - **You can use a retirement account in new ways.** Many people who
    are out of work may be turning to their retirement accounts for
    emergency cash. Under normal circumstances, that would trigger taxes
    and penalties. But the CARES Act provides more flexible hardship
    options for 401(k) and individual retirement accounts. But even
    newly jobless people who don’t need to tap their savings have a
    decision to make: Leave the money in a former employer’s plan or
    roll it over to an individual retirement account? All of these
    situations require some analysis. [This
    story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/business/401k-rollover-faq.html)
    can help.

  - **Get your free credit report.** Consumers can now check their
    credit reports from each of the Big Three credit firms each week,
    free of charge, instead of just once a year. Routine checks have
    always been wise, but now they are essential — particularly if
    you’re skipping payments with the permission of your lender. Even
    if your lender says this relief won’t hurt your credit profile,
    mistakes are bound to happen. To find out more about how to check
    your report and what to look for, read [Ann’s story
    here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/your-money/coronavirus-credit-reports.html)

  - **Watch out for fraud.** Whether it’s a shady sales pitch for a
    gravity-defying investment or a website offering masks that never
    arrive, coronavirus-related fraud is on the rise. These
    solicitations may arrive by telephone, text messages, email, social
    media, even in [store parking
    lots,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/politics/coronavirus-scams-fraud-price-gouging.html)
    which is why consumers must remain hypervigilant. This[story from
    Tara](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/coronavirus-scams.html)
    looks at overhyped pitches for complex investments, while [this
    piece from
    Ann](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/your-money/coronavirus-fraud.html)
    surveys the landscape of bogus practices. The[Consumer Financial
    Protection
    Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/beware-coronavirus-related-scams/)
    and the[Federal Trade
    Commission](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/coronavirus-scams-what-ftc-doing)
    have also posted warnings about coronavirus fraud, and a Bentley
    University professor named Steve Weisman also keeps a [running
    list](https://scamicide.com/tag/coronavirus-scams/) of virus-related
    scams.
