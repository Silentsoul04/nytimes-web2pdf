# Trump Is Pushing a False Argument on Vote-by-Mail Fraud. Here Are the Facts.

As the coronavirus pandemic accelerates a national trend toward voting
by mail, experts say it can be conducted safely, despite Republican
claims of corruption.

With concerns mounting over how the country can conduct elections during
a pandemic and [Democrats pressing for alternatives to in-person
voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/democrats-coronavirus-voting.html),
President Trump has begun pushing a false argument that has circulated
among conservatives for years — that [voting by
mail](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/politics/trump-mail-in-voting.html)
is a recipe for fraud.

“Mail ballots, they cheat,” Mr. Trump said at the White House on Tuesday
afternoon. “Mail ballots are very dangerous for this country because of
cheaters. They go collect them. They are fraudulent in many cases. They
have to vote. They should have voter ID, by the way.”

The president spoke as Wisconsin voters, many wearing protective masks,
[were going to the polls on a fraught Election
Day](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-election-coronavirus.html),
after the Republican-led legislature refused Democratic demands to delay
the election and allow for expanded [mail-in
voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/vote-by-mail.html).
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump claimed again that there was “tremendous
potential for voter fraud.”

Here’s a look at the facts on the matter.

## All voter fraud is extremely rare.

[Studies have
shown](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/18/us/voter-fraud.html) that all
forms of voting fraud are extremely rare in the United States. A
national study in 2016 found few credible allegations of fraudulent
voting. A panel that Mr. Trump charged with investigating election
corruption [found no real evidence of
fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html)
before he disbanded it in 2018.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even so, experts say that the mail voting system is more vulnerable to
fraud than voting in person.

“What we know can be boiled down to this: Voting fraud in the United
States is rare, less rare is fraud using mail ballots,” said Charles
Stewart III of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

*\[Read more about* [*fake ballots, mail-in voting and voter
fraud*](https://www.nytimes.com/article/mail-in-vote-fraud-ballot.html)*.\]*

Mr. Stewart pointed to several documented voting fraud cases of recent
decades involving mail or absentee ballots, most recently the race in
North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District in 2018, when an operative
who rounded up absentee ballots for the Republican candidate, Mark
Harris, was [charged with election
fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/mccrae-dowless-indictment.html).
The practice is known as ballot harvesting.

“They’re stories, they’re dramatic, they are rare,” said Mr. Stewart, a
professor of political science who studies the machinations of
voting.

The North Carolina case also illustrates the fact that frauds big enough
to sway the outcome of an election — those involving campaigns rather
than individual voters — will likely be detected, said Michael McDonald,
a University of Florida political scientist and elections scholar.

Richard L. Hasen, an elections expert at the University of California,
Irvine, School of Law, said such cases were few and far between.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Election fraud in the United States is very rare, but the most common
type of such fraud in the United States involves absentee ballots,” Mr.
Hasen said. “Sensible rules for handling of absentee ballots make sense,
not only to minimize the risk of ballot tampering but to ensure that
voters cast valid ballots.”

## States that vote entirely by mail see little fraud.

[Five states, including the Republican bastion of
Utah,](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx)
now conduct all elections almost entirely by mail. They report very
little fraud. The state is among the six states with the highest
percentage of mail-in votes in the last election in 2018, all of which
had Republican state election supervisors at the time, according to
David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and
Research.

Colorado, which has 3.5 million registered voters, has been a
vote-by-mail state since 2014.

“There’s just very little evidence that there is more than a handful of
fraudulent (vote-by-mail) cases across the country in a given election
cycle,” said Judd Choate, the director of elections in the Colorado
Department of State.

## Republicans say voting by mail gives Democrats an advantage.

Since the coronavirus outbreak and calls for more widespread mail voting
to protect voters, some Republican officials, including Mr. Trump, have
advanced another argument against the practice: that it will
disadvantage Republican candidates.

The president on Wednesday
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247861952736526336)
that mail-in voting “for whatever reason, doesn’t work out well for
Republicans.” In Georgia, where the secretary of state is mailing all
voters absentee ballot requests for the May primary, the State House
speaker, David Ralston, a Republican, [told a local news
site](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/pressure-mounts-for-further-delay-georgia-may-primary-election/K1wboFdcY1z7xYt7pa11MO/),
“This will be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in
Georgia,” adding, “This will certainly drive up turnout.”

Even before the coronavirus emerged as a global threat, Democrats had
generally favored ways to expand access to voting by mail. Some
Republicans have long argued against voting by mail and in favor of
tightening voter identification and registration requirements, asserting
that easing restrictions invites voter fraud.

## Some Democrats have also raised concerns about security.

While Democrats have generally favored mail voting — which works in a
very similar way to absentee voting — some have balked at its widespread
use because of the reduced level of security when voters are not
required to appear at the polls.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Douglas A. Kellner, a co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections,
is among the Democrats who have raised flags about voting by mail.

“If you analyze all the steps involved in a mail election you start to
see where the weak points are for fraud,” Mr. Kellner said, pointing out
vulnerabilities in the process, among them the chance that ballots may
be intercepted in the mail and forged.

Mr. Kellner recalls an absentee ballot harvesting scheme at New York
nursing homes during the 1980s that led to changes in the law limiting
who may help a nursing home resident fill out a ballot. It was among
rules that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo suspended last month for the coronavirus
pandemic.

## The president, vice president and cabinet members have voted by mail recently.

Mr. Trump, while criticizing mail voting, recently
[acknowledged](https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1247658663617138691?s=20)that
in March he voted absentee by mail in his adopted home state of Florida.
In the 2018 midterm elections, Mr. Trump voted absentee by mail from New
York.

Mr. Trump is hardly the only administration official to vote by mail.
Vice President Mike Pence voted absentee by mail for both the primary
and general election in 2018. Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services
secretary, also voted absentee in 2018 and Wilbur Ross, the commerce
secretary, has voted absentee 15 times in the last 15 years, according
to Florida’s voter file. Mr. Ross, like Mr. Trump, voted absentee for
Florida’s primary last month.

Senator Bernie Sanders last week called upon the nation to prepare to
mail vote in the November 3 general election.

“God forbid that this pandemic extends month after month after month
after month and that people are unable to vote in the fall,” Mr. Sanders
said, urging that paper ballots be readied for everyone.
