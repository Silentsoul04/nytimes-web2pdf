<div class="css-53u6y8">

The [coronavirus continues to spread
worldwide](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus), with over
1.2 million confirmed cases and at least 72,000 dead. In the United
States, there have been at least 350,000 cases and more than 10,500
deaths, [according to a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article).

The
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/technology/coronavirus-masks-shortage.html)
is [spreading very
quickly](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html).
Older Americans, those with underlying health conditions and [those
without a social safety
net](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-homeless.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes)
are the most vulnerable to the infection and to its [societal
disruption](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/coronavirus-usa-03-16).

Though life as we know it is sharply off kilter, there are measures you
can take.

Most important: *Do not panic*. With a clear head and [some simple
tips](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/politics/coronavirus-guidelines.html),
you can help reduce your risk, prepare your family and do your part to
protect others.

## Stay home

### It can be its own challenge. Here are some tips.

For people fortunate enough to be able to stay home, being stuck inside
24 hours a day for weeks on end is unlike anything any of us has ever
experienced. It’s a whole new set of stressors and unique experiences —
on top of the very real [cabin
fever](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/business/coronavirus-families-cabin-fever.html)
that can set in. But as difficult as sheltering in place can be,
remember that it’s all about keeping you, your loved ones and your
community safe.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

First, remember that it’s OK to feel stressed and unproductive; [give
yourself permission to feel whatever it is you’re
feeling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/smarter-living/coronavirus-coping-tips.html).
Because we’re spending so much time online, it can feel like you’re
falling behind — *why haven’t I finished that book and knitted that
scarf and cooked that feast yet?\!* — [“but staying inside and attending
to basic needs is
plenty.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/style/productivity-coronavirus.html)
And if you have children, [acknowledge that these changes to daily life
are
difficult](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/parenting/coronavirus-help-anxious-kid.html).

Among those basic needs is organizing and cleaning your home, both
vastly different tasks than they used to be. To keep the home running
smoothly, consider these [tips to keep your appliances functioning, the
mess to a minimum and the clutter at
bay](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/smarter-living/protect-your-home-against-the-onslaught.html)
and [changes you could make in how you do
laundry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/style/how-to-do-laundry-coronavirus.html).

As for cleaning your home, prioritize high-touch surfaces, including
door knobs, light switches, refrigerator and microwave doors, drawer
pulls, TV remotes, counters and table tops, toilet handles and faucet
handles. [Here’s everything you need to know about cleaning your
home](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/clean-home-coronavirus.html).
But remember: You’re dealing with potentially harmful chemicals, [so
don’t accidentally poison yourself while
cleaning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/smarter-living/coronavirus-clean-home-house-disinfect.html).

Finally: [Don’t forget to keep
moving](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/well/move/steps-walking-longevity-health.html).
It’s good for your health, mind and soul.

## When going outside, be extra cautious

### You can do your part to help your community and the world. Do not get close to other people.

This is called “[social
distancing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/smarter-living/coronavirus-social-distancing.html)”
or “physical distancing,” and is basically a call to stand far away from
other people, even if you have no underlying health conditions or
coronavirus symptoms. Experts believe the coronavirus [travels through
droplets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html),
so limiting your exposure to other people is a good way to protect
yourself.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Avoid public transportation when possible, limit nonessential travel,
work from home and skip social gatherings. You can go outside, as long
as you avoid being in close contact with people.

*\[How to keep your distance:* [*A guide to help you make the right
decisions*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/live/coronavirus-quarantine-social-distancing.html)*\]*

## Consider wearing a mask in public

### **The C.D.C. advises all Americans to wear cloth masks in public. President Trump says it won’t be mandatory.**

[This C.D.C.
recommendation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html)
is a shift in federal guidance, and reflects [concerns that the
coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no
symptoms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html).

Until now, experts at the C.D.C. had been saying that ordinary people
didn’t need to wear masks unless they were sick and coughing. Part of
the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers
who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short
supply. (The New York Times and other news outlets had been reporting
the C.D.C.’s previous guidance.)

Top officials at the C.D.C. had been pushing for Mr. Trump to advise
everyone — even people who appear to be healthy — to wear a mask when
shopping at the grocery store or going out in other public places, to
avoid unwittingly spreading the virus. Public health officials have
stressed that N95 masks and surgical masks should be saved for
front-line doctors and nurses, who have been in dire need of protective
gear.

Mask wearing doesn’t replace hand washing and social distancing.

guidance*](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-N95-mask-DIY-face-mask-health.html)

## Wash your hands. With soap. Then wash them again.

### It’s not sexy, but it works.

Wash your hands, wash your hands, [*wash your
hands*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/how-to-wash-your-hands-coronavirus.html).
That splash-under-water flick won’t cut it anymore.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A refresher: Wet your hands and scrub them with soap, taking care to get
between your fingers and under your nails. Wash for at least 20 seconds
(or about the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice), and dry.
Make sure you get your thumbs, too. The C.D.C. also recommends you
[avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed
hands](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html)
([tough one, we
know](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/health/stop-touching-your-face-coronavirus.html)).

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which should be rubbed in for about 20
seconds, can also work, but the gel must contain at least 60 percent
alcohol. (No, Tito’s Handmade Vodka [doesn’t
work](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/05/us/titos-vodka-coronavirus-trnd/index.html).)

Also, [clean “high-touch”
surfaces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html),
like
[phones](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/smarter-living/clean-your-phone.html),
tablets and handles. [Apple
recommends](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172?mod=article_inline)
using 70 percent isopropyl alcohol, wiping gently. “Don’t use bleach,”
the company said.

To disinfect any surface, the C.D.C. recommends wearing disposable
gloves and washing hands thoroughly immediately after removing the
gloves. Most household disinfectants registered by the Environmental
Protection Agency will work.

Try to stand away from other people, especially if they seem sick. Wave,
bow or give an elbow bump, rather than shaking hands.

## With children, keep calm, carry on and get the flu shot

### **The good news is that cases in children have been very rare.**

Right now, there’s little reason for parents to worry about their
children, the experts say; coronavirus cases in children have been very
rare.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The flu vaccine is a must, as vaccinating children is good protection
for older people. And [take the same
precautions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/parenting/coronavirus-parents-need-to-know.html)
you would during a normal flu season: Encourage frequent hand-washing,
move away from people who appear sick, and get the flu shot.

As in airplanes, it’s always best to make sure your metaphorical oxygen
mask is on before helping others. When [talking to your children about
an
outbreak](https://parenting.nytimes.com/childrens-health/coronavirus-kids-talk),
make sure that you first assess their knowledge of the virus and that
you process your own anxiety. It’s important that you don’t dismiss
their fears and that you speak to them at an age-appropriate level.

Be sure to be in communication with [your child’s
school](https://parenting.nytimes.com/childrens-health/coronavirus-outbreak-schools),
including about early dismissals or possible online instruction. [Be
prepared for schools to
close](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/nyregion/school-closings-ny-nj.html);
many districts and universities around the world have already taken that
step.

It’s also good to communicate with your workplace about child-care
concerns that you have.

If your children are [stuck at
home](https://parenting.nytimes.com/preschooler/coronavirus-schools-lessons?module=latest-filters-feed&action=click&rank=3&position=5),
get some games going, turn on a movie and [try to make it feel a little
like a
vacation](https://parenting.nytimes.com/childrens-health/coronavirus-parents-need-to-know?module=latest-filters-feed&action=click&rank=5&position=5),
at least for the first few days.

*\[For more information about children and the pandemic, read* [*11
Questions Parents May Have About
Coronavirus*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/parenting/coronavirus-parents-need-to-know.html)*.\]*

## Stock up on groceries, medicine and resources

### **Preparation is the best way to protect your family and loved ones.**

Stock up on a 30-day supply of groceries, household supplies and
prescriptions.

That doesn’t mean you’ll need to eat only beans and ramen. Here are tips
to [stock a
pantry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/dining/how-to-stock-a-pantry.html)
with shelf-stable and tasty foods. (Don’t forget the chocolate.) Once
you’ve got the food you’ll need, use [this guide to organize your
pantry.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/realestate/virus-organize-pantry-tips.html)
One quick rule of thumb: Put everyday items at eye level for easy
access. [Also, be careful when you’re buying those
groceries](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/well/eat/coronavirus-shopping-food-groceries-infection.html).

If you take prescription medications, or are low on any over-the-counter
essentials, go to the pharmacy sooner rather than later.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And, in no particular order, make sure you’re set with soap, toiletries,
laundry detergent, toilet paper and, if you have small children,
diapers.

## When it comes to money, uncertainty is the new normal

### It’s unclear what an economic recovery will look like — or when it will come.

The impact of the virus on the United States economy has been swift and
devastating. Nearly 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment
insurance in the past two weeks, and some estimates say the unemployment
rate is likely [higher than at any point since the Great
Depression](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/upshot/coronavirus-jobless-rate-great-depression.html).
As we struggle to fight the virus itself, it’s unclear what an economic
recovery will look like — or when it will come.

If you’re filing for unemployment, there is a lot to know, so [read this
guide on unemployment
insurance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/your-money/unemployment-insurance-coronavirus.html).
(You should also be prepared for a potentially [tough journey through
bureaucracy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-unemployment-benefits.html).)

Don’t forget to work on your emergency fund; [here’s how to keep
building it during a financial
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/your-money/coronavirus-emergency-fund.html).

For Americans with a retirement account, it has been gut-wrenching to
watch double-digit percentages of it evaporate in a matter of weeks. Not
only have we seen the market’s [largest single-day
drop](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/business/stock-market-drops-recap.html#link-7c85d039)
since Black Monday, in 1987, but [all of the gains from the past few
years have essentially been wiped
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/business/coronavirus-trump-stock-market.html).

But for long-term investors — which is what most of us should be — the
age-old advice still holds: Do nothing and just wait it out.

“The only two days that really matter in investing are the day you buy
and the day you sell. All the ups and downs in between are simply
noise,” Mel Lindauer, co-author of “The Bogleheads’ Guide to
Investing,” said in [this guide on how to keep calm during a market
crash.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/smarter-living/corona-stock-market-tips-dealing-with-financial-crash-crisis.html)

For all of your other money questions, our Your Money team has put
together two handy guides: [This personal finance

when to buy more stocks, whether you should refinance your mortgage and
much more; and [this Q\&A covers the stimulus
package.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html)

## Stay informed

### Knowing what is accurate can protect you and your family.

There’s a lot of information flying around, and knowing what is going on
will go a long way toward protecting your family.

*\[Stay Informed:* [*The New York Times is providing free coverage of
the
crisis*](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)*.\]*

Johns Hopkins has a [comprehensive web
guide](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/), as does [Harvard Medical
School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-resource-center).
The C.D.C. has up-to-date information, and your local health department
is a great resource for questions.

## Call your doctor if you are feeling sick

If you develop a high fever, shortness of breath or another, more
serious symptom, call your doctor.

There’s a good chance you won’t be tested: Testing for coronavirus is
[still
inconsistent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-testing-cdc.html)
— [there are not enough
kits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/testing-coronavirus.html),
and it’s dangerous to go into a doctor’s office and risk infecting
others. Also, check the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsteps-when-sick.html)
and your local health department for advice about how and where to be
tested.
