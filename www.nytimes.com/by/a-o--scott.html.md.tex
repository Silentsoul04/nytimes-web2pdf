As a child, A.O. Scott dreamed of being a rock critic. After dropping
out of graduate school, he worked as a book critic, and accidentally
became a film critic when The New York Times hired him in 2000. Doubling
down on that bizarre decision, the paper named him chief film critic in
2004, a title he currently shares with Manohla Dargis. Mr. Scott has
continued to dabble in literary criticism for The Book Review (and
occasionally for other publications) and writes for The Times Magazine
whenever he can. He also makes frequent appearances on radio and
television, especially during Oscar season.
