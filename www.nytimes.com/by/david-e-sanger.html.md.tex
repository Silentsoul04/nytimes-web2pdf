\subsection{}

David E. Sanger is a national security correspondent and a senior
writer. In a 36-year reporting career for The New York Times, he has
been on three teams that have won Pulitzer Prizes, most recently in 2017
for international reporting. His newest book, ``The Perfect Weapon: War,
Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age,'' examines the emergence of
cyberconflict as the primary way large and small states are competing
and undercutting each other, changing the nature of global power.
