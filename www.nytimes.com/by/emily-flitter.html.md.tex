Emily Flitter covers banking and Wall Street for The New York Times.
Before joining The Times in 2017, she spent eight years at Reuters,
writing about politics, financial crimes and the environment. She
covered Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and has also reported
from parts of the United States affected by tragedy, including the East
Texas communities flooded by Hurricane Harvey in 2017; the city of
Roseburg, Ore., where nine people were killed in a mass shooting; and
Ferguson, Mo., the site of protests that followed the killing of an
unarmed black man by a police officer.
