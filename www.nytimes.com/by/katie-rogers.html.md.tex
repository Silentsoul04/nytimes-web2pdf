  President Trump does not always watch her briefings, and even his
  allies say she risks being known more for ``hitting the press with a
  two-by-four'' than advancing his priorities.

  Ya sea que enfrente la pérdida de un familiar o la muerte de casi
  150.000 estadounidenses en una pandemia creciente, el mandatario
  estadounidense casi nunca exhibe empatía. Se lo inculcó su padre.

  Whether he is dealing with the loss of a family member or the deaths
  of nearly 150,000 Americans in a surging pandemic, President Trump
  almost never displays empathy in public. He learned it from his
  father.
