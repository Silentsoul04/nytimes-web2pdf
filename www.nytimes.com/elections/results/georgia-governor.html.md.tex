Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/kemp-abrams-georgia-governor-elections.html}{is
hoping to become the first African-American woman to be elected
governor} anywhere in the United States. Brian Kemp, the Republican
nominee and the secretary of state, wants to keep his party in power in
the Capitol. The race has been among the country's most expensive and
vitriolic, and it is a test of whether sophisticated efforts to attract
and mobilize new voters can help Democrats win in a fast-changing
Georgia.
