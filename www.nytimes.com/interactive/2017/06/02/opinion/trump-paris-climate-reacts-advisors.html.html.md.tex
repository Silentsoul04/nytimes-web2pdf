Many prominent business executives have advocated for policies to
address climate change. They've made the case not just on environmental
grounds but on commercial ones, saying that American competitiveness
would suffer if the United States abdicated leadership on climate.

Now that President Trump has ignored that advice and decided to withdraw
the United States from the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html}{Paris
climate agreemen}t, executives who disagree with him ought to stand up
for what they believe. Otherwise, they are lending their own credibility
and implicit support, and that of their companies, to his
environmentally, diplomatically, and economically self-defeating
position.

Some of the most powerful corporate honchos are on the president's
advisory panels: the Strategic and Policy Forum and the Manufacturing
Jobs Initiative. Why? If they won't distance themselves from this White
House over its radical position on climate, what would it take?

Below, we are tracking statements from all executives who are part of
these groups. The list will be updated.
