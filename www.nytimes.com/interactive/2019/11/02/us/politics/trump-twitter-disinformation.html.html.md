In September, an obscure Twitter account promoting a fringe belief about
an anti-Trump cabal within the government tweeted out a hashtag:
\#FakeWhistleblower.

It was typical for the anonymous account, which traffics in far-right
content and a conspiracy theory known as QAnon, some of whose adherents
think that satanic pedophiles control the “deep state.” The Federal
Bureau of Investigation recently labeled QAnon a potential [domestic
terror
threat](https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-documents-conspiracy-theories-terrorism-160000507.html).

Still, that did not stop others, including a Republican congressional
candidate, from quickly picking up the hashtag and tweeting it. Within a
week, hundreds of QAnon believers and “MAGA” activists had joined in,
posting memes and bogus reports to undermine the complaint by a
government
[whistle-blower](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/podcasts/the-daily/whistleblower-complaint-trump-maguire.html?searchResultPosition=34)
that President Trump had pressed Ukraine’s leader for dirt on former
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son.

Then Mr. Trump tweeted the hashtag himself.

Such is the frenetic life cycle of conspiracy-driven propaganda, fakery
and hate in the age of the first Twitter presidency. Mr. Trump, whose
own tweets have warned of deep-state plots against him, accused the
House speaker of treason and labeled Republican critics “human scum,”
has helped spread a culture of suspicion and distrust of facts into the
political mainstream.

The president is also awash in an often toxic torrent that sluices into
his Twitter account — roughly 1,000 tweets per minute, many intended for
his eyes. Tweets that tag his handle, @realDonaldTrump, can be found
with hashtags like \#HitlerDidNothingWrong, \#IslamIsSatanism and
\#WhiteGenocide. While filters can block offensive material, the
president clearly sees some of it, because he dips into the frothing
currents and serves up noxious bits to the rest of the world.

By retweeting suspect accounts, seemingly without regard for their
identity or motives, he has lent credibility to white nationalists,
anti-Muslim bigots and obscure QAnon adherents like VB Nationalist, an
anonymous account that has promoted a hoax about top Democrats
worshiping the Devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.

<div class="g-ad rad-ad-wrapper">

<div class="place-ad" data-slot-id="mid5" data-position="mid">

</div>

</div>

“I’ve been retweeted by the President of the United States, President
Trump\!” replied VB Nationalist, who gained thousands of followers after
the high-level boost and took it as a sign of encouragement, adding,
“Tell me again, how he doesn’t care about us.”

To assess this unprecedented moment, The New York Times examined Mr.
Trump’s interactions with Twitter since he took office, reviewing each
of his more than 11,000 tweets and the hundreds of accounts he has
retweeted, tracking the ways he is exposed to information and
replicating what he is likely to see on the platform. The result,
including new data analysis and previously unreported details, offers
the most comprehensive view yet of a virtual world in which the
president spends significant time mingling with extremists, impostors
and spies.

Fake accounts tied to intelligence services in China, Iran and Russia
had directed thousands of tweets at Mr. Trump, according to a Times
analysis of [propaganda
accounts](https://about.twitter.com/en_us/values/elections-integrity.html#data)
suspended by Twitter. Iranian operatives tweeted anti-Semitic tropes,
saying that Mr. Trump was “being controlled” by global Zionists, and
that pulling out of the Iran nuclear treaty would benefit North Korea.
Russian accounts tagged the president more than 30,000 times, including
in supportive tweets about the Mexican border wall and his hectoring of
black football players. Mr. Trump even retweeted a phony Russian account
that said, [“We love you, Mr.
President\!”](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/18/twitter-suspends-fake-tennessee-gop-account-later-linked-russian-troll-farm/776937001/)

In fact, Mr. Trump has retweeted at least 145 unverified accounts that
have pushed conspiracy or fringe content, including more than two dozen
that have since been suspended by Twitter. Tinfoil-hat types and racists
celebrate when Mr. Trump shares something they promote. After he tweeted
his support for white farmers in South Africa, replies included “DONALD
IS KING\!” and “No black man can develop land.”

The president gets some of his questionable material on Twitter from the
47 accounts he follows that show up in his feed, a [curated
timeline](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline) of
tweets that come mostly from his family, celebrities, Fox News hosts and
Republican politicians, some of whom in turn follow Twitter accounts
that promote QAnon or express anti-Islam or white nationalist views.

QAnon-related accounts have potentially migrated to the president’s
iPhone courtesy of retweets by [Donald Trump
Jr.](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor),
the Fox News anchor [Maria
Bartiromo](https://www.foxbusiness.com/person/b/maria-bartiromo) and the
conservative commentator [Eric
Bolling](https://static.macmillan.com/static/smp/eric-bolling/), all of
whom Mr. Trump follows. The younger Mr. Trump has also retweeted Russian
intelligence operatives pushing divisive stories about immigration and
voter fraud.

Trolls and fringe elements quickly figured out that the best way to
reach Mr. Trump is to appeal to his ego. Last year, an anonymous account
with a profile photo of the actor Kurt Russell and posts promoting QAnon
tagged Mr. Trump in a tweet, declaring, “You’re the greatest President
of my lifetime, Sir.” It was not really Mr. Russell, but Mr. Trump
retweeted it with a “Thank you\!,” helping the account add 2,900
followers that day, before Twitter eventually suspended it.

<div class="g-ad rad-ad-wrapper">

<div class="place-ad" data-slot-id="mid6" data-position="mid">

</div>

</div>

Authentic or not, the most fervent MAGA and QAnon accounts — at least
23,000 of his followers have QAnon references in their profiles — form a
dependable Greek chorus that exploits the tricks of the medium to
amplify the president’s message. Mr. Trump benefits from the activism of
his online supporters and the platform’s algorithms, which tend to
reward the most partisan content within digital communities.

But the constant exposure to the worst elements of social media poses
risks. [Clint Watts](https://www.fpri.org/contributor/clint-watts/), a
former F.B.I. agent and a cybersecurity expert who studies propaganda
campaigns on social media, said the time Mr. Trump spent on Twitter
“gives you an amazing opportunity to game the president.”

“You are very clearly capable of using Twitter to entice and influence
this president,” he said. “You can distort the guy’s views from your
house.”

Mr. Trump retweeted three videos from a British far-right figure in 2017
purportedly showing Muslims committing acts of violence. Each of the
videos was either highly misleading or was posted with a false

Since the dawn of the internet, the nation’s leaders have been largely
sheltered from the storm of disinformation and bile that churns on its
fringes. Social media barely existed during Bill Clinton’s presidency,
George W. Bush’s reference to “the Google” betrayed his unfamiliarity
and Barack Obama chafed at being [denied an
iPhone](https://fortune.com/2016/06/10/president-obamas-new-smartphone-is-more-like-a-toddler-phone/)
but agreed to it.

But with the arrival of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Twitter managed to
connect the ultimate seat of power to the darkest corners of the web for
the first time. There is little evidence that Mr. Trump harbors concerns
about promoting accounts that traffic in fake or inflammatory material.

The White House declined to comment for this article and turned down an
interview request with the president. But at a White House “[social
media
summit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/us/politics/white-house-social-media-summit.html?searchResultPosition=2)”
in July that brought together far-right activists and provocateurs, Mr.
Trump expressed appreciation for the fodder he sampled on Twitter.

“The crap that you think of,” he said, “is unbelievable.”

#### <span>Mastering the Craft</span>

The path to \#FakeWhistleblower stretches back to a seminal conspiracy
theory in Trump World: \#FakeBirthCertificate.

Mr. Trump’s [campaign to sow
doubts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video)
about Mr. Obama’s birthplace, as he was considering running for
president himself in 2012, showcased his talent for propagating a useful
lie. It also overlapped with his growing presence on Twitter.

When his account was created in 2009, the three-year-old platform was
just beginning to extend its reach beyond a community of journalists,
techies and other early adopters. Over time, as high-profile public
figures joined and Twitter allowed for longer messages, its influence
grew as a forum for people to comment in real time about live events,
world leaders to make official pronouncements and celebrities to
interact with fans. Twitter said [earlier this
year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/07/twitter-reveals-its-daily-active-user-numbers-first-time/)
that it had 126 million daily active users.

<div class="g-ad rad-ad-wrapper">

<div class="place-ad" data-slot-id="mid7" data-position="mid">

</div>

</div>

For Mr. Trump, a Twitter account quickly proved useful for promoting
himself, sounding off about politics and, eventually, amplifying his
attacks on Mr. Obama. By the time he started tweeting the birther smear
in November 2011, his fans had already been doing the same, creating
memes and hashtags like \#FakeBirthCertificate, first used for that
purpose in April 2011 by a supporter who cited Mr. Trump in the tweet.

After Mr. Trump started [tweeting on his
own](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/20/oh-no-the-day-trump-learned-to-tweet-1070789)
in early 2013 — he previously had help from an assistant — he was soon
recycling misinformation. He retweeted an anti-Obama account that had
tweeted at him, “The birth certificate that you forced Obama to show is
a computer generated forgery.” And he [spun
conspiracies](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/411247268763676673?lang=en)
within conspiracies, tweeting: “How amazing, the State Health Director
who verified copies of Obama’s ‘birth certificate’ died in plane crash
today. All others lived.”

Mr. Trump’s experience using Mr. Obama as a punching bag made him adept
at weaponizing what he found on Twitter when he decided to run for
president. As his following grew, so did his ability to give prominence
to objectionable material and — intentionally or not — those responsible
for it.

In early 2016, he twice retweeted an obscure [white supremacist
account,](https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/politics/donald-trump-retweet-white-genocide/index.html)
@WhiteGenocideTM, that had directed a tweet at him ridiculing Jeb Bush,
an opponent in the Republican primary. The since-suspended account,
which regularly posted neo-Nazi propaganda and listed its location as
“Jewmerica,” gained hundreds of followers in the days after Mr.
Trump’s retweets.

By the time he faced off against Hillary Clinton, a perfect storm had
coalesced on a more polarized and partisan Twitter — bringing together
activists and trolls practiced at spreading conspiracy theories and
hate, and Russian intelligence operatives seeking to foment discord. A
how-to manual titled “[Advanced Meme
Warfare](https://medium.com/@erin_gallagher/advanced-meme-warfare-july-6-2016-cw-5f9287ef36cd)”
circulated online with instructions for creating material to help the
Trump campaign by trashing the Clintons.

“The idea is to stack up so much doubt, emotional appeals, and
circumstantial evidence ON TOP of facts that we create a landslide of
anti-Hill sentiment that permeates through society,” it said.

As memes ricocheted around Twitter, Mr. Trump frequently retweeted them
and made use of hashtags like \#CrookedHillary. After he won the
election, Mr. Trump was asked if he would continue being combative on
Twitter once he settled into the White House. [In an
interview](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-donald-trump-family-melania-ivanka-lesley-stahl/)
with “60 Minutes,” he defended his tweeting as “nothing you should be
ashamed of,” but pledged to change his tone as president.

“I’m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all,” Mr. Trump said.
“I’m going to do very restrained.”

#### <span>Dark Undercurrents</span>

The implications of Mr. Trump’s Twitter habit became apparent early in
his presidency. In short order, he was railing about “fake news,”
questioning the findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and
peddling the fiction that millions of illegal ballots had cost him the
popular vote.

Beyond his own tweets, the president stepped up his practice of
retweeting others, sharing [anti-Muslim
videos](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/us/politics/trump-anti-muslim-videos-jayda-fransen.html)
posted by a British far-right figure who had been retweeted by Ann
Coulter. (He later stopped following Ms. Coulter after she criticized
him for not making progress on the Mexican border wall.)

<div class="g-ad rad-ad-wrapper">

<div class="place-ad" data-slot-id="mid8" data-position="mid">

</div>

</div>

That episode highlighted one of the ways the president sees information
on Twitter. His feed regularly contains tweets from his son, Donald Jr.,
who follows and retweets alt-right figures like Stefan Molyneux, a
Canadian who pushes “white genocide” conspiracy theories and has
promoted white nationalists on his YouTube channel.

The younger Mr. Trump has also followed Lauren Southern, another
Canadian right-wing activist who has promoted the “great replacement”
theory that white populations are being overrun by nonwhite immigrants
with the help of global elites. In May, the president retweeted a post
in which she complained that far-right voices were being suspended on
social media.

Six people the president follows — including Dan Scavino, the White
House social media director — in turn follow Terrence K. Williams, a
comedian who has been retweeted by Mr. Trump frequently. Among the
retweets was a phony smear claiming that a Muslim congresswoman had
partied on the anniversary of Sept. 11, and a conspiracy theory linking
the Clintons to the suicide of the imprisoned sex offender Jeffrey
Epstein.

Beyond the people he follows, there is another potential pathway to the
president on Twitter — his “mentions,” the surging stream of tweets and
replies that are directed at him by tagging his handle.

Fake accounts that Twitter identified as being run by foreign
intelligence agencies have made frequent use of this tactic to try to
get his attention: Russian accounts targeted Mr. Trump with tweets
making the false assertion that Russia did not hack the Democratic
National Committee’s emails. A Chinese account directed a tweet at him
calling CNN “goofy commies.” And an Iranian account heckled him, saying,
“Every morning that American people wakeup, they are nervous about your
new tweets.”

The odds of his seeing a tagged post amid the deluge are slim, in part
because Twitter’s algorithms try to screen out objectionable material
and his account may employ filters. Some of his Twitter activity is also
managed by Mr. Scavino. Still, Mr. Trump spends time looking at tweets
that mention him or hashtags that interest him.

The content he chooses to retweet is similar to his own: mostly partisan
attacks and praise for himself, with occasional inflammatory material
mixed in. While it is not always clear whether his retweets are intended
to endorse their authors, the president is effectively launching those
accounts into the public eye.

On St. Patrick’s Day last March, while awaiting the conclusion of the
Mueller report, Mr. Trump went on a [daylong Twitter
tirade](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fifty-two-tweets-in-34-hours-how-a-trump-twitter-frenzy-defined-a-weekend/2019/03/23/3bed256c-4bf0-11e9-93d0-64dbcf38ba41_story.html),
batting out more than 30 tweets that appear to have come from extended
immersion in the streams flowing through his account.

The morning dawned with a 6:01 a.m. barb from Donald Trump Jr. — “So
many stains on the \#GhostofJohnMcCain” — presaging several tweets from
the president an hour later attacking the deceased senator over old
grudges. At the same time, amid a rapidly building flood of mentions,
there was a plea directed at him to “reverse the replacement” of white
people, a tweet from an account with an anti-Semitic name demanding Fox
News undo the suspension of the host Jeanine Pirro for anti-Muslim
comments, and hundreds of references to QAnon.

<div class="g-ad rad-ad-wrapper">

</div>

The president shared a conspiracy-minded post by William Craddick, a
right-wing writer who peddled the [“pizzagate”
hoax](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/anatomy-of-a-fake-news-scandal-125877/)
that Democratic politicians secretly ran a child-trafficking ring out of
a Washington pizzeria. “Russiagate,” Mr. Craddick wrote, “was designed
in part to help the UK counter Russian influence by baiting the United
States into taking a hard line against them.” And Mr. Trump sent out a
tweet by Jack Posobiec, another pizzagate promoter, linking to a news
story about Latino gang members stabbing and burning a teenager.

By nightfall, Mr. Trump had retweeted an obscure QAnon follower who, a
few weeks earlier, had pushed the Democratic-pedophilia smear. His
retweet of that account — whose profile image is a stylized “Q” wearing
a red MAGA hat — drew notice on the online message boards of 4chan,
which were abuzz with speculation that the president had tacitly
approved of QAnon theories.

The binge ended at 9 p.m., when Mr. Trump tweeted, “MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN\!”

#### <span>Promoting Conspiracies</span>

QAnon entered the public consciousness in October 2017, when someone
using the code name “Q” began posting on 4chan, claiming to have secret
knowledge of a conspiracy within a Democrat-controlled “deep state” to
oust Mr. Trump in a coup.

According to Q’s groundless theory, Mr. Trump was aware of the plot and
was quietly working to unravel it with Robert S. Mueller III, the
special counsel, using the Russia investigation as a cover to sweep up
the perpetrators through mass arrests. The most extreme adherents of
[what became known as
QAnon](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-three-conspiracy-theorists-took-q-sparked-qanon-n900531)
— short for “Q Anonymous” — also postulate that the deep state is part
of a global network of corrupt elites involved in Satanism, pedophilia
and cannibalism.

Remarkably, this conspiracy would migrate from the dark fringes of
social media and into conservative political circles, where it took root
among a segment of Mr. Trump’s most fervent supporters. People holding Q
signs have shown up at [Trump
rallies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/what-is-qanon.html),
and the “Q” symbol found its way into a “Women for Trump” 2020 [campaign
video](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-campaign-ad-features-qanon-signs).

Last year, two QAnon disciples were arrested in separate episodes, and
in May the F.B.I. included QAnon in an intelligence bulletin warning of
potential violence stemming from “anti-government, identity-based and
fringe political conspiracy theories,” particularly as the 2020 election
approaches.

There are few places where QAnon’s visibility has been greater than on
Twitter, where Mr. Trump has helped propagate it. Although Mr. Trump
does not follow any QAnon-related accounts, some in his Twitter circle
do.

Bill Mitchell, a conservative podcaster who promotes QAnon, is followed
by nine people whom the president follows and has potentially appeared
in his feed more than a dozen times. The president has frequently
retweeted him, including one post advancing the discredited suggestion
that Mr. Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump’s phones in 2016.

<div class="g-ad rad-ad-wrapper">

<div class="place-ad" data-slot-id="mid10" data-position="mid">

</div>

</div>

In an email to the Times, Mr. Mitchell said he considered the
president’s retweets “a hat-tip without an overt endorsement.” He
believes that the president is deliberately provocative on Twitter to
keep political enemies off balance and unable to “think strategically,”
he said.

“Through his tweets, President Trump keeps the Democrats and media in a
perpetually heightened emotional state, in this case offense and anger,”
he wrote, adding that he respected QAnon’s leaders as “patriots and
Trump supporters.”

More than 50 accounts that have QAnon references in their profiles — and
dozens more that do not but also promote the conspiracy — appeared among
those followed by Donald Trump Jr.; Ms. Bartiromo; Ronna McDaniel,
chairwoman of the Republican National Committee; Katrina Pierson, a
Trump campaign adviser; Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio; and a handful
of others who are all, in turn, followed by the president.

There is no indication that these people, who collectively follow
thousands of accounts, are aware of the QAnon presence that lurks there,
much less support it.

But the potential for QAnon accounts to appear in the presidential feed
underscores the viral nature of disinformation on Twitter, where a tweet
can hatch on the fringes, hopscotch through layers of accounts and,
aided by hashtags and bots, gain wide currency.

On Thursday evening, a QAnon promoter tweeted an unsubstantiated yarn
that years ago he overheard a key witness in the impeachment inquiry
bad-mouthing America and talking up “Obama & globalism.” QAnon accounts
passed it around, and by the next morning it had been retweeted by Mr.
Posobiec, who in turn was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr. — in less than
24 hours, the story had wormed its way into the president’s Twitter
circle.

And it has happened before. During a busy Sunday morning of tweeting in
August, Ms. Bartiromo retweeted an anonymous account called @QBlueSkyQ
that had posted a series of conspiratorial messages about the Russia
investigation, along with a video snippet of her Fox interview with
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide arrested in the
scandal.

Even a glance at @QBlueSkyQ’s profile would have revealed that it was a
die-hard QAnon account. It has tweeted doctored images and fake memes
promoting [a
falsehood](https://theoutline.com/post/7621/slender-man-for-boomers-andrenochrome-qanon?zd=2&zi=oxrjefai)
that top Democrats sexually torture children to harvest adrenochrome — a
chemical derived from adrenaline — for a life-extending elixir. The
@QBlueSkyQ retweet was one of at least a half-dozen times Ms. Bartiromo
helped circulate such accounts, though none of the posts dealt with the
QAnon conspiracy directly. Ms. Bartiromo declined to comment.

QAnon accounts have also been retweeted by Mr. Bolling, a former Fox
News commentator. Mr. Bolling said that he had no idea any account he
retweeted was connected to QAnon, and that it was unfair to expect him
to “vet every account that I retweet.”

“I wouldn’t have done it had I known,” he said. “I have nothing to do
with QAnon.”

Mr. Bolling retweeted an anonymous QAnon account called @K12Lioness
several times, most of it partisan political material and all unrelated
to the Q conspiracy. But in between the run-of-the-mill tweets that
caught his attention, the account was also pumping out vile memes and
messages from the deepest fringes of the QAnon universe, like this post
in June:

“The Democrats have lost their minds (adrenochrome) eating baby parts.
MY GOD Americans WAKE UP\!\!”

#### <span>Deploying the Trolls</span>

Mr. Trump was two weeks from his inauguration in January 2017 when he
tweeted, “So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never
even requested an examination of the computer servers?”

<div class="g-ad rad-ad-wrapper">

It would be the start of a relentless campaign, continuing to the
present, to dispute that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election.
Eventually, the narrative would merge with another — that Mr. Biden
intervened in Ukraine to protect his son’s business interests — in the
[now-infamous phone
call](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/trump-ukraine-whistleblower.html)
in which Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine’s president to search for the
D.N.C.’s email server, implying without evidence that it was somewhere
in his country.

That effort began within days of Mr. Biden’s official campaign
announcement in April, when a Trump supporter tweeted a meme of Mr.
Biden with the words, “China & Ukraine, Quid Pro Joe.” The post prompted
another Trump fan to put a hashtag to use: \#QuidProJoe. The
\#QuidProJoe and \#FakeWhistleblower hashtags had both been created
years earlier for issues unrelated to Mr. Biden and Ukraine, but were
dusted off and put into service by Trump supporters.

The \#QuidProJoe hashtag remained relatively dormant until a few weeks
later, when it was retweeted seven times by a pro-Trump, bot-like
account that cranks out more than 100 tweets a day, including QAnon and
fervent anti-Democratic material. The hashtag steadily gained currency,
and by September, when news erupted of the whistle-blower complaint
filed a month earlier, it was part of a growing arsenal of social media
tools seized on by Mr. Trump’s supporters, including Donald Jr.

A slew of hashtags — nearly all of them created by anonymous, unverified
accounts, some connected to QAnon — have been deployed on Twitter in
recent months attacking the impeachment inquiry, and in particular
Representative [Adam
Schiff](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/10/768048653/adam-schiff-the-surprising-face-of-the-impeachment-inquiry-of-president-trump),
the California Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee. Many
have crude names, like \#LyingSackOfSchiff, \#SchiffForBrains and
\#FullOfSchiff.

So far, none of those hashtags has gotten a presidential tweet. But
every day, Mr. Trump offers his Twitter fans reason for hope.

On Oct. 19, between tweeting “Shifty Schiff is Corrupt” and retweeting
an anonymous account that regularly traffics in alt-right and Russian
propaganda, the president tweeted out a fresh hashtag being pushed by
his supporters: \#StopTheCoup.

Twitter went wild.

The New York Times reviewed every tweet and retweet sent by President
Trump from Jan. 20, 2017, through Oct. 15, 2019. Retweets include those
with and without comment. The Times reviewed each account retweeted by
Mr. Trump and determined whether the account was verified or not. The
Times then evaluated the unverified accounts to determine whether they
had been suspended by Twitter or had tweeted conspiracy theories.
