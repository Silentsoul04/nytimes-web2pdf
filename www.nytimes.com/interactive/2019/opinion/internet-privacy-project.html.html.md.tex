APRIL 10, 2019

The New York Times is launching an ongoing examination of privacy. We'll
dig into the ideas, history and future of how our information navigates
the digital ecosystem and what's at stake.

Companies and governments are gaining new powers to follow people across
the internet and around the world, and even to peer into their genomes.
The benefits of such advances have been apparent for years; the costs
--- in anonymity, even autonomy --- are now becoming clearer. The
boundaries of privacy are in dispute, and its future is in doubt.
Citizens, politicians and business leaders are asking if societies are
making the wisest tradeoffs. The Times is embarking on this monthslong
project to explore the technology and where it's taking us, and to
convene debate about how it can best help realize human potential.
