IF THERE CAN be said to be a single group of people who have most
effectively counteracted the [monolithic
idea](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/t-magazine/asian-american-comedians.html)
of what it means to be Asian-American — a label that encompasses people
with ancestry from countries in East Asia, the Pacific and South Asia —
it might be the several dozen Asian-American designers who began to
shape the fashion industry in New York beginning in the early ’80s.
Their collective presence corrects at least some of the tokenism that
has often defined the fashion world, where diversity can often be a
one-dimensional gesture.

The very first Asian-American fashion designers were pioneers such as
[Anna
Sui](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/t-magazine/fashion/anna-sui-profile-style.html),
[Vivienne Tam](https://www.viviennetam.com/), [Vera
Wang](https://www.verawang.com/) and [Kimora Lee
Simmons](https://babyphat.com/) — women who launched their labels in a
market dominated by Calvin Klein, Bill Blass, Ralph Lauren, [Michael
Kors](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/t-magazine/michael-kors-80s-photos-inspiration.html),
[Donna Karan](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donna-karan) and
[Marc
Jacobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/t-magazine/marc-jacobs.html).
Each had their own aesthetic: Sui with her peasant blouses and flouncy
skirts; Tam with her updated takes on the traditional cheongsam; Simmons
with her body-conscious velour tracksuits; and Wang, who built a new
bridal vernacular with her clean, minimalist gowns. By the aughts, a new
vanguard of Asian-American designers (here, we use the term to include
both American citizens of Asian descent and Asians who work in America)
were launching their own labels, including [Phillip
Lim](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/t-magazine/phillip-lim-shrimp-recipe.html),
[Richard Chai](https://www.instagram.com/richardchai/?hl=en), [Alexander
Wang](https://www.alexanderwang.com/us-en/), [Peter
Som](https://www.petersom.com/), [Bibhu
Mohapatra](https://www.bibhu.com/), [Derek
Lam](https://www.dereklam.com/us) and others. Their clothes shared no
unifying aesthetic aside from being contemporary — a rebuke to the
Orientalist belief that there is one particular Asian mode of
expression. (Lim recalled early on being asked by reporters why he
didn’t use dragons and red silk brocade in his designs.) Their arrival
also added depth to the notion of who, exactly, could be an American
fashion designer while also announcing a more organic age of inclusion —
these designers, for example, made a point to cast Asian and other
nonwhite models for their shows and campaigns. As they gained acclaim,
their presence was bolstered by the success of more conceptual designers
such as [Jade Lai](https://www.instagram.com/lilmingling/?hl=en),
[Yeohlee Teng](https://yeohlee.com/) and [Mary
Ping](https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/perfect-pairing-collaboration-sculptural-jewelry-mary-ping-piece-a-conviction/).
After the 2008 recession, many independent designers were unable to
sustain themselves alongside luxury conglomerates. Still, those who have
continued — [Jason
Wu](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/t-magazine/jason-wu-newspaper-dress.html),
[Joseph
Altuzarra](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/t-magazine/joseph-altuzarra-paris-fashion-week.html),
[Prabal
Gurung](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/t-magazine/prabal-gurung-book-photos.html),
to name a few — have ushered in the next generation. Jin Kay, Dylan Cao
and Huy Luong of the label
[Commission](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/t-magazine/best-new-fashion-brands.html),
which was created in 2018 and inspired by the stylish Vietnamese and
Korean women of the late ’80s and ’90s, spent time at Lim’s and Gurung’s
labels as well as at bigger European brands like
[Gucci](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/t-magazine/alessandro-michele-gucci-interview.html).
At around the same time, [Peter Do](https://peterdo.net/), who used to
work with [Phoebe Philo at
Celine](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/t-magazine/fashion/celine-phoebe-philo-era-stories-sofia-coppola-stella-tennant.html),
launched his own label in New York. There’s also now ’90s-grunge
inspired designers such as Jenny Cheng, of [Gauntlett
Cheng](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/t-magazine/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-top-10-moments.html),
as well as [Sandy
Liang](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/fashion/sandy-liang-fleece.html),
whose label features raver-like cargo pants for the club kids of the
Lower East Side, among many more.

The rise of these designers can be explained, in part, by the
professionalization of fashion — the [School of Fashion at
Parsons](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/fashion-school/) and the
[Fashion Institute of
Technology](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/fashion-institute-of-technology)
in Manhattan are incubators for talent (in 2010, The New York Times
reported that roughly 70 percent of Parsons’s international students
came from Asia; 23 percent of F.I.T.’s students were Asian or
Asian-American). Their achievements have also helped Asian parents
accept that fashion design can be a replicable pathway to success. And
if many come from families with backgrounds in the garment industry,
much like the Jewish-American designers who preceded them (the
grandparents of Lam, who is of Chinese descent, owned a large
bridal-gown factory in San Francisco; Lim’s mother, who emigrated from
China, worked as a seamstress in Los Angeles), many also found their way
into fashion through other arenas: Lim cites the music videos he used to
watch on MTV as a teenager growing up in Southern California as being
more of a direct influence on him than anything else. “I wanted to be
part of *that* tribe,” he said.

BUT NONE OF this explicitly answers why so many Asian-Americans have
gravitated toward fashion. Asian-American representation in the broader
glamour industry — not only on the red carpets and in fashion shows but
also [in film and
television](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/t-magazine/asian-american-actors-representation.html)
— has been slow to come. There are still too few actors and models of
Asian descent to accurately reflect the diversity of this country, one
where Asian-Americans are approximately 6 percent of the population,
according to the 2018 census. Whatever lingering resistance exists to
*seeing* Asian-Americans speaks to a persistent invisibility — in part
because Asian-Americans don’t neatly fit into the black-white racial
dynamics of America, and also because our own history in this country is
easily diminished or, worse, [often left
unacknowledged](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/t-magazine/japanese-american-novel.html).
The success of these designers is very hard won, as the funders, buyers
and editors in fashion are still essentially the same as they were
decades ago, and because building a brand takes years of dedication
along with significant investment.

Perhaps one reason there are so many Asian-American designers is that
fashion values the concept of presentation — design is a way to connect
to the cultural values of craftsmanship and use of luxury materials so
historically prevalent in East and South Asian countries. Perhaps, too,
the stereotypes surrounding assimilation (especially the model minority)
have made it easier for gatekeepers to accept and take risks on them
(today, 48 of the more than 500 members of the Council of Fashion
Designers of America identify as Asian; by comparison, only 19 identify
as black and 31 as Latinx). More commercially, the popularity of these
American designers translates abroad, as brands such as Lim’s or
Alexander Wang’s proved to be viable in not just the European markets
but in China, South Korea and Japan as well, where consumer spending
power has increased in the last two decades.

Finally, there’s also a less tangible factor, which is that the last
half century of these designers’ work (as well as that of Japanese
designers such as [Rei
Kawakubo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/t-magazine/rei-kawakubo-comme-des-garcons-menswear.html),
[Yohji Yamamoto](https://theshopyohjiyamamoto.com/), [Junya
Watanabe](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/t-magazine/junya-watanabe-interview.html)
and [Issey Miyake](https://www.isseymiyake.com/en/)) has aligned
designers of Asian descent with the avant-garde. Asian invisibility may
still persist, but these designers have become an indelible part of our
collective consciousness when it comes to what we wear and how we choose
to wear it. And that can only grow over time. Yet when you ask Gurung
why there are so many Asian-American designers, he replies, “Are there,
*really*?” There is always, he was pointedly saying, room for more.
