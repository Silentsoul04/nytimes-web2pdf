<div class="rad-story-body">

THE CITY OF ANTWERP in northern Belgium is, somewhat confoundingly, both
Europe’s second busiest seaport and located 50 miles inland from the
nearest sea. For much of the past half millennium, its character has
been defined by this geographical quirk. Sheltered in a nook of the
Scheldt River estuary, it is at once quintessentially European — a city
of medieval cobblestone streets and Gothic Flemish Renaissance buildings
— and directly connected to the globe-spanning shipping routes entered
by the North Sea. Accordingly, it has been one of the continent’s
essential trade hubs as well as a prolific incubator of the avant-garde.

These two identities developed in tandem in the early 1500s, when
Antwerp became, briefly, one of the centers of the West’s rapidly
expanding known world. As Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese merchants began
traveling to and from newly encountered territories during the age of
exploration, up to 40 percent of the globe’s trade passed through
Antwerp’s docks, and along with silk from Turkey, peppercorns and
diamonds from Africa and silver from America came immigrants and new
ideas. “We always know in Antwerp news of everything that goes through
the rest of the provinces of the universe,” the Italian merchant
[Lodovico
Guicciardini](https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000035507)
boasted in 1567. Though this golden age was short lived (the Dutch
blockaded the Scheldt from 1585, when Antwerp surrendered to Spain
during the Eighty Years’ War, until 1795), it forged the city’s rich and
enduring cultural life: The economic boom created a market for art,
allowing for printing shops, coffee houses and guilds to form. In 1663,
[David Teniers the
Younger](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/david-teniers-the-younger),
the master of the Guild of Saint Luke, an association that had been
vital to Antwerp’s artistic development during the 16th century, founded
the [Royal Academy of Fine
Arts](https://www.ap.be/en/royal-academy-fine-arts-antwerp), a school
whose alumni, ranging from [Vincent van
Gogh](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vincent-van-gogh) (1885-86)
to the fashion designer [Demna
Gvasalia](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/t-magazine/gucci-alessandro-michele-balenciaga-vetements-demna-gvasalia.html)
(2002-06), have continued to shape the world’s culture.

ONCE EVERY FEW generations, there is a college or a workshop, a theater
company or a lab that produces a seemingly disproportionate number of
influential graduates: In the 1940s, the artists [Alex
Katz](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/alex-katz), [Roy
DeCarava](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/roy-decarava) and Lois
Dodd passed through [Cooper
Union](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/cooper-union-for-the-advancement-of-science-and-art)
in New York; in the mid 1990s, Central Saint Martins in London nurtured
[Phoebe
Philo](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/t-magazine/phoebe-philo-celine-prophetic-fashion.html),
Stella McCartney and Hussein Chalayan. What is less recognized is the
influence of the Royal Academy in the early ’80s, when its students made
work that would transform the worlds of fashion, art and theater.

Even now, despite its ongoing economic might (to this day, the city is
wealthy from its port and the diamond trade), Antwerp “remains a sort of
village,” says the Belgian artist [Luc
Tuymans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/luc-tuymans-palazzo-grassi-mosaic-la-pelle.html),
who studied painting at the Royal Academy from 1978 to 1979 and still
lives in the city. Perhaps because its growth abruptly ended in 1585,
Antwerp never became a metropolis like London or Paris. “There is an
atmosphere here of a rather small city in which a lot of people are
working together,” says the fashion designer [Dries Van
Noten](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/dries-van-noten.html).
This collaborative spirit, as well as the competition inherent in a
close-knit community, is partly what enabled the designers known as the
Antwerp Six — Van Noten, [Ann
Demeulemeester](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/style/tmagazine/27ann.html),
Dirk van Saene, [Walter Van
Beirendonck](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/t-magazine/walter-van-beirendonck.html),
Dirk Bikkembergs and Marina Yee — along with fellow alumni [Martin
Margiela](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/t-magazine/fashion/martin-margiela-history-fall-winter-2000-show.html),
to transform Antwerp into a capital of intellectual, unconventional
fashion. While the six designers were fiercely individualistic — “We
each wanted to be different from and better than the others,” recalls
Demeulemeester — they were also friends who exchanged ideas from their
own spheres of interest and from nearby cities. Antwerp in the early
’80s was, as in the city’s 16th-century heyday, a breeding ground for
creativity: It was close enough to the exploding youth subcultures of
Berlin and London to feel their echoes but far enough away that those
influences could ferment into new forms. “We look at everything with a
certain distance,” says Van Noten of his city’s residents. “Not a very
far distance, but just one step back. In that way, we can rethink
certain things and do things our own way.”

Since its belle epoque, Antwerp’s mercantile and artistic communities
have converged in its social life. In the ’80s, the city’s abundant
ware­houses helped cultivate a thriving underground scene.
Demeulemeester recalls a favorite nightclub called Cinderella where
“people from the academy, from the harbor and punks” danced together.
Tuymans remembers seeing Belgium’s first punk group, the Kids, perform
in Antwerp not long after they formed there in the late ’70s. Within
this milieu, the pioneering theater director [Ivo van
Hove](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/t-magazine/rufus-wainwright-ivo-van-hove-conversation.html),
who was then a student in the city, met his future partner and
collaborator, the set designer Jan Versweyveld, who was enrolled at the
Royal Academy at the time; they later opened a brasserie to fund their
experimental joint productions, reinforcing Antwerp’s historic marriage
of art and commerce, and making use of the city’s array of affordable,
nontraditional venues (in 1981, they staged their first play, “Rumours,”
in a disused laundromat). And it was in Antwerp’s cafes at the start of
the next decade that the designer [Raf
Simons](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/t-magazine/raf-simons-interview.html)
met many of his lifelong collaborators, including the photographer
[Willy
Vanderperre](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/t-magazine/spring-fashion-cover.html)
and the stylist [Olivier
Rizzo](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/t-magazine/fall-fashion-androgyny.html).
Today, the Antwerp-based artist [Kati
Heck](https://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/kati_heck.htm) captures the
vibrancy of the city’s social world in her large-scale paintings, such
as “Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde” (“The Drinking Song of the Earth’s
Sorrow,” 2017), in which a group of her friends, including the
genre-defying cellist Simon Lenski, are depicted drinking in their
real-life local haunt, the Cafe De Kat.

“There’s something free and artistic about the life here, if one looks
for it, perhaps more than anywhere else,” van Gogh wrote to his brother
Theo from Antwerp in 1886: “There’s gusto and people enjoy themselves.”
For a city whose culture has depended on trade since its inception, on
an openness to whatever innovation comes through its docks, the burden
of tradition is less stifling in Antwerp than it might be for young
artists in less changeable cities. While there is an artistic legacy —
[Pieter
Bruegel](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/arts/design/bruegel-kunsthistorisches-museum-technology-layers.html)
and Peter Paul Rubens both made some of their most important works here
— as well as the legend of the Six to contend with, there is also a
desire for knowledge that is outward-facing rather than self-contented.
Indeed, Van Beirendonck, who has overseen the Royal Academy’s fashion
department since 2007, says the most important quality an applicant can
possess is that they are, above all, “culturally hungry.”
