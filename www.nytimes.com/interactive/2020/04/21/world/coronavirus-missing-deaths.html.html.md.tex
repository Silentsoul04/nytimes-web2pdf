At least 161,000 more people have died during the coronavirus pandemic
than the official Covid-19 death counts report, a review of mortality
data in 28 countries shows --- providing a clearer, if still incomplete,
picture of the toll of the crisis.

Over the last several months, far more people have died in most of these
countries than in previous years, The New York Times found. The totals
include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely
including people who
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/health/treatment-delays-coronavirus.html}{could
not be treated} as hospitals became overwhelmed. These numbers undermine
the notion that many people who have died from the virus may soon have
died anyway.

\hypertarget{where-we-found-higher-deaths-than-normal}{%
\subsubsection{Where we found higher deaths than
normal}\label{where-we-found-higher-deaths-than-normal}}

Note: Excess deaths are estimates that include deaths from Covid-19 and
other causes. Reported Covid-19 deaths reflect official coronavirus
deaths during the period when all-cause mortality data is available,
including figures that were later revised. Reported Covid-19 deaths in
Istanbul are estimated based on the government's statement that 60
percent of the country's cases are in the city.

Mortality data in the middle of a pandemic is not perfect. In most
places, the disparities between the official death counts and the total
rise in deaths reflect limited testing for the virus rather than
intentional undercounting. Officially, more than
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{673,000
people had died worldwide} of the coronavirus as of July 31.

But the total death numbers offer a more complete portrait of the
pandemic, researchers say, especially because most countries report only
those Covid-19 deaths that occur in hospitals.

``Whatever number is reported on a given day is going to be a gross
underestimate,'' said Tim Riffe, a demographer at the Max Planck
Institute for Demographic Research in Germany. ``In a lot of places the
pandemic has been going on for long enough that there has been
sufficient time for late death registrations to come in, giving us a
more accurate picture of what the mortality really was.''

The virus was last to hit Latin America, and excess deaths are still
climbing in several countries. Ecuador recorded about 22,400 more deaths
than usual compared to the same period in the last three years --- about
five times higher than the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/world/americas/ecuador-deaths-coronavirus.html}{reported
number of Covid-19 deaths} in the country during that time. And in Peru,
more than 37,000 excess deaths were recorded from April to June.

Expected deaths in 2020

Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent
partial weeks; Data from weeks 1 to 10 in 2020 was not collected for
Mexico City; Mexico City's 2016-2018 death counts are based on mortality
data released by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and
Informatics (INEGI). Itts 2019-2020 data is based on death certificate
records obtained via the General Directorate of the Civil Registry.

These estimates were made for each country by comparing the total number
of people who died this year to the number of deaths that would be
expected given local mortality trends, adjusted to account for changes
over time. The Economist is also
\href{https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19-excess-deaths-across-countries}{tracking
these deaths}, known as excess deaths, in a similar way.

It is unusual for mortality data to be released so quickly, demographers
say, but many countries are working to provide more comprehensive and
timely information because of the urgency of the coronavirus outbreak.
The data is limited and, if anything, excess deaths are underestimated
because not all deaths have been reported.

``At this stage, it's a partial snapshot,'' said Patrick Gerland, a
demographer at the United Nations. ``It's one view of the problem that
reflects that most acute side of the situation, primarily through the
hospital-based system.''

That is likely to change.

``In the next couple of months,'' Mr. Gerland said, ``a much clearer
picture will be possible.''

Throughout March and early April, many countries across Europe reported
clear deviations from normal patterns of deaths, according to data
released by the
\href{https://www.euromomo.eu/outputs/zscore_country_total.html}{European
Mortality Monitoring Project}, a research group that collects weekly
mortality data from 24 European countries.

But over the last few weeks many countries have returned to normal
levels of death.

Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent

In countries like Belgium and France, authorities have worked to include
Covid-19 deaths outside of hospitals in their daily death reports, or
adjusted the overall Covid-19 death totals once a death is confirmed in
a place like a nursing or retirement home.

Other agencies, like Britain's
\href{https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending20march2020}{Office
for National Statistics}, release mortality data after death
certificates have been processed, confirming those that mention
Covid-19. This provides a more accurate, if delayed, account of
mortality than the hospital figures released each day by
\href{https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/}{Public Health England}.

\hypertarget{not-all-countries-saw-excess-deaths}{%
\subsection{Not all countries saw excess
deaths}\label{not-all-countries-saw-excess-deaths}}

In a handful of countries there has been no clear sign of increased
mortality this year. The reasons for this are varied and will become
clearer in the months ahead as countries process and certify deaths.

In Norway, Denmark and Finland, demographers say the low mortality is
due in part to a less severe flu season this winter --- but also because
these countries were quick to implement severe restrictions to slow the
spread of the virus when their outbreaks were smaller and easier to
contain.

Israel hasn't seen many more deaths than normal through early July, the
latest data available, but a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/world/middleeast/israel-virus-protests-netanyahu.html}{recent
spike in infections} may raise the level of excess deaths in the coming
weeks.

Notes: Data from weeks 1, 52 and 53 are excluded, as they may represent

Age breakdowns in mortality data will also provide a clearer picture of
the role of Covid-19 in excess deaths. Using relative age-standardized
mortality rates, Britain's Office for National Statistics
\href{https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020\#age-standardised-mortality-rates}{found}
that Spain had the highest rate of all European countries during the
peak of the pandemic.

Even taking into account differences in mortality by age, experts say
the death toll to date could have been much worse.

``Today's rise in all-cause mortality takes place under conditions of
extraordinary measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, closed
borders and increased medical care, at least some which have positive
impacts,'' said Vladimir Shkolnikov, a demographer at the Max Planck
Institute for Demographic Research. ``It is likely that without these
measures, the current death toll would be even higher.''

Read more about the methodology and
\href{https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/excess-deaths}{download
data} for excess mortality from The New York Times on GitHub.

To estimate expected deaths, we fit a linear model to reported deaths in
each country from 2015 to January 2020. The model has two components ---
a linear time trend to account for demographic changes and a smoothing
spline to account for seasonal variation. For countries limited to
monthly data, the model includes month as a fixed effect rather than
using a smoothing spline.

Some countries have less historical data available. For countries with
three or fewer years of data, the model uses a simple average of deaths
in the observed years. For the United Kingdom, the model accounts for
the number of bank holidays in a given week, since deaths are not
registered during bank holidays.

\textbf{About the data:} The all-cause mortality data obtained from each
country varies: Some countries publish daily death totals dating back
decades, and others only for the last few years. Places with less
historical data, such as Istanbul, make for rougher historical
comparisons. Historical baselines used to calculate excess deaths do not
adjust for any expected reduction in recent deaths from non-Covid-19
causes or for two deadly flu epidemics in Europe during the winters of
2014-15 and 2017-18. The data in Italy includes towns accounting for 94
percent of the population.

\textbf{Correction:} An earlier version of a chart with this article
misstated the average historical number of deaths in France during the
first week of April. More complete historical data has since been added.
The average for the week was about 11,000, not 9,400.
