LEBANON

Beirut

Explosions
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-blast.html}{erupted
in Lebanon's capital} on Tuesday evening, leveling buildings, damaging
hospitals and shattering windows miles away. At least 100 people were
killed, according to the Lebanese Red Cross.

A shock wave raced from the site of the blasts, Beirut's industrial
waterfront, into the city's densely populated residential neighborhoods
and shopping districts downtown. Dozens of nearby buildings collapsed or
were severely damaged, imagery from the aftermath showed.

Officials said it appeared the blast was caused by the detonation of
more than 2,700 tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate that had been
stored in a warehouse at the port since it was confiscated from a cargo
ship in 2014.

The explosions erupted next to a tall building called the Beirut Port
Silos, which could be seen partially collapsed amid the rubble of nearby
buildings. Several fires burned across the port area, seen in this
panoramic image.

Videos and photos taken from the scene showed a thick cloud of gray
smoke hovering over the Mediterranean before an enormous burst of red
and orange fumes exploded into the sky.
