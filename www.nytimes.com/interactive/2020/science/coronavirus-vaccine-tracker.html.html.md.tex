Work began in January with the deciphering of the
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html}{SARS-CoV-2
genome}. The first vaccine safety trials in humans started in March, but
the road ahead remains uncertain. Some trials will fail, and others may
end without a clear result. But a few may succeed in stimulating the
immune system to produce effective antibodies against the virus.

Here is the status of all the vaccines that have reached trials in
humans, along with a selection of promising vaccines still being tested
in cells or animals.

Process}}{The Vaccine Testing Process}}\label{the-vaccine-testing-process}}

\emph{The development cycle of a vaccine, from lab to clinic.}

PRECLINICAL TESTING: Scientists give the vaccine to \textbf{animals}
such as mice or monkeys to see if it produces an immune response.

PHASE I SAFETY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to a \textbf{small
number of people} to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that
it stimulates the immune system.

PHASE II EXPANDED TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to
\textbf{hundreds of people} split into groups, such as children and the
elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. These trials
further test the vaccine's safety and ability to stimulate the immune
system.

PHASE III EFFICACY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to
\textbf{thousands of people} and wait to see how many become infected,
compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials can
determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. In June, the
F.D.A. said that a coronavirus vaccine would have to
\href{https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-action-help-facilitate-timely-development-safe-effective-covid}{protect
at least 50\% of vaccinated people} to be considered effective.

APPROVAL: Regulators in each country review the trial results and decide
whether to approve the vaccine or not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may
receive emergency use authorization before getting formal approval.

COMBINED PHASES: Another way to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html}{accelerate
vaccine development} is to combine phases. Some coronavirus vaccines are
now in Phase I/II trials, for example, in which they are tested for the
first time on hundreds of people. (Note that our tracker would count a
combined Phase I/II trial as both Phase I and Phase II.)

\textbf{Moderna} develops vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) to
produce viral proteins in the body. They have yet to bring one to the
market. In partnership with \textbf{National Institutes of Health}, they
found that the vaccine
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html}{protects

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html\#link-6509720d}{launched}
a Phase III trial on July 27. The final trial will enroll 30,000 healthy
people at about 89 sites around the United States. The government has
bankrolled Moderna's efforts with nearly \$1 billion in support.\\

The German company \textbf{BioNTech} has entered into collaborations
with \textbf{Pfizer}, based in New York, and the Chinese drug maker
\textbf{Fosun Pharma} to develop their mRNA vaccine. In July, they
posted preliminary results from their Phase I/II trials in the
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20142570v1}{United
States} and
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20140533v1}{Germany}.
They found that the volunteers produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,
as well as immune cells called T cells that respond to the virus. Some
volunteers experienced moderate side effects such as sleep disturbances
and sore arms. On July 27, they announced the
\href{https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200727005800/en/Pfizer-BioNTech-Choose-Lead-mRNA-Vaccine-Candidate}{launch}
of a Phase II/III trial with 30,000 volunteers in the United States and
other countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Germany.

The Trump administration
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{awarded}
a \$1.9 billion contract for 100 million doses to be delivered by
December and the option to acquire 500 million more doses. Meanwhile,
Japan made a

A decade ago, researchers at \textbf{Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center} in Boston developed a method for making vaccines out of a virus
called
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/health/coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-janssen.html}{Adenovirus
26}, or Ad26 for short. \textbf{Johnson \& Johnson} developed vaccines
for Ebola and other diseases with Ad26 and have now made one for the
coronavirus. In March they
received\href{https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-a-lead-vaccine-candidate-for-covid-19-landmark-new-partnership-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-and-commitment-to-supply-one-billion-vaccines-worldwide-for-emergency-pandemic-use}{\$456
million}from the United States government to support their move towards
production. The vaccine has provided protection in

is planning for Phase III trials in September. If their vaccine is
approved, they have hopes of making a billion doses in 2021.\\

PHASE I\\
\includegraphics{https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/10/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/assets/images/russiahealth-800.png}\\
The \textbf{Gamaleya Research Institute}, part of Russia's Ministry of
Health, launched a Phase I trial in June of a vaccine they call
Gam-Covid-Vac Lyo. It is a combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and
Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene. In July, the chair of the
upper house of Russia's Parliament
\href{https://tass.com/society/1181659}{announced} the country may start
vaccine production by the end of the year.\\

The American company \textbf{Merck} announced in May it would develop a
vaccine from vesicular stomatitis viruses, the same approach it
successfully used to produce the only approved vaccine for Ebola. The
company is partnering with \textbf{IAVI} and has received

Maryland-based \textbf{Novavax} has developed a way to stick proteins
onto microscopic particles. They've created vaccines for a number of
different diseases using this platform; their flu vaccine finished Phase
III trials in March. The company launched trials for a Covid-19 vaccine
in May, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has
invested \$384 million in the vaccine. On July 6, Novavax announced a
U.S. government award of
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/health/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-warp-speed.html}{\$1.6
billion to support clinical trials and manufacturing}. If the trials
succeed, Novavax expects to deliver 100 million doses for use in the
United States by the first quarter of 2021. Plants in Europe and Asia
would be able to satisfy more of the world's demand.\\

Canada-based \textbf{Medicago}, partly funded by the cigarette maker
Philip Morris, uses a species of tobacco to make vaccines. They deliver
virus genes into leaves, and the plant cells then create protein shells
that mimic viruses. In July, Medicago
\href{https://www.medicago.com/en/newsroom/medicago-begins-phase-i-clinical-trials-for-its-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/}{launched}
Phase I trials on a plant-based Covid-19 vaccine in combination with

A vaccine from Australia's \textbf{University of Queensland} delivers
viral proteins altered to draw a stronger immune response. The
university launched Phase I trials in July, combining the proteins with
an adjuvant made by \textbf{CSL}. If the results are positive, CSL will
advance late stage clinical trials and expects to make tens of millions
of doses.\\

A second tobacco-based vaccine is in development at \textbf{Kentucky
BioProcessing}, an American subsidiary of British American Tobacco, the
maker of Lucky Strike and other cigarettes. Like Medicago, Kentucky
BioProcessing engineers a species of tobacco called Nicotiana
benthamiana to make viral proteins. The company previously used this
technique to make a drug called Zmapp for Ebola. After preclinical
testing in the spring, they registered a Phase I trial for their
coronavirus vaccine in July.\\

After the SARS epidemic in 2002, \textbf{Baylor College of Medicine}
researchers began developing a vaccine that could prevent a new
outbreak. Despite promising early results, support for the research
disappeared. Because the coronaviruses that cause SARS and Covid-19 are
very similar, the researchers are reviving the project in partnership
with the \textbf{Texas Children's Hospital}.

In addition to their mRNA vaccine, \textbf{Sanofi} is developing a
vaccine based on viral proteins. They are producing the proteins with
engineered viruses that grow inside insect cells. \textbf{GSK} will
supplement these proteins with adjuvants that stimulate the immune
system. The companies expect to enter clinical trials in September. In
July they reached two major agreements for supplying the vaccine next
year. They reached an
\href{https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-07-29-07-00-00}{agreement}
with the British government to provide up to 60 million doses if the
vaccine succeeds in trials. Meanwhile, the United States
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/covid-19-vaccine-sanofi-gsk.html}{will

On July 18, \textbf{North Korea}'s State Commission of Science and
Technology announced on their web site that they had started clinical
trials on a vaccine based on part of the coronavirus spike protein. It's
hard to independently determine how much truth there is in the claim
from the isolated dictatorship. The commission claimed to have tested
the vaccine on animals, but provided no data. What's more, it stated
that effectiveness trials would have to be carried out in another
country ``since there is no case of Covid-19 in DPR Korea.'' That's a
claim outside experts find
