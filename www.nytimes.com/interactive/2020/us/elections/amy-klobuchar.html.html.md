# Amy Klobuchar

The senator from Minnesota is campaigning as a Midwestern pragmatist who
gets things done.

Amy Klobuchar [dropped out of the presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-drops-out.html)
on March 2, 2020. This page is no longer being updated.

<div class="g-section g-basics">

## Who is Amy Klobuchar?

<div class="g-bullets">

59 years old

Born in Plymouth, Minn.; lives in Minneapolis and Washington

Former Hennepin County attorney; elected to the Senate in 2006

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Klobuchar’s signature issues

Ms. Klobuchar, running as an experienced moderate, has emphasized
throughout her presidential campaign that a bipartisan approach is the
Democrats’ best chance at winning the White House.

In May, [she released a $100 billion
plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/us/politics/klobuchar-addiction-plan.html)
to combat drug and alcohol addiction and improve mental health care — an
issue deeply personal to her.

Several weeks later, she unveiled [a list of more than 100
actions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/klobuchar-president-plans.html)
she would take in her first 100 days as president if elected. The list
addressed issues such as voting rights, prescription drugs and antitrust
enforcement. She has also released [a detailed infrastructure
plan](https://medium.com/@AmyforAmerica/amys-plan-to-build-america-s-infrastructure-671b08a10751)
and [a plan to help
seniors](https://medium.com/@AmyforAmerica/senator-klobuchars-plan-for-seniors-efce83143761).

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Amy Klobuchar

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. I didn’t watch the Kavanaugh hearings. What happened?**

Ms. Klobuchar drew attention during [the Senate confirmation hearing for
Brett M.
Kavanaugh](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings.html),
President Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee.

Ms. Klobuchar asked him whether he had ever blacked out drinking.
[“Have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsVtXJtl7lw)*[you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsVtXJtl7lw)*[?”
he shot back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsVtXJtl7lw), to which she
calmly replied, “I have no drinking problem, Judge.”

Justice Kavanaugh later apologized to Ms. Klobuchar, whose father
struggled with alcoholism.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. Does Ms. Klobuchar actually get things done?**

Ms. Klobuchar often focuses her attention on issues that can attract
bipartisan support, like many of the ones she addressed in her “first
100 days” plan. In general, she has staked out more moderate positions
than some of her Democratic competitors on broad issues like [climate
change](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2019/democrats-climate-town-hall/amy-klobuchar-climate-change)
and [health
care](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-campaign.html).

Her bipartisan approach to politics — she takes pride in being able to
“disagree without being disagreeable” — has won her praise from
colleagues on both sides of the aisle and helped her [pass dozens of
bills through
Congress](https://medium.com/@AmyforAmerica/senator-amy-klobuchar-passed-over-100-bills-as-lead-democrat-29327297d2c).

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. What do Minnesotans think of her?**

She is hugely popular in Minnesota and coasted to victory last November
in a state that President Trump nearly won in 2016. She is betting that
[her brand of “Minnesota nice”
politics](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-election.html)
will make her a compelling candidate, particularly to voters in Iowa and
other key Midwestern swing states.

Ms. Klobuchar also loves reminding voters that [she kicked off her
presidential campaign amid a snowstorm in
Minneapolis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-president-2020.html)
in front of supporters sporting snow pants and ski goggles who turned
out by the
thousands.
