A former tech executive warns of the perils of automation and wants to
provide every American with a ``universal basic income.''

Andrew Yang
\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/andrew-yang-drops-out.html}{dropped
out of the presidential race} on Feb. 11, 2020. This page is no longer
being updated.

45 years old

Born in Schenectady, N.Y.; lives in Manhattan

Former technology executive; founded a nonprofit to create jobs; no
prior elected office

Mr. Yang says his experience working in Silicon Valley and leading a
start-up that sought to create jobs gave him an up-close look at the way
automation could affect the economy in the years ahead. His solution? To
give every American a ``universal basic income'' of \$1,000 a month.

universal basic income actually
work?}}{1. How would his proposed universal basic income actually work?}}\label{1-how-would-his-proposed-universal-basic-income-actually-work}}

Mr. Yang's signature campaign proposal is to provide a monthly payment
he calls the freedom dividend. Every American 18 and over would qualify
--- even billionaires. The payments, he argues, would go a long way
toward blunting the impact of automation, which Mr. Yang fears will
cause mass unemployment.

Giving people all that money would come with a huge price tag, and Mr.
Yang suggests paying for it, in part, by imposing a value-added tax of
10 percent.

Mr. Yang announced his campaign for president in February 2018, long
before other candidates. At the time, he truly was a fringe candidate.

But after some unconventional campaigning and appearances on the debate
stage, Mr. Yang found new fans and his fund-raising efforts took off.
Mr. Yang, still a long-shot candidate, now regularly polls in the low
single-digits, which is better than many of his competitors who have
held elective office.

supporters?}}{3. Who are his supporters?}}\label{3-who-are-his-supporters}}

Mr. Yang has developed a devoted internet following known as the ``Yang
Gang.'' His fans have plastered Mr. Yang into memes and produced songs
and music videos about his candidacy.

He has also built one of the most ideologically eclectic coalitions in
the field, drawing support from progressives, libertarians, Trump voters
and disaffected voters. His crowds tend to skew young and male.
