</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Sanders’s signature issues

With an anti-establishment style that has changed little over five
decades, Mr. Sanders has attracted a loyal cadre of fans. He often
boasts, correctly, that some of his agenda items once considered radical
— “[Medicare for
all](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all.html),”
a $15 minimum wage, tuition-free public college — have now been embraced
by many Democrats.

Running for president a second time, he is one of the most-well known
candidates in the race. But he remains something of an outsider: A
self-described democratic socialist, he has never joined the party he
hopes to
lead.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Bernie Sanders

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. What does that mean?**

Democratic socialism [has become a powerful force in American political
life](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/democratic-socialism-facts-history.html),
but its definition is up for debate. Generally, it falls somewhere
between communism and social democracy, which is common in Europe.

Strictly speaking, democratic socialists do not support capitalism,
meaning they want workers to control the means of production. Unlike
communists, democratic socialists also believe that socialism should be
achieved democratically.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. What is Sanders’s plan for student loan debt?**

Mr. Sanders has long called for eliminating tuition at public colleges
and universities. And in June, two months after one of his rivals,
Senator Elizabeth Warren, proposed canceling [most student loan
debt](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-student-debt.html),
Mr. Sanders went even further,
helping[to](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-student-debt.html)[introduce
legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-student-debt.html)
to eliminate *all* of the country’s student debt.

Mr. Sanders earned plaudits for his plan from his supporters, as well as
from some in the education field. But other analysts were skeptical
about its
feasibility.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. He seems to really dislike millionaires. But how much does he make?**

According to 10 years of tax returns that
he[](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/bernie-sanders-taxes.html)[released
in
April](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/bernie-sanders-taxes.html),
Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane O’Meara Sanders, reported income that
topped $1 million in 2016 and 2017, in part from proceeds from his
books.

His income puts him within the top 1 percent of taxpayers, creating some
political awkwardness for the senator, who often speaks against
“millionaires and
billionaires.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-quote">

<div class="quote-bar">

</div>

### “The only way we will win this election and create a government and economy that work for all is with a grassroots movement — the likes of which has never been seen in American history.”
