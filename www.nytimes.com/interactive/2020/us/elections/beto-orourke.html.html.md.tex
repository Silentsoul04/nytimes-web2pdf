The former Texas congressman is seeking to regain the momentum he
enjoyed during his 2018 run for Senate.

Beto O'Rourke

out of the presidential race} on Nov. 1, 2019. This page is no longer

47 years old

Born in El Paso; lives in his hometown

Former three-term congressman representing El Paso, first elected in
2012

Lost his bid to unseat Senator Ted Cruz in 2018

issues}\label{orourkes-signature-issues}}

Following a mass shooting in El Paso in August, Mr. O'Rourke has sought
to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/politics/beto-orourke-2020-trump.html}{reset
his campaign} and train his focus on ``taking the fight to Donald
Trump'' over issues like immigration and gun violence. Rather than
tethering himself to early voting states as he did early in his
campaign, he has now spent a large share of his time in immigrant-rich
communities.

Yes, but narrowly.

As he barnstormed towns, live-streamed his travels and spoke with his
signature gusto, Mr. O'Rourke captured the imagination of Democrats in
deep-red Texas and across the nation. He
came\href{https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate}{}\href{https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-senate}{within
three percentage points of pulling the upset}, and talk of a
presidential campaign soon followed.

Mr. O'Rourke chose to go to Columbia University in part because he
looked up to his uncle, who had tapped into New York's music scene. At
the time, he went by Robert --- Beto was a nickname from El Paso --- and
he played the guitar. He and a few of his friends formed a punk rock
group.

After returning home to El Paso, Mr. O'Rourke
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/us/politics/beto-o-rourke-el-paso-texas.html}{quickly
transitioned from musician to businessman}, using a loan from his
parents to create a web design company and an online newsmagazine. His
brief tenure as a publisher prompted his interest in civic issues and he
joined various local organizations. Mr. O'Rourke was elected to the El
Paso City Council in 2005; he won his seat in Congress seven years
later.

million online} during his first 24 hours as a presidential candidate.
But early on, he also found himself on the defensive. He had to
apologize for joking that his wife, Amy, was home raising their
children, ``sometimes with my help'';
for\href{https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/politics/beto-orourke-wife-white-privilege/index.html}{}\href{https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/politics/beto-orourke-wife-white-privilege/index.html}{writings}

benefiting from white privilege}. He was accused of being entitled after
appearing

Vanity Fair cover story} about the campaign and declaring that he was
``just born to be in it.''

In August, a shooting at an El Paso Walmart that left 22 people dead
placed the national spotlight on Mr. O'Rourke, and when he rejoined the
campaign trail after going home to grieve, he made gun control a central
issue.
