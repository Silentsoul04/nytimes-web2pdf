A late arriver to the White House race, the former Massachusetts
governor brings a moderate message and a rags-to-riches biography.

Deval Patrick

out of the presidential race} on Feb. 12, 2020. This page is no longer

Deval Patrick entered the campaign in November and quickly staked out
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/deval-patrick-bio.html}{fairly
moderate positions}. Unlike his fellow New Englanders, Senators
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html}{Elizabeth
Warren}, he opposes ``Medicare for all.'' He also distanced himself from
a wealth tax. During two terms as governor, Mr. Patrick focused on
education policies to close the gap separating students of different
races and socioeconomic backgrounds; pushed through a \$13 billion
transportation infrastructure bill; and promoted casino gaming in the
state.

appeal?}}{1. What's his appeal?}}\label{1-whats-his-appeal}}

Mr. Patrick's biography is a classic rags-to-riches story that makes for
a compelling stump speech. Raised by a single mother on Chicago's South
Side, he frequently slept on the floor because there were not enough
beds. With some lucky breaks --- including a scholarship to a
prestigious boarding school --- he eventually graduated from Harvard Law
School. His first public-sector role was assistant attorney general for
civil rights under the Clinton administration.

Capital?}}{2. What exactly did he do at Bain Capital?}}\label{2-what-exactly-did-he-do-at-bain-capital}}

After leaving the governor's office, Mr. Patrick joined the private
equity firm Bain Capital in 2015, heading up an investment fund that
focuses on socially responsible investments. The fund acquired interests
in fitness centers in the Midwest, a vegan fast-food chain and sushi
restaurants serving sustainable fish, among other businesses. With
private equity under attack by other Democrats, Mr. Patrick could face
questions about his Bain connection as well as other business ties,
including stints at Texaco and Coca-Cola and board memberships.

Mr. Patrick had considered joining the presidential race earlier, but
announced in December 2018 that he had decided against it, citing the
``\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/us/politics/deval-patrick-president-2020.html}{cruelty}''
of the elections process. At the time, his wife had cancer, but she is
now healthy. With some Democrats expressing unease in recent months
about the party's ability to defeat President Trump, Mr.
Patrick\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020.html}{}\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020.html}{decided}
in November to enter the race. While he is regarded as a potentially
formidable candidate, his 11th-hour decision puts him at a considerable
disadvantage in
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/deval-patrick-campaign.html}{funding
and organization}.

Mr. Patrick and Michael R. Bloomberg both entered the race in November.
