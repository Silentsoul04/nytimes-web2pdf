</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Trump’s signature issues

Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic has not been a defining
issue of his presidency for long, but how his administration has
responded is likely to be critical not only to his legacy, but also to
how some swing voters who are open to both him and [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
make their decision in November.

Before the coronavirus crisis consumed his White House, his 2016
rallying cry of “build the wall” still echoed in his re-election
campaign. Construction of a wall along the country’s southern border,
intended to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country,
[has been slow
going](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/us/border-wall-texas.html),
but an immigration crackdown has remained one of the policy issues that
enlivens his base. Mr. Trump has even tried to use immigration as a way
to change the subject from criticism of his administration’s handling of
the pandemic.

Mr. Trump has also made eliminating federal regulations a priority, with
a focus on [dismantling Obama-era environmental
regulations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html).
So far, he has failed to achieve his top legislative priority when he
came into office: [repealing the Affordable Care
Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/health/unconstitutional-trump-aca.html).
But he has pleased Republicans, in particular, with his commitment to
[appointing conservative
judges](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/trump-appeals-court-judges.html)
to the federal bench at a record-setting pace.

Mr. Trump touts two trade deals as his signature policies, even as they
mark a break from Republican free-trade **** orthodoxy in favor of a
populist approach: an initial trade agreement [with
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/china-trade-deal.html),
and his revised accord [with Mexico
and](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/us/politics/trump-trade-deal-usmca.html)[Canada](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/us/politics/trump-trade-deal-usmca.html).
His foreign policy doctrine can be summed up by the phrase [“America
First](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/trump-mattis-american-first-foreign-policy.html),”
a banner under which Mr. Trump has over the years questioned the
founding tenets of alliances like NATO, and demonstrated a reluctance to
engage in overseas military operations.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Donald Trump

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. Is Donald Trump under investigation?**

For almost the first time in his presidency, the answer appears to be
no. The first two years of his administration were defined by the
looming investigation of the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who
in March 2019 wrapped up [his report on Russian interference in the 2016
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/us/politics/mueller-report-summary.html).
Mr. Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump illegally
obstructed justice, but found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy
between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Mr. Trump [was
impeached](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html)
by the House of Representatives months after the Russia investigation
concluded, for seeking to pressure Ukraine to smear his political
rivals. In February, after five months of hearings, Mr. Trump [was
acquitted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/politics/trump-acquitted-impeachment.html)
in the Senate, along party lines, of abuse of power and obstruction of
Congress.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. Will Mr. Trump’s re-election hinge on the virus?**

Many aides and allies have been making the case to Mr. Trump that he is
no longer running against a political opponent, but rather against the
virus, and that his re-election in November depends on convincing voters
that his administration’s response saved lives.

Through daily White House news conferences, Mr. Trump has been [trying
to reshape the
narrative](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-briefings-analyzed.html)
and convince voters that his response to the health crisis was adequate,
despite the fact that he repeatedly played down the threat of the virus
and was slow to absorb the scale of the risk. He has also been eager to
restart the economy, so that he can claim credit for the economic gains
that he was running on before the virus washed them away, while pinning
the blame for the spread of the virus elsewhere, like on China or the
World Health Organization.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. How much is Donald Trump worth?**

Mr. Trump, famous for telling falsehoods and making inflated claims
about himself, has long claimed to be a billionaire. The question of how
much Mr. Trump is really worth has been a moving target, and one he
refuses to answer. He has continued to refuse to release his tax
returns, and it’s now a battle being fought in the courts.

He has tried to shield his tax returns from Manhattan state prosecutors,
an effort that was rejected by a federal judge. The Justice Department
has helped his attempt to block a subpoena demanding the release of
eight years of his personal and corporate tax
returns.
