Senator Elizabeth Warren is running for president promising to bring
about ``big, structural change,'' with the goal of tilting power toward
working people and away from big corporations and the rich.

She has become known in the Democratic field for her long list of policy
plans, including
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/upshot/warren-wealth-tax.html}{creating
a wealth tax},
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-student-debt.html}{canceling
student loan debt} for most borrowers and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html}{breaking
up big technology companies}. She is also a proponent of ``Medicare for
all,'' and has rolled out proposals to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-100-days.html}{transition
to} and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all.html}{pay
for} such a system.

She has stood out from many of her opponents by
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-donors-fundraising.html}{swearing
off fund-raisers with wealthy donors}, and she spends hours taking
pictures with voters who wait in a
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-selfies.html}{``selfie
line''} at the end of her town halls.

Warren}\label{three-questions-about-elizabeth-warren}}

them?}}{1. She has lots of big plans. How would she pay for them?}}\label{1-she-has-lots-of-big-plans-how-would-she-pay-for-them}}

Ms. Warren has laid out
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/06/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-policies-taxes.html}{numerous
revenue sources for her various plans}, but her marquee proposal is to
create a wealth tax that would apply to the super rich. She would impose
a 2 percent annual tax on a household's net worth between \$50 million
and \$1 billion, and a 6 percent tax on net worth above \$1 billion.

Ms. Warren says the revenue from that tax --- estimated at \$3.5
trillion over a decade --- would cover the cost of her plans for
universal child care, K-12 education, free public college and student
debt cancellation. It would also help pay for Medicare for all.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Has she always been a
Democrat?}}{2. Has she always been a Democrat?}}\label{2-has-she-always-been-a-democrat}}

No. Ms. Warren was registered as a Republican until 1996, when she was
in her 40s. Ms. Warren has said that her switch amounted to going
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-republican-history.html}{from
``not political'' to ``political.''}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. What about the controversy

ancestry?}}{3. What about the controversy over her ancestry?}}\label{3-what-about-the-controversy-over-her-ancestry}}

Ms. Warren has faced scrutiny over her claims of Native American
ancestry since she ran for Senate in 2012, and President Trump has
repeatedly used a slur to mock her over the subject. Ms. Warren has said
that she never used her ancestry claims to advance her career.

Before entering the presidential race, she
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-dna-ancestry.html}{released
the results of a DNA test} that provided evidence that she had a Native
American ancestor. But the DNA test
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-dna-test.html}{angered
some Native Americans}, and she has since
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-native-american.html}{apologized}
for the DNA test and for identifying herself as Native American during
her career as a law professor.
