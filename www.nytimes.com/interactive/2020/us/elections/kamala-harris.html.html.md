# Kamala Harris

The senator and former California attorney general says she can
“prosecute the case” against President Trump.

Kamala Harris [dropped out of the presidential
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-drops-out.html)
on Dec. 3, 2019. This page is no longer being updated.

<div class="g-section g-basics">

## Who is Kamala Harris?

<div class="g-bullets">

55 years old

Born in Oakland, Calif.; lives in San Francisco and Washington

Elected to the Senate in 2016

Former attorney general of California; former San Francisco district
attorney

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Harris’s signature issues

Kamala Harris has pitched herself as a history-making candidate who can
appeal to both progressives and moderates. Rather than trying to upend
the economy, her policies seek incremental, targeted results,
particularly focusing on historically marginalized groups like women,
people of color and low-income Americans. At times, Ms. Harris has
created confusion by oscillating between policy positions. Still, her
sharp debate skills and affable personality have made her a top-tier
contender, just a short time into her first term in the Senate.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Kamala Harris

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. What’s Ms. Harris’s position on health care?**

She’s held several of them. Originally, she was a sponsor of the
Medicare for All bill offered by Senator Bernie Sanders, which would
create a single-payer system and eliminate private health insurance.

But she seemed to change her position frequently on elements of Medicare
for All until she [released her own
proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all.html)
in July. Unlike the Sanders bill, her plan would maintain a limited role
for private insurers and seek to pay for costs without raising taxes on
the middle class.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. Is Ms. Harris a progressive?**

She has described herself as a “progressive prosecutor” during her time
as a district attorney and attorney general in California. While she
pushed leftward on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she
sometimes enraged liberals by refusing to go further.

In the presidential race, Ms. Harris has styled herself as a pragmatic
problem solver. In many ways, she's indicative of how Democrats have
broadly moved to the left, even if she remains more moderate than the
most vocal progressive firebrands.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. How does Ms. Harris talk about her identity?**

Ms. Harris is of Jamaican and Indian descent, and she is the most viable
candidate who is a black or Indian woman to run for president. She
attended a historically black college (Howard University), is a member
of a prominent black sorority (Alpha Kappa Alpha) and visited India
often while growing up. She often argues that her identity makes her
uniquely suited to fight for people who have been traditionally
ignored.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-quote">

<div class="quote-bar">

</div>

### “I believe our country wants and needs some leadership that provides a vision of the country in which everyone could see themselves.”
