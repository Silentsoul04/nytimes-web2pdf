A former mayor arguing that it takes one superrich New Yorker to defeat

## Who is Michael Bloomberg?

<div class="g-bullets">

78 years old

Raised in Medford, Mass.; lives in New York City

Former three-term mayor of New York City (2002-2013)

Billionaire businessman and philanthropist; founded Bloomberg L.P., a
financial news and data company

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-issues">

## Bloomberg’s signature issues

Mr. Bloomberg has staked his campaign on both his accomplishments as
mayor — economic growth in the city, falling crime, a focus on public
health — and his advocacy work during and after his time in office. He
has been an especially prolific giver to gun-control and environmental
causes. But several elements of Mr. Bloomberg’s record in government,
like his longstanding (and [recently
disavowed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-speech.html))
defense of aggressive stop-and-frisk policing, are likely to complicate
his message to a Democratic electorate.

</div>

<div class="g-section g-questions">

## Three questions about Michael Bloomberg

<div class="g-qa">

### **1. Has Michael Bloomberg always been a Democrat?**

No. But he was a Democrat before he was a Republican, which was before
he was an independent — and way before his recent re-embrace of the
party. Despite his socially liberal views, Mr. Bloomberg changed parties
to run in the Republican mayoral primary in 2001. He [registered as an
independent](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/bloomberg-leaving-republican-party/)
midway through his time at City Hall. In 2016, he spoke in support of
Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. In 2018, he
[officially
returned](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/nyregion/michael-bloomberg-democrat-president.html)
to the party.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **2. Did he really ban Big Gulps?**

He did not. But he tried. Sort of. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg hoped to
impose limits on the sale of large sugary drinks, but the initiative
[failed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/nyregion/city-loses-final-appeal-on-limiting-sales-of-large-sodas.html)
in the courts. Even if it hadn’t, Mr. Bloomberg’s plan included
exemptions for convenience stores like 7-Eleven, with its outsize Big
Gulp. This has not stopped critics from invoking the Big Gulp as a
symbol of what they view as Bloombergian policy overreach.

</div>

<div class="g-qa">

### **3. Does he have a chance?**

Mr. Bloomberg’s path is unconventional in the extreme: skipping the
early-voting states and debates to focus on delegate-rich contests in
March and beyond. He has the resources to pull it off — millions upon
millions of dollars of his own money to flood the airwaves with his ads.
But if another candidate claims momentum in February, Mr. Bloomberg
could have a difficult time breaking
through.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-section g-quote">

<div class="quote-bar">

</div>

### “Defeating Donald Trump — and rebuilding America — is the most urgent and important fight of our lives. And I’m going all in. I offer myself as a doer and a problem solver — not a talker. And someone who is ready to take on the tough fights — and win.”
