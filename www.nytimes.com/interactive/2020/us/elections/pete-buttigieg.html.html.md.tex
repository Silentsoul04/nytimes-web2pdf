Pete Buttigieg has built his campaign around the idea of generational
change. The youngest candidate in the presidential field, he says he
would be a bridge to a new era of American politics.

Mr. Buttigieg was the first candidate to
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/politics/reparations-court-packing-filibuster-2020-democrats.html}{push
the idea} of increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court. And he
has proven to be one of the most
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-fundraising.html}{formidable
fund-raisers} in the race.

Until launching his presidential campaign in January 2019, Mr. Buttigieg
was a relatively obscure mayor of an Indiana city of just over 100,000
people. Educated at Harvard and then Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, he
served as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve and worked as a
McKinsey consultant.

Mr. Buttigieg's first entry into national politics came in early 2017,
when he ran unsuccessfully for the chairmanship of the Democratic
National Committee.

Court?}}{2. How would Mr. Buttigieg change the makeup of the Supreme Court?}}\label{2-how-would-mr-buttigieg-change-the-makeup-of-the-supreme-court}}

Mr. Buttigieg has proposed or endorsed a handful of options for altering
how justices are seated. Changing the system, he says, could make each
new court appointment less of a political death match between
Republicans and Democrats.

One plan Mr. Buttigieg has floated would establish a Supreme Court of 10
permanent justices, with five others rotating in who could be seated
only by unanimous consent of the first 10. He's also considered having
appellate court judges serve rotating one-year terms on the court.

He's the youngest candidate running, he's the first openly gay candidate
to mount a major campaign for the presidency, and he's aiming to be the
first mayor to go directly from city hall to the White House.

In 2018 he married Chasten Glezman, a schoolteacher from Michigan.
Chasten Buttigieg has since become a prolific fund-raiser in his own
right, stumping for his husband at events across the country.
