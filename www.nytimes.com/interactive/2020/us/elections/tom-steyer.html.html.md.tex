A billionaire says he can help get money out of politics, decrying what
he calls the ``corporate stranglehold on democracy.''

Tom Steyer
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/us/politics/tom-steyer-drops-out.html}{dropped
out of the presidential race} on Feb. 29, 2020. This page is no longer

\subsection{Who is Tom Steyer?}\label{who-is-tom-steyer}}

62 years old

Born in New York; lives in San Francisco

Started the hedge fund Farallon Capital; funded political groups
including Need to Impeach and NextGen America; no prior elected office

\hypertarget{steyers-signature-issues}{%
\subsection{Steyer's signature issues}\label{steyers-signature-issues}}

Mr. Steyer casts himself as a progressive outsider with a business
record, calling for term limits in Congress, decriminalizing illegal
border crossings and expanding the Supreme Court. He says his top
priorities are breaking the influence of corporations and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/us/politics/tom-steyer-hopes-nextgen-climate-gets-voters-to-consider-environment.html}{addressing
climate change}.

Mr. Steyer has spent millions of dollars
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/impeach-trump-democrats-tom-steyer.html}{pushing
for the impeachment of President Trump}, airing television ads and
building a grassroots online network. Now, after considering runs for
California governor and senator, he is promising to spend \$100 million
or more of his own money on a presidential bid.

Steyer}\label{three-questions-about-tom-steyer}}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{1. How rich is Tom
Steyer?}}{1. How rich is Tom Steyer?}}\label{1-how-rich-is-tom-steyer}}

Very rich. Mr. Steyer has released more than
\href{https://www.tomsteyer.com/transparency/}{a decade of tax returns}
that show more than \$1 billion in earnings, including nearly \$110
million in ``taxable income'' in 2017. He has become one of the largest
Democratic financiers in the country, spending more than \$300 million
on politics between 2014 and 2017.

Mr. Steyer founded his investment firm, Farallon Capital, in the 1980s
and left in 2012. Some of its past investments could cause political
headaches for Mr. Steyer, including those in private prisons
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/us/politics/prominent-environmentalist-helped-fund-coal-projects.html}{and
coal}.

\hypertarget{2-isnt-he-the-impeachment-guy}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Isn't he the impeachment
guy?}}{2. Isn't he the impeachment guy?}}\label{2-isnt-he-the-impeachment-guy}}

Yes, Mr. Steyer founded the group Need to Impeach and has appeared
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/impeach-trump-democrats-tom-steyer.html}{in
many television ads} asking for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Some ran on
Fox News in an effort to get Mr. Trump's attention. (The president
responded on Twitter to one ad,
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html\#the-letter-S}{calling
Mr. Steyer a ``weirdo.''}) In January 2019, Mr. Steyer announced
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-trump-2020.html}{he
would not run for president} to focus on the impeachment efforts. But in
July, he reversed himself and
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-president.html}{declared
himself a candidate}.

\hypertarget{3-is-mr-steyer-a-moderate-or-a-progressive}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. Is Mr. Steyer a moderate or a
progressive?}}{3. Is Mr. Steyer a moderate or a progressive?}}\label{3-is-mr-steyer-a-moderate-or-a-progressive}}

Mr. Steyer is selling himself as a businessman who can challenge Mr.
Trump on economic matters. But he is not casting himself as a moderate.

He has embraced a ``wealth tax'' on the superrich, not unlike one
proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren. He has suggested adding new
justices to the Supreme Court, a relatively radical idea pressed by some
on the left. He wants to take emergency action to address climate
change. In many ways, he is running as a populist outsider, much the way
Mr. Trump did in 2016. He is just proposing a different set of
solutions.

We followed Mr. Steyer on his crusade to spend millions
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/tom-steyer-debate.html}{to
get money out of politics}.

Here's a dispatch from an event in San Francisco, when Mr. Steyer said
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/us/politics/tom-steyer-2020-campaign.html}{he
didn't see himself as rich}.

\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/tom-steyer-president.html}{Becoming
a presidential candidate} was another reinvention for Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Steyer's hedge fund has bankrolled

mines and coal-fired power plants}.
