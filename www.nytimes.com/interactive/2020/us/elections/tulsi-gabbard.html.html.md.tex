\subsection{Who is Tulsi Gabbard?}\label{who-is-tulsi-gabbard}}

38 years old

Born in American Samoa; lives in Kailua, Hawaii, and Washington

Four-term congresswoman representing Hawaii's Second District, first
elected in 2012

\hypertarget{gabbards-signature-issues}{%
\subsection{Gabbard's signature
issues}\label{gabbards-signature-issues}}

Ms. Gabbard was deployed to Iraq and currently serves as a major in the
Hawaii Army National Guard. She has leaned on her background as a
service member in making foreign policy her chief concern.

Specifically, she is
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-race.html}{urging
the United States to get out of foreign wars} and focus on
peacebuilding. She has also
\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-foreign-policy-war.html}{warned
that a nuclear arms race} could be on the horizon.

on foreign
policy?}}{1. Where does Ms. Gabbard stand on foreign policy?}}\label{1-where-does-ms-gabbard-stand-on-foreign-policy}}

Ms. Gabbard doesn't fit neatly into any one established ideology or
school of thought. She generally does not endorse meddling with
dictators; she thinks the threat from Russia is severely exaggerated;
she wants to stop beating the drums of war with Iran; and she would
prefer to make nice with North Korea.

``We should be coming to other leaders in other countries with respect,
building a relationship based on cooperation rather than with, you know,
a police
baton,''\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-race.html}{}\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-race.html}{she

al-Assad?}}{2. Wasn't she the one who met with Bashar al-Assad?}}\label{2-wasnt-she-the-one-who-met-with-bashar-al-assad}}

Ms. Gabbard visited Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus in
January 2017 --- something other American officials had not done since
reports emerged of Mr. Assad's use of chemical weapons against
civilians. She defended the move as a way to help broker peace. She

against a House resolution condemning the dictator's war crimes}, and
more recently, she said Mr. Assad was
``\href{https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/rep-gabbard-assad-is-not-an-enemy-of-the-us-1438093891865}{not
the enemy of the United States}.''

Critics have called her actions
un-American.\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-prisoners-tulsi-gabbard.html?module=inline}{}\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-prisoners-tulsi-gabbard.html?module=inline}{After
Ms. Gabbard sharply criticized Senator Kamala Harris} for her
prosecutorial record during one of the Democratic debates, Ms. Harris
called Ms. Gabbard an ``apologist for an individual, Assad, who has
murdered the people of his country like cockroaches.''

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. How did she vote on
impeachment?}}{3. How did she vote on impeachment?}}\label{3-how-did-she-vote-on-impeachment}}

She broke with most Democrats and voted ``present'' on the two articles
of impeachment charging President Trump with abuse of power and
obstruction of Congress. She was the only member of the House to cast
such a vote.

running for president.

As Ms. Gabbard injects a bit of chaos into the race, some members of her
own party are
