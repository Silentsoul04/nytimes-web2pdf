Getting a precise nationwide count of the number of [people collecting
unemployment
benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/unemployment-claim-numbers-coronavirus.html)
has been hampered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Data from
overwhelmed and understaffed state offices has been inconsistent and
strewn with errors. And there may be some double-counting as the
agencies struggle to clear out the flood of new and backlogged claims.

On Thursday, the [Labor Department
reported](https://oui.doleta.gov/press/2020/072320.pdf) that the total
number of people [claiming unemployment
insurance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/economy/unemployment-gig-workers-coronavirus.html)
for the week ending July 4 — without any seasonal adjustments — equaled
31.8 million.

Ernie Tedeschi, a policy economist at Evercore ISI, estimates that the
actual figure is closer to 30 million, roughly one out of every five
workers — a staggering number by any count.

The Labor Department categorizes the claims in separate batches. In one
are those filed through states’ regular unemployment insurance systems,
a number that rose last week for the first time in months. A second
includes people who filed through the federal government’s temporary
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, for workers not ordinarily
eligible for state benefits. A third and growing group includes
recipients who exhausted their regular benefits but are eligible for an
additional 13 weeks of [emergency
assistance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html)
that Congress passed after the coronavirus outbreak.

Over the past couple of months, the labor market showed surprising gains
as businesses reopened and rehired workers. The overall jobless rate
dipped in June to 11.1 percent from a peak of 14.7 percent in April. But
troubling weaknesses may be reflected in the weekly tallies of laid-off
workers filing new applications, Mr. Tedeschi said.

“I’m surprised that the claims numbers haven’t gotten better yet,” he
said.

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance extends eligibility to some workers who
would not otherwise be able to apply for unemployment benefits, such as
part-time and self-employed workers. Regular claims are seasonally
adjusted but P.U.A. claims are not.

Source: Labor Department

By The New York Times

</div>

The government reported on Thursday that more than 1.4 million workers
[filed new claims for state unemployment
benefits](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) last week, the first time
that the weekly tally has risen in more than three months.

The upturn, from about 1.3 million in the two preceding weeks, comes
just days before an extra [$600-a-week jobless benefit is set to
expire](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits.html).

An additional 975,000 claims were filed last week by freelancers,
part-time workers and others who do not qualify for regular state
jobless aid but are eligible for benefits under an emergency federal
program, the Labor Department said. Unlike the state figures, that
number is not seasonally adjusted.

“At this stage, you’re seeing all the wrong elements for recovery,” said
Gregory Daco, the chief United States economist at Oxford Economics. “A
deteriorating health situation, a weakening labor market and a softening
path for demand.”

The report on Thursday has particular resonance: It reflects the week
that will be used by the department to calculate the June jobs data and
unemployment rate.

The stubbornly high rate of new weekly claims more than four months into
the coronavirus pandemic “suggests that the nature of the downturn has
changed from early on,” said Ernie Tedeschi, a policy economist at
Evercore ISI. It may mean that [businesses are shutting down
again](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/business/economy/economic-recovery-coronavirus-resurgence.html)
as cases surge in some places, or that funds from emergency federal
loans through the Paycheck Protection Program are running out, he said —
or worse, something more fundamental.

“It might be that businesses are running through their first line of
credit,” he said, “and now they’re facing the music of an economy that
has recovered a little bit but not nearly enough.”

**Disney** on Thursday gave a worrisome update on its movie business —
the largest in Hollywood, by far, and still mostly shut down because of
the pandemic — by delaying the theatrical release of its live-action
“Mulan” indefinitely and pushing back three upcoming “Star Wars”
movies and four scheduled “Avatar” sequels by one year each.

The next “Star Wars” movie will not arrive until 2023, making for a far
less promising 2022 for Disney’s movie and consumer products divisions.
“Mulan” was supposed to arrive in theaters on Aug. 21 after being
pushed back several times already.

“It’s become clear that nothing can be set in stone when it comes to how
we release films during this global health crisis,” Disney said in a
statement.

In a similar move, **Warner Bros.** on Monday[indefinitely delayed
Christopher Nolan’s big-budget
“Tenet,”](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/20/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/warner-bros-backs-off-its-aug-12-release-date-for-tenet?partner=IFTTT)
which had been scheduled to arrive in theaters on Aug. 12.

Some upcoming Disney movies are being delayed because the coronavirus
has halted movie production across Hollywood. But the “Mulan”
postponement reflects the economics of blockbuster-style films and the
inability of theaters in some crucial markets — New York, Los Angeles,
the San Francisco Bay Area — to reopen without government approval, the
timing of which is impossible to predict. To release “Mulan” on Aug. 21,
Disney would need to start its advertising barrage now. But no company
wants to spend a minimum of $150 million to market a movie worldwide if
it can’t be sure that the advertised product will be available.

Similarly, because these movies cost roughly $200 million just to
produce, the only way to make them financially viable is to make them
available everywhere all at once, thwarting piracy as much as possible.
New York, Los Angeles and the Bay Area are the country’s three biggest
markets for ticket sales; it would be a financial calamity to release a
“tent pole” movie with even one of those areas offline.

Disney’s next megamovie will now not arrive until at least November,
when “Black Widow” is set to roll into theaters.

Without its movie division to generate revenue, Disney’s theme parks
have become even more important to the conglomerate. Disney reopened
Walt Disney World in Florida earlier this month. It has been
accused<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>of irresponsibility
from people concerned about visitor and worker health, but Disney has
developed what it believes are safe operating procedures. And it gets to
tell investors on its Aug. 4 earnings call that at least something came
back online in the quarter.

Pennies and dimes are hard to find in many parts of America after
pandemic lockdowns disrupted their flow and kept households from
exchanging their coin jars for dollar bills.

The United States Mint wants you to know that you can be part of the
solution.

“We ask that the American public start spending their coins,” the Mint,
which is part of the Treasury, implored in a release on Thursday. “The
coin supply problem can be solved with each of us doing our part.”

Other options include depositing coins or exchanging them for cash.

The coin shortage has forced regional Federal Reserve banks, which
distributes coins, to institute a [rationing
system](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/business/economy/coin-shortage-coronavirus.html).
On June 30, the Fed
[established](https://www.frbservices.org/news/communications/071020-us-coin-task-force-members-confirmed.html?utm_source=home-071020&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=fedcash&utm_content=3-coin-task-force)
a coin task force to deal with the unfolding crisis, complete with
“industry leaders in the coin supply chain.”

The shortage has become a problem for many small businesses across
America and has been the topic of [local
news](https://www.wataugademocrat.com/covid19/widespread-coin-shortages-a-symptom-of-pandemic/article_806c11c9-9b52-5ace-890a-dc250e8316cc.html)
coverage and of discussion on a corner of Reddit devoted to prepping
strategies.

Even big retailers are feeling the penny pinch — **Walmart**, **CVS**,
**Kroger** and other chains have begun asking customers to pay with
plastic when possible or to use exact change.

While digital payments have become prevalent, coins have remained

“For millions of Americans, cash is the only form of payment and cash

“As important as it is to get more coins circulating, safety is
paramount,” it added. “Please be sure to follow all safety and health
guidelines.”

**AMC Theatres**, the nation’s largest cinema chain, delayed the opening
of its more than 1,000 theaters in the United States until mid-to-late
August. The move was not a surprise, given that it arrived on the heels
of the Warner Bros. announcement earlier this week that
“[Tenet](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/20/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#warner-bros-backs-off-its-aug-12-release-date-for-tenet),”
its big-budgeted thriller from Christopher Nolan, would not be released
on its rescheduled date of Aug. 12. No new date has yet been set.

With the coronavirus showing no signs of abatement, the studios and
their movie theater partners have been playing a game of chicken,
postponing the return to moviegoing until the virus numbers show a
decline.
[Disney](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/business/hong-kong-disneyland-closing.html),
which had rescheduled its live-action adaptation of “Mulan” for Aug. 21,
has yet to announce a date shift but is likely to do so.

[Theater
chains](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/07/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#several-movie-theater-chains-sue-new-jersey-over-its-reopening-plan)
large and small are struggling with the ramifications of the pandemic.
Though they received initial assistance from the federal government in
the form of the Paycheck Protection Program, they are still grappling
with soaring fixed costs and zero revenue.

Overseas, AMC says that approximately one-third of its cinemas in Europe
and the Middle East are already open and operating normally.

The Trump administration is dropping its insistence on a payroll tax cut
as the centerpiece of the upcoming economic relief bill in favor of more
direct payments to Americans, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on
Thursday.

The [payroll tax
cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/payroll-tax-cut-trump-recession.html),
which was a priority for President Trump, emerged as an obstacle as
Senate Republicans have tried to coalesce around a stimulus plan this
week. Mr. Mnuchin said that the idea, which he thinks would help
stimulate the economy over the longer term, will not be in the “base
bill” but that it could still emerge in future legislation.

“We think the payroll tax cut is a very good pro-growth policy,” Mr.
Mnuchin said on CNBC. “The president’s focus is, he wants to get money
into people’s pockets now.”

Mr. Mnuchin said that Republicans had agreed to a plan to continue
expanded unemployment insurance, which will expire at the end of the
month. He said that the proposal would replace approximately 70 percent
of a worker’s lost wages so that the policy did not create incentives
for people not to return to their jobs.

“We want to make sure that the people who are out there that can’t find
jobs do get a reasonable wage replacement,” Mr. Mnuchin said.

He added that there would be tax credits to encourage businesses to
rehire workers. The plan would also replenish the Paycheck Protection
Program so that small businesses with revenue down by 50 percent or more
can apply for second loans.

His comments come as Senate Republicans on Thursday are expected to
unveil a roughly $1 trillion coronavirus relief measure that will
allocate more than $100 billion to schools, new aid for states to
conduct testing across the country and liability protections for
schools, hospitals and businesses.

The Treasury secretary also said that the Republican plan would include
liability protections for businesses that are seeking to reopen to
shield them from “frivolous lawsuits.”

**AT\&T** reported second-quarter results Thursday, and the numbers
revealed customer defections across it businesses, including wireless,
broadband and satellite TV. The only bright spot appeared to be HBO Max,
but even there the numbers looked fuzzy. Here are the highlights:

  - The wireless division saw a loss of 154,000 customers in its
    traditional service where people pay a monthly bill. The company
    added 165,000 new customers to its prepaid plans. Factoring in
    resellers and other connected devices like tablets, AT\&T claims
    171.4 million total wireless accounts, an 8 percent uptick from last
    year. The phone giant still has plenty of cash coming in the door,
    allowing it to pay down its enormous debt and shell out dividends.

  - The company’s TV service, including satellite (formerly known as
    DirecTV) and its online cable platform, saw a net loss of 954,000
    customers, a downturn the company blamed on lower household spending
    because of the pandemic.

  - So what about HBO Max? The company’s [new streaming
    service](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/business/media/hbo-max-netflix-streaming.html)
    was introduced in late May, and in its first month it attracted 4.1
    million customers. For some context, rival Disney+ [signed up 10
    million](https://twitter.com/edmundlee/status/1194661580539125762)
    after the first 24 hours. AT\&T said it hoped to have 50 million HBO
    Max customers by 2025.

  - To get there, AT\&T will need to convert more of its regular HBO
    customers to HBO Max customers. More than 23.5 million people who
    pay for regular HBO could switch to HBO Max.

  - What’s making those numbers a bit hard to understand is that AT\&T
    sells two versions of HBO. Both cost the same, but HBO Max has much
    more content. AT\&T wants people to buy HBO Max or convert their
    existing HBO account to HBO Max. Because most people get HBO through
    their cable or satellite provider, AT\&T has already cut deals with
    most of them to allow their customers to [make the
    switch](https://www.nytimes.com/article/hbo-max-amazon-roku.html).

  - But that doesn’t mean everyone has. Or can. Amazon, for example,
    sells HBO through its Amazon Channels service, but it hasn’t been
    able to strike a deal with AT\&T to convert those people to HBO Max
    customers. AT\&T’s chief executive, [John
    Stankey](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/business/media/att-ceo-john-stankey-randall-stephenson.html),
    had some harsh words for Amazon on the earnings call following the
    report. “We’ve tried repeatedly to make HBO Max available on
    Amazon,” he said, “Unfortunately, Amazon has taken an approach of
    treating HBO Max and its customers differently” than other services.

  - Customers may also be confused about HBO versus HBO Max, or may not
    be aware they can even make the switch — a marketing challenge for
    AT\&T.

  - Revenue at the HBO division was down 5.2 percent to $1.6 billion, a
    result of more people cutting their cable and satellite accounts.
    But AT\&T is spending more — costs were up about a third to $1.5
    billion — to invest in HBO Max. Content is expensive.

  - The company’s cable network division that includes CNN, TNT and TBS
    (where it airs sports programming) took a big hit to its advertising
    business with a 37 percent drop to $796 million, the biggest
    shortfall across the media group.

The pandemic has taken a [heavy toll on
retailers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/business/coronavirus-malls-department-stores-bankruptcy.html),
especially apparel sellers and other mall-based chains that might have
otherwise stayed afloat, perhaps even for a short period, without
turning to bankruptcy court.

The latest company to file for bankruptcy was **[Ascena Retail
Group](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/ascena-bankruptcy-ann-taylor-lane-bryant.html)**,
which on Thursday became at least the ninth prominent retailer to file
for bankruptcy since early May, following [Brooks
Brothers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/business/brooks-brothers-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html),
[Neiman Marcus
Group](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/business/neiman-marcus-bankruptcy.html)
and [J.C.
Penney](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/jc-penney-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html),
among others.

Ascena, just a few years ago was one of the country’s largest clothing
retailers for women and girls, will close “a select number” of its Ann
Taylor, Lane Bryant, LOFT and Lou & Grey stores, as well as all of its
Catherines locations.

Ascena was known for decades as Dress Barn, the clothing chain founded
in 1962 by Roslyn S. Jaffe, who noticed that there were few options for
stylish and affordable women’s work attire even as more women were
entering the work force. Dress Barn went public in 1983, around the time
that the “power suit” came into vogue, exemplifying women’s desire to
take on the predominantly male corporate world.

Having multiple jobs is business as usual for millions of Americans. But
many cobbled-together employment arrangements that enabled people to get
by when the jobless rate was skimming along at record lows collapsed
once the pandemic curbed or closed large swaths of the economy.

And when hard times hit, they are excluded from regular state
unemployment benefits.

“There’s a misfit between the enormous volatility and part-time jobs
that make up the ways that people cobble together making money and the
system that’s going to cut you a check,” said[Susan J.
Lambert](https://ssa.uchicago.edu/ssascholars/s-lambert), a professor at
the University of Chicago who studies low-skilled hourly jobs.

The economic shock quickly exposed the mismatch between the reality of
making a living in 2020 and the systems built to protect workers. People
who rely on paychecks from different employers are already more likely
to have shifting schedules and unpredictable weekly paychecks, low
hourly wages and the absence of benefits like sick days and health
insurance.

They are also more likely to be[Black, young and without a college
degree.](https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/5/4/218)

“The rules of the game have changed,” Ms. Lambert said, but protections
for workers, like jobless benefits, have not caught up.

States have been whittling away at the backlog of unemployment claims,
but persistent delays in some places have continued.

Behnaz Mansouri, an attorney at the Unemployment Law Project in
Washington State, said her office was still averaging 200 phone calls a
week from people who had received no benefits after waiting months, or
who had inexplicably had them cut off.

Recently there has been some slow progress, she said. A number of people
who had appealed a decision in March, April and May were beginning to be
called in for a hearing. Those who have waited the longest, Ms. Mansouri
said, are often those who have disabilities or don’t speak English well.

In Oklahoma, hundreds of frustrated workers [camped out

hoping to sort out delays with their unemployment claims at one of the
large-scale processing sessions that officials were holding around the
state.

The pain of job losses can be found in every corner of the country, but
Black men have had particular difficulties, said [Peter Q.
Blair](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/peter-blair), a co-director
of the Project on Workforce at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

The government’s [June jobs
report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm) showed that
although unemployment for every other group declined from May, the rate
for African-American males over 20 rose to 15.8 percent from 15.3
percent.

“It’s important that we look at the way in which this crisis is having a
disparate effect on the African-American community, particularly Black
men,” he said.

Goldstein](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/evictions-moratorium-cares-act.html).

> Landlords in Tucson, Ariz., filed dozens of eviction cases last month
> despite the federal moratorium, which was put in place because of the
> coronavirus crisis. Legal aid lawyers had to go to court to stop the
> eviction of a San Antonio renter who had lost her job during a
> citywide stay-at-home order. And in
> [Omaha](https://www.nhlp.org/wp-content/uploads/Douglas-County-Order-of-Dismissal.pdf),
> a court found that a struggling renter’s attempted eviction had
> violated the emergency law.
> 
> As the number of Covid-19 cases has [surged across the
> country](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
> a disturbing trend has emerged: landlords commencing eviction
> proceedings even though the CARES Act relief law currently protects
> about 12 million tenants living in qualifying properties.
> 
> State and local governments have also issued eviction moratoriums, but
> the CARES Act is the furthest reaching, covering as many as 12.3
> million renters living in an apartment complex or single-family home
> financed with a federally backed mortgage. But like other moratoriums,
> it’s about to expire: After Friday, landlords can begin filing
> eviction notices for failure to pay rent. It will be at least 30 days
> after that before any tenants are kicked out.

Stocks on Wall Street tumbled on Thursday, with shares of large
technology companies leading the decline, as investors considered the
latest earnings reports and a rise in unemployment claims by workers in
the United States.

The S\&P 500 fell more than 1 percent in the afternoon, while the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was down by more than 2 percent, as shares
of **Apple**, **Microsoft**, and **Alphabet** all slid. Large technology
companies have a outsize influence on the stock market indexes because
of their sheer size.

Microsoft tumbled more than 4 percent even after reporting earnings late
on Wednesday that were better than Wall Street had expected. Apple was
one of the worst performing stocks on the S\&P 500 with a decline of
more than 4.5 percent.

Wall Street’s negative tone was also affected by news that more than 1.4
million workers filed new claims for [state unemployment
benefits](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) last week, the first time in
more than three months that the weekly tally has risen. The rise in
claims comes as a surge in coronavirus cases around the United States
has prompted some states to reinstate restrictions on public gatherings
and close bars and restaurants again.

Investors have shaken off concerns about the impact the lockdowns might
have on the economy, in part because lawmakers in Washington are in the
middle of negotiations over a spending plan that will help offset some
of the damage. On Wednesday, Senate Republican leaders and White House
officials said that they [had reached an agreement in
principle](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/coronavirus-stimulus.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
on a proposal to give more than $100 billion to schools, send additional
checks directly to Americans and provide $16 billion for states to
conduct testing and contact tracing.

But on Thursday, the negative tone spread to other markets as well.
Crude oil prices, for example, which can reflect expectations for the
economy, were also lower.

  - 🤳🏻 **BuzzFeed** said it had laid off 50 employees, including 10
    people in its news division.The employees were among a group of 74
    who were furloughed in the spring, the company said. Buzzfeed cut
    the salaries of its U.S. workers earning more than $40,000, and top
    executives had their pay reduced by 25 percent. Jonah Peretti, the
    company’s chief executive, said he would forgo his salary until the
    crisis passed. Employees will get between four and eight weeks of
    severance, and BuzzFeed will pay for insurance through September 30,
    a spokesman said.

  - 🧹 The British technology and manufacturing company **Dyson**
    announced plans<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>on Thursday
    to cut 900 jobs, about 6 percent of its global staff. Two-thirds of
    the job losses will be in Britain and apply to people in retail and
    customer service roles. The company said it hadn’t put any staff on
    furlough during the pandemic or used government money in any of the
    countries it operates in.

  - 🏦 Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, confirmed that he would
    oppose Judy Shelton’s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board. It
    remains unclear whether Ms. Shelton, an unorthodox economist with
    close ties to the Trump administration, has enough votes to clear
    the full Senate. The Senate Banking Committee [voted to
    advance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/shelton-federal-reserve-trump-senate.html)
    Ms. Shelton’s nomination this week, as several Republicans who had
    once expressed doubts about her suitability decided to vote in her
    favor. Now, she and fellow Fed nominee Christopher Waller must win a
    simple majority vote in the full Senate to gain confirmation.

  - ✈️ **Southwest Airlines** and **American Airlines** on Thursday
    reported deep losses in the second quarter of the year, as a meek
    rebound in travel slowed in recent weeks with the spread of
    coronavirus infections and travel restrictions nationwide. For
    Southwest, revenue declined 83 percent from the same quarter last
    year, resulting in an overall loss of $915 million. American saw
    revenue fall 86 percent, giving way to a $2 billion loss. The losses
    represent a reversal of fortune for both airlines, which earned
    hundreds of millions of dollars in profit during the same three
    months in 2019.

  - 🧪 **Dow**, the American chemicals company, announced plans to cut 6
    percent of its global work force, nearly 2,200 jobs, as it published
    its second quarter earnings on Thursday. The Michigan-based company
    said it aimed to save $500 million this year, increasing the
    previous target from $350 million. Its sales declined 24 percent in
    the second quarter, compared with last year.
