Thanksgiving Day is being returned to the workers at major retail
chains, fueled by concerns for worker and customer safety amid the
coronavirus outbreak.

**Target** [said
Monday](https://corporate.target.com/article/2020/07/early-holiday-plans)
that it would close its stores on Thanksgiving this year as part of
safety measures it has rolled out during the pandemic, following a
similar announcement from **Walmart** [last
week](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/21/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#walmart-will-close-on-thanksgiving-day),
which cited appreciation for its staff.

“Let’s face it: Historically, deal hunting and holiday shopping can mean
crowded events, and this isn’t a year for crowds,” Target, which is
based in Minneapolis, said in a statement. Target said that it would
start offering deals in October this year as well as after the holiday.

The pandemic has given retailers the chance to reverse the creep of
Black Friday sales into Thanksgiving, something that had [increased in
popularity](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sapna/five-years-for-retailers-to-conquer-thanksgiving)
over the past decade. The sales have received widespread
[criticism](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-thanksgiving-protest/target-given-190000-black-friday-protest-signatures-idUSTRE7AK24S20111121#GDqRY8xAbLObGsib.97)
for forcing workers into stores on a holiday often spent with family,
and for promoting consumerism on what’s meant to be a day of gratitude.
The criticism has deepened as more consumers shop online from their
couches instead of lining up at stores.

Last year, Target opened at 5 p.m. on Thursday and stayed open until 1
a.m. on Black Friday. (It reopened at 7 a.m. that day.) A spokeswoman
for Walmart said that the retailer had been open on Thanksgiving since
“the 1980s.”

John Furner, the head of Walmart’s U.S. operations, said last week in a
memo to employees that after a trying year, “We want you to enjoy the
day at home with your loved ones.”

Other retailers are likely to follow suit given the size of Walmart and
Target. **Dick’s Sporting Goods** also [announced
Monday](http://investors.dicks.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404751770) that
its retail locations and distribution centers would shut for the
holiday.

As coronavirus cases surge across the country, **MGM Resorts**
**International** said on Monday that it would not restart live
entertainment events before Aug. 31.

The company also expects to lay off the majority of employees working in
the entertainment division on that day, according to July 27 letter sent
to employees.

“We’ve pledged to be as transparent and supportive as possible with
employees and are working to reduce the impact and help them moving
forward,” MGM said in a statement. “We’re continuing to coordinate with
public officials and look forward to the time when we can bring back
employees to support our entertainment offerings and relaunch
entertainment for our guests.”

Many MGM-owned resorts are now open to guests, including the MGM Grand,
the Bellagio and the ARIA, with most amenities available including
casinos, pools and dine-in restaurants.

Las Vegas’s road to reopening has been rocky. Since Nevada casinos
opened on June 4, hundreds of thousands of people have filled the Las
Vegas Strip, many of them without masks. As Covid-19 cases increased
across the state, the governor of Nevada **** issued a statewide mask
order on
[June 24](http://gov.nv.gov/News/Press/2020/Gov__Sisolak_announces_mandatory_face_covering_policy_in_public/)
and forced bars that did not serve food to shut their doors at midnight
on July 10, for the second time since the pandemic hit. MGM requires
masks to be worn at all company-owned properties.

Judy Shelton, President Trump’s unconventional nominee to the Federal
Reserve Board, has lost the support of a second Republican senator,
potentially imperiling her confirmation to the central bank.

Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said in a statement that she would
not vote for Ms. Shelton’s confirmation, joining Mitt Romney, Republican
of Utah, who said last week that he would not support Mr. Trump’s
choice.

“Ms. Shelton has openly called for the Federal Reserve to be less
independent of the political branches, and has even questioned the need
for a central bank,” Ms. Collins said in her statement. “This is not the
right signal to send, particularly in the midst of the pandemic.”

Ms. Shelton needs only a simple majority vote to clear the Senate.
Assuming no Democrats support her candidacy, she would need to avoid
losing another two Republicans to get the votes she needs for
confirmation.

Ms. Shelton’s chances remain unclear. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaskan
Republican who was thought to be a possible “no” vote on the nomination,
told reporters last week that she was leaning yes.

Her candidacy has raised questions in part because of her close ties to
the White House. Ms. Shelton advised Mr. Trump’s campaign and critics,
including Democratic senators, have suggested she would lack the
independence needed for the Fed board. Her views have also raised
eyebrows: Ms. Shelton has a long history of pushing for a gold standard,
or a similar system in which currency is backed by a common store of
value.

She is nominated alongside Christopher Waller, the research director at
the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a much more conventional pick.
It is unclear when the Senate will vote on the nominations.

If both are confirmed, Mr. Trump will have nominated six of the board’s
seven members, who hold a constant vote on monetary policy and
regulatory oversight of the largest banks.

Sundar Pichai, chief executive of **Google’s** parent company
**Alphabet**, told employees Monday that they would not be expected back
in the office until mid-2021.

The company’s work force, which has been [working remotely since
March](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/technology/coronavirus-work-from-home.html),
had previously been told to expect a return to the office in January
2021.

A Google spokesman said: “To give employees the ability to plan ahead,
we are extending our global voluntary work from home option through June
30, 2021 for roles that don’t need to be in the office.”

Technology companies moved quickly with work-from-home policies from the
beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, and have been reluctant to bring
workers back too early. In May,
**[Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/coronavirus-stock-market-today.html)**
said it would allow many employees to work from home permanently.

The moves reflect the reality that no one can be sure how long [the
coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=STYLN_coronahub&variant=show&region=header&context=menu)
will last, as new outbreaks emerge across the United States even as the
spread of the virus has slowed in early hot zones like New York City.

News of the decision was reported
[earlier](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-keep-employees-home-until-summer-2021-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-11595854201)
by The Wall Street Journal.

  - **Regal Cinemas**, the No. 2 movie theater chain in the United
    States, consisting of 7,128 screens in 42 states, pushed back its
    planned reopening until Aug. 21. Regal, owned by Cineworld of
    Britain, had previously said it would start relighting marquees on
    Friday. But studios have since postponed release plans for new
    films. The No. 1 theater chain, AMC, said last week that it hoped to
    reopen in “mid to late August.”

  - The supermarket chain **Albertsons**
    [reported](https://investor.albertsonscompanies.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404748481)
    on Monday that it had seen a boost to its bottom line since the
    pandemic hit. Sales were up by 21 percent, reaching $22.8 billion,
    with digital sales more than tripling. The company earned about $586
    million during the first quarter of 2020, compared with $49 million
    during the same period last year.

  - The gym chain **Planet Fitness**
    [announced](https://www.planetfitness.com/club-cleanliness) Monday
    that all guests would be required to wear masks at all times while
    inside its facilities, effective Aug. 1. “Club employees have
    already been required to wear masks, but this new measure is
    designed to keep everyone in the clubs as safe as possible, which is
    Planet Fitness’ top priority,” the company said in a statement. The
    announcement follows similar policies implemented by national chains
    in recent weeks, including **Walmart**, **Target** and
    **McDonald’s**. Planet Fitness opened its 2,000th gym in December
    2019.

As the United States slowly, haltingly reopens, hotels are trying to
persuade Americans to make this the summer of the road trip.

Although some hotels have kept a trickle of guests coming through the
doors by catering to essential workers, people seeking a change in
scenery and willing to drive to a vacation spot are the industry’s
lifeline for the foreseeable future. Most business travel and nearly all
group bookings have been postponed, and many travelers are reluctant to
take unnecessary plane trips.

“Everything that we’ve seen and read was pointing to the summer of the
drive market and drive destinations,” said John Davies, vice president
of marketing at Benchmark Resorts & Hotels.

So, hotel marketing campaigns are leaning into nostalgia, invoking the
familiar tropes of the family car ride to a beach, the mountains or a
national park.

Given that many pools, spas, gyms and restaurants remain closed or are
operating in only a limited capacity, hotels are promoting nearby parks,
scenery and vistas along with simple activities that are easy to do
while maintaining social distance. The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess has
held drive-in movie nights, playing family-friendly cartoons and
comedies in its parking lot, while Kimpton hotels in Winston Salem,
N.C., and Los Angeles created pop-up “bodegas” with premade snacks and
bottled cocktails for guests while their restaurants were shuttered.

The focus on regional and short-haul markets is changing how hotels
communicate with travelers and giving a much bigger role to social media
channels. “The messages are getting a little bit more specific,” said
Bjorn Hanson, a hotel industry consultant. “This is a
property-by-property environment — each really has to have its own
unique messaging.”

Is Labor Day our moment to return to the movie theaters? **Warner
Bros.** is betting on it.

On Monday, Warner said that it was scheduling the [oft-moving
“Tenet”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/business/media/tenet-release-delayed.html)
for a Sept. 4 release in the United States. First, though, the film will
open in over 70 countries, including Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Russia, Spain and the United Kingdom, starting on Aug. 26.

Touted as a mind-bending thriller from the filmmaker Christopher Nolan,
“Tenet” has become something of a marker in the [struggle to open
theaters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/business/media/tenet-release-delayed.html?searchResultPosition=3)
in the United States. Originally slated for July 17, the film’s release
has been pushed back twice because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The release of **Walt Disney’s** “Mulan” has also been delayed, as has
“Unhinged,” a Russell Crowe thriller from **Solstice Studios**. While
those are likely to receive new release dates in the late summer or
early fall, other studios have given up on 2020. **Paramount**, for
example, has pushed its wide releases for films like “A Quiet Place 2”
and the “Top Gun” sequel into 2021.

Here’s the latest news in the ongoing negotiations in Washington over a
[new stimulus
package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits.html):

> Republicans are seeking a $400-per-week reduction in unemployment

> initially lowering the payments for tens of millions of jobless
> Americans from $600 to $200, according to officials familiar with the

> The proposal to slash the jobless aid by two thirds, part of a

> over the next round of pandemic relief. Democrats support a $3
> trillion package that includes extending the $600-per-week
> unemployment payments, which expire on Friday, through the end of the
> year.

Gold reached a record high on Monday, continuing its rise as nervous
investors sought a safe place to put their money.

The price for spot gold, which has been [climbing
steadily](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/24/business/stock-market-updates-coronavirus#stocks-fall-and-gold-rallies-as-uncertainty-ripples-through-wall-street)
since March, reached a record high of $1,944 per ounce on Monday.

The price of gold usually rises amid financial uncertainty, and its
recent climb reflected a number of factors, including concern over
U.S.-China relations, the decline of the U.S. dollar amid the Federal
Reserve’s stimulus efforts and rock-bottom interest rates. The last time
gold reached this level was following the 2008 financial crisis, another
time when the Fed flooded the economy with dollars to generate economic
activity.

Stock markets were mixed on Monday, with shares in the United States
slightly higher while those in Europe and Asia were mostly lower. The
S\&P 500 rose more than half a percent, as shares of large technology
companies like **Apple** and **Microsoft** rebounded from a decline last
week. Reflecting the rally in tech stocks, the Nasdaq composite rose
more than 1.5 percent.

Monday saw some encouraging news on the coronavirus vaccine front.
Shares of the biotech company **Moderna** rose more than 9 percent after
it said that it had received [another $472 million in
funding](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/27/us/27reuters-health-coronavirus-moderna.html)
from the U.S. government. Moderna’s experimental vaccine will go [into a
Phase 3
test](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/health/cornavirus-vaccine-moderna.html)
on Monday involving 30,000 people.

The [British government’s abrupt
decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/world/europe/Spain-quarantine-UK-travel.html)
over the weekend to order travelers arriving from Spain to self-isolate
for 14 days, citing a spurt in coronavirus cases in that country, added
to uncertainty over travel restrictions and caused shares of
travel-related companies to dive. The British low-cost airline
**EasyJet** and the European travel company **Tui** each fell sharply,
as did **IAG**, the parent company of **British Airways** and
**Iberia**.

The pandemic has scrambled what fliers want.

Price and schedule flexibility used to be the most important factors in
choosing a flight, but now customers are more concerned about
cleanliness and social distancing throughout the airport and on the
plane, according to Bill Lentsch, a 30-year veteran of **Delta Air
Lines** who serves as its chief customer experience officer.

“The order of priorities is different,” he said in an interview.

Delta is trying to stake a claim as one of the most cautious airlines in
the industry, as it and its peers fight over the few people who are
still flying. The airline has already promised to leave middle seats
empty through September, test all of its employees for the coronavirus
and clean each of its planes between flights.

Last month, Delta teamed up with the Mayo Clinic, and on Monday, it
announced a new partnership with the parent company of Lysol to improve
cleaning in flight, starting with airplane lavatories.

“It doesn’t sound terribly glamorous, but it’s incredibly important to
our people,” Mr. Lentsch said.

The airline hopes those partnerships will yield dividends, helping to
improve its practices in unexpected ways.

“We’re looking for a critical eye to help us fill any gaps and push the
boundaries,” Mr. Lentsch said. “It is my opinion that in three to six
months, there are going to be some products on our airplanes that I’m
not even contemplating right now.”
