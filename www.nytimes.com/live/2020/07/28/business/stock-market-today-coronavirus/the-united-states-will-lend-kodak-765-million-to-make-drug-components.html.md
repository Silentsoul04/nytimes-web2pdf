LOS ANGELES — **Universal Pictures** and **AMC Entertainment**, the No.
1 movie chain in the world, have reached a deal to allow movies to move
to homes after a mere three weeks in theaters in the United States,
almost certainly changing the way that Hollywood does business.

The deal, announced on Tuesday, gives AMC the exclusive right to show
movies from Universal and its Focus Features division for just 17 days
in the United States — down from roughly 90 days, long the industry
norm. After that, the studio has the option to make its movies available
in homes through premium video-on-demand services. Universal may opt to
let big-ticket sellers play exclusively in theaters for longer than 17
days. The studio controls the “Fast and Furious,” “Jurassic World” and
“Despicable Me” franchises.

“The theatrical experience continues to be the cornerstone of our
business,” Donna Langley, chairman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment
Group, said in a statement. “The partnership we’ve forged with AMC is
driven by our collective desire to ensure a thriving future for the film
distribution ecosystem and to meet consumer demand with flexibility and
optionality.”

No firm start date for the deal was set because theaters remain closed
because of the pandemic. AMC has said that it hoped to begin reopening
in “mid to late August,” but has pushed that time line back several
times as virus cases have surged in the country. Universal has cleared
its schedule until October, when it will release “Candyman,” a remake of
the horror classic, directed by Nia DaCosta and co-written and produced
by Jordan Peele.

AMC and Universal said they would start negotiations for international
releases in the coming weeks. AMC has major operations in Europe and the
Middle East.

The Trump administration said on Tuesday that it would extend a $765
million loan to Eastman Kodak Company to begin producing critical
pharmaceutical components, in an effort to allay American dependence on
foreign countries for essential medicines.

The project relies on funding by the Defense Department, which will be
channeled to the film giant through the U.S. International Development
Finance Corporation, a development bank set up by the Trump
administration to replace the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.

The unusual arrangement leverages the Defense Production Act, a Korean
War-era law that gives the government vast powers and resources to
direct certain kinds of production in the interest of national security.
In [an executive order in
May](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fpresidential-actions%2Feo-delegating-authority-dpa-ceo-u-s-international-development-finance-corporation-respond-covid-19-outbreak%2F),
President Trump gave the International Development Finance Corporation,
which typically funds projects in poorer countries, the authority to use
the Defense Production Act to help in the response to the coronavirus
pandemic.

The investment is “the beginning of American independence from our
pharmaceutical dependence on foreign countries,” Peter Navarro, the
director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing policy,
said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network. He
said that the facility and a companion factory in Minnesota would
eventually produce a quarter of the active pharmaceutical ingredients
for generics needed in the United States.

The project will be set up in the Eastman Business Park in Rochester,
N.Y., and will support 360 direct jobs, the company said.

The pandemic has revealed the extent to which domestic companies rely on
foreign suppliers, which may be risky in industries like
pharmaceuticals, said Kaitlin Wowak, a professor at Notre Dame’s Mendoza
College of Business.

“Having domestic companies such as Kodak start producing key ingredients
for generic drugs allows domestic pharmaceutical companies significantly
more control over the supply chain,” she said.

Global same-store sales at **Starbucks** plunged 40 percent in the three
months that ended in June from the same period last year because of
store closures, shortened operating hours and fewer customers owing to
the coronavirus pandemic.

In a quarterly earnings update Tuesday, [Starbucks
reported](https://investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2020/Starbucks-Reports-Q3-Fiscal-2020-Results/default.aspx)
that total revenue was $4.2 billion, down 38 percent from the same
period last year. It lost about $678 million in the period.

The company said that 97 percent of its stores worldwide were now open,
with the largest percentage in Canada, China, Japan and the United
States. In the United States, 96 percent of stores were open, up from 44
percent in April.

Starbucks said it expected that the business would return to
profitability in the next quarter, when global same-store sales were
expected to fall 12 to 17 percent.

Correction: An earlier version of this article, and an accompanying
picture caption, referred incorrectly to the region where 44 percent of
Starbucks stores were open in April. They were stores in the United
States, not the brand’s global stores.

**L Brands**, the owner of **Victoria’s Secret** and **Bath & Body
Works**, [said on
Tuesday](http://investors.lb.com/news-releases/news-release-details/l-brands-provides-update-progress-executing-go-forward-strategy)
that it would lay off 850 associates at its headquarters in Columbus,
Ohio, or 15 percent of staff there, as it works to separate the brands
into two stand-alone companies and manage sales drops tied to the
coronavirus outbreak.

The company, which oversees more than 2,000 stores in North America,
announced the layoffs as part of a broader set of measures that it said
would cut costs by $400 million on an annualized basis, as it faces an
overall sales decline of 20 percent in the second quarter. L Brands
already[reported
a](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/business/coronavirus-economy-stock-market.html)
net sales plunge of 37 percent in the three months that ended May 2.

L Brands said it was tightly managing its merchandise, and it expected
fall inventory receipts at Victoria’s Secret to be down 50 percent
compared with last year. The brand said it would also execute a
previously announced plan to close 250 Victoria’s Secret stores this
year and is negotiating with landlords for rent relief, while working to
cut operating losses in Britain and China, where it closed its
unprofitable Hong Kong flagship store. L Brands said that it planned to
slash Victoria’s Secret store costs through “changes in management
structure and the labor model.”

The retailer said it remained committed to separating the
better-performing Bath & Body Works from Victoria’s Secret while
improving the lingerie giant’s profitability.

L Brands is recovering from [the
termination](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/business/coronavirus-victorias-secret-sale-falls-apart.html)
in May of a deal to sell Victoria’s Secret to Sycamore Partners, a
private equity firm. The acquisition was announced after serious
questions were raised about the leadership of Leslie H. Wexner, a
storied retail magnate who recently stepped down as the chief executive
of L Brands. In the past year, Mr. Wexner had faced scrutiny tied to
[Victoria’s Secret’s internal
culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/business/victorias-secret-razek-harassment.html)
and [his relationship
with](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/business/jeffrey-epstein-wexner-victorias-secret.html)
the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.

Fraudsters may have obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in loans
from a disaster loan program meant to help small businesses devastated
by the coronavirus pandemic, the Small Business Administration’s
internal watchdog said on Tuesday.

Hannibal Ware, the agency’s inspector general, said banks and financial
institutions had fielded more than 5,000 complaints about possible
suspicious transactions. An initial review found signs of “pervasive
fraudulent activity,” he said.

Some $250 million has already gone to potentially ineligible borrowers,
Mr. Ware said [in a
report](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/sba-inspector-general-report-on-eidl-fraud-concerns/dc62cc6f7385acef/full.pdf).
An additional $46 million was spent on what may have been duplicate
payments.

The relief effort, known as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program,
offers eligible companies low-interest loans and small grants. Unlike
the more prominent Paycheck Protection Program — which [has had its own
problems with
scammers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/lamborghini-ppp-covid-19.html)
— the disaster program does not rely on banks to vet applicants and
issue loans. Instead, the S.B.A. makes loans directly from the
government’s coffers; so far, it has lent $160 billion to 2.8 million
businesses.

Organized fraud rings have used social media posts advertising “free
money” to recruit applicants, Mr. Ware said, while other thieves have
used stolen identities to obtain loans. One credit union that received
$15 million in disaster loan deposits audited 60 of the transactions and
found that 59 were fraudulent, he said.

Mr. Ware recommended “immediate action and attention” to prevent further
losses. He identified one especially glaring shortfall: The S.B.A. has
no formal process for working with financial institutions to review
possible fraud cases.

In a written response to Mr. Ware, the S.B.A. said his findings were
“unexpected.” The agency said it was working with three large banks —
it did not name them — to investigate their concerns about “a high
amount of suspicious activity” related to the disaster-loan program, and
said that it planned to convene a task force to create a system for
responding to banks’ reports.

U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as investors awaited a batch of corporate
earnings results and the details of a new federal stimulus bill in
Congress.

The S\&P 500 closed nearly 1 percent lower. European stocks were mostly
lower, after Asian markets closed mostly higher.

The [price of
gold](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/business/gold-prices-record-high.html)
briefly hit a record of $1,980 an ounce before dropping lower. In
Turkey, [the lira
fell](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/28/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/turkey-faces-currency-crisis-as-lira-nears-record-lows)
and the country’s central bank appeared to be running out of ammunition
to stop its decline toward record lows.

In industry news, a global airline group said airline revenues were not
expected to recover to last year’s levels until 2024.

The [Federal Reserve announced
Tuesday](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/28/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#the-fed-will-extend-its-emergency-programs-through-2020)
that it would extend its emergency lending programs through the end of
2020 as the coronavirus continues to surge across the nation. Many of
the [Fed’s nine
programs](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/business/economy/coronavirus-fed-bond-buying.html),
which are meant to keep credit flowing through the financial system
during times of stress, were originally set to expire on or around the
end of September.

Meanwhile, coronavirus cases continue to surge in parts of the United
States. On Monday, Texas became the fourth state (after California, New
York and Florida) to report more than 400,000 cases. Investors are
watching Washington lawmakers try to negotiate [another round of
stimulus

**McDonald’s** said Tuesday that it continued to suffer the impact of
the global coronavirus pandemic, reporting that net income fell 68
percent to $483.8 million in the second quarter compared to a year ago.

McDonald’s said global same-store revenues fell 24 percent in the
quarter, an improvement as restrictions eased in parts of the world and
restaurants were able to reopen.

Fast-food chains with drive-through operations like McDonald’s have
fared generally better than other restaurants during the pandemic. But
executives said on Tuesday that the company had spent $200 million since
the beginning of the pandemic supporting its franchisees, including on
advertising to boost sales.

“Our strong drive-through presence and the investments we’ve made in
delivery and digital over the past few years have served us well through
these uncertain times,” said Chris Kempczinski, the president and chief
executive.

McDonald’s has reopened 2,000 restaurant dining rooms with limited
seating capacity in the United States.

**Nissan** said on Tuesday that it expected to make an annual operating
loss of $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic
puts pressure on its attempts to reboot its struggling business.

The
[announcement](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/200728-03-e)came
as the Japanese automaker reported its results for the three-month
period that ended in June. Operating profit during the period, when much
of the world’s economies were in lockdown to prevent the spread of the
virus, plunged $1.46 billion compared with the same period a year ago,
with automobile sales dropping by nearly 48 percent.

The results followed an annual loss of $385 million in fiscal year 2019.

If Nissan’s projections for the fiscal year prove accurate, the 2020
annual loss would be the largest for the company since it was pulled
from the edge of bankruptcy by its former chief executive and chairman,
Carlos Ghosn, nearly two decades ago.

Nissan has been struggling to reinvent itself since the 2018 arrest of
Mr. Ghosn on charges of financial wrongdoing. He has maintained his
innocence and fled Japan late last year, saying he would not be able to
find justice there.

Mr. Ghosn’s era was marked by an attempt to increase market share at the
cost of profits and quality, executives say. Now Nissan has said it
plans to retrench and rebuild its business by focusing on its alliance
with French automaker **Renault**, cutting costs, producing fewer cars
and focusing on introducing new vehicles to a lineup that has long been
criticized as stale.

**Omnicom Group**, one of the world’s largest marketing conglomerates,
made “very difficult and permanent” changes during the pandemic as
companies slashed advertising spending and events were canceled, its
chief executive, John Wren, said Tuesday.

Omnicom’s revenue sank nearly 25 percent to $2.8 billion in its second
quarter. The decline “is expected to continue for the remainder of the
year,” according to the company, which suffered a loss of $24.2 million;
a year ago, it recorded $370.7 million in net income in the quarter.

To adapt to the pandemic, Omnicom laid off 6,100 employees, shed more
than 1 million square feet of office space and dropped several smaller
businesses. It also tapped wage subsidy programs from several
governments, froze hiring and salary increases, scaled back its use of
freelancers and implemented some pay cuts.

Similar streamlining is happening [throughout the advertising
industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/business/media/a-big-correction-pandemic-brings-change-to-bloated-ad-industry.html),
as brands and agencies weigh years of wasteful traditions and bloated
bureaucracies against uncertain budgets. “Old habits die hard, but
people are being forced out of necessity to adapt faster,” said Marcelo
Pascoa, the vice president for marketing for the beer brand Coors.

Mr. Wren said on an investor call on Tuesday that Omnicom’s future could
be affected by a second wave of coronavirus cases, the timing and
content of government stimulus packages, and shifting consumer
sentiment. But he was optimistic: “We think the worst is behind us.”

  - **Avis Budget Group** reported a steep 67 percent decline in revenue
    in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, but said that
    the drop was uneven across its network. Revenue at its non-airport
    locations have nearly recovered, it said, a sign that many people
    are still renting cars even as they shun other modes of
    transportation like public transit and airplanes.

  - **Best Buy**
    [followed](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/27/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/target-thanksgiving)
    **Walmart**, **Target** and **Dick’s Sporting Goods** by saying on
    Tuesday that it will close its stores on Thanksgiving Day this year.
    The chain said that it would start offering its holiday deals
    earlier and enhance the way it fulfilled orders “to meet our
    customers’ changing lives this holiday.” Best Buy said that it
    started opening on Thanksgiving Day in 2013, after opening at
    midnight on Black Friday in 2012.

  - A global airline industry group says it expects the recovery to take
    longer than expected as a rise in infections around the world slows
    the reopening of borders. Airline revenues are not expected to
    recover to last year’s levels until 2024, according to the group,
    the **International Air Transport Association**.

  - **Selfridges**, a British chain of high-end department stores, said
    Tuesday it would cut about 450 jobs, 14 percent of its work force.
    The flagship store, which opened in 1909 and includes several
    restaurants and a cinema, is in central London’s main shopping
    district, where foot traffic has plummeted because of the pandemic.
