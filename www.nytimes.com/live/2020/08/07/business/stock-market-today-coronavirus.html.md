The American economy gained 1.8 million jobs last month, even as the
coronavirus surged in many parts of the country and newly reintroduced
restrictions caused some businesses to close for a second time.

Still, the increase [reported Friday by the Labor
Department](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) was well
below the 4.8 million jump in jobs in June and a sign that momentum is
slowing after a burst of economic activity in late spring. The
unemployment rate fell to 10.2 percent.

“The labor market continues to heal, which is encouraging, but there is
a long road ahead,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank
of America.

She noted that 42 percent of the jobs lost since the pandemic hit had
now been recovered, but warned the remainder would be harder to make up.

“In the very early stages of the recovery it’s easier to bring back
workers quickly just to have a functioning operation,” she said. “It’s
not a snap back to pre-Covid levels by any means. It’s a healing
process.”

But dig a little deeper and the picture isn’t so bright.

The [Labor Department’s U-6
measure](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm), which
includes discouraged workers who have given up the search for work as
well as those who are in part-time jobs because they can’t find
full-time positions, stands at 16.5 percent, seasonally adjusted.

The U-6 figure has come down from 22.8 percent in April. Still, the U-6
is among a series of data points that underscore just how difficult the
labor market remains for those out of work.

“The rate of churn in the labor market remains incredibly high,”
concluded Morgan Stanley’s economics team. In plain English, that means
millions of workers finding a job only to be fired soon afterward, or
being let go permanently after assuming a layoff was temporary.

“I think the U-6 is a better indicator of the job market than the 10
percent unemployment rate,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist
at S\&P Global. “The traditional unemployment rate doesn’t capture
what’s happening on the ground.”

**G/O Media**, the publisher of **The Onion**, **Gizmodo**, **Jezebel**
and several other websites, laid off more than a dozen staff members in
its video department Friday, prompting accusations from the employees’
union that websites’ editors in chief had not been consulted.

A G/O Media spokeswoman said that 15 employees had been let go. A
statement said the decision was necessary to allow the company to invest
in other areas.

“In our efforts to strengthen editorial teams at G/O Media, we completed
a thorough evaluation of our traffic and sites,” it said. “In doing so,
we’re making the unfortunate but necessary decision to change our
current process of video production.”

But in a statement posted on Twitter, the GMG Union accused the company
of taking the video department’s legs out from under it.

“Instead of working with editorial leadership to figure out how to
execute a successful video strategy,” it said, “they laid off many
talented and vital staff members, leaving a serious gap in sites’
abilities to produce any videos at all.”

In April, G/O laid off 14 workers in response to the coronavirus
pandemic, which has caused a sharp drop in advertising.

But the media company had been struggling before the pandemic. Last
fall, nearly two dozen employees resigned from the sports news site
**Deadspin** after its acting editor in chief was fired, causing the
sports blog to fall silent for several months. Also that fall, G/O
shuttered **Splinter**, a politics-focused blog.

G/O is owned by the Boston private equity firm **Great Hill Partners**,
which purchased what was then known as **Gizmodo Media Group** from
**Univision** in April 2019. Univision in turn had bought several of the
sites from **Gawker Media**, which had filed for bankruptcy in 2016
following a $140 million judgment in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit
secretly bankrolled by the Silicon Valley executive Peter Thiel.

During the pandemic, wealthy families have continued to use their
investment pools, known as family offices, to gain access to the type of
high-return opportunities once reserved for institutional investors. But
they are taking a more hands-on role in those financial decisions.

These family offices have chosen to bypass private equity and venture
capital funds — which have high minimum investments and sizable fees —
to invest directly in companies, either by themselves or with other
significantly wealthy families, [a
report](https://www.fintrx.com/fintrx-charles-schwab-2020-family-office-report)
released on Friday found.

Half of all family offices in the world make direct investments in
companies, according to the report, which was released by Fintrx, a data
and research company, and sponsored by Charles Schwab’s family office
arm.

“Family offices add value in times of crisis,” said Russ D’Argento,
founder and chief executive of Fintrx. “That’s a big component of how
they stand out and can be different from other fund structures.”

With so many distressed companies looking for investors in the pandemic,
family offices have an opportunity to leverage the “family alpha,” or
the operating knowledge that a family has in the area from which its
wealth came, said Kristi Kuechler, managing director of client relations
at Vernal Point Advisors, a multifamily office.

“There are families who have as much knowledge of a sector as a private
equity firm,” Ms. Kuechler said.

The Canadian government said on Friday that it planned to impose tariffs
on aluminum products from the United States, in a tit-for-tat response
to a similar measure announced by President Trump on Thursday.

Canada’s tariffs, on “aluminum and aluminum-containing products from the
U.S.,” will take effect by Sept. 16 and will remain in place until the
United States eliminates its tariffs, the Canadian government said in a
statement on Friday.  
  
The statement included a list of products that might be subject to the
tariffs, from aluminum wire to refrigerators and washing machines.

President Trump said Thursday that he would impose a [10 percent tariff
on Canadian
aluminum](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/business/economy/trump-canadian-aluminum-tariffs.html)
in an effort to help struggling American producers. In a speech at a
Whirpool factory in Clyde, Ohio, Mr. Trump accused Canada of “taking
advantage of us as usual.”

In early 2018, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from
Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which caused those countries to
impose their own tariffs on good from the United States. The tariffs
from Canada and Mexico were not lifted until the next year.

With 13 million fewer people working since the pandemic hit, according
to the [monthly jobs report released on
Friday](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm), the economist
Kenneth S. Rogoff — an expert on financial crises — says the American
economy is at a precarious point.

“We are going to clock the worst recession since the Great Depression,
regardless of how fast we bounce back at this point,” he said. “The
virus is coming back, hard and fast. It really does look like this is
going to have profound long-term impacts.”

A Harvard University professor, Mr. Rogoff is a noted historian of
economic calamities. His books include “This Time Is Different: Eight
Centuries of Financial Folly,” written with Carmen M. Reinhart in 2009.

Mr. Rogoff said the current state of virus was reminiscent of 1918
Spanish Flu, in which the second wave of virus proved even more
devastating from an economic and public health perspective than the
first. At this point, the economic damage from the coronavirus has far
surpassed the 2008 recession, he said.

Small businesses will be hit hardest, Mr. Rogoff said.

“We’re going to start to see a lot of small businesses fall by the
wayside, a lot of people who are unemployed become chronically
unemployed,” he said. “We’re in very, very dangerous territory.”

Large corporations will be more shielded from the impact of the virus,
accelerating their ability to crush smaller competitors, a trend that
the United States has been experiencing over the last 40 years, he said.

“They have cash reserves to survive this,” he said. “And so their
monopoly power is going to grow.”

Despite renewed restrictions on business activity in some parts of the
country, the leisure and hospitality industry managed to show some signs
of life in July, gaining 592,000 jobs, or one-third of the total gain in
payrolls for the month.

The sector was among the hardest hit when restaurants and bars closed
abruptly in March as the pandemic hit. July’s increase follows a jump of
3.4 million in May and June, seasonally adjusted, but still leaves
employment in the leisure and hospitality field 4.3 million below where
it was in February.

Retail, another hard-hit sector which has seen numerous bankruptcies in
recent months, added 258,000 jobs.

“Retail and leisure and hospitality are two of the sectors most
sensitive to coronavirus, and I was pleasantly surprised by the pace of
job creation there,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank
of America.

The plunge in employment in these sectors hit lower-paid workers
especially hard, including millions who depend on tips. For big
increases in hiring at restaurants and bars, employees may need to wait
until indoor dining is again permitted in states like New York —
something unlikely to occur until a vaccine is found.

Employment in state and local government arrested its decline in July —
but the change was largely the result of a quirk in how the numbers are
adjusted, and it left the combined work forces much smaller than
February.

Local governments have cut about 970,000 jobs since the month before the
pandemic took hold, while state governments now employ 200,000 fewer
people, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Combined, they have shed nearly
6 percent of their pre-pandemic work force.

Economists and policymakers are concerned that the job losses will
continue as local government budgets come under extreme strain. While
July offered what seemed to be a reprieve, with state and local hiring
ticking up, the improvement was heavily driven by education hiring as
seasonal adjustments made the numbers look rosier. On an unadjusted
basis, the figures showed [continued
declines](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CEU9093000001).

“Typically, public-sector education employment declines in July,” the
Bureau of Labor Statistics
[said](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) in its release,
but “declines occurred earlier than usual this year due to the pandemic,
resulting in unusually large July increases” after the seasonal
adjustment.

Aid to state and local governments remains a flash point in negotiations
over a new federal relief package. Democrats [are pushing
for](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-stimulus.html)
more assistance, something that congressional Republicans and the White
House have resisted or opposed.

The Federal Reserve and Treasury Department [have established a
program](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/business/house-democrats-want-fed-to-give-cities-and-states-more-help-by-improving-program-terms.html)
to buy short-term municipal debt from certain state and local
governments, but it has not been used much. The terms are not generous,
experts have said, and many local governments are hoping for grants
rather than loans that they would have to pay back.

Without help, further job losses could be in store.

“Unlike small businesses or restaurants — which respond immediately to
economic shocks — deep budget and job cuts in state and local government
will likely grow in the next few months and fester for years to come,”

Stocks on Wall Street lost their footing on Friday, as investors moved
cautiously amid escalating tensions between the United States and China
and little indication that lawmakers in Washington were close to
resolving their differences over the next economic aid package.

It helped, somewhat, that the monthly employment report showed that
American employers [added 1.8 million
jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/07/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/us-employers-added-1-8-million-jobs-in-july-despite-a-coronavirus-surge)
in July, continuing a rebound that began earlier this year. But even in
that report there were reasons for caution: The rate of hiring slowed
substantially from June, and the unemployment rate remained above 10
percent.

After recouping early losses, the S\&P 500 was essentially unchanged by
the end of trading Friday. Technology stocks that have led shares higher
in recent days tumbled on Friday, with the Nasdaq composite down nearly
1 percent as **Apple**, **Amazon**, **Alphabet** and **Microsoft** all
declined.

Hanging over Wall Street was President Trump’s decision late Thursday to
order sweeping restrictions on two popular [Chinese social media
networks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html),
**TikTok** and **WeChat.** Two executive orders cited national security
concerns in barring transactions with WeChat or TikTok by any person or
property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The orders
take effect in 45 days.

The moves are expected to prompt [retaliation from
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/trump-china-wechat-tiktok.html).
A Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman called the executive
orders a “nakedly hegemonic act.” Shares in **Tencent**, the parent
company of WeChat, fell almost 6 percent, and markets in Asia dropped.

Investors were also watching talks in Washington over what shape another
economic aid package would take. Federal unemployment benefits, a
moratorium on evictions and aid for small businesses shuttered during
the pandemic hang in the balance, and economists have repeatedly warned
that failure to extend the assistance could imperil the American
economy.

On Friday, negotiations between the White House and Democrats stalled,
as both sides said they remained deeply divided on the package.
President Trump’s advisers said they would recommend that he bypass
Congress and act on his own to provide relief.

Here’s some of the news you might have missed.

  - **The Evening Standard**, a free daily newspaper in London, is
    planning to lay off 139 employees, or about a third of the staff, as
    well as other noncontract workers. The paper’s main readership —
    commuters in central London — has all but vanished because of the
    pandemic, but the company was already facing financial difficulty,
    having reported a pre-tax loss of £13.6 million ($17.8 million) last
    year. A spokesperson said the company would focus on growing the
    paper’s digital and live events business. .

  - **Uber** said on Thursday that its revenue in the second quarter
    dropped 29 percent to $2.2 billion from a year ago and that its net
    loss narrowed to $1.8 billion, as the ride-hailing giant deals with
    the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The revenue decline was
    the steepest since
    [Uber](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/uber-reports-steep-revenue-decline-as-delivery-outpaces-ride-hailing)
    went public in May 2019.

  - Rupert Murdoch’s **[News
    Corp](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/dow-jones-was-news-corps-only-growing-division-this-past-fiscal-year)**
    reported a $401 million loss for the three months ending in June,
    with much of the decline related to impairment charges for some of
    its assets in Britain and Australia and restructuring costs related
    to the coronavirus pandemic. The company revealed for the first time
    financial details of its **Dow Jones** division, the group that
    publishes The Wall Street Journal. The unit was News Corp’s only
    growing business on an annual basis.

  - With operations ceased for the entirety of the quarter and most of
    its employees laid off or furloughed, **[AMC
    Entertainment](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/amcs-quarterly-revenues-dropped-98-7-percent-from-last-year)**,
    the largest theater chain in the United States, posted a quarterly
    loss for the period ended June of $561.2 million. Revenues totaled
    $18.9 million, a 98.7 percent plunge from the same period last year
    for the Kansas-based company. The coronavirus has laid waste to
    AMC’s 1,000 theaters scattered across the globe, calling into
    question whether it would be able to stay financially viable.

  - The Trump administration is considering forcing Chinese companies to
    delist their shares from stock exchanges in the United States unless
    they share their audits with American regulators, a move that would
    further ratchet up tension between the world’s two largest
    economies. The [President’s Working Group on Financial
    Markets](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/06/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/us-may-insist-chinese-companies-share-audits-or-delist-their-shares-from-american-exchanges)
    recommended the move in a report released on Thursday as a way to
    protect American investors from what it described as the [risks
    posed by Chinese
    companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/business/in-china-inspecting-the-inspectors.html).
