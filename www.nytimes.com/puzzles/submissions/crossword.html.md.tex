\paragraph{Construction Guidelines}\label{construction-guidelines}}

Themes

Themes should be fresh, interesting, narrowly defined and consistently
applied throughout the puzzle. If the theme includes a particular kind
of pun, for example, then all the puns should be of that kind. Themes
and theme entries should be accessible to everyone. Themeless daily
puzzles using wide-open patterns are also welcome, provided the word
count is below 72.

Fill

Constructors should emphasize lively words, names and fresh phrases. We
especially encourage the use of phrases from everyday writing and
speech, whether or not they are in the dictionary. For variety, try some
of the lesser-used letters of the alphabet --- J, Q, X, Z, K, W, etc.
Brand names are acceptable if they're well known nationally and you use
them in moderation.

Do not use partial phrases longer than five letters (ONE TO A, A STITCH
IN, etc.), uninteresting obscurity (a Bulgarian village, a water bug
genus, etc.) or uncommon abbreviations. Foreign words are allowed
provided most Americans would be familiar with them (LAIT, OJO, NEIN).
Keep crosswordese to a minimum --- that is, answers that appear far more
in crosswords than in real life (ERNE, ASTA, ARETE, YSER, etc.)
Difficult words are fine --- especially for the harder daily puzzles
that run late in the week --- if the words are interesting bits of
knowledge or useful additions to the vocabulary. However, never let two
obscure words or names cross.

Constructor Tools and Tips

There are many options for making a crossword puzzle, including the
good, old-fashioned graph-paper-and-pencil method, though several
software programs exist as well. For a full list of these programs, as
well as tips from New York Times constructors and editors on the puzzle
making process, see our series
on~\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/crosswords/how-to-make-a-crossword-puzzle-the-series.html}{How
to Make a Crossword Puzzle.}

\subparagraph{Technical Specs}\label{technical-specs}}

Basic Rules

While we encourage new and creative crossword themes, there are a few
hard rules when it comes to constructing New York Times crosswords.
These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Crosswords must have black square symmetry, which typically comes in
  the form of 180-degree rotational symmetry;
\item
  Crosswords must have all-over interlock;
\item
  Crosswords must not have unchecked squares  (i.e., all letters must be
  found in both Across and Down answers);
\item
  All answers must be at least 3 letters long;
\item
  Black squares should be used in moderation.
\end{itemize}

Maximum Word Count

78 words for a 15×15 (72 for a themeless); 140 for a 21×21. Maximums may
be exceeded slightly at the editor's discretion, if the theme warrants.

Rights

Times puzzles must never have been published anywhere before, either in
print or electronically. The Times buys all rights, including first
rights.

Formatting

Use regular typing paper (8 1/2″ × 11″). Type the clues double-spaced on
the left (no periods after the numbers), answer words in a corresponding
column on the far right. Down clues need not begin on a new page.
Include a filled-in answer grid with numbers. Put your name, address and
email address on the grid page.

An example is shown below, which you

as a pdf.}

Payment

Payment varies based on the day of the week and number of puzzles you've
had published with The New York Times.
