    As a California resident, you have additional rights under the
    California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. While The New York Times
    Company does not “sell” personal information of its readers as the
    term “sell” is traditionally understood, “sell” under the CCPA is
    broadly defined. To learn more, review the text below.

    The New York Times Company does not sell personal information of its
    readers as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. But “sell”
    under the CCPA is broadly defined. It includes the sharing of
    personal information with third parties in exchange for something of
    value, even if no money changes hands. For example, sharing an
    advertising or device identifier to a third party may be considered
    a “sale” under the CCPA.
    To the extent The New York Times Company “sells” your personal
    information (as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA), you have
    the right to opt-out of that “sale” on a going-forward basis at any
    time. To exercise this right, click the “Do Not Sell My Personal
    Information” link in the footer of our website or under your
    “Account,” which you have already done. You can also submit a
    request to opt-out by emailing us at <privacy@nytimes.com> with the
    subject line “California Resident - Do Not Sell.”
    Once you have opted out, you will see a change to “We No Longer Sell
    Your Personal Information.” If you have an account with certain
    Times Services (specifically nytimes.com, cooking.nytimes.com,
    nytimes.com/crosswords, the New York Times app, the New York Times
    Cooking app and the New York Times Crossword app) and are logged in,
    we will save your preference and honor your opt-out request across
    browsers and devices so long as you remain logged in. If you are not
    logged in, or do not have an account with any Times Services listed
    above, your opt-out of the “sale” of personal information will be
    specific to the browser or device from which you have clicked “Do
    Not Sell My Personal Information” and until you clear your cookies
    (or local storage in apps) on this browser or device.
    If your browser or device is using a “do not track” setting, we will
    detect it and honor it on that specific browser or device only. If
    you wish to have a “do not track” experience across all of your
    browsers and devices, please make sure that all of your browsers and
    devices are set on “do not track.”
    After you opt out of the “sale” of your personal information, we
    will no longer “sell” your personal information to third parties
    (except in an aggregated or de-identified manner so it is no longer
    personal information), but we will continue to share your personal
    information with our service providers, which process it on our
    behalf. Exercising your right to opt out of the “sale” of your
    personal information does not mean that you will stop seeing ads on
    our sites and apps.
    To opt-out of interest-based advertising as much as technically
    possible, go to [“How Do I Manage
    Trackers”](https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/cookie-policy#how-do-i-manage-trackers)
    in our Cookie Policy. To opt out of the “sale” of your personal
    information from participating companies, please visit the Digital
    Advertising Alliance
    [website](https://optout.privacyrights.info/?c=1) or
    [apps](https://www.privacyrights.info/appchoices). We do not control
    these opt-out mechanisms and are not responsible for their
    operation.
    You can designate someone else to make a request on your behalf. To
    protect your information, we will ask for a signed permission from
    you authorizing the other person to submit a request on your behalf.
    We will contact you to verify your identity before we respond to
    your authorized agent’s request.
    After 12 months, we may ask you if you want to opt into the “sale”
    of your personal information.
    For further information, please refer to our [Privacy
    Policy](https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/privacy-policy).
