  There were 15 of them. Most arrived in the dead of night, laid their
  trap and waited for the target to arrive. That target was Jamal
  Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic of his country's government and
  its young crown prince. Since his killing in Istanbul, Turkish media
  has released a steady drip feed of evidence implicating Saudi
  officials. Weeks of investigation by The Times builds on that evidence
  and reconstructs what unfolded, hour-by-hour. Our timeline shows the
  ruthless efficiency of a hit team of experts that seemed specially
  chosen from Saudi government ministries. Some had links to the crown
  prince himself. After a series of shifting explanations, Saudi Arabia
  now denies that this brazen hit job was premeditated. But this
  reconstruction of the killing, and the botched cover-up, calls their
  story into serious question. It's Friday morning, Sept. 28. Khashoggi
  and his fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, are at the local marriage office in
  Istanbul. In order to marry, he's told that he needs Saudi paperwork
  and goes straight to the consulate to arrange it. They tell him to
  return in a week. It all seems routine, but it's not. Inside there's a
  Saudi spy, Ahmed al-Muzaini, who's working under diplomatic cover.
  That very day, he flies off to Riyadh and helps concoct a plan to
  intercept Khashoggi when he returns to the consulate. Fast-forward to
  Monday night into Tuesday morning. Saudi agents converge in Istanbul
  aboard separate flights. Muzaini, the spy, flies back from Riyadh. A
  commercial flight carries a three-man team that we believe flew from
  Cairo. Two of the men are security officers and they've previously
  traveled with the crown prince. A private jet flying from Riyadh lands
  around 3:30 a.m. That plane is often used by the Saudi government, and
  it's carrying nine Saudi officials, some who played key roles in
  Khashoggi's death. We'll get to Team 3 later on, and for now focus on
  these men from Team 2. This is Salah al-Tubaigy, a high-ranking
  forensics and autopsy expert in the Saudi interior ministry. Turkish
  officials will later say his role was to dismember Khashoggi's body.
  Another is Mustafa al-Madani, a 57-year-old engineer. As we'll see,
  it's no accident that he looks like Khashoggi. And this is Maher
  Mutreb, the leader of the operation. Our investigation into his past
  reveals a direct link between Mutreb and the Saudi crown prince. When
  bin Salman toured a Houston neighborhood earlier this year, we
  discovered that Mutreb was with him, a glowering figure in the
  background. We found him again in Boston, at a U.N. meeting in New
  York, in Madrid and Paris, too. This global tour was all part of a
  charm offensive by the prince to paint himself as a moderate reformer.
  Back then, Mutreb was in the royal guard. Now, he would orchestrate
  Khashoggi's killing. And his close ties to the crown prince beg the
  question, just how high up the Saudi chain of command did the plot to
  kill go? Early Tuesday morning, Khashoggi flies back from a weekend
  trip to London. He and the Saudis nearly cross paths at the airport.
  The Saudi teams check into two hotels, which give quick access to the
  consulate. Khashoggi heads home with his fiancée. He'd just bought an
  apartment for their new life together. By mid-morning, the Saudis are
  on the move. Mutreb leaves his hotel three hours before Khashoggi is
  due at the consulate. The rest of the team isn't far behind. The
  building is only a few minutes away on foot, and soon, they're spotted
  at this entrance. Mutreb arrives first. Next, we see al-Tubaigy, the
  autopsy expert. And now al-Madani, the lookalike. The stage is almost
  set. A diplomatic car pulls out of the consulate driveway and switches
  places with a van, which backs in. Turkish officials say this van
  would eventually carry away Khashoggi's remains. From above, we can
  see the driveway is covered, hiding any activity around the van from
  public view. Meanwhile, Khashoggi and his fiancée set out for the
  consulate, walking hand-in-hand. In their final hour together, they
  chat about dinner plans and new furniture for their home. At 1:13
  p.m., they arrive at the consulate. Khashoggi gives her his cellphones
  before he enters. He walks into the consulate. It's the last time we
  see him. Inside, Khashoggi is brought to the consul general's office
  on the second floor. The hit team is waiting in a nearby room. Sources
  briefed on the evidence, told us Khashoggi quickly comes under attack.
  He's dragged to another room and is killed within minutes. Then
  al-Tubaigy, the autopsy expert, dismembers his body while listening to
  music. Maher Mutreb makes a phone call to a superior. He says, ``Tell
  your boss,'' and ``The deed was done.'' Outside, the van reportedly
  carrying Khashoggi's body pulls out of the side entrance and drives
  away. At the same time, the Saudis begin trying to cover their tracks.
  While Khashoggi's fiancée waits here where she left him, two figures
  leave from the opposite side. One of them is wearing his clothes.
  Later, the Saudis would claim that this was Khashoggi. But it's
  al-Madani, the engineer, now a body double pretending that the missing
  journalist left the consulate alive. Yet there's one glaring flaw: The
  clothes are the same, but he's wearing his own sneakers, the ones he
  walked in with. Meanwhile, the van that's allegedly carrying
  Khashoggi's body makes the two-minute drive from the consulate to the
  Saudi consul's residence. There's several minutes of deliberations but
  the van eventually pulls into the building's driveway. Again, it's
  hidden from public view. It's now three hours since Khashoggi was last
  seen. The body double hails this taxi and continues weaving a false
  trail through the city. He heads to a popular tourist area and then
  changes back into his own clothes. Later, we see him joking around in
  surveillance footage. Over at the airport, more Saudi officials arrive
  on another flight from Riyadh. They spend just five hours in Istanbul,
  but we're not sure where they go. Now we pick up Maher Mutreb again,
  exiting from the consul's house. It's time for them to go. Mutreb and
  others check out of their hotel and move through airport security.
  Al-Muzaini, the spy, heads to the airport too. But as they're leaving
  Istanbul, Khashoggi's fiancée is still outside the consulate, pacing
  in circles. She'll soon raise the alarm that Khashoggi is missing and
  she'll wait for him until midnight. The alarm spreads around the
  world. Nine days later, the Saudis send another team to Istanbul. They
  say it's to investigate what happened. But among them are a
  toxicologist and a chemist, who also has ties to the hit team. He and
  Tubaigy attended a forensics graduation days before Khashoggi was
  killed. Turkish officials later say that this team's mission was not
  to investigate, but to cover up the killing. Now the Saudi story has
  changed, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for several
  suspects in Khashoggi's killing. But that doesn't include Crown Prince
  Mohammed bin Salman, who many Western government officials are
  convinced authorized the killing. Khashoggi's remains still haven't
  been found.
