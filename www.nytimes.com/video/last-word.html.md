## The Last Word: Harold Prince

#### In a never-before-seen interview, the legendary Broadway producer Harold Prince sat down with The New York Times in 2008 to talk about his life, career and accomplishments.

</div>

  -   
    “No show gets a free ride because you had a success before. You’re
    as naked as you were the first day you worked, and you better make
    it good.” For more than half a century, Harold Prince produced or
    directed many of the most successful and influential musicals on
    Broadway. \[singing\] “The Pajama Game.” \[singing\] “West Side
    Story.” \[singing\] \[singing\] “Fiddler on the Roof.” \[singing\]
    And “Phantom of the Opera,” the longest-running show in Broadway
    history. \[singing\] \[singing\] Prince, perhaps more than anyone
    else, trailblazed a new direction for the modern musical. We sat
    down with this Broadway titan in September 2008, to discuss his
    career and the astounding 21 Tony awards he has won, more Tonys than
    anyone else. “It’s a nice thing to get them, but they are not a
    measure. ‘West Side Story.’ That never got a Tony. That was
    history-making, but not celebrated at its time. History is littered
    with great works of art that got terrible reviews originally. And
    they survived.” Harold Prince was born in 1928 and raised in New
    York City during the Great Depression. As a young boy, his family
    often took him to the theater, where he loved to escape. “I was a
    very solitary kid. I had a theater made of cardboard, and I would
    listen to the opera on Saturdays and Milton Cross would tell the
    story of the opera.” Announcer: “The opera house is in complete
    darkness for this opening storm-raging scene.” “And I would move
    little tin people around on the stage. It was my solitary,
    imaginative world. The world that I conjured up in my head was much
    more real than the world outside.” But the hardships of the Great
    Depression took its toll on Prince. And at the age of 14, he had
    what he says was a nervous breakdown. “I wandered the street having
    kind of conversations in my head. I came to my parents and said, I
    think there’s something really wrong. It’s just a black cloud over
    everything. And within a space of about three months, it began to go
    away. The legacy of it was that I came out of it a different person
    — extremely ambitious. I wanted what I wanted, and I was going to
    get it.” He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1948.
    “I came back to New York. And then I thought, what am I going to
    do?” What he did was write a letter to George Abbott, Broadway’s
    most important producer and director at the time, asking for a job.
    “I said, I would like to work for you. I live with my parents and
    the subway’s a nickel. I can afford to work for six months for
    nothing. And here was the clincher — if you can tell that you’re not
    paying me, then fire me, please. It’s a very intriguing thing.”
    Abbott took Prince under his wing, employing him primarily as an
    assistant stage manager. By 1954, after a two-year stint in the
    Army, an opportunity came his way — a book about a strike in a
    pajama factory, courtesy of his friend and future producing partner,
    Robert Griffith. “Bobby Griffith called me one day and said, there’s
    a book review in The Times. It seems like a musical. I called around
    to find the agent. He said, you know I’ve had another offer. Leland
    Hayward has made an offer. And I think there will be other offers.
    What can you guys give me that would persuade me? We said, well, if
    we could talk George Abbott into directing it, would that interest
    you? He said, if you can talk George Abbott into directing it, the
    book is yours.” \[singing\] Reporter: “This was your first show and
    you had a hit.” “Huge hit. Huge hit. On the opening night at the St.
    James Theater, Bobby Griffith and I were on either side of the
    stage. And when the show was over, we simply walked across the stage
    and embraced each other. It was a giant smash, long lines the next
    day, and so on.” Directed by Abbott and Jerome Robbins, and
    choreographed by Bob Fosse, “The Pajama Game” won the Tony award for
    best musical. “It’s often very hard to follow a hit with another
    hit. There’s a sophomore jinx, but you did.” “Yeah. Well, George
    Abbott found a book called ‘The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant.’
    He said, I think it’d make a good musical. Want to do it? A year
    later, we opened. It was a hit.” \[singing\] “Damn Yankees,” a tale
    of a man who sells his soul to the devil to help the Washington
    Senators win the pennant. It was directed by Abbott, and again,
    choreographed by Fosse. \[singing\] Then came a landmark in Prince’s
    career. Stephen Sondheim had become a good friend. But in the
    mid-1950s, Prince had become a Broadway success, and Sondheim was
    still hoping for his first Broadway credit. “He was working on what
    became ‘West Side Story.’ He was Lenny Bernstein’s lyricist.” The
    show lost its producer while in development and was without
    financing. Prince told Sondheim that he and Robert Griffith were
    interested in producing it. “I said, could you put together the
    authors? And we would hear the score. Steve had been told by Lenny
    never to play the score for anyone. So I went to Bernstein’s
    apartment and Lenny played the score. And I started to hum along the
    score, and he stopped halfway through it and said, that’s what I’ve
    always wanted: A musical producer who really understands music. And
    I never did tell him that I’d heard the score dozens of times.”
    \[singing\] \[singing\] “We loved it and turned to them and said,
    we’ll do it. But we have to raise the money very quickly. We had
    such a successful track record that, I’d say, we’re doing a musical.
    Please tell us within the next 24 hours whether you want in. And
    within 24 hours, everyone was in. And we had it.” \[singing\] “West
    Side Story” made its debut on Broadway in 1957. “It was not as big a
    hit as the first two. That I would stand at the back of the theater
    and I thought, you’re backstage at theater history. And by God,
    you’re a small part of it.” \[singing\] In 1961, Prince suffered a
    major shock when his producing partner, Robert Griffith, died
    suddenly. “Bobby was playing golf and had a heart attack and died
    the next day. I was at the hospital. And I mean, what could be more
    shocking? He was in his 50s. And I thought, you know, it’s sort of
    the end of the world. I really relied on him enormously.” Prince had
    already been thinking about doing more than producing hits and the
    loss of his producing partner spurred him on. “What I really wanted
    to do was that cliché. What I really want to be is a director.” His
    first notable hit was “She Loves Me” in 1963. \[singing\] Then in
    1966, came his groundbreaking musical, “Cabaret,” based on
    Christopher Isherwood’s “Berlin Stories,” and with a score by John
    Kander and Fred Ebb. \[singing\] “I’ve always thought the two years
    in Uncle Sam’s army provided a deductible. I used to hang out in
    Stuttgart in a cheesy, bombed-out church cellar where there was an
    M.C. — you can see what’s coming — and three bovine chorus women.
    And I just loved it. I sat at the bar for hours and hours and this
    little guy, painted with lipstick and false eyelashes, who was about
    as funny as the entertainer, but tragic and wonderful. And I came
    back with him all those years later and I said, we should create a
    role for the M.C.. He is the entertainer, but we should make him
    metaphorical. He should represent Berlin and the depths of the
    Depression — eager to please, hopeless, bad taste, energetic. And as
    the evening goes on, he should turn into the Nazis. So that by the
    time the evening is over, he’s pulled Germany out, but he’s
    consummate evil.” \[singing\] “Cabaret” was a revelation. It moved
    the musical away from straightforward storytelling and into a
    fragmented narrative form, one that would influence much that came
    after it, including such landmark musicals as “A Chorus Line” in
    Chicago. “You have to express yourself, not the status quo, by being
    more daring, by really expressing who you are, and by making the
    musicals what you think musicals should be.” “Cabaret” established
    Prince as a director. And then he reunited with Sondheim and they
    created show after show. “Company,” with its non-linear libretto
    about a man of 35 afraid to commit to a relationship. “Follies,”
    about a reunion of chorus girls in a ruined theater 30 years after
    their youthful success. “A Little Night Music,” based on a movie by
    Ingmar Bergman. And “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet
    Street.” \[singing\] “Directing, I had to hopefully find something
    of myself. It was a lot easier when you’re working with Steve
    Sondheim, let me tell you, because he was of the same mind. And he
    was courageous as hell.” More hits came in the late 1970s and the
    1980s. Prince and Andrew Lloyd Webber teamed up to make “Evita” and
    “Phantom of the Opera.” “He said, I’m thinking of a musical idea.
    Do you think there’s anything in ‘Phantom of the Opera?’ And I said,
    I’ll do it. And he said, why do you want to do it so much? I said,
    because it’s romantic. Let’s do a Victorian romance, larger than
    life. Let’s take the theater and turn it into another world, and
    have the audience come in from the street and just enter that world,
    like so many children. Put a mantel of romance over them.”
    \[singing\] “The very thing that brought me into the theater in the
    first place: escape.” \[singing\] Prince’s own imagination continued
    to challenge theatergoers. “I’m trying desperately not to be the old
    director who tells anecdotes to the company, instead of directs the
    play. I live for the next musical. I live in the future. I’m totally
    mindful that nobody will ever have the life I’ve had in the theater.
    That’s past. And that’s damn
sad.”
