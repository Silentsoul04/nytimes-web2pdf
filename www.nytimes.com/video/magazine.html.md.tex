  ``Promises made. Promises kept.'' This is the night Fox crossed the
  line between where the network ends and President Trump begins. And
  I'm going to tell you how we got here. ``America, you have the power.
  Tomorrow, you can shock the world again.'' ``Hello everyone. We are
  out here live on Facebook at President Trump's rally in Cape
  Girardeau.'' This is not just any rally. It's the night before a
  historic midterm election. Control of Congress, the future of Trump's
  presidency, it's all on the line. Missouri is a key battleground. And
  team Trump is pulling out all the stops to fire up the base. This is
  the birthplace, the hometown of Rush Limbaugh. There's no more sacred
  ground in conservative media. ``What an honor. This is so exciting! I
  have been watching Trump rallies'' --- Lo and behold, word goes out,
  Sean Hannity will be among the presenters. Well, that would be
  astonishing. Mind you, this is the top person in all of cable news ---
  Fox News's PR department, their phones are ringing off the hook. Sean
  Hannity is supposed to be like an opinion columnist. Fox allows him to
  take great liberty, but he still has to, at least, abide by some
  measure of news standards. Talent for a news organization should not
  be openly campaigning with a candidate. It erases any line between the
  news organization and the campaign. Hannity completely denies it,
  tweets out: ``I will not be on stage campaigning with the president.''
  He says he's just covering the final rally for his show. ``Sean
  Hannity, come on up, Sean Hannity.'' That one small step for Sean
  Hannity would be a giant step for the network that pledged to make the
  news ``fair and balanced.'' So, how did we get to this moment? It all
  started with an Australian media mogul who wanted to take on the
  world. Rupert Murdoch, from the minute he steps ashore in the United
  States in the '70s, is all about upending the elitist news
  environment. He wants to blow up the entire media system here. ``With
  a publishing empire in New York alone, that includes The Post, New
  York Magazine, Village Voice.'' Murdoch's expanding his empire in the
  United States just as a new right-wing radio star enters the scene.
  ``Rush Limbaugh, talent on loan from God.'' Rush Limbaugh is a
  national hit --- he is huge. ``That's more like it!'' Limbaugh is a
  game changer for the conservative base. But what Limbaugh doesn't have
  is the gravitas of a news operation. Murdoch sees a big opportunity
  and he finds the perfect accomplice. ``I'm here with Roger Ailes, who
  has been called the Ernest Hemingway of campaign advisers.'' Roger
  Ailes was in the Nixon White House. He knows Watergate happens because
  The Washington Post, this beacon of credibility, this mainstream news
  organization, takes down a president. Ailes and Murdoch want that kind
  of power. They start in 1996. The two men make their pitch to the
  base. ``So, what will our Fox News be? It will be different and it
  will be fair, because it has to be. Because a very large audience is
  begging it to be.'' ``On the record. Fair and balanced.'' There was a
  brilliance to it. We are fair and balanced because the others aren't.
  This makes us different. It's a bullhorn, not a dog whistle, to those
  people who have felt left out by the news conversation. This is for
  me. For a long time, they're struggling to get any notice. And then,
  they get a gift: the Monica Lewinsky scandal. It's a salacious story
  tailor-made for Fox. ``Get ready with your clicker to turn your volume
  up.'' It gripped the base and starts to solidify their audience. ``The
  president's on trial. Our team will keep you informed.'' And
  everything flows from there. ``On the ground in Lower Manhattan.''
  ``Strike happened shortly after dark.'' They established their news
  division. ``Are American policies too strict or not strict enough?''
  And that news division gave heft to their commentariat. --- ``Since
  the April deadly shooting'' ``They're gonna go after the guns.''
  ``Yes.'' Ailes also newsified his commentators. ``Those who want
  reparations for slavery are misguided.'' ``Should people who illegally
  sneak into this country be given a free ride?'' Sean Hannity, he's not
  just in a studio in a Lacoste shirt talking to a microphone. It's a
  news desk. It has flashing headlines. It's got all the accoutrements
  of news. ``We can get you to jump in and listen to Hillary.'' For many
  years, it was fair and balanced. ``So, let me go back to the single
  mother issue here.'' Hannity would square off against a liberal named
  Alan Colmes. ``They hate the nuclear family.'' ``Liberals hate the
  nuclear family?'' ``Let him, let her finish her point.'' ``Yeah, would
  you stop interrupting? I'm trying to make a point here.'' ``I lost my
  head.'' But let's face it, he got his butt kicked on almost every
  debate. It was fair and balanced on the surface. But there was a lot
  more at play underneath it that tilted the scales to the right. It's
  the secret of their success. ``This is a Fox News alert.'' We're a
  news organization like anybody else. And we're going to tell you those
  other news organizations are wrong. They're lying to you. ``These
  people are not journalists. These are not news channels. What you just
  saw is nothing but left-wing propaganda.'' ``This was a retweet'' ---
  ``All right, whatever it is.'' ``And it came from sources'' --- ``I
  told you whatever it is, you shouldn't tweet, ever!'' One thing you
  have to do if you want to run for president as a Republican, it is
  believed you must visit Rupert Murdoch at the Fox headquarters in
  Midtown Manhattan. You have to inform him of your plans. So, Trump
  informs Rupert that he is running for president. And Rupert is eating
  soup. And as we hear this story, he doesn't even look up from his
  soup. Rupert is not ready to buy into the idea of a Trump presidential
  run, let alone, a Trump presidency. Ailes has the same reaction. And
  the sentiment comes through loud and clear. Trump's getting pounded on
  Fox. ``Loser?'' ``Loser is Trump, who seems to think this campaign is
  about him.'' ``It is simply bad anti-terror policy to overreact and
  prohibit Muslims, even if you could, which you can't!'' ``I find him
  offensive.'' ``I don't think you're a first-time offender making a
  personal crack at a woman.'' ``I just think that belief in Trump is
  misplaced.'' It would drive Trump crazy. And he would call Ailes and
  yell and it gets to the point where Trump's own staff has to try to
  keep him away from the television. And then there's the bitter proxy
  war with Megyn Kelly. It begins on the national debate stage. ``You've
  called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs.'' Trump is furious. ``You
  know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood
  coming out of her, wherever.'' ``This afternoon, Fox chief Roger Ailes
  demanding Trump apologize for his latest Twitter tirade against host
  Megyn Kelly.'' What it settles into is this really interesting power
  struggle, because Ailes doesn't take orders from candidates. ``Before
  we get to the issues, let's address the elephant not in the room
  tonight.'' Trump doesn't take orders from anybody. ``Donald Trump has
  chosen not to attend this evening's presidential debate.'' They both
  need each other. Trump needs the Fox audience. Fox needs Trump's
  ratings. So, there's just this battle for control of effectively,
  really the party. ``Donald Trump is the front-runner.'' Thirty seven
  percent to Kasich's 34.'' ``Trump is leading in Idaho.'' ``All my
  money on Trump.'' Fox might have been hard on Trump, but it didn't
  matter. The base loves him. It's looking like Trump's probably on his
  way to becoming the Republican nominee. ``We rarely see black chips
  here at this table.'' Trump isn't a Murdoch kind of guy in terms of
  temperament, in terms of policy. But Murdoch and Ailes have to make a
  choice: Get behind Trump or risk losing their base and their ratings.
  ``This is the great wall of Trump, I guess? I don't know.'' In March
  2016, Murdoch sends a signal: He's ready to get behind Trump. He
  tweets out the Republican Party would be quote, mad not to unify. Over
  the course of several weeks, you see the different parts of the
  Murdoch empire get behind Trump. ``So, big news today is Donald Trump
  has agreed to sit down with yours truly.'' The big moment comes when
  Megyn Kelly goes to Trump Tower to make peace. Trump visits Ailes for
  lunch at the Fox headquarters and that's another breaking of the bread
  --- the truce is complete. ``Roger Ailes, the architect of the Fox
  News Network'' --- But a few months later, literally as Trump's
  cinching the nomination, Ailes is ousted over sexual harassment
  allegations. ``Rupert Murdoch, who hired Ailes'' --- Murdoch takes the
  helm. He's back in the newsroom. He's part of the action. It's just a
  wild, fun ride. Through most of the summer, everyone, including Trump,
  still thinks that Clinton's probably going to win. Rupert Murdoch and
  Rupert Murdoch's sons, James and Lachlan, all believe the true future
  of the network is with a Megyn Kelly. Someone who can be Trump
  critical --- ``Mr. Trump is off base'' --- and can appeal to sort of
  moderate centrist, suburban Republican women and ideally, some
  independents. They need to grow. ``Hillary Clinton has called Donald
  Trump to concede the race.'' Trump winning starts to change this
  calculus dramatically. And we start to see a shift in Fox's primetime
  lineup. ``Donald Trump's son'' --- Greta Van Susteren? Gone. ``He's
  right here to go on the record.'' ``I have decided to pursue a new
  challenge.'' Megyn Kelly, she lands a big job at NBC. Gone. Bill
  O'Reilly's also forced out over sexual harassment allegations.
  Suddenly, their primetime is far more pro-Trump than it ever was under
  Ailes. The new faces? The hard-right commentator Tucker Carlson.
  ``Admit the world's poor they tell us, even if it makes our own
  country poorer, and dirtier and more divided.'' And the conservative
  radio star Laura Ingraham. ``A conservative Republican like Donald
  Trump to remind us what it was all about, freedom.'' ``What the
  mainstream media will never tell you.'' Anchoring it all is Sean
  Hannity. Ailes used to tell me that Hannity's show was segmented, that
  its appeal was limited to a shrinking hardcore base. But it turned out
  this wrong. ``That I would be the bridge between two generations of
  the Fox News channel. This is the next generation.'' Trump is ratings
  gold. His rise to power turned Hannity into Fox's biggest star. And
  the affection was mutual. ``One of the reasons I'm supporting Donald
  Trump this year is number one, he's going to'' --- Weeks after Ailes
  was forced out, Hannity actually appeared in a video for the Trump
  campaign. There was a stern reprimand from Fox, but it was an early
  sign that times were changing. With a freewheeling Murdoch now running
  the show and Trump in the White House, ``fair and balanced'' gets lost
  in the ratings chase. The network actually drops the slogan eventually
  --- there's virtually no limit on how far Hannity can go. ``As I have
  been warning, Mueller is out to get the President, and it appears at
  any cost. Here's what happened.'' Fox and Trump are now both vying for
  the base's affection, but the base overwhelmingly only wants Trump and
  Trump cheerleading. ``We've been talking about for about a week now,
  blanketed in red, white and blue'' --- The feedback loop is just
  amazing. It becomes an echo chamber. If you ever see daylight between
  them, it's because one of them isn't properly giving the base what it
  wants to see. ``Do not fall for it, Mr. President.'' ``We're already
  on the right track, Mr. President.'' ``Mr. President, I understand the
  pressure that you are under from every side. But the wall at our
  southern border is a promise that you made, ran on, got elected on and
  must keep.'' ``From Cape Girardeau, Mo., it is our election eve
  edition.'' Which brings us back to the rally in Missouri, on the eve
  of the midterms. Remember, Hannity claimed he would just be covering
  the rally for his show. ``Let me describe the scene here if I can for
  everybody. They're, like, firing out hats and T-shirts. I mean, this
  is, literally, like a rock concert.'' To Fox News it should be a
  political event. It's not a rock concert. ``There never has been
  anybody like him. I was speaking to Sean Hannity backstage. Do we love
  Sean, by the way?'' But the problem is, Sean Hannity is in the band
  and he's about to go up there and play lead guitar. Here we go ---
  being on stage is just a whole other level of involvement. It's
  breaking down that last little bit of independence that Fox says it
  expects from even its opinion hosts. ``By the way, all those people in
  the back are fake news.'' It has always been part of Fox's m.o. to
  attack the rest of the media as biased. But doing it from a stage with
  the press in the building, including his own Fox colleagues --- he's
  pointing at them, among others, saying ``fake news.'' That was a big
  deal. This moment is a joint play to the base. Now, they're the real
  leader of the party. ``So, anyway. You're right. U.S.A.'' After much
  uproar, Fox says they don't condone anyone taking the stage. So, they
  don't name the people who took the stage and that's all. The tepid
  response is a reflection of where Fox stands right now. It still has
  real news and real journalists. So, they need to signal they're not
  officially approving what Hannity did, but they will only go so far.
  The opinion hosts are still the ones plugging into the Trump base,
  drawing the ratings and leading the attack against the so-called fake
  news. ``By the way their ratings dropped through the floor last
  night'' --- With a new Murdoch taking the reins at Fox News, there's
  speculation this dynamic might change. But today, Trump and the
  network are as friendly as ever. ``And our friends, Tucker, Sean,
  Laura --- through the roof last night.'' With 2020 coming into view,
  and both Trump and Fox working to feed the base, how much closer can
  they get?
