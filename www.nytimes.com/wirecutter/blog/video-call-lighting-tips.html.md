Now that the world’s primary method of communication is the clunky,
awkward video call, people’s horrid at-home selves are being revealed.
Nobody wants to come across to their co-workers and friends as a dimly
lit basement troll. The only thing that can save you is good lighting.  

As a professional video producer, I can tell you that finding good
lighting isn’t always easy. It’s the reason the task of production
usually involves giant lights, accessories, and teams of people to set
everything up. For the folks at home, there are some easy adjustments
you can make that will shine a light (literally) on your beautiful face
and make your next video call just a bit more radiant. Watch our video
above to learn about lighting. You’ll learn how to make natural light
work for you, and how to tweak your lamp light for a more photogenic
look.
