  Forty-eight years after he first ran for the Senate and 33 years since
  his first presidential bid, Joe Biden is the Democratic Party's
  nominee.
\item
  Mr. Biden pledged to bridge the country's divisions in ways President
  Trump had not. ``I will draw on the best of us, not the worst,'' he
  said.
\item
  His speech was an emphatic closing argument in a four-day convention.
  Now begins a general-election challenge that the party has cast as a
  rescue mission.
