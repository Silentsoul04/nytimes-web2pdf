Mrs. Rosetta Tharpe Morrison, who as Sister Rosetta Tharpe was one of
the first gospel singers to gain wide recognition outside the Negro
churches of the Deep South, died yesterday in Temple University Hospital
in Philadelphia, where she made her home. She was 57 years old.

Sister Rosetta Tharpe was born in Cotton Plant, Ark. Both her parents
were active preachers in Pentecostal churches and after she learned both
guitar and singing from her mother they were often on tour together.

Her performances developed a following in more secular circles. In 1938
she made her first recording for Decca. After a brief stint with Cab
Calloway as singer and guitarist, she joined band leader Lucky Millinder
in 1941 to perform at the Savoy Ballroom. An interviewer noted that she
was criticized by some Harlem ministers for putting too much motion as
well as emotion into her singing. She denied this.

In later years she continued to appear before religious groups and also
in nightclubs, including Cafe Society Downtown. In 1959 she was a
leading performer in a folk‐song concert at Town Hall, and had also
appeared at the Newport Folk Festival and in performances at Alice Tully
Hall.

Sister Tharpe suffered a stroke three years ago that necessitated
amputation of a leg, but she continued to do some performing, She had
been scheduled to make her first, recording since her illness this week,
when she was hospitalized.

Her husband, Russell Morrison, survives.

The funeral service will be held in the Bright Hope Baptist Church in
Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.
