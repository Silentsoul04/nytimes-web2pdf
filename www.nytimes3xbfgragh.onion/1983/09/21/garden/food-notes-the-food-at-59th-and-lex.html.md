The food halls at Bloomingdale's have taken a new name and a new look;
they are sleeker, more organized and better stocked. The store has
introduced 240 private-label products under the name Le Gourmet, which
have been put on the shelves just in time for the store's salute to
France.

If you like croissants try the ones made of dough imported from Dalloyau
P^atisserie in Paris. Golden brown, with a flaky crust and a buttery,
yeasty interior, they are excellent - and expensive, at $1.25 each.
Richer and equally as good are the almond croissants with almond paste
inside and toasted sliced almonds on top at $1.50 apiece. The raisin
swirls, called pain de raisin ($2), are made with croissant dough but
shaped like Danish pastries. They are generously studded with golden
raisins soaked in rum.

Several desserts from Dalloyau are also being flown in once a week.
Those that appear to have survived the journey admirably are the Cassis,
with its intense cassis-flavored mousse surrounding almond genoise and a
tart of fresh black currants, at $3.50; the Opera, a bar of thin, moist
layers of almond genoise, chocolate ganache and unctuous mocha butter
cream topped with dark chocolate, at $3.50, and the Brasilia, a soft
almond macaroon with mocha butter cream, topped with toasted almonds and
powdered sugar, at $3.50 Unfortunately the famous breads from the
Poilane bakery in Paris were not available for tasting.

Bloomingdale's is also selling the only imported butter I have tasted
that was worth the price - $3.50 for half a pound. Produced by Echire,
it comes from Charente and has a delicate nutlike flavor. It is
delicious with anything in which the butter flavor is important - a
slice of toast, steamed vegetables, broiled fish.

The cherry jam sold under the Gourmet label is quite special. It is a
study in delightful contrasts - the tartness of the cherries mingling
with the sweetness of the jam. Don't let the cherry pits deter you from
enjoying a 17 1/2-ounce jar at $7.50. A Seasonal Delight

Here is a recipe that shows off the little purple plums that are the
current best buy to their best advantage. Purple Plum Torte 1 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened 1 cup flour 1 teaspoon baking powder Salt to
taste 2 eggs 12 purple plums, halved and pitted 1 tablespoon sugar, more
or less depending on tartness of fruit 2 teaspoons lemon juice, more or

1.\* Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

2.\* Cream sugar and butter until light in color.

3.\* Sift flour with baking powder and salt to taste. Add with eggs to
sugar-butter mixture.

4.\* Spoon mixture into 9-inch springform pan. Cover top of batter with
plum halves, skin side up. Sprinkle with sugar and lemon juice, adusting
to tartness of fruit. Sprinkle with cinnamon.

5.\* Bake for 1 hour.

Yield: 8 servings.

NOTE: This is best served warm; it can be frozen and reheated.
Manufacturers' Claims

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Among the claims that food manufacturers often use for their products
are the following (where applicable,the Federal agency that regulates
use of the terms is mentioned). Low calorie. The Food and Drug
Administration regulates the use of this claim so that a product
carrying it cannot contain more than 40 calories a serving. Reduced
calorie. For a product to carry this description the F.D.A. requires
that it have at least a third fewer calories than a similar product that
does not claim a reduction in calories. Provides extra food energy.
Energy comes from calories; a food with ''extra energy'' is one high in
calories. This phrase is unregulated by the Government. Light. No
regulations govern the use of this term. Sometimes foods that are
described as light have as many calories as or more than similar
products without the description. Natural. ''Natural'' may mean that a
product is free of additives and/or preservatives - or it may not. To
make certain read the ingredient statement. This term is unregulated by
the Government.

Dining Out on Good Diets

Interest in smaller portions and in low-calorie and low-sodium food has
spread from supermarkets and home kitchens to restaurants.

According to a nationwide Gallup poll, conducted by telephone with 1,021
adults earlier this year, the number of diners who would order such
meals if they were offered has increased significantly. Of particular
interest are low-sodium meals, with 55 percent of those surveyed either
''very likely'' or ''fairly likely'' to order a low-sodium entree. In
1982, 47 percent expressed interest in low- sodium meals.

The interest is highest among those over 65 years old (a 50 percent
positive response), but more than a third of those surveyed in other age
groups were likely to order them.

Not surprisingly, the desire for smaller portions and low-calorie meals
is greater among women than men: 23 percent of the men said they would
order a small portion, compared with 44 percent of the women; 18 percent
of the men and 42 percent of the women said they would order low-calorie
meals if they were offered. FOODNOTES BOX - C7 BUY OF THE WEEK PURPLE
