Hollis Frampton, an influential avant-garde film maker and photographer,
died Friday after a brief illness.

He was 48 years old.

A professor at the State University of Buffalo Center for Media Study
since 1973, Mr. Frampton never received a high school or college
diploma.

His films were shown in retrospectives around the world, and he produced
more than 60 films in his career.

Mr. Frampton, a native of Wooster, Ohio, began his career as a film
maker in 1962, and he taught film and design at Hunter College from 1969
to 1973. His writings have appeared in several magazines, and his essays
were collected last year and published in the book ''Circles of
Confusion.''
