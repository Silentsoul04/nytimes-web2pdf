About the Archive

This is a digitized version of an article from The Times's print
archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve
these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter,
edit or update them.

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or
other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived
versions.

The one dimly interesting thing about ''Bill and Ted's Excellent
Adventure'' is the way the two teen-age heroes communicate in
superlatives. ''We are about to fail most egregiously,'' says Ted to
Bill, or maybe it's Bill to Ted. They are also fond of odd words, such
as bodacious.

Other than that, they are inconsistent ciphers. They know how to
pronounce egregious but when, in their time-travel adventures, they meet
Socrates, they call him ''Sock-rates.'' Freud comes out ''Frood.''
''Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,'' which opens today at the
Criterion Center and the Plaza, is meant to be funny, but it only swells
the sinus passages. It is a painfully inept comedy about two high-school
pals who, via a magic telephone booth, are able to bounce in and out of
great moments of history, to hobnob, in passing, with Napoleon, Joan of
Arc and Abraham Lincoln, among others.

The film was directed by Stephen Herek, who made his theatrical film
debut with ''Critters.'' Keanu Reeves, who plays Ted, and Alex Winter
(Bill) give it the old school try. The screenplay is by Chris Matheson
and Ed Solomon. It is their first.

''Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure'' has been rated PG (''Parental
Guidance Suggested''). It includes some mildly vulgar language. Meeting
Frood And Sock-rates BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, directed by
Stephen Herek; written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon; director of
photography, Timothy Suhrstedt; edited by Larry Bock and Patrick Rand;
music by David Newman; production designer, Roy Forge Smith; produced by
Scott Kroopf, Michael S. Murphey and Joel Soisson; released by Orion
Pictures. At the Criterion Center, Broadway and 45th Street, and the
Plaza, 58th Street east of Madison Avenue. Running time: 90 minutes.
This film is rated PG. Ted (Theodore) Logan ... Keanu Reeves Bill S.
Preston ... Alex Winter Rufus ... George Carlin
