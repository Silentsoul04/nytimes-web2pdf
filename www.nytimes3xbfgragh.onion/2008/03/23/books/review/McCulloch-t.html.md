**THE LABRADOR PACT, by Matt Haig. (Viking, $23.95.)** In “Henry IV,
Part 1,” Falstaff much prefers survival (and a good breakfast) to honor
and duty: “What is that word honor? ... Who hath it? He that died o’
Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No.” The demands of virtue are also a
problem for Prince, the canine narrator of Haig’s curiously affecting
take on “Henry,” which tells the story of a loyal Labrador’s efforts to
hold his human family together. If only he follows the pact of his
breed, Prince tells himself, he can save these people from themselves —
from “all their lies and tensions and betrayals and injustices.” His
friend Falstaff, a chubby mixed-breed he meets in the park, begs to
differ. “Duty schmooty,” he bays (or however fictional dogs utter their
dialogue) when faced with Prince’s insistence on “duty over all.” Dark,
comic and quite brilliantly adult, Haig’s thinking animals never stray
into the sickly sweet zone. As the duplicities mount (among both
species), Prince’s Labrador dogma proves inadequate to the task:
“Whereas dogs can learn to suppress their instincts,” he realizes,
“for humans there is no hope.”

**THE DIVING POOL: Three Novellas, by Yoko Ogawa. (Picador, paper,
$13.)** Still waters run dark in these bright yet eerie novellas, whose
crisp, almost guileless prose hides unexpected menace. In the title
story, Aya, a high school student, is obsessed with the graceful body of
a young diving enthusiast and the suffering of a child on whom she
unleashes a strangely calm cruelty: “I wanted to savor every one of
Rie’s tears, to run my tongue over the damp, festering, vulnerable
places in her heart and open the wounds even wider.” Another novella is
the perplexing account of two sisters, one apparently keeping a record
of the other’s pregnancy. At first, the mother-to-be seems the more
troubled, with her bizarre cravings and visits to a psychiatrist. Then
again, perhaps it’s the diarist we should be keeping an eye on. In the
final novella, a lonely woman helps settle her young cousin into her old
college residence, which has fallen into disrepair since the unexplained
disappearance of a student. This nameless narrator can’t stay away from
the dorm or its spooky manager, who is missing a leg and both arms and
says he is dying. She begins visiting every day, only belatedly
wondering why her cousin never seems to be around. Stephen Snyder’s
elegant translations from the Japanese whet the appetite for
more.

**DERVISHES, by Beth Helms. (Picador, paper, $14.)** Secrets and lies
swirl around the characters in this first novel like the heat and dust
of 1970s Ankara, which Helms evokes so well. Grace and her 12-year-old
daughter, Canada, are part of the embassy set, adrift in a country with
which they never really connect. This sense of dislocation seems to have
its roots in the mysterious work of Grace’s husband, who is frequently
called away on clandestine missions to unknown destinations. The novel
opens with just such a summons, but this is one from which Canada’s
father will not return. Helms then rewinds to recount the period leading
up to that late-night phone call. For mother and daughter, it’s a time
of unraveling: Grace makes bad judgment calls and has an affair with
Canada’s riding instructor, while her daughter, who is both a corrupting
and a corruptible child, tries to raise herself. As Helms deftly maps
the damage these two have wrought on themselves and those around them,
Canada wonders how they will cope: “How would we live outside the close
and sheltering world we’d always bucked against, but always known? We
would be suddenly, in all ways, unmoored, ill equipped, stark naked.”

**THE SHADOW YEAR, by Jeffrey Ford. (Morrow/HarperCollins, $25.95.)**
Ford travels deep into the wild country that is childhood in this novel
— part mystery, part fantasy — about a struggling family on Long
Island in the 1960s. The story’s “strange changeling year” begins in the
last days of August as a prowler is reported outside a neighbor’s
window. The unnamed narrator, a sixth grader, and his brother, Jim,
decide to investigate, enlisting the mysterious powers of their quirky
sister, Mary, who tells them what’s going to happen by moving the pieces
on a model of the neighborhood they keep in the cellar. Jim has built
this miniature world, Botch Town, out of “buttons, Dixie cups, ice cream
sticks, bottles and assorted other discarded items” on a table their
father set up for electric trains — a project nixed by “the money
troubles.” Ford’s attention is always on the kids, keeping their
alcoholic mother and workaholic father largely at a distance. But the
observations and adventures of these sharp, wayward children provide
more than enough depth to be satisfying. And, of course, there’s the
whodunit: What happened to young Charlie Edison? Who is the prowler? And
do the answers to these questions involve the man who cruises the
streets in a large white car?

**THE EXECUTOR: A Comedy of Letters, by Michael Krüger. (Harcourt,
$23.)** Rudolf, a famous, curmudgeonly German writer living in Italy,
has committed suicide, leaving his longtime friend, the narrator of this
taut little novel, to sort out Rudolf’s literary legacy and unlock the
secret of his last, great masterwork, a novel “meant to transform the
genre itself.” What a perfect setup for an author with the authority of
Michael Krüger (poet, novelist, editor and longtime head of a major
German publishing house) to ponder writers and writing. This he does
through the dead man, who, as remembered by the narrator, had almost
nothing good to say about his art or its practitioners: “On the subject
of contemporary literature he was excoriating, disparaging it as
‘middle-class prose’ ”; “for him, imagination was a petit-bourgeois
fad”; “nothing was more repugnant to him than a gathering of authors.”
Along the way, Krüger scatters names like bread crumbs — Pavese, Valéry,
Lucentini, Proust, Kierkegaard, Levi and many more — adding to the
rather bombastic tone of the book, translated by John Hargraves. The
mystery of the masterwork is provocative, but Rudolf is no Céline —
there’s not enough genius to make his misanthropy (and misogyny, for
that matter) worth caring about.
