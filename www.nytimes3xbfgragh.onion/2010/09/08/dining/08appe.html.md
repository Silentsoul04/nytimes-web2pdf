FOR years, our family recipe for plum cake was so inextricably linked to
Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, that I could not even fathom the idea
of one without the other.

We weren’t alone. Back in the ’80s, this [recipe for a soft, airy,
buttery torte topped with plums and perfumed with cinnamon
sugar](http://events.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/3783/1991/09/04/Original-Plum-Torte/recipe.html?scp=1&sq=marian%20burros%20and%20plum%20cake&st=cse)
— made popular by Marian Burros in The New York Times — made the rounds
among New York Jews of my parents’ generation. It became a nearly
ubiquitous addition to the holiday table, as important as the apples and
honey and just as sweet.

It never occurred to me to make any other kind of plum cake. And it
might never have, had I not fallen in love with a certain [sour-cherry
cake
recipe](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Hungarian-Sour-Cherry-Cake)
I stumbled upon this summer.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was everything the plum cake was not. Sturdy and dense, it had a
coarse crumb and deep, nutty flavor from whole-wheat flour. The cherries
melted into the cake, leaving chewy, scarlet craters. It, too, was
delightful, but in a rustic
way.

I made the cake a few times, tweaking it to try to lighten the texture
slightly without compromising its whole-wheat nuttiness. When
sour-cherry season was done, I still was not.

I had a few more variations to try out, including reducing the
granulated sugar in the batter so I could sprinkle the surface with
crunchy Demerara sugar. I imagined the cake would seem almost like a
crumble with a bumpy topping covering jamlike fruit.

So, I made the cake with other fruit: blueberries, peaches and
raspberries. All were nice, but none were as compelling as the cherries,
which had just the right degree of tartness to balance the sugar while
their brightness mitigated the earthy whole-wheat flour.

I searched my brain for a better substitute and came up with plums. They
can be almost as tangy as sour cherries, and profoundly spicy, too. If I
could perfect the recipe, I could surprise my family with something new
for the holiday.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I set to work, buying an assortment of jewel-toned fruit and adding them
to a less-sweet batter in which I increased the egg. Then I dusted the
top with Demerara. The cake was just where I wanted it, with juicy,
almost candied plums nestled into a hearty, rich-tasting crumb with a
slightly more refined texture. It will certainly grace the family table
this Rosh Hashana. And because of its salubrious whole-wheat flour
quotient, I’ll be ushering in a happy and even healthier New Year.
