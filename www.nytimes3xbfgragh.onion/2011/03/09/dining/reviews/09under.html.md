MOST garlic knots let you down. After one or two salty, satisfying
bites, you’re left to chew on the increasingly impenetrable thing like a
masticating cow. It’s a snack food for suckers and optimists, anybody
with a Charlie Brown-like faith that maybe Lucy Van Pelt won’t pull away
the football, that this time it might be great.

The garlic knots ($3 for six) at [Best
Pizza](http://best.piz.za.com/ "Best Pizza") in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
deliver on that hope. Baked in a century-old brick oven, they arrive
charred on top and creamy inside, more gougère than repurposed crust.
There are no tricks, just good technique: dough that rises all day; a
drizzle of garlic oil after the knots come out of the oven; a dusting of
shaved pecorino; chopped parsley, because that’s what you do. The knots
are served on a flimsy paper plate with pickled vegetables (fennel,
mostly) because Best Pizza is a slice joint, where $3 will feed you, and
$15 will pay for a feast.

A team venture between Brooklyn Star and Roberta’s (it’s in the old
Brooklyn Star space), the restaurant (and its wood-burning oven) have
been entrusted to Frank Pinello, a 28-year-old from Bensonhurst. He is a
Culinary Institute of America graduate who prefers “pizza man” to
“pizzaiolo.”

Mr. Pinello has made pizza at Pulino’s Bar & Pizzeria and at a slice
joint in Poughkeepsie. He brings some of both to Best Pizza.

Slices start at $3, toppings at 25 cents (at $1, the most expensive is
[pepperoni from Salumeria
Biellese](http://www.salumeriabiellese.com/ "pepperoni from Salumeria Biellese")),
and $3.50 gets a piece of white pie made with impeccable ingredients:
mozzarella made in-house, fresh ricotta, pecorino, caramelized onions
and a sprinkle of sesame seeds on the crust that Mr. Pinello said is a
tribute to his Sicilian heritage.

A 20-inch white pie ($21) has a crust that can handle being boxed up and
delivered. It’s not a bad option: Best Pizza can feel hectic at night
when the kitchen is busy. During the day, it’s more pleasant, especially
when sunlight fills the eating area and locals who remember when John
Lindsay switched parties stand at the counter and make conversation.

The menu is scribbled on white paper plates tacked to the wall; sodas
($1.50) are self-serve from a deli fridge. Budweiser draft ($4 a pint,
$13 a pitcher) is sold on the honor system — the tap is out in the
dining area, under a piece of masking tape that says, “NO WEEEEZING THE
JUICE.”

There is no sense of salesmanship. You have to scan to find the paper
plates that list the chicken parm ($9) and meatball sub ($9).

These days, the meatball sub has the bigger following. A [Pat
LaFrieda](http://lafrieda.com/ "Pat LaFrieda") blend of short rib and
brisket mixed with garlic, bread crumbs, pecorino and ricotta, the
meatballs are blasted in the oven. Served on a singed bâtard from the
wood-burning oven at Roberta’s with marinara and aged provolone, it’s a
fine sandwich.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the chicken parm belongs in the same lofty category as the garlic
knots. Brined thigh meat is dredged in flour and fried to order, then
assembled in much the same way as the meatball sub. The difference is
the cheese (the chicken parm gets house-made mozzarella) as well as the
garnish (the meatballs are topped with parsley; the chicken, a single
basil leaf). It’s a sloppier sandwich. Which is what elevates it: the
oil from the chicken soaks into the bread with the sauce so that it
becomes a gooey, crispy, meaty mess held together by the charred crust.

There’s no easy way to eat it. Not that it should stop you.
