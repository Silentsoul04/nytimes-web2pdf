WASHINGTON — Fifty members of the Senate have signed a letter to the
N.F.L. to urge its leadership to press the Washington Redskins to change
the team name in the aftermath of tough sanctions against the owner of
the Los Angeles Clippers for racially charged comments.

The position embraced by half of the Senate, and the willingness of the
lawmakers to sign a formal request to Commissioner Roger Goodell,
escalated the fight over the name and represented an effort to put
increasing pressure on the league, which receives a federal tax break,
and the ownership of the team.

“The N.F.L. can no longer ignore this and perpetuate the use of this
name as anything but what it is: a racial slur,” said the letter, which
was circulated by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and
endorsed by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader.
“We urge the N.F.L. to formally support a name change for the Washington
football team.”

Cantwell said that “we are going to find out if the N.F.L. can act
against this kind of discrimination as quickly as the N.B.A. did.” She
said she considered the Senate letter an important milestone.

“Listen, it is hard to get 50 people in this place to agree on
anything,” she said.

Reid has made the push for the name change a top interest. He said in an
interview that he could not understand the league’s resisting the
senators on the name change given other pressing disputes it was
navigating, including head injuries and the health of former players.

“I have 22 tribal organizations in Nevada,” Reid said. “They are not
mascots. They are human beings. And this term Redskins is offensive to
them.”

## Letter to Roger Goodell

Fifty members of the Senate signed the letter, circulated by Senator
Maria Cantwell and endorsed by Senator Harry Reid, which urged the
league to press the Washington Redskins to change the team name.

All but five Senate Democrats — Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia,
Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Mark Pryor of
Arkansas — signed the letter. It was not circulated among Republicans.

N.F.L. officials said they had not received the letter. But a league
spokesman, Brian McCarthy, provided a statement saying the league “has
long demonstrated a commitment to progressive leadership on issues of
diversity and inclusion, both on and off the field.”

“The intent of the team’s name has always been to present a strong,
positive and respectful image,” the statement said. “The name is not
used by the team or the N.F.L. in any other context, though we respect
those that view it differently.”

The management of the Redskins, owned by Daniel Snyder, has repeatedly
said that the team will not change its name and that it is meant as a
tribute to the courage of Native Americans. The team has also said that
many Native Americans support the name.

The letter from the Senate said, however, that “Indian Country has
spoken clearly on this issue.” It said that organizations representing
more than two million Native Americans and 300 sovereign tribes had
passed resolutions supporting a change in a team name they found to be
racially offensive.

The senators said the quick action the N.B.A. took against Donald
Sterling, the owner of the Clippers, should be an example to the N.F.L.

“We urge you and the National Football League to send the same clear
message as the N.B.A. did: that racism and bigotry have no place in
professional sports,” the letter said.
