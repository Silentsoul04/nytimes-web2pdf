BETTING on professional sports is currently illegal in most of the
United States outside of Nevada. I believe we need a different approach.

For more than two decades, the National Basketball Association has
opposed the expansion of legal sports betting, as have the other major
professional sports leagues in the United States. In 1992, the leagues
supported the passage by Congress of the Professional and Amateur Sports
Protection Act, or Paspa, which generally prohibits states from
authorizing sports betting.

But despite legal restrictions, sports betting is widespread. It is a
thriving underground business that operates free from regulation or
oversight. Because there are few legal options available, those who wish
to bet resort to illicit bookmaking operations and shady offshore
websites. There is no solid data on the volume of illegal sports betting
activity in the United States, but some estimate that nearly $400
billion is illegally wagered on sports each year.

Times have changed since Paspa was enacted. Gambling has increasingly
become a popular and accepted form of entertainment in the United
States. Most states offer lotteries. Over half of them have legal
casinos. Three have approved some form of Internet gambling, with others
poised to follow.

There is an obvious appetite among sports fans for a safe and legal way
to wager on professional sporting events. Mainstream media outlets
regularly publish sports betting lines and point spreads. Voters in New
Jersey overwhelmingly voiced their support for legal sports betting in a
2011 referendum. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey recently signed a
bill [authorizing sports
betting](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/09/09/nyregion/christie-unilaterally-lifts-sports-betting-prohibition.html)
at local casinos and horse racetracks, a law the N.B.A. and other
leagues have opposed — and a federal court has blocked — because it
violates Paspa.

Outside of the United States, sports betting and other forms of gambling
are popular, widely legal and subject to regulation. In England, for
example, a sports bet can be placed on a smartphone, at a stadium kiosk
or even using a television remote control.

In light of these domestic and global trends, the laws on sports betting
should be changed. Congress should adopt a federal framework that allows
states to authorize betting on professional sports, subject to strict
regulatory requirements and technological safeguards.

These requirements would include: mandatory monitoring and reporting of
unusual betting-line movements; a licensing protocol to ensure betting
operators are legitimate; minimum-age verification measures;
geo-blocking technology to ensure betting is available only where it is
legal; mechanisms to identify and exclude people with gambling problems;
and education about responsible gaming.

Without a comprehensive federal solution, state measures such as New
Jersey’s recent initiative will be both unlawful and bad public policy.

Let me be clear: Any new approach must ensure the integrity of the game.
One of my most important responsibilities as commissioner of the N.B.A.
is to protect the integrity of professional basketball and preserve
public confidence in the league and our sport. I oppose any course of
action that would compromise these objectives.

But I believe that sports betting should be brought out of the
underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately
monitored and regulated.
