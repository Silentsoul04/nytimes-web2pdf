Michael Moore, Sotheby's director of events, continually outdoes himself
--- it's in his job description. With a three-person team, Moore
produces more than 350 American events (and some abroad) for Sotheby's
each year, the crowning jewel of which is the ultraexclusive dinner that
precedes the high-profile New York contemporary auction each spring and
fall. This year, Moore faced the task of topping last spring's
contemporary dinner, for which Sotheby's flew in 16 chefs from
\href{http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/11/29/edible-selby-danish-modern/}{Noma},
the Copenhagen restaurant often cited as the best in the world, and
asked them to recreate its dining experience right in Sotheby's New York
flagship on the Upper East Side. (Moore and his team attempted to meet
all of the chefs' requests, no detail too small --- one consequence of
which was a long, thorough search for just the right river rocks for
Noma to serve its langoustines upon.)

For this spring's dinner, which took place on Sunday, the answer lay
closer to home --- just about 30 miles upstate, at
\href{http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/26/at-the-table-dan-barbers-radical-evolution/}{Blue
Hill at Stone Barns}, Dan Barber's hyperliteral take on farm-to-table
dining situated on 80 bucolic, sprawling acres, which just last week won
this year's
\href{http://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/2015-james-beard-award-winners}{James
Beard Award} for Outstanding Restaurant. ``We're not looking for them to
come here in a truck with some waiters and serve their food,'' Moore
explained at Sotheby's last Wednesday, in the final stages of planning
the dinner, surrounded by half-hung paintings by Lichtenstein, Rothko,
Warhol and many more. ``We want to transplant Blue Hill into our gallery
as much as possible. I can rent 60-inch round tables and chairs from
anybody. I don't want that; I want everything to be sourced and
unique.''

That meant suffusing Sotheby's austere, modernist setting with the Blue
Hill at Stone Barns experience in every possible respect --- the
four-course menu; the woodsy table décor; a large set of barn doors
brought down from the farm; even the hand soap and lotion in the
restrooms, which Blue Hill makes in-house. But both the Sotheby's and
Blue Hill teams took care not to include elements that would compete
visually with the masterpieces on the walls: After all, as Moore noted,
``When you're sitting between \$300 million worth of paintings, you
don't need big flowers.'' Instead of tall, colorful floral sprays, the
arrangements were kept close to the table and understated in hue. ``We
were thoughtful to consider that there will be lots of color, so our
color is very earthy and muted,'' Laureen Barber, the chef's
sister-in-law and an owner of Blue Hill, said when T visited the farm
last week.

Also adorning the tables were other farm-fresh touches, including
cast-silver grapevine candelabras, small potted plants, candles made
from hollowed-out goose eggs and ferns planted in small, shapely vases
of
``\href{http://www.stonebarnscenter.org/about-us/blue-hill-at-stone-barns.html}{biochar},''
the restaurant's term for the charcoal pieces it creates from animal
bones and uses to cook meat and vegetables. ``There's this shared
interest in aesthetics --- so obviously, if you're interested in art,
you're interested in food and the way it's presented,'' Laureen said.
``And we spent a lot of energy on, not just the ingredients, clearly,
but also how they're presented.''

Speaking of which: The dinner itself, which was initially conceived for
80 but ended up serving 135 clients, likewise entailed finding harmony
in the juxtapositions between the gallery setting and the farmhouse
vibe. All four courses --- smoked lobster and corned-beef ``farm tacos''
with toothsome ``shells'' created from slices of kohlrabi; ``Barber II
wheat'' brioche with farm cheese and greens marmalade; a parsnip steak
with beet ketchup and creamed spinach; and a rhubarb dessert with milk
custard and ice cream --- as well as the canapés and petits-fours, are
Blue Hill mainstays and were chosen specifically for the Sotheby's
crowd. ``It was sort of cherry-picking some of the dishes that we do
here, or some of the service that we do here, that's a little more
iconoclastic and overturns people's expectations for fine dining,'' chef
Dan Barber said. ``We tried to draw that out a little more for this
event --- because the event is about art that, at one point anyway, did
that; or still does that.''
