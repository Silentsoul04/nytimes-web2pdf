DHAKA, Bangladesh — The police in Bangladesh filed formal murder charges
on Monday against 41 people accused of involvement in the [2013
collapse](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/04/25/world/asia/bangladesh-building-collapse.html)
of a building that housed several clothing factories, leaving more than
1,100 people dead in the worst disaster in garment industry history.

Among those charged were [Sohel
Rana](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/05/01/world/asia/bangladesh-garment-industry-reliant-on-flimsy-oversight.html),
the owner of the building; his parents, the owners of several factories
in the building; and at least a dozen government officials, according to
a state prosecutor, Anwarul Kabir, who is part of the legal team that
will pursue the case.

If convicted, the accused could face the death penalty, said Bijoy
Krishna Kar, the investigating officer who filed the charges on Monday.

The collapse of Rana Plaza led to an international outcry, and to a
commitment by Western retailers to [widespread
inspections](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/09/02/business/global/superficial-visits-and-trickery-undermine-foreign-factory-inspections.html)
of Bangladesh’s thousands of apparel factories.

Mr. Kabir said the investigating officer for the police had also
submitted to a court in Dhaka, the capital, charges against 18 people
for building code violations. Of those 18 people, 17 were among those
charged with murder on Monday, including Mr. Rana and his parents.

A high-level state report released in 2013 found that the building was
constructed with substandard materials in violation of building codes,
and recommended bringing formal charges against the owner, Mr. Rana, as
well as against the owners of five factories in the building.

The report stated that owners of the factories urged employees to return
to work even after an engineer inspected the building the day before the
collapse and deemed it unsafe. The upper stories of the building were
illegally constructed, and heavy generators installed there caused the
building to shake, it said.

“The workers were scared of losing their life or getting injury from the
day before the building collapsed,” said Mr. Kar. “The building and
factory owners and others accused in cool head compelled the scared
workers to join the work.”

Bangladesh has more than 5,000 garment factories, handling orders for
nearly all of the world’s top brands and retailers, and is second in
garment manufacturing output behind China. It has the lowest wages for
garment workers in the world, and the collapse at Rana Plaza drew
attention to unsafe practices in the industry.

The formal charges are a significant step toward the prosecution of
garment factory owners, who often enjoy impunity in the country because
of the economic heft and power of the industry.

But at least one victim did not believe that justice would come
speedily. Mili Khatun, 25, a worker in one of the factories in Rana
Plaza, was caught in the collapse, but locals rescued her from the
rubble. Her husband, a cutting master in the same factory, was killed.

“I wanted punishment of the culprits, I wanted justice. I am not alone,
all the victims wanted the same thing,” said Ms. Khatun. “I have doubts
that the culprits will be punished.”

Taslima Akhter, the coordinator of Bangladesh Garment Workers
Solidarity, a worker’s organization, pointed out that it took the police
two years to file charges.

“Now our concern is we are not sure how long it will take to complete
trial to ensure final justice for the victims of the Rana Plaza
tragedy,” she said.

Mr. Rana was arrested days after the disaster, apparently while hiding
near the Indian border. He was a powerful businessman in the country,
and some landowners in the Savar municipality, where Rana Plaza was
located, said that he bullied them into giving up their land to build
the structure.

A hearing for the case is scheduled for June 28 in a court in Dhaka, Mr.
Kabir said.
