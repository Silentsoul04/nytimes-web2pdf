Mayor [Bill de
Blasio](http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per),
in a sharp shift from his initial objections, is poised to hire nearly
1,300 additional officers for the [New York Police
Department](http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/new_york_city_police_department/index.html?inline=nyt-org),
a surprising addition in a $78.5 billion budget deal announced by city
leaders on Monday night.

Increasing the size of the force had been a top priority of the City
Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, and the notion was endorsed by
Mr. de Blasio’s police commissioner, William J. Bratton. But the move
has been opposed by some advocates for criminal justice reform, and it
is expected to add at least $100 million to the city’s budget.

The mayor, who has pledged to improve police-community relations, has
long been hesitant to hire more officers, saying he felt comfortable
with the city’s near-record-low level of crime. But his administration
has come under intense pressure in recent weeks after a notable
[increase in homicides and
shootings](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/02/nyregion/gunplay-rises-in-new-york-reviving-issue-for-de-blasio.html)
compared with the same period last year.

“There have been long conversations particularly over the last few weeks
on what was the right thing to do,” Mr. de Blasio said on Monday night
at City Hall, with Ms. Mark-Viverito at his side. “We came to a plan
that allows us to strengthen our police force while encouraging a
deepening of reform, while finding key reforms on the fiscal front.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The budget deal, which is expected to be approved by the full Council
this week, represents a roughly 4.7 percent increase from the one
approved last year. On the police issue, aides to the mayor said the
plan included new and hard-fought limits on overtime pay for officers,
to blunt the impact of added wages and benefits. About 300 of the new
officers would form a new counterterrorism team to patrol areas of the
city perceived as high risk, like Times Square.

And in what Mr. de Blasio billed as a “pioneering” step in police
reform, the city is expected to debut a new neighborhood-based policing
model, in which patrol officers would be given about one-third of their
day away from radio calls to develop closer relationships with residents
of their precincts.

Still, some Council members were taken aback on Monday that Mr. de
Blasio went beyond the 1,000 new officers that Ms. Mark-Viverito had
requested. And reform advocates, who had celebrated Mr. de Blasio’s
criticism of aggressive policing, were upset.

“This deal to increase the N.Y.P.D. head count seems like politics at
its worst,” said Monifa Bandele, a leader of the advocacy group
Communities United for Police Reform. “It’s disappointing and perplexing
that the city budget will increase the N.Y.P.D. head count when systemic
problems with police accountability and culture, that allow New Yorkers
to be abused and killed, have yet to be fixed.”

The Police Department currently has about 34,600 uniformed personnel, a
number that will grow by [roughly 890 new
officers](http://www.nypdnews.com/2015/01/new-class-of-891-police-academy.html)
who are to graduate from the Police Academy on July 2. The force was
significantly expanded in the early 1990s, under former Mayor David N.
Dinkins. Since then, it has shrunk amid recessions and a sharp drop in
urban crime.

Mr. Bratton [had allied
himself](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/16/nyregion/city-council-speaker-draws-ire-of-allies-on-police-hiring.html)
with Ms. Mark-Viverito’s request for 1,000 new officers, one of the few
points of open contention between the Council speaker and the mayor, who
are both Democrats. The proposed increase in officers had, in turn, been
an item of apparent discord between Mr. de Blasio and his police
commissioner, whom the mayor has presented as a close partner.

As recently as June 5, Mr. de Blasio told a radio caller that raising
the head count was unnecessary, arguing that officers had already been
freed up because his administration had reduced the number of police
stops and arrests for possessing small amounts of marijuana.

“When you have a force that’s effective in the way the N.Y.P.D. is now
and getting better, I think that’s a reason to stick with what we’re
doing,” the mayor said [during an interview on
WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-summer-sit-down-mayor/).

Another reason, according to some skeptics, is a fiscal one: the
long-term liabilities for the city budget, which would have to add
millions for retirement and pension costs. “The problem is what happens
when they’ve been there awhile and then, really acutely, when they start
to retire,” said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan
Institute, a right-leaning think tank.

“We can only afford to add more cops now because Wall Street is booming
and we’re probably in the throes of another real estate bubble,” Ms.
Gelinas said. “What happens when that goes away?”

The budget deal for the fiscal year beginning in July also included
encouraging news for advocates of the city’s libraries. The city is to
add $39 million in funds to extend library hours and keep many branches
open six days a week. Ms. Mark-Viverito also received funding for one of
her signature initiatives, the creation of a $1.4 million bail fund that
would help low-income defendants accused of low-level crimes.
