Mayor
\href{http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per}{Bill
de Blasio}, in a sharp shift from his initial objections, is poised to
hire nearly 1,300 additional officers for the
\href{http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/new_york_city_police_department/index.html?inline=nyt-org}{New
York Police Department}, a surprising addition in a \$78.5 billion
budget deal announced by city leaders on Monday night.

Increasing the size of the force had been a top priority of the City
Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, and the notion was endorsed by
Mr. de Blasio's police commissioner, William J. Bratton. But the move
has been opposed by some advocates for criminal justice reform, and it
is expected to add at least \$100 million to the city's budget.

The mayor, who has pledged to improve police-community relations, has
long been hesitant to hire more officers, saying he felt comfortable
with the city's near-record-low level of crime. But his administration
has come under intense pressure in recent weeks after a notable
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/02/nyregion/gunplay-rises-in-new-york-reviving-issue-for-de-blasio.html}{increase
in homicides and shootings} compared with the same period last year.

``There have been long conversations particularly over the last few
weeks on what was the right thing to do,'' Mr. de Blasio said on Monday
night at City Hall, with Ms. Mark-Viverito at his side. ``We came to a
plan that allows us to strengthen our police force while encouraging a
deepening of reform, while finding key reforms on the fiscal front.''

The budget deal, which is expected to be approved by the full Council
this week, represents a roughly 4.7 percent increase from the one
approved last year. On the police issue, aides to the mayor said the
plan included new and hard-fought limits on overtime pay for officers,
to blunt the impact of added wages and benefits. About 300 of the new
officers would form a new counterterrorism team to patrol areas of the
city perceived as high risk, like Times Square.

And in what Mr. de Blasio billed as a ``pioneering'' step in police
reform, the city is expected to debut a new neighborhood-based policing
model, in which patrol officers would be given about one-third of their
day away from radio calls to develop closer relationships with residents
of their precincts.

Still, some Council members were taken aback on Monday that Mr. de
Blasio went beyond the 1,000 new officers that Ms. Mark-Viverito had
requested. And reform advocates, who had celebrated Mr. de Blasio's
criticism of aggressive policing, were upset.

``This deal to increase the N.Y.P.D. head count seems like politics at
its worst,'' said Monifa Bandele, a leader of the advocacy group
Communities United for Police Reform. ``It's disappointing and
perplexing that the city budget will increase the N.Y.P.D. head count
when systemic problems with police accountability and culture, that
allow New Yorkers to be abused and killed, have yet to be fixed.''

The Police Department currently has about 34,600 uniformed personnel, a
number that will grow by
\href{http://www.nypdnews.com/2015/01/new-class-of-891-police-academy.html}{roughly
890 new officers} who are to graduate from the Police Academy on July 2.
The force was significantly expanded in the early 1990s, under former
Mayor David N. Dinkins. Since then, it has shrunk amid recessions and a
sharp drop in urban crime.

Mr. Bratton
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/16/nyregion/city-council-speaker-draws-ire-of-allies-on-police-hiring.html}{had
allied himself} with Ms. Mark-Viverito's request for 1,000 new officers,
one of the few points of open contention between the Council speaker and
the mayor, who are both Democrats. The proposed increase in officers
had, in turn, been an item of apparent discord between Mr. de Blasio and
his police commissioner, whom the mayor has presented as a close
partner.

As recently as June 5, Mr. de Blasio told a radio caller that raising
the head count was unnecessary, arguing that officers had already been
freed up because his administration had reduced the number of police
stops and arrests for possessing small amounts of marijuana.

``When you have a force that's effective in the way the N.Y.P.D. is now
and getting better, I think that's a reason to stick with what we're
doing,'' the mayor said
\href{http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-summer-sit-down-mayor/}{during an
interview on WNYC}.

Another reason, according to some skeptics, is a fiscal one: the
long-term liabilities for the city budget, which would have to add
millions for retirement and pension costs. ``The problem is what happens
when they've been there awhile and then, really acutely, when they start
to retire,'' said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan
Institute, a right-leaning think tank.

``We can only afford to add more cops now because Wall Street is booming
and we're probably in the throes of another real estate bubble,'' Ms.
Gelinas said. ``What happens when that goes away?''

The budget deal for the fiscal year beginning in July also included
encouraging news for advocates of the city's libraries. The city is to
add \$39 million in funds to extend library hours and keep many branches
open six days a week. Ms. Mark-Viverito also received funding for one of
her signature initiatives, the creation of a \$1.4 million bail fund
that would help low-income defendants accused of low-level crimes.
