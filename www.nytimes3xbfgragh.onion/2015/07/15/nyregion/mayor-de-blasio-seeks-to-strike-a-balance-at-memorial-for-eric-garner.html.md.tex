Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke slowly on Tuesday night, committed to getting
the words right inside a modest Staten Island church.

To his left was
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/15/nyregion/eric-garners-family-says-settlement-will-not-stall-push-for-police-reform.html}{the
family of Eric Garner}, who died one year ago this week after a police
chokehold on Bay Street, a short walk away. Behind them were New York
City police officers.

``I want to use a phrase that we did not hear as much in all the
discourse,'' the mayor said, ``but we should say it because it's
evident~tonight: All lives matter.''

He continued: ``It should not need to be said, but until we make more
progress we will say it again: Black lives matter.''

There was one more.

``Also we should say,'' the mayor added, in a nod to the Police
Department that has defined his early tenure, ``blue lives matter.''

Less than eight months ago --- hours after a grand jury declined to
indict the white police officer who placed Mr. Garner, an unarmed black
man, in a chokehold --- it was at this same place, Mount Sinai United
Christian Church, that Mr. de Blasio chose to deliver his message.

At the time, he said that he understood the pain pulsing through his
city, though he declined to criticize the grand jury decision directly.
He repeated the protesters' mantra, ``Black Lives Matter,'' and stopped
there.

And in a flourish that proved a touchstone of his first year in office,
the mayor invoked his own biracial son, Dante, recalling his efforts to
train the teenager to ``take special care'' in any encounter with the
police.

``I've had to worry over the
years,''~\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2014/12/04/us/ap-us-police-chokehold-death-mayor.html}{the
mayor said}~in December. ``Is Dante safe each night?''

On Tuesday night, the mayor took pains to reach several constituencies.
Mr. de Blasio, who does not regularly attend church, began by saying,
``I want to give honor to God.''

In an interfaith service that included Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan and the
Rev. Al Sharpton, Mr. de Blasio cast Mr. Garner as a catalyst for
change, insisting he ``did not die in vain.''

He linked the gathering to those mourning the recent shooting deaths at
a church in Charleston, S.C., and offered a call for unity among
officers and those they serve.

``It will become common for officers to know the clergy, the
shopkeepers, the parents,'' he said, alluding to a recent plan to add
nearly 1,300 officers in the hopes that the police will spend more time
getting to know the neighborhoods where they work. ``It'll be like the
village we all come from in our ancestral past.''

Speaking to more than 100 people at the church, beneath a low ceiling
and a white sign overhead declaring 2015 ``the year of maximized
spiritual potential,'' elected and religious leaders addressed a city at
once removed from the intensity that immediately followed the grand jury
decision and still consumed by the case's long shadow.

Cardinal Dolan said that the tragedy in New York ``seemed to ooze like a
toxic oil spill'' to Baltimore and Charleston and Ferguson, Mo.

The Rev. A. R. Bernard lifted words from Martin Luther King Jr. ``Peace
is not the absence of tension,'' Mr. Bernard said. ``It is the presence
of justice.''

Since his election, Mr. de Blasio's pledge to reshape the Police
Department has proceeded in fits and starts --- challenged, most
memorably, after the shooting deaths of two police officers in late
December prompted extraordinary public protests against the mayor from
union leaders and rank-and-file officers.

The mayor's comments about his son were held up by critics as proof of
his anti-police tilt --- a suggestion, they said, that officers were to
be feared and not respected.

Since then, the conflict has cooled. But the anniversary has laid bare
the tensions still underpinning the city's efforts.

The remarks at the church came one day after officials announced
a~\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/14/nyregion/eric-garner-case-is-settled-by-new-york-city-for-5-9-million.html}{\$5.9
million settlement}~with Mr. Garner's family, as part of an agreement
approved by the city comptroller's office.

Already, the payment has proved a delicate political issue.

In~\href{http://nypost.com/2015/07/14/nypd-union-head-on-the-citys-obscene-eric-garner-settlement/}{an
op-ed~article} in The New York Post, Edward D. Mullins, the president of
the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said the Garner family ``should
not be rewarded simply because he repeatedly chose to break the law and
resist arrest.''

``I think it sends a message that it's O.K. to commit crime in New
York,'' Mr. Mullins said of the settlement in an interview~on Tuesday.
``And you can spin it around to sue the city, and dependent upon the
outcome, we'll just throw you money.''

At the same time, some of the mayor's supporters have chafed at the pace
of progress at the Police Department, lamenting his dedication to
so-called broken-windows policing, which calls for aggressive
enforcement of low-level offenses like Mr. Garner's.

An attendee at the church, Janine Sawyers, 56, of Staten Island, said in
an interview that the mayor had approached any overhaul at the
department ``very gingerly.''

``It's been a process for them,'' she said. ``Slow process.''

Before the speech, Councilman Jumaane D. Williams of Brooklyn, who has
long advocated for policing changes, said he hoped Mr. de Blasio would
not shy away from the candor that accompanied his last visit to the
church. ``He had an honest conversation,'' Mr. Williams said of the
mayor's past remarks. ``And look what happened to the city.''

Inside Mount Sinai, Mr. de Blasio suggested he was unbowed.

``The roots of the problem, we are overcoming together,'' he said.
``They are deep. They're historic, they're painful, they're challenging.
But that doesn't stop us.''
