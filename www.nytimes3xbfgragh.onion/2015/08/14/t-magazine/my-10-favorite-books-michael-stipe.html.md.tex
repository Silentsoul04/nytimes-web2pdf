\href{http://onegrandbooks.com/}{\emph{One Grand}}\emph{, the editor
Aaron Hicklin asked people to name the 10 books they'd take with them if

Works}}\textbf{,'' Arthur Rimbaud} ``Because of Patti Smith I read
Rimbaud's entire works at the age of 16. The whole time I was thinking
his name was pronounced \emph{Rim-bawd}. I actually can't say at the
time that I understood much of the finer points, but it was a wild
read.''

the Road}}\textbf{,'' Jack Kerouac} ``This book became my band's
template. To explore the country and do it all --- having a great big
time --- on our terms, and no one else's. Hooray! Followed by ``The
First Third'' by Neal Cassady. The muse speaks, writes, smokes, drinks,
seduces.''

of Champions}}\textbf{,'' Kurt Vonnegut} ``Introduced me to irony and
self-deprecating humor. I can't say I learned the lesson well,
but\ldots{}a B- for effort.''

\textbf{``}\href{http://www.amazon.com/All-Families-Psychotic-Douglas-Coupland/dp/0007117531/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\&qid=1439577644\&sr=8-1\&keywords=All+Families+Are+Psychotic}{\textbf{All

It as It Lays}}\textbf{,'' Joan Didion} ``Which weirdly, through a Jack
Pierson photograph and a gift from Douglas Coupland, became maybe the
genesis of, and one of the three horns of my ongoing obsession with
sculptural replicas and obsolete forms.''
