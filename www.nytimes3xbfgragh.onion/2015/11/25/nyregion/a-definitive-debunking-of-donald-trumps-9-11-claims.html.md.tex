How alarmed were New Jersey officials by reports of Muslims dancing in
the streets of Jersey City and Paterson on Sept. 11, 2001, to celebrate
the destruction of the World Trade Center?

They feared riots would break out and were ready to send in the National
Guard and the State Police to preserve order.

But John J. Farmer Jr., then the New Jersey attorney general and the
state's chief law enforcement officer, said on Tuesday that he ordered
an investigation that very day and found the reports to be bogus, more
wild stories born in the stricken hours after the attacks.

Nevertheless, those ancient, false rumors were recycled as truth over
the weekend by
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/06/16/us/elections/donald-trump.html?inline=nyt-per}{Donald
J. Trump}, who has folded them into his calls for the national
registration of Muslims and possible closing of mosques.
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/11/22/us/politics/donald-trump-syrian-muslims-surveillance.html?_r=0}{Speaking
in Alabama}, Mr. Trump said: ``Hey, I watched when the World Trade
Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where
thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was
coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.''

Reporters were unable to find any evidence for his story, but Mr. Trump
stuck with it in a television interview on Sunday. ``It did happen,'' he
said. ``I saw it. It was on television.''

Few people, if any, could address the circumstances more definitively
than Mr. Farmer, who went on to serve as senior counsel to the Sept. 11
commission.

In an account Mr. Farmer provided Tuesday, he described being in the
state's command center, in Liberty State Park in Jersey City, directly
across the Hudson River from the burning wreckage of the trade center.
The New Jersey State Police radio antenna had been on top of one of the
towers, cutting off communications.

``We were forced to rely on runners for intelligence about what was
happening across the river and in New Jersey,'' Mr. Farmer said.

In the vacuum, rumors were flying, he said. Bombers with suicide vests
were in Times Square. Saboteurs were lurking around power plants. New
York City's mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was missing.

And then there was the wisp of a story that Mr. Farmer said was most
disturbing of all: ``That Muslims were dancing on the rooftops and in
the streets of Jersey City and Paterson.''

Indeed, pockets of radical Islamists had set up in Jersey City in the
past. The 1993 World Trade Center bombers rented a van and stored
chemicals and fertilizers in that city.

Open jubilation at the mass death, Mr. Farmer said, might quickly be
followed by rioting and more deaths. ``If true, we would have had to
mobilize the State Police and National Guard and locked the place
down,'' he said.

``We followed up on that report instantly because of its implications,''
he added. ``The word came back quickly from Jersey City, later from
Paterson. False report. Never happened.''

Political campaigns are notorious for the damage they do to truth, but
Mr. Trump's presidential run
\href{http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/}{has erased
any lines that would segregate rumors, facts, mistakes and outright
falsehoods}. This month, he posted a graphic on Twitter that purported
to show that 81 percent of white murder victims were killed by blacks;
\href{http://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/trump-retweets-bogus-crime-graphic/}{in
fact, 82 percent of whites are murdered by whites}.

Confronted by Bill O'Reilly, Mr. Trump essentially shrugged: ``I
retweeted somebody that was supposedly an expert, and it was also a
radio show.'' He has said, variously, that 200,000 or 250,000 Syrian
refugees would be coming to the United States; the Obama
administration's actual goal for next year is 10,000, as
\href{http://FactCheck.Org}{FactCheck.org}
\href{http://www.factcheck.org/2015/10/trump-gets-refugee-numbers-wrong/}{reported}.

Indifferent as Mr. Trump is to facts, in retailing the myth of the
dancing Muslims, he could not face a more sober and careful fact-finder
than Mr. Farmer.

Now a
\href{https://law.newark.rutgers.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/john-j-farmer-jr}{professor
of law} at Rutgers University, he led the Sept. 11 commission's
investigation of the disarray in the nation's air defenses on that
morning and
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/09/08/nyregion/newly-published-audio-provides-real-time-view-of-911-attacks.html}{exposed
as fiction} claims by the Pentagon that fighter pilots were in hot
pursuit of the hijacked airliners. In fact, military officials did not
know about three of the four hijacked planes until after they had
already crashed. That became the subject of a book by Mr. Farmer,
``\href{http://www.johnfarmerbooks.com/}{The Ground Truth},'' which was
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/11/15/books/review/Heilbrunn-t.html}{hailed}
by Jacob Heilbrunn in The New York Times as a ``precise and reliable
accounting of what happened.''

Mr. Farmer said isolating and stigmatizing Muslims now, whatever its
short-term political appeal, would spawn more alienated Muslim youth and
potential recruits for the Islamic State.

``Whatever the message, it is just plain wrong to cite thousands of
Muslims dancing in Jersey City or Paterson on 9/11 as support,'' Mr.
Farmer said. ``That simply never happened.''
