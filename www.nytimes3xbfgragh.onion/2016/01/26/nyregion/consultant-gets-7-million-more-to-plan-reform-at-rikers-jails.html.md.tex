In the latest indication of how daunting it has been to remake the
troubled New York City jails, the de Blasio administration is spending
an additional \$7 million on an international consulting firm that it
first hired in 2014 to develop a blueprint for reform.

While the consultant, McKinsey \& Company, specializes in reorganizing
corporations, it has rarely if ever worked in jails or prisons before
the
\href{http://topics.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/rikers_island_prison_complex/index.html?8qa}{Rikers
Island jail complex}. The firm's consultants --- often youthful
graduates of elite universities --- are expected to focus on measures to
reduce the violence, which persists even as the city spends tens of
millions of dollars to improve conditions.

Officials declined to describe how many consultants would be involved or
what services would be provided by McKinsey, which was first hired by
the city in September 2014 for \$1.7 million.

The department ``is committed to creating a culture of safety within the
city's jails, and extending our current contract with McKinsey is part
of that ongoing effort,'' a Correction Department spokesman said in a
statement.

During the first contract, McKinsey conducted a survey of the 9,000
uniformed officers at Rikers, which concluded that morale in the
department might be the worst it had ever seen in any organization.

City officials said the consultants had also helped develop a plan to
reduce the use of solitary confinement by creating alternative housing
that would permit even the most troubled inmates to be out of their
cells several hours a day.

In the
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/22/nyregion/mayor-bill-de-blasio-budget-plan-new-york-city.html?rref=collection\%2Ftimestopic\%2Fde\%20Blasio\%2C\%20Bill\&action=click\&contentCollection=timestopics\&region=stream\&module=stream_unit\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=10\&pgtype=collection}{proposed
2017 budget} made public last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio called for
nearly \$100 million in new spending for the Correction Department,
including \$41.3 million for the
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/03/13/nyregion/rikers-island-mayor-de-blasio-plan-curtail-violence.html?_r=0}{Anti-Violence
Plan} he introduced last year and \$58.3 million for training technology
and extra staffing.

With the increase, the city plans to add 542 uniformed staff members,
aimed at improving the guard-to-inmate ratio in programs for the most
troubled prisoners and reducing overtime.

\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/12/15/nyregion/at-rikers-a-roadblock-to-reform.html}{Norman
Seabrook}, president of the correction officers' union, said he was
pleased about the additional officers as well as the budget increase,
but was highly critical of the extension of McKinsey's contract, which
was
\href{http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160125/BLOGS04/160129948/de-blasio-quadruples-down-on-outsourcing-rikers-reform}{reported
in Crain's New York Business}.

``I do not think McKinsey has done anything impressive enough to justify
giving them another contract worth millions of taxpayer dollars,'' Mr.
Seabrook said. ``They have not shown that they know anything about how
to operate a correctional facility.''

``There has never been a dialogue between the union and McKinsey that
resulted in better services being provided,'' he said.

The increased spending by the department will also help pay for more
security cameras. Last year the city agreed to install thousands of new
cameras throughout the jail as part of a
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/23/nyregion/new-york-city-settles-suit-over-abuses-at-rikers-island.html}{settlement
of a class-action lawsuit} brought by the Legal Aid Society's Prisoners'
Rights Project and the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet
Bharara.

In 2014, Mr. Bharara released the findings of an investigation
describing pervasive brutality at the jail housing 16- and 17-year-olds.
Nearly half the young inmates suffered ``head shots'' at the hands of
violent guards, while many others had their bones broken, according to
the report.

Since then, the correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, has eliminated
solitary for 16- and 17-year-olds and reduced it substantially for
inmates aged 18 to 21.

While in some Rikers buildings there has been a reduction of
inmate-on-inmate violence, as well as physical force being used by
officers against inmates, the number of slashings and stabbings has
continued to rise.

In a particularly vicious attack in November, a group of young inmates
jumped a correction officer,
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/11/07/nyregion/2-teenage-inmates-charged-in-attack-on-rikers-island-officer.html}{Raymond
Calderon}, slashing his face in several places.

Union officials have complained that because the commissioner is cutting
back on solitary confinement, dangerous inmates have been freed to walk
the cellblocks and attack officers.

This month, the city's Board of Correction, a jail watchdog agency,
agreed to give the commissioner until June to end solitary confinement
for all young adults.
