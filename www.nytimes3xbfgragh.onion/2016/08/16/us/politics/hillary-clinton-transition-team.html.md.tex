PHILADELPHIA --- Hillary Clinton's campaign announced on Tuesday that
Ken Salazar, the
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/04/06/us/politics/ken-salazar-joyful-run-interior-secretary.html}{former
interior secretary} and Colorado senator, would become chairman of Mrs.
Clinton's transition planning team.

The effort, which will be based out of Washington, is aimed at preparing
Mrs. Clinton and her team to enter the White House after the November
election if she wins --- an operation intended to be largely separated
from Mrs. Clinton's campaign apparatus in Brooklyn.

The campaign said Mr. Salazar would lead four team members: Tom Donilon,
who served as national security adviser under President Obama; Jennifer
Granholm, the former governor of Michigan; Neera Tanden, the president
of the Center for American Progress; and Maggie Williams, the director
of Harvard's Institute of Politics and a longtime Clinton confidante.

Two top campaign policy advisers for the Democratic nominee, Ed Meier
and Ann O'Leary, will also shift full-time to the transition efforts.
Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for
Equitable Growth, will be the team's chief economist.

``While our campaign remains focused on the task at hand of winning in
November, Hillary Clinton wants to be able to get to work right away as
president-elect on building an economy that works for everyone, not just
those at the top,'' John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman
and the transition team president, said in a statement. ``These
individuals, who bring a deep level of experience in the work of
presidential transitions, will help us build a team that is ready to
govern after the general election.''

The White House has been preparing for months to help oversee a transfer
of power in January. Representatives of both the Clinton and Trump
campaigns have been invited to begin attending transition-planning
meetings and to arrange for intelligence briefings.

Donald J. Trump has put Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey
