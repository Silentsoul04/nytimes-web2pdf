Amid low ratings, ``I Am Cait,'' E's documentary series

Caitlyn Jenner's life as a transgender woman, is finished after two
seasons.

Ms. Jenner announced the news on Twitter on Tuesday,
\href{https://twitter.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/765626711752908800}{saying}
after two seasons that ``it's time for the next adventure.''

``I Am Cait'' premiered last July to enormous expectations following Ms.
Jenner's April 2015 revelation that she was transgender. Every step Ms.
Jenner took last spring resulted in a ratings bonanza, including an ABC
interview with Diane Sawyer and an appearance at ESPN's ESPY award
ceremony.

But those massive ratings never materialized for her E! series. The
premiere of the
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/29/arts/television/i-am-cait-scores-solid-ratings-for-e.html}{show
debuted} to a respectable 2.7 million viewers but it declined
significantly from there. The second season premiere
\href{http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-caitlyn-jenners-reality-873419}{debuted}
to just 750,000 viewers.

Though the series had the occasional cameo from her celebrity family
members --- including Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Kanye West --- it
largely focused on Ms. Jenner's new circle of friends as she navigated
life as a transgender woman.

Before the debut of the second season, E!

the} performance of the series, with their head of programming, Jeff
Olde, saying, ``we always love ratings but we do the show for many
reasons.''

In a statement, an E! spokesperson said: ``Caitlyn and E! have mutually
decided not to move forward with another season at this time. She will
always remain a part of the E! family, and we look forward to continue
following her journey as she appears on `Keeping Up with the
Kardashians.'''
