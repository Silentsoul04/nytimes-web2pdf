On the Friday before Labor Day, the New York-based artist Rashid Johnson
was shooting hoops outside the city and talking about his new show at
Hauser \& Wirth that comprises 14 new pieces, including a monumental
sculpture installation that integrates a live piano performance. Music
has always been an inspiration for Johnson, who first made art-world
waves when three of his large-scale photographic portraits were included
in Thelma Golden's landmark 2001 ``Freestyle'' exhibition at the Studio
Museum in Harlem. And it's often been physically represented in his
practice: Album covers have prominently figured into his installations
in the past. But the live audio element of the upcoming Hauser \& Wirth
show --- one of the New York art season's most anticipated, named ``Fly
Away'' after the gospel hymn --- is a first for the artist.

At the opening tonight, the musician Antoine Baldwin will play an
upright piano situated on the second level of ``Antoine's Organ,'' a
giant sculpture created in a 3-D steel grid 28 feet wide and more than
10 feet tall, which houses over 250 plants brought from Florida and
planted in pots made by Johnson himself. It's a sensory, immersive
installation, incorporating books, wood, shea butter, video (including
``The New Black Yoga,'' which you can watch in full at the end of this
post) and grow lights studded throughout --- along with the plants and,
of course, the music. Baldwin will continue to drop in on the show
throughout its run to contribute live performances of his original jazz
compositions. Listen to a recording of Baldwin playing for Johnson, in
Brooklyn earlier this year, below.

The artist and the musician met through a mutual friend, the music
producer Anthony ``The Twilite Tone'' Khan, who suggested they work
together --- so Johnson rented a practice space and a piano and asked
Baldwin to play for him. ``Here was this dynamic, young pianist, and I
felt the relationship to sculpture and realized that a live musical
performance could bring my sculpture to life in a way I hadn't
considered,'' Johnson recalls. ``He didn't know me, nor my work, and the
New York show was already on the books. I was already thinking about the
major installation and thinking about the New York show and how this
sculpture could be different from
\href{http://garagemca.org/en/event/rashid-johnson-within-our-gates}{the
Moscow one} shown earlier this year. Although the Moscow piece, `Within
Our Gates,' is also a large grid structure with plants, it used film at
its core --- and the New York piece became a music box.''

Baldwin did more than add to the show --- he was a present influence
during Johnson's process of creating it, too. ``I bought a piano and put
it in my studio and he would come and play and I worked,'' he says. ``He
kind of inspired what I was making.''
