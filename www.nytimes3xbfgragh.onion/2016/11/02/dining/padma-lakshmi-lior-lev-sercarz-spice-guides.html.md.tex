Two of the city's best spice purveyors now have reference guides. Padma
Lakshmi, the television personality and cookbook author, has
collaborated with Kalustyan's, a magic carpet of ingredients on
Lexington Avenue and 29th Street, on an A-to-Z guide to spices and
herbs. Color photos illustrate many of the entries and typical uses, but
no recipes are given. Lior Lev Sercarz, who owns
\href{http://laboiteny.com/}{La Boîte}, a spice shop on 11th Avenue and
51st Street, and who custom-blends spices for chefs, has also done a
guide. The handsome book comes in a box, is lavishly photographed and is
organized alphabetically to cover spices and herbs. There are no
recipes, but suggested uses are given for each product. Mr. Sercarz
explains how to best buy, blend, roast and store seasonings, and how
spices are sanitized to be sold: \emph{``The Encyclopedia of Spices \&
Herbs: An Essential Guide to the Flavors of the World,'' by Padma
Lakshmi with Judith Sutton and Kalustyan's (Harper Collins, \$25); ``The
Spice Companion: A Guide to the World of Spices,'' by Lior Lev Sercarz
(Clarkson Potter, \$40, \$50 with slipcase).}
