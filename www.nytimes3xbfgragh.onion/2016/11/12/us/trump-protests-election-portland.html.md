Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets in several cities across
the country for a second night on Thursday in protests against the
election of Donald J. Trump as president.

In Portland, Ore., the police arrested 29 people while contending with
what they described as an “aggressive” crowd of about 4,000 protesters
and widespread reports of vandalism, fires and broken windows.

“Due to extensive criminal and dangerous behavior, protest is now
considered a riot,” the Portland Police Department [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/PortlandPolice/status/796933213008474112).

Sgt. Pete Simpson, a police spokesman, said Thursday that there were
accounts of protesters with bats and drivers being attacked, but there
were no reports of injuries.

Photos and videos posted to social media showed vandals spray-painting
buildings and cars, and the police later said on Twitter that they had
deployed “less lethal munitions,” including pepper spray and “rubber
ball distraction devices.”

Sergeant Simpson said that the overwhelming number of participants were
law-abiding citizens but that “a smaller segment are anarchist-types”
who were hiding in the crowd.

“We’re constantly assessing what’s happening and trying to figure out
where they’re going next,” he said.

Protests took place in other cities, including Baltimore, Denver,
Milwaukee, Oakland and Philadelphia. Some demonstrations started early
Wednesday after election returns showed the Democratic nominee, Hillary
Clinton, losing to Mr. Trump, a Republican.

On Twitter on Thursday night, Mr. Trump expressed his dissatisfaction at
the protests, which he said were “incited by the media.”

On Friday morning, however, Mr. Trump reversed course with [a follow-up
post on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/797034721075228672)
that praised the demonstrators and echoed the themes of unity he
expressed in his victory speech.

“Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have
passion for our great country,” he wrote. “We will all come together and
be proud\!”

Remigio Mateo, 31, a social worker in Los Angeles, said he was stunned
by the results and wondered how a candidate who had used such
anti-immigrant language during the presidential campaign could win
election to the White House.

He wanted to be with people who would understand. When a friend
mentioned a protest on Wednesday night at City Hall, Mr. Mateo said he
knew he needed to be there.

“This election was a real wake-up call that things aren’t anywhere near
as progressive as we thought they were,” he said. “I feel confused,
disheartened, shocked and afraid of what comes next. I felt I needed to
be around others who felt the same way, not only to protest, but to
think of how to move forward.”
