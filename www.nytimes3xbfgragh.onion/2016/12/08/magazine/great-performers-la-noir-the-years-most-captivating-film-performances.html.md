**WESLEY MORRIS:** What is it about watching someone become someone else
that has been so mesmerizing for so many people for so long? What is it
about a person’s becoming his or her ultimate self that we can’t resist?
It’s all-powerful, all-consuming stuff. In life, that consumption can be
dangerous. But in art, I *want* my mind controlled by that power. I want
an actor’s skill, intelligence, energy, body and face to overtake me. I
love the movie magic of no longer seeing an actor — or especially a star
— but a person.

**A.O. SCOTT:** Me, too. And the best place to surrender to the power
you describe is still in a darkened theater, in spite of all the
competing performances we can sample on television and elsewhere. The
movies still feel larger than life and blissfully distant from it, even
as life grows crazier and more improbable than the movies. But the big
screen hardly holds a monopoly. Let’s be honest: If we weren’t limited
to movie stars here, we might have come up with a list of great
performers that included Beyoncé, Donald Trump, LeBron James and whoever
we suppose Elena Ferrante to be.

But what’s most fascinating to me about movies now is how many different
kinds of acting coexist within the art form. In these pages, we have
some people who excel through the discipline of old-fashioned theatrical
technique and others who seem less like actors than like unwitting
documentary subjects. I marvel at the deep craft that Denzel Washington
and Viola Davis wield in bringing to life characters invented by August
Wilson (in “Fences”). I also marvel at the apparent artlessness of
Krisha Fairchild (in “Krisha”) and Sasha Lane (in “American Honey”), who
don’t seem to be pretending at all. Washington and Davis, playing a
long-married couple living in Pittsburgh in the 1950s, feel like
recognizable American archetypes; the characters, at least at first, are
as familiar as the people playing them. Krisha (the character) is a
middle-aged woman with a history of substance abuse and awful behavior
who pays a Thanksgiving visit to her semi-estranged family. Fairchild
(the performer) seems so much like that person that you wonder if she
might show up at *your* next holiday meal. Similarly, you can’t be
entirely sure that Sasha Lane won’t ring your doorbell selling dubious
magazine subscriptions. Each performer pursues, and achieves, a distinct
kind of credibility.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**MORRIS:** Yes, this group of men and women presents a gamut of what
movie acting can be and do: knock you out, break your heart, scare you,
delight you, amuse and haunt you, whether through vertiginously high
style (hey there, Denzel and Viola) or plain-old naturalism. Sometimes
the feat is intangible, like the way that Ruth Negga’s eyes and frown,
as she plays [Mildred Loving in
“Loving”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/13/movies/loving-jeff-nichols-interview.html)
— Jeff Nichols’s film about the landmark interracial-marriage case —
offer deep reserves of sadness. If Modigliani ever painted the Delta
blues, it would look something Negga’s expression in this movie. She
doesn’t have much to do in “Loving,” and part of me wishes she were able
to get up to more. But here’s a woman who can calibrate a long face so
that it has a gravitational pull. And that’s really
something.

Negga works in the naturalist style you identified in Sasha Lane and
Krisha Fairchild. But it’s funny: I hadn’t thought of Fairchild as
practicing naturalism until just now. Fairchild has an arresting beauty
— it’s crystal-shop Sharon Stone — and a flair for tragedy that
reminds me of Cassavetes-era Gena Rowlands. But part of what makes her
so good is the simple surprise of her talent: We had never seen this
woman before. In the opening scene, the minute she gets out of that car,
takes a few steps and then trudges back to get the suitcase she forgot,
I knew I was in for something other than — or in addition to — realism.
I knew I was watching a woman wielding a control over her rawness. Her
commitment becomes the drama. We’re so absorbed in this woman’s state of
mind that the simple dressing of a turkey becomes Hitchcock-suspenseful.

**SCOTT:** And one of the most hackneyed conceits in all of movies — the
family holiday from hell — becomes the freshest, scariest, most
electrifying domestic nightmare anyone has ever
shot.

There are lots of fresh faces in our group, and some of what makes, say,
[Royalty

follow her wherever that turned out to be. We talked at some point about
what unites the actors gathered for this issue, and I really do think,

or Huppert, it’s surprise, don’t you?

**SCOTT:** Yes, we’re used to seeing the same thing repeated everywhere
— not only in the entertainment we consume but also in our
interactions with the real world. Most of us, most of the time, are
content to rest on our assumptions about what other people are like.
Online, we traffic in algorithms, aggregations and demographic data
sets, the pseudoscientific dressing for old habits of generalization and
stereotyping. But a strong performance can smash through that
complacency with a force akin to love or friendship, reminding us that
the odd, the idiosyncratic, the irreducibly individual still have a
place in our standardized and quantified world. We quickly discover that
we’ve never seen anyone like this
before.

What astonishes me is how many different forms this uniqueness can take,
how many distinct techniques there are for arriving at it. Troy Maxson,
Denzel Washington’s character in “Fences,” sails onto the screen on
gusts of verbiage. He probably utters more words in the first two
minutes of that movie than all three of the actors who play Chiron do in
the entirety of “Moonlight.” But the character, born in August Wilson’s
words, takes life in Washington’s body. Troy’s history — a brutal
childhood, a spell in prison, a baseball career and a lot of sex, liquor
and manual labor in the midst of it all — is all written in Washington’s
posture. Shoulders back, belly forward, all the weight centered in the
hips, a kinetic vision of masculine grace and power worn down and gone
slightly to seed.

What happens in
“[Moonlight](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/21/movies/moonlight-review.html)”
is something else altogether. It tells what might have been a standard
coming-of-age story, about a young man growing up poor, black and queer
in the Liberty City section of Miami. But instead of the usual plot
points, the story is fashioned out of moods and emotions, by the
flickerings of Chiron’s consciousness and the stirrings of his desire.
It’s a three-dimensional portrait in color and sound, and Alex Hibbert,
Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes — who play Chiron as a schoolboy, a
teenager and a grown man — execute a *coup de cinéma* that feels to me
utterly without precedent. A single soul occupies three distinct bodies.

**MORRIS:** In American movies, children have often been asked to be
hams, to weaponize cuteness and spunk. But you get tired of kiddie
kleptomaniacs. You want to see some risks. Now the old European style of
acting has happily come into American independent filmmaking: lots of
stillness and quiet, these moments of privacy, solitude and thinking,
from actors who, to us, are strangers — and often uncannily seasoned
young people. Sometimes all that quiet and stillness comes off as
bashful, as amateurism. But often, as in “Moonlight,” it’s simply
confidence re-engineered. Each of the three chapters in Chiron’s life is
handled by a different actor. Plenty of films use flashbacks or
prologues featuring a younger version of the protagonist to telescope an
adult hero’s journey, and it can be a hokey device for any number of
reasons, including misbegotten casting. The coup you identify in
“Moonlight” has precisely to do with the brilliance of its casting,
and for us, that starts with Hibbert, who plays the youngest Chiron with
top-secret assurance. Some actors really are hams. This kid was born
with the discipline of a vegetarian.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hibbert’s a peanut who can sit at a dining-room table or stand in a long
shot of an open field and draw you to him. He’s got a serene,
self-protectively hardened face that conveys simultaneous hurt and
wonder and an awareness that the wonder can hurt. All of that complexity
is in the baton that’s passed to Sanders, a very different performer
with a very different face, but he amplifies what Hibbert gives him and
adds physicality, volatility and grace. Sanders has two scenes that
involve walking, and the way he uses each gait to evoke a distinctly
different mood of dismay killed me. The director, Barry Jenkins, uses
two performances to establish these feelings and experiences, then hands
them off to Rhodes, whose final incarnation of Chiron strategically
buries all that has preceded him in rock-hard thuggery. I think he has
the hardest job. First, *you* try following Hibbert and Sanders\!
Second, he has to perform a hardness that we know is an act — he’s got
to exude *some* of Hibbert and Sanders’s innocence. Third, he has to
nail a crucial phone call for the movie’s psychological junction to make
its thunderous “click.” When he takes that call, the experience of
watching what’s happening on Rhodes’s face, in his being, is not unlike
finding out that all Charles Foster Kane ever wanted was that sled.
That’s so much of the movie right there: three performances snapping
into place with one drug dealer’s dropped
jaw.

**SCOTT:** And it’s not just that — as in “Citizen Kane” — the audience
is finally understanding something about the character that he already
knew. Chiron at that moment is finally understanding himself, and we are
witnesses to the unlocking of his inner secret.

**MORRIS:** A few of these performances rely on a moment or two to
unlock what best illustrates a character’s character. I’m thinking about
Casey Affleck, Viola Davis and Taraji P. Henson. The beauty of what
they’ve done with their roles has everything to do with patience —
remembering that you’re playing much more than a single, crucial moment
— but also to do with an understanding of how real people work,
emotionally.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**SCOTT:** Real people are often emotionally opaque to others and
unavailable even to themselves. Perhaps the greatest challenge screen
actors face is capturing that opacity. Nonprofessional or untrained
actors sometimes have an advantage, because they haven’t been taught the
tricks of controlled and sublimated expression, staples of the
curriculum in those acting schools that emphasize the psychological
basis of the craft. There is an enigmatic quality to the characters in
Italian neorealism, early Bresson and a lot of Kiarostami that comes
from the use of untrained actors.

I think Sasha Lane has some of that quality. In “[American
Honey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/02/movies/american-honey-open-highways-free-spirits.html),”
her first film, she plays a girl named Star (of course she’s named
Star), who escapes a grim family situation and runs off with a feral
crew of teenagers who roam the heartland selling magazine subscriptions
nobody wants. They pretend to be raising money for scholarships or
sports teams, but really they’re the pawns in a grim little scam, the
main point of which seems to be their own exploitation. There’s a
sequence in which Star breaks away from her mentor and
sometime-kind-of-boyfriend (played by Shia LaBeouf) to take a ride with
some middle-aged guys in cowboy hats who are out for a good time. So is
Star, but it might not be the same kind of good time, and the scene
unfolds with terrifying unpredictability. We don’t know what’s going to
happen to Star — maybe something unspeakable, maybe something
uncomfortable, maybe something crazy and fun — and we also don’t know
what she wants to happen, how much control she’s in or even thinks she’s
in. But I don’t think Lane is playing uncertainty or ambivalence in any
conventional sense. She’s not communicating her character’s
recklessness; she’s matching
it.

**MORRIS:** I love that way of thinking about a certain kind of rawness.
It’s a risk, right? Andrea Arnold, the director of “American Honey,” is
a raw actor’s director. She knows what to do with roughness and edginess
and daring. She’s searching for that in her casting. When it works, it’s
spellbinding for the audience. Harvey Keitel in any of his primes had
it. So have Jennifer Jason Leigh and Angela Bassett in theirs. Joaquin
Phoenix is my current favorite in this style of post-Marlon Brando
performance. Part of it is: How far in, out, up, down will this actor
go? Will he or she get to a place where all the training and technique
are gone and you’re just watching an arsonist play with matches? Guys
like Nicolas Cage or Ed Harris or Tom Hardy can go too far with the fire
and sometimes seem to act just to burn everything down.

**SCOTT:** In the anti-Method acting manifesto “True and False,” David
Mamet argues that what we respond to in a great performance is not the
dubious “emotional truth” of the character but rather the existential
courage of the actor. This is something more clearly seen onstage, where
there is no chance to retake or fix it in postproduction and where the
audience is always at least somewhat conscious of watching “a real body
in real time.” But the camera also forces risks on those who step in
front of it. When I reflect on the moments in recent movies that have
stayed with me — Taraji P. Henson arriving in her NASA office, soaking
wet, to claim the respect that is her due; Casey Affleck walking away
from Michelle Williams on a frigid New England street; Sasha Lane
plunging into a Texas swimming pool; Don Cheadle as Miles Davis
suffering the indignity of a visit to a Columbia University dormitory in
the midst of an absurd caper — I think that the right name for what I’ve
witnessed is
bravery.

Mamet might call “what I command.” But obviously, bravery in screen
acting exists. Any woman who takes an assignment with Lars von Trier,
for example — Emily Watson, Björk, Nicole Kidman, Bryce Dallas Howard,
Kirsten Dunst and especially Charlotte Gainsbourg — embodies the concept
to a degree that abuts holiness and would alarm H.R.

Right now, given how few screen actors are expected — or hired — to
achieve anything close, it’s a trait that feels increasingly endangered.
But what is it? A result of a seemingly hazardous workplace? The choice
to forgo likability in favor of being fully human? A willingness to push
yourself, regardless of the outcome, to some new expressive frontier?
Sasha Lane exceeds these definitions — while working with Shia LaBeouf,
too, a terribly underrated performer whose self-regard is crying out for
a director to toss him a book of Nicolas Cage’s matches. I actually
think the scene in which Taraji P. Henson explodes at her co-workers in
“[Hidden
Figures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/22/movies/taraji-p-henson-octavia-spencer-hidden-figures-rocket-science-and-race.html)”
is more brave of the *character* — Katherine Johnson, a black female
mathematician working among scores of white men in the early 1960s —
than of the woman playing her. That’s a moment of cathartic acting, of
roaring release. She delivers that speech the way a battleship delivers
a torpedo. And accordingly, it does blow a hole in the rest of a smartly
done, crowd-pleasing movie, because you don’t forget that in addition to
the space race, there’s this *other* race thing going on. But what I
found brave about the rest of her performance is how demure she has
allowed herself to be. Katherine seems as surprised by her outburst as
we and those men are. Until then, she’s playing everything *but*
anger.

**SCOTT:** There is an element of self-awareness, just this side of
winking, in the way Henson holds herself in check. At the moment, she is
known to all the sentient television-watching world as Cookie Lyon, a
volcano of rage, greed, maternal possessiveness and sexual need. One
fantasy that “Hidden Figures” invites is that the nerdy, demure,
slightly disheveled Katherine will respond to the slights and insults
thrown her way by Kirsten Dunst’s character and the rest of the white
power structure by unleashing her inner Cookie. Of course the
stereotypical view of black womanhood embedded in that fantasy is part
of what “Hidden Figures” is attacking, and Henson is central to that
attack. Her self-control mirrors Katherine’s self-control, but Henson is
also letting us know that she has always been in control. I would call
that assertion a form of bravery.

**MORRIS:** Truly brave, of course, is all some actors ever do. That’s
all Isabelle Huppert ever does. And you’d think it would get old
watching her go out on yet another limb. But Huppert is why I’ll never
stop going to the movies: She’s all limbs. In
“[Elle](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/11/movies/elle-review-isabelle-huppert.html),”
she plays a clammy video-game executive who is haunted by a sexual
assault. The appalling audacity of the movie, which Paul Verhoeven
directed, is its refusal to draw a line between rape and fetish. But the
movie is as much about Verhoeven’s toying with propriety as it is about
an actress toying with herself. Her film persona is bound up in the
psychodynamics of sex and power. This might be her breeziest-yet
approach. And yet there are so many layers to what she’s doing here:
repression, lust, shame, disgust, fun. I’ve never seen an actor so good
at and so seemingly obsessed with performing instinct, subtext and
offensiveness. That might get aggravating with someone else, because,
ultimately, it’s meta-humanity she’s after: Even when the women she’s
playing just live in Paris, they never seem entirely from Earth. But you
always want to see how too-far she’ll take
things.

**SCOTT:** Even when she stays close to home, as in the finely observed
domestic drama of Mia Hansen-Love’s “Things to Come,” she’s playing
almost a doppelgänger of the “Elle” character — a philosophy professor
whose marriage breaks up, who becomes a grandmother and whose sexual
interests point in what others might regard as an inappropriate
direction. She’s also kind of mean, or at least shockingly direct. But
there’s no violence in Hansen-Love’s world, no sensationalism, nothing
lurid. Everything in tasteful Gallic moderation, except for Huppert, who
is a walking avatar of extremity. She collapses the distinction between
terror and rapture.

**MORRIS:** Huppert is among the last of a dying breed of psychological
star. That kind of acting has tended to be closely associated with the
Europeans and the Method people, but is it nuts to watch Kristen Stewart
work and think: She could be Huppert’s
daughter?

**SCOTT:** No more nuts than my own hunch, which is that [Kristen
Stewar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/17/t-magazine/entertainment/kristen-stewart-the-good-bad-girl.html)t
is the new Robert De Niro. Back in the ’70s and ’80s, De Niro’s
reputation as the best actor in American movies rested on his ability to
vanish completely into each role, to effect a physical and psychological
transformation so total that you could barely recognize him from one
movie to the next. Some of what he did was a matter of what you might
call technical extremism: learning Sicilian dialect for “The Godfather
Part II,” pushing his body from sinewy fighting trim to has-been
bloatedness in “Raging Bull.” Stewart hasn’t quite done that yet, but
she burrows as deeply as De Niro ever has into the interiors of her
characters, arranging her expressions, her carriage, her vocal
inflections — even, it can seem, her height and bone structure —
accordingly.

You could say that, having been made, perhaps reluctantly, into a movie
star by the “Twilight” movies, she has lately reinvented herself as the
character actor she might have always preferred to be. Apart from her
lead performance in Olivier Assayas’s “Personal Shopper,” she has been
an ensemble player in 2016, with roles in Woody Allen’s “Cafe Society,”
[Kelly Reichardt’s “Certain
Women”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/16/magazine/the-quiet-menace-of-kelly-reichardts-feminist-westerns.html)
and Ang Lee’s “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk.” But the fact that she’s
the most interesting person in all of those movies suggests that her
movie-star charisma is still intact. She’s just using it in subtle and
occasionally subversive
ways.

**MORRIS:** I think Kristen Stewart is just about the best American
movie actress we have. Her bad romance with movie stardom has served her
well, because early exposure to its toxins might have fortified her
resistance to mere fame. Unlike with, say, Ben Affleck, there’s no
tension or ambivalence between her being an actor and her being a star.
She appears to have rejected the latter to insist upon the value of the
former. Lots of people can have it both ways, but it’s a balance that
takes a while to achieve. Look at how long it took for Meryl Streep and
Leonardo DiCaprio, whose allergy to overnight godliness foreshadowed
Stewart’s. In the meantime, it’s fascinating to watch her flirt with
stardom in the films she takes and the women she plays.

**SCOTT:** In “[Cafe
Society](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/15/movies/cafe-society-review-woody-allen.html),”
the Woody Allen movie, she takes what is, as written, an almost entirely
functional character — the dream girl swooned over by both a middle-aged
Hollywood mogul and his ambitious nephew; a catalyst of male desire and
a mirror of masculine ego — and makes her into the only person in the
film whose choices and desires really matter. In “Certain Women,” a much
better movie, she slouches onto the screen with self-effacing
diffidence. You may wonder if Elizabeth Travis, a young lawyer trying to
earn some extra money teaching adult-ed classes to disgruntled teachers
in a middle-of-nowhere Western town, is in possession of a backbone. Her
posture is terrible. Her fashion sense is worse. She seems entirely
capable of standing in front of a room full of people and vanishing from
sight.

Except to a young ranch hand (Lily Gladstone), in whose eyes Elizabeth
is a dazzling, almost magical creature, the most intoxicating and
glamorous person she has ever encountered — a dangerous and alluring
Edward Cullen to her own humble Bella Swan. But there is no winking from
Stewart herself, and none of the kind of ostentatious deglamorization
that stars sometimes traffic in when they are shopping for Academy
hardware. If this is realism, it’s the kind that forces you to
acknowledge the gaps and blurry spaces in your previous conception of
reality.

Not that realism is everything. Even the drabbest, most earthbound
cinematic exploration of ordinary unhappiness is on some level a
fantasy. “[La La
Land](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/06/movies/la-la-land-stars-ryan-gosling-emma-stone-and-los-angeles.html),”
Damien Chazelle’s brazen attempt to reinvigorate the old-fashioned movie
musical, is a fantasy on a lot of different levels. One is Emma Stone’s
performance as a fresh-faced, quick-witted Los Angeles girl next door
who happens to be an aspiring movie star.

**MORRIS:** You and I are both guilty of pleading with the people who
make our movies to please, pretty please, put Taraji P. Henson and Emma
Stone in more of everything. And here they both are. It took only a few
moments in a couple of movies to realize that the women were stars.
They’ve got gale-force charisma that risks neglect and misuse. With
Henson, I worried that the movies would throw up their hands in
pre-emptive exasperation: “We just don’t the have the roles for her.”
And since her first Oscar nomination as Brad Pitt’s mammy seven years
ago, they really haven’t. With Stone, I worried that the only times we
would see her best stuff would be at awards shows and when she played
Peter Parker’s damsel in a dreary Spider-Man reboot.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But “La La Land” is an ideal home for her sunlight and the clouds she
can gather to obscure it. Everything she’s doing for Chazelle is on the
surface, which is just right for a movie that needs her to start singing
and dancing. You have to seem ready to join the joy — or, as is often
the case here, the solemnity — of having a song in your heart. One
reason to pick Stone over a lot of other actors for that kind of
readiness is that her intelligence doesn’t get in her way. She has done
all her thinking before we see her. How many good actors have a hard
time giving themselves over to anything too small or normal, lest
someone miss them acting? Or: How many actors have to work hard at
appearing natural? Stone woke up like this. May the movies stay awake to
her\!

**SCOTT:** My favorite Emma Stone moment in “La La Land” — and this is
saying a lot — is a very small morsel of multidimensional bravura. Her
character, Mia, is at an audition in the middle of a stressed-out,
ordinary, young-person-in-Los-Angeles-looking-for-a-break kind of day.
She’s supposed to react as someone breaks up with her over the phone,
and Mia — Emma — gives it everything. Her eyes swell with unshed tears;
her mouth crumples and freezes into a pained half-smile. And then
someone interrupts, and the audition is over, and she makes her
exasperated way down a corridor lined with pretty, petite redheads just
like her. But we know she’s not just another interchangeable aspirant.
We know, based on that audition, that Mia is a terrific actress. We
already knew that about Emma Stone, but now somehow we know it even
more.

**MORRIS:** “La La Land” arrives at a moment in which the movies are
diverging from Stardom 101: “This is who I am, and it won’t ever change
too much.” Both she and her co-star Ryan Gosling — who’s also excellent,
and appears to have recovered from that give-me-the-matches syndrome —
are working on established personas, in a classical style that can
result in serious work. (Ask Denzel Washington and Isabelle Huppert.)
But ever since De Niro, I think seriousness in American acting has come
to mean suffering and stress. His Jake LaMotta is a landmark piece of
acting from which people continue to extract the wrong lesson. The
achievement of that performance isn’t its physicality — it’s the
psychological torture that defines and dictates it. (I have to say, the
toll of playing that character seemed to wreck his acting for a decade.)
That kind of madness might need the Method. But it has landed a lot of
performers in the pits of mannerism too. Natalie Portman has been one of
those actors: someone who needs the suffering to achieve the sublime.
Her playing [Jacqueline
Kennedy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/30/fashion/jackie-kennedy-first-lady-natalie-portman.html)
in Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie” could have been more stunt work — the
accent, the brittleness, the froideur. But I really like what an
exercise in state of mind she makes it. She’s acting symbolism and
tragedy in a way only partly to do with her husband’s assassination and
everything to do with performing docility, sympathy, wifeliness,
decorum, strength and bereavement for an expectant nation. Portman knows
what to do with a symbol: make it mean something.

She and Don Cheadle are the only actors in our group playing outsize
cultural icons. That kind of acting is a gamble, obviously, because it
can get too close to impersonation. We tend to value it nonetheless
because we have a historical record by which to measure it. So my bias
is always toward something completely new that has come from the inside
out, something that invents more than reinvents. But I’m into certain
reinventions too. Plain old stardom — the way Stone pursues it in “La La
Land” — isn’t something we value as much in movies anymore. What we
value now is visible work. One of the many things I love about all the
fantastic film acting being done now is that some of these great
performers understand how invisible works, too.
