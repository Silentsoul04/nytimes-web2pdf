For those who want their fashion designers to be both creative and
political, Kerby Jean-Raymond is a case study.

The designer, who turned 30 last year, and founded his label in 2013,
first made waves with his spring 2016 show, which featured a short film
about race relations in the United States. Since then, he has [designed
T-shirts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/01/22/fashion/after-a-tragedy-like-the-charlie-hebdo-shooting-come-the-products.html)
that listed the names of victims of police brutality; [traveled to North
Dakota](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/18/fashion/erykah-badu-debut-new-york-fashion-week.html)
with supplies for the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters; and created a
collection that [explored the theme of economic
inequality](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/13/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-hood-by-air-altuzarra.html).

This season, Mr. Jean-Raymond drew inspiration from his father,
Jean-Claude Jean-Raymond, 59, who arrived in New York from Haiti in 1980
and who raised Kerby alone after his wife, Vania Moss-Pierre (Pyer Moss
is her namesake), died when his son was seven. The collection is titled
“My Father as I Remember, 1980-1999,” and is the first part of a
multiseason series called “Stories About My Parents.”

It is also a timely reminder of the importance of the melting pot in the

“My dad was always so strict that I was scared to speak to him,” Mr.
Jean-Raymond said recently, driving through East Flatbush, Brooklyn,
where he grew up. “Haitian parents are very, ‘This is adults’ business;
this is kids’ business.’”

At the apartment where his father has lived since 1982, Mr. Jean-Raymond
scrolled through his phone as Jean-Claude Jean-Raymond looked on. “He
randomly sent me these pictures on WhatsApp a few months ago and I
started designing my collection around them,” Mr. Jean-Raymond said,
scrolling through the messaging app. “It’s an ode to the cars that he
drove, the excessive amount of jewelry he
wore.”

“I grew up thinking my father was tacky,” Mr. Jean-Raymond said. “There
was no color coordination. It was whatever was cool. ‘These sweatpants
are cool. I’ll wear them with these shoes that are cool.’” Only recently
did Kerby begin to truly admire his father’s style. “He had less
inhibitions,” he said. “I wasn’t respectful of his swag then.”

When Jean-Claude Jean-Raymond would take Kerby and his stepbrother to a
store called Dr. Jay’s to buy new clothes for school, Kerby always ran
to the back. “My stepbrother would head for Phat Farm, FUBU, those
sections, and I would look for anything that was made in Italy,” he
said. “There wasn’t much to pick from. That kind of stuff they kept
behind the
counter.”

“I grew up in a different Flatbush,” Mr. Jean-Raymond added. “When we
went outside for recess there would be drug dealers in the yard. We used
to take milk crates and hang them on the fence to play basketball.”

His father said, “There was an area nearby called Vietnam,” referring to
a stretch of several blocks near Flatbush Avenue. “Day or night, you
couldn’t walk in this area. It was too dangerous. But the same area now,
there’s a Starbucks.”

“I never sold drugs,” Kerby Jean-Raymond said. “There were times when
gangs would approach me, but my father was way stronger than them. They
would come make threats and stuff, and I was like: ‘You don’t know the
opposition I’ve got upstairs. I’m not scared of
you.’”

He did, however, have a lifelong obsession with sneakers, financed
starting when he was 13 by an after-school job at a sneaker store on
Flatbush Avenue called Ragga Muffin (he told the hiring manager that he
was 15). “The way I was raised, you get a new pair of sneakers when the
old one gets messed up,” Mr. Jean-Raymond said. “But when I got to high
school, I started dating girls and trying to fit in, and I realized
everybody was collecting Jordans. When I would get my paychecks, I
wouldn’t even take money. I would just trade them for sneakers.”

“It’s completely different,” he said of today’s Ragga Muffin. Still, he
credited the place with inspiring his career path. Seeing the
less-than-high-quality pieces that sold while he worked there, he
thought to himself: “I can make something
better.”

Mr. Jean-Raymond had always been an impatient, antsy child, and to
channel his energy, his homeroom teacher at the High School of Fashion
Industries in Manhattan had him work as an intern with the designer Kay
Unger, who became a mentor.

Though he attended Hofstra University and earned a degree in business
law and entrepreneurship, he continued to freelance for Marc Jacobs,
Theory, Kenneth Cole and others, helping with showroom preparation,
draping and pattern making. Then came Pyer Moss, now based in
Manhattan’s garment
district.

Back at the office, Mr. Jean-Raymond went over several
pieces-in-progress with his team. “I’m taking classic cuts, but I’m
doing them in textures that remind me of him,” he said, referring to his
father. A bright silver, furry jacket lay on a table. Nearby was a sleek
tracksuit in black and purple, and a large leather jacket purposely left
unfinished. Also part of the collection: a hand-drawn patch featuring an
image of his father in his youth with his nickname, “Didi,” printed

He picked up a dark burgundy and black coat, inspired by a Maison
Margiela style his father wore when Mr. Jean-Raymond was a child, and
put it on. Maison Magiela and Yohji Yamamoto are the only two labels Mr.
Jean-Raymond now wears besides his
own.

suit and a Van Heusen shirt and brown corduroy pants.” He did not love
