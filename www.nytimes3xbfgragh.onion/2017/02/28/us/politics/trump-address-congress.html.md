WASHINGTON — President Trump, in his first address to a joint session of
Congress, defended his tumultuous presidency on Tuesday and said he was
eager to reach across party lines and put aside “trivial fights” to help
ordinary Americans.

He called on Congress to work with him on overhauling health care,
changing the tax code and rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure and
military.

But he raised new questions about his policy priorities and how he plans
to achieve them, especially on immigration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Only hours before his address, Mr. Trump had [broken from his tough
immigration
stance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/01/us/politics/trump-undocumented-immigrants.html)
in remarks at the White House, suggesting that legal status be granted
to millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed serious
crimes. Many of Mr. Trump’s core supporters had denounced that approach
as “amnesty” during the campaign.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in his speech, Mr. Trump never mentioned legalizing undocumented
people and over all held to the tough-on-immigration theme of his
campaign.

“The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is
compromise on both sides,” the president said at the White House,
according to people in attendance who asked for anonymity because they
were not authorized to speak about the meeting.

The idea is a sharp break from the crackdown on immigrants in the United
States illegally that Mr. Trump ordered in his first weeks in office and
the hard-line positions embraced by his core supporters that helped
sweep him into the White House.

But Mr. Trump made only a glancing reference to an immigration overhaul
in his speech, calling for a new “merit-based” system that would admit
only those able to support themselves financially. Over all he took a
hard line on immigration, much as he had during the
campaign.

## Trump’s Speech to Congress and Democrats’ Response: Video and Analysis

Times reporters analyzed President Trump’s address to Congress on
Tuesday and the Democrats’ response, which was delivered by former Gov.
Steve Beshear of Kentucky.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals
that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens,” Mr. Trump said.
“Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.”

But in contrast with the dark themes of his inaugural address, Mr.
Trump’s speech to Congress was a more optimistic vision of America and
what he called the promises ahead. The themes were largely Republican
orthodoxy, delivered soberly and almost verbatim from a prepared text.
Mr. Trump read from Teleprompters and appeared restrained and serious.

Republicans interrupted dozens of times with standing ovations, although
Democrats mostly sat stone-faced. Mr. Trump presented himself as eager
to put aside some of the vitriol of his presidency.

“The time for small thinking is over, the time for trivial fights is
behind us,” he said. “From now on, America will be empowered by our
aspirations, not burdened by our
fears.”

## Fact Check: Trump’s First Address to Congress

Reporters from The New York Times fact checked President Trump’s first
address to Congress.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The most emotional moment of the speech came when Mr. Trump recognized
Carryn Owens, the widow of William Ryan Owens, a member of a Navy SEAL
team who was killed during a commando raid that the president authorized
in Yemen. Ms. Owens sobbed as Mr. Trump said, “Ryan’s legacy is etched
into eternity.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump said that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had guaranteed him that
it was a “highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital
intelligence.” Mr. Trump has been criticized for the raid, including by
Mr. Owens’s father, with some arguing the operation was botched. Earlier
in the day, Mr. Trump had blamed Mr. Owens’s death on “the generals” who
oversaw the mission.

Although Mr. Trump’s presidency has been defined by executive orders and
pronouncements, his speech appeared to be an attempt to open a new phase
and reflected his need for cooperation from Congress.

“My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make
child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have
paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air
and clean water and rebuild our military infrastructure,” Mr. Trump
said.

## In Their Choice of Guests, Trump and Congressional Democrats Sent Dueling Messages

The issues represented by the guests of the first lady, Melania Trump,
as well as by representatives and senators at President Trump’s first
address to Congress.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president has yet to propose major legislation to achieve his goals,
with members of his cabinet and senior staff members divided over key
elements of tax and health plans, and congressional Republicans split on
how to structure them. By this point in his presidency, Mr. Obama had
established an active — if not always friendly — working relationship
with a Democratic Congress, having signed into law a [$787 billion
package of spending and tax
cuts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/projects/44th_president/stimulus)
intended to stabilize the economy.

Mr. Trump laid out the broad outlines of a health care overhaul that
papered over divisions among Republicans about how to structure it,
calling for a plan that uses tax credits and tax-advantaged savings
accounts to help Americans buy insurance, and promising a “stable
transition” from the existing system.

Yet he made no mention of an array of challenges abroad, including
Syria, North Korea and Russia. Nor did Mr. Trump criticize one of his
favorite foils, the “fake news” media. He did pledge his full support
for NATO after questioning the need for the alliance, and argued that
his demands that nations contribute more money to NATO had paid off.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I can tell you that the money is pouring in,” Mr. Trump said without
providing examples or specifics. “Very nice.”

Similarly, Mr. Trump offered no specifics on his suggestion earlier in
the day that he might seek a comprehensive immigration overhaul. Such a
move would be a significant turnaround for Mr. Trump, whose campaign
rallies rang with shouts of “build the wall\!” on the Mexican border. In
January, he signed an executive order directing the deportation of any
unauthorized immigrant who has committed a crime or falsified a
document. The standard could apply to virtually any of the estimated 11
million people in the country illegally.

In his comments to the television anchors at the White House, Mr. Trump
went so far as to raise the idea of granting citizenship to young
undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as
children, one person present said. Such a change would go well beyond
the temporary work permits President Barack Obama [offered them through
a 2012 executive
order](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/06/16/us/us-to-stop-deporting-some-illegal-immigrants.html).

During his campaign, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama’s directive as an
“illegal amnesty,” and promised to immediately end the program if
elected. But he has
[delayed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/26/us/politics/daca-dreamers-immigration-trump.html?_r=0)
acting on the matter since taking office and expressed sympathy for its
beneficiaries, sometimes known as Dreamers.

The White House did not dispute Mr. Trump’s remarks to the anchors, but
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, said she had not
witnessed the conversation and was therefore unable to confirm it.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The president has been very clear in his process that the immigration
system is broken and needs massive reform, and he’s made clear that he’s
open to having conversations about that moving forward,” Ms. Sanders
said. “Right now, his primary focus, as he has made over and over again,
is border control and security at the border and deporting criminals
from our country, and keeping our country safe, and those priorities
have not changed.”

The president’s remarks about immigration came as he prepares to issue a
new version of his [executive order banning travel to the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html)
from seven predominantly Muslim countries and suspending the acceptance
of refugees. The ban has been revised because of legal challenges.

Mr. Trump defended that order in his address to Congress.

“It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from
places where proper vetting cannot occur,” Mr. Trump said. “Those given
the high honor of admission to the United States should support this
country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead
of terrorism to form inside America — we cannot allow our nation to
become a sanctuary for extremists.”

The speech reflected the war Mr. Trump is fighting with himself and his
inner circle. Even as he held out the possibility of legal status for
millions of undocumented immigrants, Melania Trump, the first lady, was
hosting the families of victims of violent crime by such immigrants — a
way of highlighting the president’s belief that immigrants who lack
legal status pose a grave threat to Americans and should be feared and
removed, not embraced.

Mr. Trump singled out the victims’ families, saying, “Your loved ones
will never be forgotten.”

Giving the official Democratic response, former Gov. Steven L. Beshear
of Kentucky offered an implicit contrast to the president by noting his
own humble background and military service, accusing Mr. Trump and his
“cabinet of billionaires and Wall Street insiders” of favoring banks
and the wealthy over ordinary people.

“You and your Republican allies in Congress seem determined to rip
affordable health care away from millions of people who most need it,”
Mr. Beshear said. “This isn’t a game. It’s life and death for people.”

For Mr. Trump’s speech, the president turned to the top advisers who
helped develop his inaugural address: Stephen Miller, his senior policy
adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist. The two were still
working on the speech late Monday, aides said.

Mr. Miller and Mr. Bannon, both architects of the president’s tough
immigration policies, were responsible for shaping the dark themes of
the [president’s speech on Inauguration
Day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-presidency.html).
