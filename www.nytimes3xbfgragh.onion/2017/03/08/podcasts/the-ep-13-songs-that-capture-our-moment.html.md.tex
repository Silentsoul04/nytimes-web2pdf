What songs tell us where music is going? You can read 25 answers to that
question in the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/03/09/magazine/25-songs-that-tell-us-where-music-is-going.html}{second
annual Music Issue from The New York Times Magazine}.

Or you can listen --- and hear some of our favorite writers talk about
the songs and the stories that stuck with them this year. ``The EP''
weaves together conversation, commentary and music in one multitrack
collection. It's a window on how we listen to music --- and how we talk
to one another about it --- right now.

Some songs are the hits that seem to shout something important about our
culture. Others wormed their ways into writers' personal lives. And some
stand out because they come from artists we just can't help trying to
figure out a little better.

Along the way, you'll hear about everything from the year's hottest
vegan rap verse to the band that currently qualifies as the J.J. Abrams
of heavy metal.

You can find and subscribe to ``The EP'' wherever you listen to
podcasts.
