Conservatives have long complained that “I don’t recognize my country
anymore.” In Trump’s America, though, it’s liberals who see something
insufficiently, well, American. Issues once assumed to be settled — the
desirability of racial tolerance, a general preference for democratic
processes — now appear, suddenly and ominously, to be up for debate. For
many, this has created a sense of rupture, a disconnect between what
they had assumed would be happening at this moment in history and what
is actually taking place — as if the 2016 election shifted the nation
into some dystopian reality that was never meant to be.

This, at least, is the feeling reflected in the growing popularity of a
word once used to browbeat liberals and leftists. Today’s White House,
according to Trump’s critics, is not only wrongheaded or meanspirited
but “un-American.”

“America is a nation of immigrants,” Bruce Springsteen
[declared](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-slams-trump-america-is-a-nation-of-immigrants-w463952)
from a stage in Australia in the wake of Trump’s first travel ban. “And
we find this antidemocratic and fundamentally un-American.” When the
White House introduced a revised version of the order earlier this
month, the newly chosen Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom
Perez, warned that “this ban on Muslims is just as dangerous and
un-American as the last one.” Others have invoked the word to assail the
president’s name-calling, attacks on judges and contempt for the media.
“This White House does not seem to value an independent press,” CNN’s
[Jake Tapper
declared](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/24/politics/jake-tapper-white-house-trump-unamerican-cnntv/index.html)
last month. “There is a word for that line of thinking. The word is
un-American.”

This line of attack remains just as popular on the right, and Trump
staff members have been quick to use it. On the day after Trump’s speech
to Congress, Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to the president,
called for unwavering support of the president’s initiatives on behalf
of “immigration crime” victims: “If you object to that, you are in favor
of pain, in favor of tragedy and in favor of chaos,” he told one
interviewer, “and that is un-American.” The president himself has joined
in, too. “The real scandal here is that classified information is
illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy,” he tweeted in
mid-February, responding to accusations about his campaign’s ties to
Russia. “Very un-American\!”

The charge can come across as an empty one, ready to be attached to any
given outrage. But its re-emergence reflects something far more serious
about the state of national discourse. On the surface, “un-American”
implies consensus: It carries a punch only when everybody agrees what
“American” is. But the word has historically gained traction at
moments when national consensus seems the most wobbly and uncertain. It
signals an urgent desire to find something — anything — that Americans
can still agree
on.

For Trump’s critics, it is aspirational, pointing toward an American
dream of liberty and equality that has never quite been realized on the
ground. For the administration, the word is a way of designating
insiders and outsiders, the righteous and the nonrighteous, those who
deserve the privileges of citizenship and those who do not. Coming from
the White House, it also carries an implied threat: Those who are
“un-American” — leakers, critics, reporters — may need to be dealt
with as “enemies of the people,” another worrisome Trump phrase.

To label something “un-American” is to imagine America as it should have
been or as it might yet be but not as it ever was. Far from bringing
back a meaningless insult, the revival of the charge suggests that
something very big is now at stake: not only the direction of federal
policy or the partisan balance of power but America’s identity as a
nation.

**In his farewell** speech, Barack Obama paid homage to “the beating
heart of our American idea,” describing how the promise of “freedom to
chase our individual dreams” has long inspired the nation’s citizens.
This notion — that America is not simply another nation-state but an
“idea” — is *itself* the big American idea, the “beating heart” of
what’s known as American exceptionalism. It’s what allows Americans to
label certain things un-American even when those things have existed for
centuries within the territorial boundaries of the United States.
“America is capable of being un-American,” lamented Richard Cahan, one
of the authors of a recent book on Japanese internment — a seemingly
absurd claim but, within the exceptionalist tradition, an entirely
plausible one.

Americans have been denouncing each other in this manner almost since
the dawn of the republic. By the early 20th century, the accusation
encompassed a vast and incoherent range of political convictions.
“Americans are very fond of classing as un-American anything they
don’t like,” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch complained in 1909, ticking
off tariffs and trusts, prohibition and social drinking, boycotts and
“the intimidation of workingmen” as just a few of the positions
declared “un-American” by their opponents.

The First World War only raised the stakes of this rhetorical clash. In
an attempt to mobilize a divided country, President Woodrow Wilson
called for “100 percent Americanism,” effectively marginalizing anyone
not 100 percent on board with the war effort — including thousands of
German immigrants (whose noncitizenship made them candidates for
internment) and antiwar dissenters like the Socialist leader Eugene Debs
(who was sentenced to 10 years in prison under Wilson’s new Espionage
Act). After the war, the impulse to enforce “Americanism” helped to
justify deportation raids and the rapid growth of the Ku Klux Klan. By
1924, the same impulse had yielded the nation’s first comprehensive
immigration law, which largely banned immigrants from Asia, Africa and
the Middle East and restricted entry from the heavily Catholic and
Jewish countries of southern and eastern Europe.

Throughout these years, the burgeoning civil liberties movement clung to
“un-American” as a useful critique, insisting that restrictive speech
and immigration laws violated essential American principles. By the
1930s, though, “un-American” had begun to harden as a language of
repression, not resistance. In 1938, the House of Representatives
created its infamous Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). After
brief forays into investigating domestic fascism, the committee focused
almost exclusively on American communists, deemed dangerous both for
their suspected ties to the Soviet Union and for their “un-American”
ideas about labor rights and racial
equality.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The committee did target a few suspected spies, but HUAC’s tribunals
served primarily to decimate the American left, creating an atmosphere
in which communists and noncommunists alike feared expressing their
political opinions. Even at the height of this conflict, though, a few
dissenters held on to an alternate view. By 1948, one F.B.I. memo noted,
some Americans were starting to see “the House Committee on Un-American
Activities as being un-American, itself.”

For today’s Democratic leadership, this viewpoint appears to hold
considerable appeal. In her now-notorious 2013 speech at Goldman Sachs,
Hillary Clinton warned against demagogues who “play on people’s fears”
to promote their “backward-looking” agenda. “They have to be rejected,”
she declared, “because they are fundamentally un-American.” Two years
later, Obama made a speech championing the children of undocumented
immigrants: “When I hear folks talking as if somehow these kids are
different than my kids or less worthy in the eyes of God, that somehow
they are less worthy of our respect and consideration and care, I think
that’s un-American,” he said. “I think we should do better, because
that’s how America was made.”

The problem, of course, is that this is *not* how America was made. As a
point of strategy, it may behoove Democrats to embrace patriotic or
nationalistic language — to insist that there is more than one way to
make America great. As a matter of history, however, this tends to
obscure the bitter and enduring conflicts of the past. During election
season, many Democrats apparently believed their own story, assuming
that Americans were too dedicated to the expansion of liberty to elect
Donald Trump. His victory is a reminder that, despite the country’s
fondness for aspirational rhetoric, our illiberal traditions have
serious staying power, too.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Today’s Republicans seem to recognize this perfectly well. In the past
three years, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has praised the 1924
immigration act as a matter of national self-preservation. Newt Gingrich
has [called for a
revival](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/newt-gingrich-house-un-american-activities-committee/)
of HUAC to contend with ISIS sympathizers. And the Ku Klux Klan and
American fascist movements have experienced levels of attention and
influence not seen since before World War II. Trump complains that he is
being subjected to “witch hunts” and “McCarthyism” but has advocated
policies — like a “registry” for Muslims — that hark back to the
list-making and name-naming of the HUAC era.

For the president’s opponents, it may be comforting to believe that such
policies are un-American. But as the editors of The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch noted more than a century ago, “the things we hurry to
denounce as un-American” are often “peculiarly and distinctly American.”

“A better and broader view,” they concluded, “seems to be that these
problems are of our own creation, and are to be solved only by
ourselves.”
