``Find out why your resting heart rate is so high in the first place,''
says Dr. John Elefteriades, who directs the Aortic Institute at Yale
University. Someone struggling with heart or lung problems, for example,
will have an elevated pulse that needs to be corrected immediately with
medicine. But even with no serious health problems, lowering the number
of times your heart beats in a minute can decrease its burden. Once you
determine your resting heart rate by making several measurements ---
count the beats for 30 seconds, then double that number --- start
exercising regularly for a long period of time. ``If you're a couch
potato, your pulse rate might go up just by doing normal activities,''
Elefteriades says.

``For someone who is not inclined toward exercise, just walking is
great,'' he says. Walk one to two miles, five times a week, or bike
three times as far as you would walk or run. In addition to reducing
your resting heart rate, such exercise will improve the efficiency with
which your heart pumps blood to various bodily tissues. But don't overdo
the workouts. ``Endurance athletes use lowering heart rates as a badge
of honor, which is not necessarily a good thing,'' Elefteriades says,
adding that the heart wasn't made to operate for much more than one hour
in a high aerobic state.

A temporarily elevated pulse caused by panic attacks, anxiety or sudden
heart palpitations can affect resting heart rates. To relax your heart,
try the Valsalva maneuver: ``Quickly bear down as if you are having a
bowel movement,'' Elefteriades says. ``Close your mouth and nose and
raise the pressure in your chest, like you're stifling a sneeze.''
Breathe in for 5-8 seconds, hold that breath for 3-5 seconds, then
exhale slowly. Repeat several times. Raising your aortic pressure in
this way will lower your heart rate. Yoga, meditation and other
relaxation techniques also provide relief. Chronic stress, which can
lead to an overactive sympathetic nervous system (the one that produces
flight-or-fight reactions), can be detrimental over decades. ``If the
rapid heart rate is related to anxiety,'' Elefteriades says, ``treat the
anxiety.''
