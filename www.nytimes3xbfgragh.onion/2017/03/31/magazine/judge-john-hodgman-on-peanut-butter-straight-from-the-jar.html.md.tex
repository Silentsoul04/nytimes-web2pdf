\textbf{Olivia writes:} \emph{I leave a jar of peanut butter at my
office and often eat a spoonful (or several) when I am too lazy to pack
lunch. My fiancé badgers me, saying that it is ``not sufficient in
nutrients or volume.'' I eat a well-rounded diet otherwise. Please order
him to stop making fun of my lunch choices.}

Your fiancé is being very kind to throw nutrition-themed shade at you
for a practice that is, simply, gross. Do you think your judge has not
eaten peanut butter straight from the jar with a spoon? Of course I
have, but only alone, my shame cloaked by night, after cocktails. It is
one of the most delicious transgressions in the world, but not something
your co-workers need to see. And because you're keeping your stash at
the office, I guarantee your jar has long ago been breached by other
tongues. Buy some crackers.
