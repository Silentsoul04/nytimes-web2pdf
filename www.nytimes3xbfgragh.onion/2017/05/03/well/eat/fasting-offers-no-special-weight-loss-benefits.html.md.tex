Alternate-day fasting has gained some popularity as a weight-loss
technique, but a rigorous trial has found that it works no better than
ordinary calorie restriction.

Researchers randomized 100 overweight and obese people to one of three
groups: alternate-day fasting; a diet restricted to 75 percent of
regular daily energy intake; and a control group that followed their
usual eating plan. The researchers tracked calorie intake, and all
participants were generally healthy at the start of the study.

At six months, both the fasting and the calorie restricted groups had
lost 6.8 percent of their weight. By one year, the fasting group was
down 6 percent, and the calorie restriction group 5.3 percent. In other
words, there was no statistically significant difference between the two
diets. The alternate-day fasting group had the highest dropout rate: 38
percent dropped out of the study, compared with 29 percent for the
calorie restriction group and 26 percent for the controls.

There was no significant difference between the groups in the reduction
of cardiovascular risk factors like blood pressure, cholesterol or
triglycerides. The
\href{http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2623528}{study
is in JAMA Internal Medicine}.

The senior author, Krista A. Varady, an associate professor of nutrition
at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said that while fasting is not
for everyone, it could be worth a try.

In any case, she added, ``There's nothing magical here. We're tricking
people into eating less food, in different ways.''
