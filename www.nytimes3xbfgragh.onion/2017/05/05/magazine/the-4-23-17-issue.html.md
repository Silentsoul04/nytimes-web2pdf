**RE: THE CLIMATE ISSUE**

*The April 23 issue focused on how people will adapt to our changing
environment. Jon Gertner wrote about*
[*geoengineering*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/18/magazine/is-it-ok-to-engineer-the-environment-to-fight-climate-change.html)
*and the attempt to intentionally alter the environment in order to
fight climate change, and Jon Mooallem wrote about how the* [*future is
already
here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/19/magazine/our-climate-future-is-actually-our-climate-present.html)*.*

**Your climate issue** is very sobering. We have the information we need
to tackle the existential challenge of climate change. What we don’t
know is if we have the will to make sure that the most severe effects of
climate change don’t permanently damage society. As important as
individual actions are, only collective action will save us from
ourselves. *Edwin Andrews, Malden,
Mass.*

**Honestly, at this point,** what have we got to lose? The situation is
already on the brink of hopeless. We need geoengineering as a stopgap.
Preliminary research can minimize the risks. If this can be done for a
billion dollars per year, there is nothing else we can do for so little
cost, and we are too collectively stupid to make the investments needed
to produce an optimal solution. We’d much rather spend our money on
preparing to fight with each other, and we are not good at optimal,
complex solutions. We’re much more likely to have at least some success
with simple and cheap.

Further, we still have some 4 billion people to add to our population
this century. Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases tomorrow, our
climate would continue to warm until a new equilibrium is reached. This
is referred to as committed warming. As the article points out, the
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now is equal to the amount 3
million years ago when camels roamed above the Arctic Circle. Yet we are
far from done mining carbon from the earth’s crust and pumping it into
the atmosphere. Without geoengineering, the best we can do in the
process of converting to renewable energy sources is slow down warming
somewhat, but that is not nearly enough. *Michael Rodriguez, Corvallis,
Ore.*

**Jon Mooallem’s essay** is reminiscent to me of Azar Nafisi’s “Reading
Lolita in Tehran,” where she highlights the intricacies of obtaining
freedom. That sense of knowing something bigger and better might be
there, but also of being unable to observe the hole left over in the
space it once occupied. It is only a hole in the minds of those who held
it, but since there is no hole in reality, newer humans move on.

Elizabeth Kolbert touched on this idea, too, in “The Sixth Extinction,”
where she is visiting the reef at One Tree Island, being simultaneously
aware of the vastness of the ocean before her but also that that feeling
is what tricks us into complacency, of feeling that we are alone and
ineffective, when in fact we are so numerous as to be a scourge on the
earth.

We must live in the reality we inhabit. We must refuse to look away from
what we know of the past through our own experience but also through the
accounts of those who came before us. We must acknowledge our collective
wrongs and each take responsibility for more than our part. If we fail,
we condemn ourselves to our own future (and present) condemnations.
*Melanie H.,
Chicago*

**In 2009, researchers** from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment
Agency and elsewhere published their projections of the greenhouse gas
consequences if humanity came to eat less meat, no meat or no animal
products at all. The researchers calculated that a no-animal-product
diet could produce a cumulative reduction in 2010 to 2050 of carbon
dioxide to 17 percent, methane emissions to 24 percent and nitrous oxide
emissions to 21 percent. What’s more, the researchers found that these
gains would be achieved at a much lower cost than a purely
energy-focused intervention involving carbon taxes and renewable energy
technology.

To dedicate an entire magazine to climate change without providing
readers who may want to do something effective to combat it with a
simple change in diet is a grave missed opportunity. That meat recipe in
the Eat column could have been replaced with one for the heart-healthy,
environmentally friendly lentil. *Claire Stadtmueller, New York*
