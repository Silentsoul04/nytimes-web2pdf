*In Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books.
This week, Francine Prose and Thomas Mallon suggest reading that suits
the current moment and tells us what we can expect from it.*

**By Francine Prose**

*Jane Mayer’s “Dark Money” explores the roots of the intense class
divisions and gross inequalities that beset
us.*

Jane Mayer’s harrowing “Dark Money” should be required reading for
anyone who wants to know how our country got into the mess we’re in.
Mayer shows how the intense class divisions and gross inequalities that
beset us now were neither inevitable nor accidental, but carefully
orchestrated by a handful of billionaires determined to transform the
United States into a cash machine from which only the wealthiest
citizens could withdraw.

Beginning in the 1970s, alarmed by Richard Nixon’s tough new
restrictions aimed at protecting the environment, these oil, banking and
industrial moguls spent fortunes working behind the scenes, fighting
against anything that would increase their costs or decrease their
profits. Perhaps the most famous of these Wizard of Oz-like figures are
Charles and David Koch, but there are others (among them the family of
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos) whose stories Mayer tells: tycoons
who silenced whistle-blowers, intimidated rivals, sued and blackmailed
their own siblings, and whose plans for us involved polluting our air
and water, lowering taxes for the wealthy, and drastically decreasing
the amount we spend on education, health and welfare. To implement their
agenda, they started foundations, think tanks and university programs;
they financed libertarian political campaigns and the Tea Party
movement, all the while using these “charitable” donations as loopholes
to avoid paying taxes. According to Mayer, President Obama never stood
much of a chance against the power of his opponents’ money,
determination and resistance — and their untiring and ultimately
successful efforts to turn the Republican Party into the “party of no.”

Greed isn’t pretty, and “Dark Money” won’t make you feel differently
about the deadly sin that is currently ruling our society. But the book
answers some questions. In its final paragraph David Koch tells us
everything we need to know about what motivates him and others like him.
When, as a child, he was asked to share a treat, he would say, “I just
want my fair share — which is all of it.”

If “Dark Money” confirms our suspicions about the past and the present,
Nadezhda Mandelstam’s “Hope Against Hope” — a memoir about what she and
her husband, the great poet Osip Mandelstam, endured during the worst
years of Stalin’s regime — reflects our darkest fears about a possible
future. And yet, despite the terror and suffering it describes, I am
always heartened and consoled by the beauty and intelligence with which
Mandelstam tells us how a group of decent, resourceful, gifted and
complicated human beings braved a terrible era.

Having written a poem comparing Stalin’s fingers to fat grubs, Osip was
arrested by the despot, who (as seems typical of despots) had no sense
of humor and appears to have been particularly offended by the line
about his fingers. Nadezhda had a prodigious memory, and her book is
full of sharply observed moments: We see the poet Anna Akhmatova
insisting that Osip, on his way to prison, eat the egg (a great delicacy
in those days) that the Mandelstams have procured and prepared for her,
in honor of her visit. Dense and detailed, the book tells us what it was
like to cope with the lack of basic necessities and to live under a
dictatorship: learning to lie, watching every word, discovering who can
and cannot be trusted, struggling to preserve one’s dignity. And
everywhere are astute and moving observations about poetry, love and
life.

One more book I might add: For those days when you feel the need to take
a break, to experience a different time and place, to take the kind of
vacation from reality that only a great book can provide, pick up
Charles Dickens’s “David Copperfield.” Read the first sentence, then the
second. See what happens next. At this current moment, perhaps even more
than most, there’s a great deal to be said for literature as a passport,
as an inexpensive, trustworthy and temporary means of escape.

Richard Nixon’s
presidency.*

Trump-Nixon comparisons are in vogue, and any consideration of them
requires “The Haldeman Diaries,” the indispensable narrative that
Richard Nixon’s chief of staff, Harry Robbins (H. R.) Haldeman, began
keeping on Jan. 18, 1969, two days before the start of a presidency
distinguished by bold foreign overtures; beset by Vietnam and domestic
dissent; and destroyed, finally, by Watergate. Haldeman switched from
handwriting the diaries to taping them late in 1970, only months before
the White House, interested in better record-keeping, began taping
itself.

As Nixon’s “lord high executioner,” Haldeman presented a public image as
unyielding as his brush cut. While hardly literary, his chronicle of
“the P” displays keen and constant powers of observation. The book is
in some ways *Nixon’s* diary, presented in the third person, with
Haldeman acting as superego to the president’s id, preserving the boss’s
utterances with the fidelity of a Boswell or an Eckermann. Haldeman
showcases the chief executive’s lack of proportion and tendency to go on
“talking for hours,” occasionally “in one of his sort of mystic moods”
but more often just profanely bitching.

Nixon seeks to create for himself a personal “mystique,” a spooky
charisma that will wean the public from its memory of John F. Kennedy’s
glamour and flash: “The P made the point that in describing Nixon you
have to make the point that he’s always like the iceberg, you see only
the tip.” But if he can be “cool, tough, firm and totally in command”
during a crisis (Haldeman’s own view of him), Nixon remains, day to day,
painfully maladroit with other people. The chief of staff shrewdly
monitors his psychology. When a reporter describes one presidential
statement as having been “bitter,” Nixon descends into an angry mood
that Haldeman deconstructs: “I think he knows it was bitter and thus
doubly resents it.” In May 1970, when the P ventures out to the Lincoln
Memorial around dawn, to talk with young antiwar protesters, Haldeman
writes: “I am concerned about his condition.” Seven months later, Nixon
decides (not uninterestingly) “that the major effect of the youth
revolution is its effect on parents and their guilt complexes.”

The days grind on with problems and personalities that never seem to
evolve. How can the White House best deploy the quotable and incendiary
Vice President Spiro Agnew? Will Henry Kissinger, the national security
adviser, and William Rogers, the secretary of state, ever stop
complaining about each other? Haldeman curates the administration’s
flamboyant gestures (P “ordered me to have ‘Portnoy’s Complaint’ …
removed from White House library”); its small screw-ups (“P launched his
Indian message with meeting with Taos tribe. No one mentioned the whole
deal would have to be translated”); its daily little lies (“The Apollo
shot was this morning; the P slept through it, but we put out an
announcement that he had watched it with great interest”).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Take Haldeman’s book down from the shelf in the spring of 2017, and
correspondences will abound: “The P said that he thought he was the only
man who could be P.” *(I alone can fix it.)* Nixon sees himself leading
a movement of “forgotten minorities” (white ethnics) that is bigger and
more important than the Republican Party. The press and the
establishment are despised, and even a form of the Deep State excites
worry: “Were the Camp David phones tapped for the Defense Department?”
Haldeman wonders in a note to his text.

Comforting? *Plus ça change?* Maybe. But such flashes of recognition,
however plentiful, remain incidental. There are really no political
precedents for the way we have to live now. In 1974, a drifting ship of
state foundered on the gifted, garrulous iceberg that was Nixon himself.
Today we are steered by a bellowing captain who has never looked beneath
the surface of anything. Is someone, after coming home from the White
House each night, secretly logging the voyage toward the crash?

“Fellow Travelers” and “Watergate,” a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner
