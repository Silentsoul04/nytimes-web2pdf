\begin{quote}
```As I was saying,' she picked up naturally, `I is a woman who don't
put no trust in carry-go-bring-come news.'''

From Kei Miller's ``Augustown'' (Pantheon, 2017, Page 65), the latest
novel from the Jamaican-born writer and poet.
\end{quote}

In Jamaica, in 1920, something unbelievable is happening: A preacher has
started to fly. The news has spread across the island, where it is
accepted or disputed, cheered or mocked, depending on the audience
receiving it. Believers are full of hope; elites are threatened;
revolution is in the air.

The sentence above is spoken by a woman who has traveled a long distance
to see the supposed miracle for herself. It is happening in Augustown, a
desperately poor community (the novel's main character becomes blind
after her ceiling collapses under the weight of rats) where the King's
English does not rule; everyone speaks in patois. Hence the conjugation
``I is,'' the double negative ``don't put no trust'' --- and, best of
all, the wonderful idiom ``carry-go-bring-come,'' in which four verbs
are welded together by hyphens, Voltron-style, to form a single,
powerful adjective.

``Carry-go-bring-come news'' means, simply, gossip: information that has
moved, busily, from its source at the original event to curious eyes and
ears somewhere in the distance. The phrase contains deep skepticism. How
do we know things? What counts as --- to use the contemporary American
vernacular --- ``fake news?''

This is one of the basic functions of the institution of journalism,
with its fact checkers and house styles and ombudsmen: to convince
people that our carry-go-bring-come news is at least as accurate as
eyewitness reports. It is, in some ways, an unnatural trust, built over
decades and centuries --- a technology as artificial as irrigation, and
every bit as necessary. Trust is valuable; it is expensive. And
expensive things are liable to be stolen.
