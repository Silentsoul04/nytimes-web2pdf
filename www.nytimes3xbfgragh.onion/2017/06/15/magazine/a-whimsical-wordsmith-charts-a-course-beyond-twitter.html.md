<div class="css-53u6y8">

<span class="css-ggqk20 ethc9we0">**T**</span>here are a few things we
should clear up about the Twitter humorist known as “jomny sun.”
Although sun’s Twitter bio describes him as an “aliebn confuesed abot
humamn lamgauge,” and his avatar is a line drawing of a smiling alien in
a T-shirt, he is, in fact, a real person, and that really is his name.
Also, he knows how to spell.

Twitter is layered with niche and broadly popular humor accounts with
handles like @woodmuffin, @pixelatedboat and @weedhitler. Many of Sun’s
half-million followers can be forgiven for assuming that, even
correcting for typos, “[Jonny
Sun](https://twitter.com/jonnysun "Twitter account")” is a nom de tweet.
“I’m fortunate that my name sounds like a fake name,” Sun says.

The [jokes Sun tweets](https://www.jomnysun.com/ "Website") are
sometimes absurd, sometimes clever, often both. They wouldn’t
necessarily kill at the Laugh Factory, but Sun’s Twitter account offers
comfort, whimsy and an alternative to the
rage/panic/schadenfreude/political flame-warring of much online
discourse.

> on earth: a magiciam puts his hand in his hat  
> in the rabbit realm: The Hand emerges. it is time. the rabit council
> must chose a sacrifice
> 
> LIFE HACK: give ur next child a normal name  
> ME: are u still mad that ur mother and i named u Life Hack

And many of the tweets are not jokes at all — they’re unironically
joyful and lonely, a little bit bewildered by humanity and terminally
confused about English spelling.

> look. life is bad. evryones sad. we’re all gona die. but i alredy
> bought this inflatable boumcy castle so r u gona take ur shoes off or
> wat

Sun’s recipe of amusement tinged with melancholy has won him the fandom
of big names in comedy and entertainment. The comedian Will Arnett told
me, “I just latched onto his particular brand of — it’s not just humor
but, beneath the surface, a very resonating life lesson.” When
Lin-Manuel Miranda first met Sun backstage at “Hamilton,” he joyously
tweeted: “I met JOMNY SUN\! It’s a goob night\!” Sun frequently
converses with Miranda and Mara Wilson; he’ll chat with Arnett, Patton
Oswalt and Joss Whedon and has become close with an array of Twitter and
YouTube stars.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Sun’s most devoted following probably skews younger. A certain kind
of jomny sun tweet makes a perfect high-school-yearbook quote, and Sun’s
Twitter feed has overflowed with fans posting yearbook pages, often
noting that some yearbook staff member corrected Sun’s wayward spelling.
At Sun’s few public appearances, young fans have brought printouts of
his tweets for him to sign. Some of his most popular tweets aim for a
kind of resonant mystery without attempting a punch line. These have
inspired fans to create drawings, paintings and hand-glazed coffee mugs,
to say nothing of tattoos. One tweet, in particular, has birthed a fair
number of inky astronauts floating across a sidereal
arm.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The minor-key wonder of such tweets belies a more ambitious agenda. Sun,
like many young artists who have earned an audience through tireless
production on social media, is trying to figure out how that material
translates to other realms: in his case, playwriting, hip-hop, a spec
script for TV and, this month, the publication of his first book, an
illustrated story based loosely on his Twitter feed: “everyone’s a
aliebn when ur a aliebn too.”

At the same time, as a [Ph.D. student in urban studies at
M.I.T.](http://www.jonathan-sun.com/), he is trying to understand, in a
more objective way, the communities that social media fosters. His
research focuses on the question of how Twitter and YouTube and
Instagram stars (or viral content from nonstars) influence the broader
world — how meaning is made online and how it spreads, changes the news
or culture and is itself altered as it spreads. As one popular Twitter
comedian remarked about him, “he’s like jane goodall and we’re the
apes.”

**On a bright day** in late February, I met Sun, now 27, at a coffee
shop in Brooklyn. He was dressed casually but crisply, tortoiseshell
glasses framing his face and a giant analog watch devouring his right
wrist. He didn’t appear to be wearing socks. Sun greeted me warmly. “I
sometimes get really intense social anxiety, so it’s difficult for me to
get to know someone in person,” he revealed, but he has a generous laugh
that puts people at ease.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sun had just emerged from the “cave” of finishing the book’s
illustrations. He spent a year completing 180 drawings, pen on vellum,
and managed to damage his shoulder in the process. It was his attempt to
bring a sensibility reminiscent of some of his favorite
writer-illustrators — Bill Watterson of “Calvin and Hobbes,” Shel
Silverstein, Maurice Sendak — into the social-media age. In the book, an
alien comes to Earth and encounters animals and trees, which he assumes
are people. There is an otter that spouts art theory. An egg enduring an
existential crisis. A melancholic tree. A bee who offers therapy to a
bear. The story lines intersect, vanish, reappear.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sun explains, “It’s supposed to read like the experience of joining
Twitter and following a bunch of people and seeing all their tweets on
your timeline.” The animals are deliberately cute, rendered in an
unadorned style. Sun thinks of them as icons — or avatars — and compares
them to the people we view on social media. “You don’t necessarily
engage with a tweet the same way you’d engage with a real person,” he
says. “Twitter is often thought of as a shallow, superficial thing. In
reality, there’s a lot of honest pathos and humanity in it.”

When Sun first started paying attention to Twitter, in 2011, he followed
several professional comedians but quickly grew bored with their
self-promotion. Then he stumbled on a demimonde that has come to be
known as Weird Twitter. “It was funny in a way I didn’t know you could
be funny,” Sun told me. These loosely affiliated, offbeat miniaturists
were sending up the format of traditional jokes by undercutting the
expectation of a punch line, using textual elements (odd spacing,
spelling, punctuation), creating tiny scripts or warping grammar to
comedic ends. Sun began responding to their jokes, and then writing his
own. Weird Twitter began to retweet him; he was weird by association,
and then by commission. Now his account has far more followers than many
of the humorists he admired — often by a factor of 10.

“Part of my working theory on comedy — and maybe just all art — is that
it’s supposed to feel like an inside joke, but you’re supposed to try to
get everyone to feel like they’re in on the inside joke,” he said. One
feature of humor on Twitter is how little is typically known of the
author. The platform opens the door for a lot of chilling, dispiriting,
consequence-free vitriol, but it also removes some of the preliminary
gatekeepers to reaching an audience. If you’re consistently funny,
you’re consistently funny. People will share what you write. “You
can’t talk about humor online without talking about underrepresented
communities,” Sun says.

Twitter offered an alternative route for Sun, who is Asian, to catch the
eye of traditional media, just as it has for many others. Professional
comedy writing has long been a white-male preserve, but Twitter has
helped quite a few people who don’t fit that mold — people like Megan
Amram, Shelby Fero and Demi Adejuyigbe — to gain admission to the club.
“With Asian-American representation,” Sun says, “we still aren’t at
the level where we have that many people to look up to yet. Someone
tweeted me and said, ‘When I found out you were Asian, I started crying,
because I’d never seen anyone like that doing what you do.’ ”

Fans like Lin-Manuel Miranda admire what Sun has done. “Establishing a
distinctive worldview, an indelible character, and adapting his voice to
the world as it unfolds on Twitter: That’s *a lot* to accomplish in 140
characters,” Miranda told me. Another well-known Twitter comedian, known
simply as @darth, told me over chat that jomny sun “just makes reading
twitter bearable. ... all the terrible news and then an aliebn.”

Sun has his share of dissenters too. There is a fine line in comedy — in
writing, in art — between voice and tic. One Weird Twitter stalwart
publicly wondered how “that Jonny Sun guy” could post something like
“fimding a melen :)” and get thousands of retweets. Another comedian
with a popular Twitter account lampooned Sun’s sensibility:

> doctor: sir ur dying  
> jomny sun: flowmers are beautifel n we shld kiss all the cloumds

Sun is aware of the limits of this tactic, but as he points out, Twitter
is a very crowded room in which to be heard. “When you see the
‘gimmicky’ stuff online,” he told me, “it’s not necessarily a
gimmick, it’s just something with a strong voice that cuts through
everything else.” But the voice that holds your attention on social
media can sound like shouting in an empty room when it has to carry a
book or a TV show. (See “$\#\*\! My Dad Says.”) “That’s the balance to
strike,” Sun acknowledges.

**Sun’s parents are** medical researchers who emigrated from China to
Calgary in the 1980s. “I think my feelings of being an outsider and not
being able to connect — those come down to me as an Asian-Canadian and
not really feeling at home anywhere,” Sun told me. The family moved to
Toronto when Sun was 11, which offered a more cosmopolitan environment.
Still, Sun remained socially anxious and awkward. By the time he got to
high school, he felt virtually invisible. He evaporated in groups, never
spoke in class. But after school, everyone got on MSN Chat, and it was
as if his high school recreated itself online. Here he felt liberated.
People who would walk past him without acknowledgment seemed to enjoy
his personality. “I was able to be funny and natural through the
keyboard and awkward and quiet and weird in person,” he told me. “I
wonder how many writers of this generation figured out how to write
through chat.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In an effort to change his fate, Sun enrolled in drama class. Acting and
hanging around actors gave him “permission to perform the way you wish
you could be.” He began reading drama too — he gravitated to the short,
comic plays of David Ives and fell in love with the work of the Irish
playwright Martin McDonagh, as well as with Beckett and the theater of
the absurd. But that path appeared to end with high school. “My parents
wanted me to do something that would offer more stability,” he says. “I
was good at math.”

He enrolled at the University of Toronto’s engineering school, but after
graduation, looking to wed his technical skills to more creative
pursuits, Sun went to the Yale School of Architecture. “His drawings had
a very distinct sensibility — more Marimekko than Michelangelo,” Sunil
Bald, one of his professors there, says. “There was an obvious interest
in cities over buildings, patterns over singular figures.”

It was in architecture school that he began a regimen of tweeting at
least one joke every day. It became a new discipline, a way to keep his
comedy brain sharp, almost an obsession. He also took classes in
playwriting at Yale’s drama school. One of his plays, a sort of “No
Exit” with zombies, was produced in Toronto last fall. Another, “Fried
Mussels,” captured the imagination of Taylor Norton, a theater director
and independent producer who had fallen in love with the voice of Sun’s
tweets and brought him to New York for a table read. “Fried Mussels”
involves three pairs of characters at a diner, all engaged in somewhat
archetypal, emotionally charged situations. Their dialogue cascades down
the page in three separate columns, which makes reading the play
something of a choose-your-own-adventure
experience.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At the table reading, the actors got lost several times, distracted by
others’ lines. But there were moments of harmony, when a single word
echoed through the room, and there were intense chords of dialogue when
everyone seemed to speak at once, impossible to follow but still
carrying meaning.

**Not long ago,** Sun was invited to the wedding of two people he had
never met. The couple had found each other online through their shared
loved of jomny son tweets. As Sun sees it, social-media platforms are
like urban landscapes, in which popular accounts function almost like
landmarks. They are spaces where people go to interact and encounter one
another; people imbue them with meaning and, over time, a shared
history.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sun has made fruitful use of such connections with “landmarks” in his
collaboration with Susan Benesch at the Berkman Klein Center for
Internet and Society at Harvard. They make an interesting pair. Sun’s
research looks at how online communities form and then develop rules of
engagement. Benesch, 53, is an expert in human rights law and the
founder of the Dangerous Speech Project; she is working to identify
examples of “counterspeech” on social media — some of which researchers
call “golden conversations,” in which responses to “dangerous” or
venomous speech can help change someone’s mind or means of expression.
Humor seems to be a promising avenue.

At M.I.T., over the spring semester, Sun, Benesch and colleagues
interviewed a diverse roster of activists, podcasters, YouTubers, Vine
comedians and others, like a TV writer whose joke tweet helped inspire
the Tax March in April. But the most popular conversation was with Matt
Nelson, a student at Campbell University in North Carolina, whose
Twitter account WeRateDogs — the handle is @dog\_rates — boasts more
than two million followers. Students filled an auditorium at M.I.T.’s
Media Lab, and 55,000 people watched a video stream of the conversation
online.

WeRateDogs is not exactly edgy. With gently funny captions, the account
does what it promises: It rates pictures of cute dogs, referred to as
“doggos” or “puppers.” All dogs get high scores — usually at least 12
out of 10. WeRateDogs generally steers clear of politics, in part
because there’s a financial risk: Nelson now employs two people and
sells hats. But dog-rating courted controversy when the account tweeted
pictures of dogs from the Women’s March and travel-ban protests. Sun
became fascinated by how something so innocuous took on a political
cast. “It’s a Trojan-horse approach,” he told me before speaking with
Nelson. “People come for the cute animals,” and what they find are
protesters who, in the presence of pets, seem more “normalized,” more
human. Yet WeRateDogs had publicly mocked an antagonist — not exactly
golden conversation — and that response also went viral.

Recently, Nelson began selling a hat featuring a presidential Twitter
typo (“covfefe”). This annoyed some left-wing dog lovers — why make
money from this president’s gibberish? Then he announced the account
would donate half the profits to Planned Parenthood. That angered
right-wing dog lovers. Nelson quickly promised to donate an equal amount
to a dog shelter. “Dogs are bipartisan and that’s why my following is
diverse and my account brings people together,” he wrote in a lengthy
mea culpa. “Last night I jeopardized that, and I’m sorry.” The response
to this was the most brutal of all: As a furious segment of his
followers saw it, Nelson had just apologized for supporting women’s
health. He took the statement down.

At M.I.T., Sun and Benesch asked Nelson about his political influence on
his followers, and theirs on him. It was hard for Nelson to say. The
discussion turned, inevitably, to how the tweeter in chief had changed
the landscape of social media. “People are angrier,” Sun said. “I’m
getting more people mad at me. ... It has turned into a worse space over
all.”

Most of us are probably not equipped to handle the negativity that can
build up online — the way a remark shared with a small circle can slip
its context and bring the swift and lasting condemnation of strangers,
the way public posts march down our screens in an endless conga line of
rage. Tweets like Sun’s are landmarks that let us catch our breath. As
Sherry Turkle, a professor in the department of science, technology and
society at M.I.T., said to me describing the appeal of jomny sun: “In
part we are smiling because we feel reassured. We are with our people.”

All the terrible news, in other words, and then an aliebn.
