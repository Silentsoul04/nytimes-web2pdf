King Lear, King James, Don King or Prom King? Perhaps all of them. This
poem's couplets are like train rails carrying us through lyrical
commandments before placing us in the native landscape of the
Ugandan-born poet Nick Makoha. The king calls to us from there and
nowhere. The forefathers, the clansmen, the brothers are ours. Which is
not to say the poem is universal. It is as rooted in the particular
(Uganda glows at the poem's heart) as it is in metaphor. The king
addresses all of us. \emph{Selected by Terrance Hayes}

FROM THE KING

By Nick Makoha

Do no work today, cousins, we are marked to die.\\
Feast with your neighbour, then we will depart.

Take care of your tongue, watch what the lips say,\\
for foreign words uprooted our pumpkins.

Let us not inherit the stupidity of our forefathers\\
who, like dust, abandoned their homestead.

Smear your bodies in red oil. Tonight we split the darkness.\\
We will be remembered as the wild cats

who smeared their bodies in blood. The fewer our men,\\
the greater our share of honour. Do not count your coins;

there is nothing you need from gold. Our bodies will be\\
our wealth. Even the grave will not reject our clansmen.

It's Uganda's loss if we live. Curse the man who does not\\
share this fellowship and fears our desires. He is mucus

in the mouth, a rotting fruit. He was not carved out of the rock\\
as we were. Find the stomach to fight.

Let courage be your host. Shed your blood with me, brothers.\\
When they name this day, you who live will show your scars.

Wear them as you would the kikoys in your hut.\\
Hold vigil. You who see old age, tell this to your sons.

Let us be the throb in our children's dreams\\
and the wounds they wear under their skins.
