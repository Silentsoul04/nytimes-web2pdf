\textbf{Andy writes:} \emph{My college friend Bill says chicken tenders
are an appetizer. I think that they are an entree. (They're often served
with fries.) I can't imagine starting a meal with chicken tenders and
moving on to an even heavier entree.}

Chicken tenders are like subatomic particles: They change nature in
context. They are an appetizer in any restaurant that has more than one
television above the bar. They are an entree in any establishment where
fried food is served outside from a window. They are a mystery insofar
as why anyone would ever eat one when there is fried chicken in the
world or, for that matter, fried clams. The reason you can't imagine
eating chicken tenders as an appetizer is that you are growing up and
your youthful metabolism is fading. It is time to put childish things
aside. Sorry, Bill: Eat actual food!
