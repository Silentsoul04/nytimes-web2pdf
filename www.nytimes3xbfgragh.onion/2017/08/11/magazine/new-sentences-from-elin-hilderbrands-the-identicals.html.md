> “Eleanor hears about Tabitha’s love affair with the builder and that

> From “The Identicals” (Little, Brown and Company, 2017, Page 360), the
> 19th novel by Elin Hilderbrand.

Every summer, on vacation in Cape Cod, my friend Rachelle sits on the
beach reading novels set on nearby Nantucket. They have sky-blue covers
featuring women in bathing suits and blurbs about what perfect beach
reads they are. (People magazine: ‘‘Just the thing for a day by the
sea.’’) Every summer there is a new one, or even two, by the same
author. This year I snatched one for myself and hunkered down in the
sand. I was captivated. I finished it in a day, as waves slipped over
the shore and crabs scuttled across the seafloor and the white edge of
my thigh burned.

The novel is about a pair of estranged identical-twin sisters; its plot,
as the sentence above suggests, becomes pretty tangled. What was most
fascinating, though, was the book’s genre. It reads like a novel written
in the margins of a travel guide with lifestyle-magazine clippings and
Chamber of Commerce brochures pasted in. The characters suffer their
passions and betrayals at actual scenic beaches and shops and
restaurants, where they order menu items that are listed at
artery-clogging length (‘‘passion-fruit panna cotta, miniature cannoli
filled with pistachio cream,’’ and so on). High-end kitchen appliances
are name-checked. Sometimes it feels as if the whole thing has been
commercially sponsored. I could hardly look away.

Occasionally, as I read, a seal popped his head out of the water and
stared at us, but I did not join him. I had been pulled into this other
world — one that was, in all important respects, exactly the world I was
already in. It felt silly to be in there, escaping from my escapism, and
yet it turned out that I was a sucker for this simulacrum of upper-class
island life: I longed to stay forever in fake-real Nantucket with
Tabitha and Harper and Eleanor and Ainsley. Sometimes, as the book’s
narrator puts it, ‘‘the summer sun reveals too much.’’
