Just a handful of Europe's rattan ateliers are still in operation. The

An air of fustiness hovers over the very words ‘‘wicker furniture’’: One
imagines sepia-toned photos of peacock-backed chairs on verandas in
colonial India, and ornately curved chaises in Victorian conservatories.
And indeed, the style is old — while wicker’s apex was in the 19th
century, when trade routes from Asia brought a steady supply of rattan
to Europe, the art of weaving objects from natural fibers actually goes
back at least as far as ancient Egypt.

Today, however, quality handwoven wicker is still being produced in a
few of those original century-old workshops, most of which are small
family-run operations. The designs have evolved with the times, but the
construction process has barely changed in thousands of years. (Wicker
refers to a technique of weaving fibers rather than to any particular
material, and so can be done with anything from plant-based elements to
synthetics.) These remaining ateliers continue to use natural rattan,
the stem of a sturdy yet flexible climbing palm, to form the base of the
structure of the piece, and thin spaghetti-like strands harvested from
the interior of the stem for the fine weaving work that gives wicker its
name. Competition has come mostly in the form of imported cheaper
pieces, which might be a fine thing, especially for the countries where
rattan grows, like Indonesia and Malaysia. But rarely is the
craftsmanship or design comparable to the work coming from these
traditional studios. Here, highly skilled artisans create furniture the
way they always have: by heating stiff poles of rattan into malleable
rods that are bent on a metal frame and willed into functional works of
art.

Three of the last ateliers left — in Sweden, England and Italy — are by
all accounts creating the most beautiful wicker furniture today. While
all use the same over-under weaving technique practiced by basket-makers
for millennia, the styles of each house are reflections of their
individual countries — making wicker a small but lovely prism through
which to view the world.

### <span>Bonacina</span>

*Lurago d’Erba, Italy, est. 1889*

Long a secret resource of Europe’s most discerning decorators,
[Bonacina](http://www.bonacina1889.it/) is a 128-year-old wicker
furniture company north of Milan run by the founder’s grandson Mario,
along with his wife and children. Most of the workers are locals who
have been with the company for years, and who return home each afternoon
for lunch. Men do the hot, physical work of bending the thick rods of
rattan, and women do the weaving. The day I visited, Luigi Meroni, a
Bonacina employee of 50 years, was making a coffee table, while two
sisters, Cecilia and Rosa, were weaving chairs.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to the thousands of designs created over three generations —
everything from a classic armchair with a sunburst pattern designed by
decorator Renzo Mongiardino to, more recently, a thin chaise resembling
a bent sheet of metal created by Mario Bonacina — the company has
collaborated with a number of other designers such as Gae Aulenti, Gio
Ponti, Joe Colombo and Franco Albini. Most famous, perhaps, is the
decades-­long collaboration with Mongiardino, who created for the house,
among other things, a collection of charming, old-fashioned chairs and
settees with Italian doyenne Marella Agnelli for all of her properties,
including those in St. Moritz, Rome, New York City and Marrakesh.
(There’s an oft-told story that after Agnelli toured a nouveau riche
American’s home, she remarked of her hostess, ‘‘It will take her another
lifetime to understand wicker.’’)

It also hasn’t been difficult for contemporary designers and architects
— including Peter Marino, Jacques Grange and Daniel Romualdez — to
appreciate the company’s humble but elegant design; Bonacina’s grand
sloping armchairs and spare, streamlined loungers can be found in
Italian hotels like Le Sirenuse, Francis Ford Coppola’s Palazzo
Margherita and Villa
Feltrinelli.

### <span>Soane</span>

*Leicestershire, U.K., originally est. as Angraves, 1912*

In 2010, Nigel Angrave was faced with shuttering the company his
grandfather had started nearly 100 years earlier. It meant not only the
loss of jobs and his family’s business, but as the company was the last
rattan-weaving workshop in England, forever losing the art of
traditional wicker-making in Britain. Enter Lulu Lytle and Christopher
Hodsoll, owners of [Soane](http://www.soane.co.uk/), a London enterprise
committed to creating furniture and fabrics made by craftspeople from
across Britain. They purchased the Angraves workshop in Leicestershire —
at one time the heart of the British rattan industry, which reached its
peak in the Victorian era — and rehired its two chief craftsmen, frame
maker Mick Gregory and master weaver Phil Ayres, both of whom began
working in rattan over 40 years ago, when they were still teenagers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lytle revitalized the company’s old-fashioned designs with playful
updates of English country classics like tall barstools with
diamond-patterned backs, petite side tables crafted entirely of tightly
woven rattan and lampshades made in a traditional basket weave. Many of
Soane’s pieces are also technically complex, including the Ripple
console, which resembles folds of gently undulating fabric, and the
Venus chair, the back of which crests into petal-like scallops,
requiring multiple applications of naked flame and water to achieve a
fluidity of form.

By creating a new market and appreciation for British wicker, Hodsoll
and Lytle were able to start an apprenticeship program and add another
seven artisans (six men and one woman) trained by Gregory and Ayres.
‘‘Because this is the very last workshop,’’ Lytle says, ‘‘it was
crucial we train the next generation before the skills are lost
forever.’’

### <span>Larsson Korgmakare</span>

*Stockholm, est. 1903*

On a narrow street in the old city of Stockholm, an ancient building
holds the warehouse of the 114-year-old [Larsson
Korgmakare](http://www.larssonkorgmakare.se/), the only artisanal rattan
workshop left in Sweden. Next door, in the cellar, you’ll find
49-year-old Erica Larsson, carrying on the family tradition begun by her
great-grandfather. She is not just the owner, but the company’s sole
artisan, doing the physically taxing work of firing and shaping rattan
with the help of just one assistant. The history and continued existence
of the business owes much to the great Swedish designer Josef Frank.
Larsson’s grandfather, a craftsmen and designer, began a partnership in
the 1930s with Frank, whose rustic, minimal wicker sofas and chairs she
continues to produce for the famed Stockholm design emporium Svenskt
Tenn.

</div>

When Larsson decided to join the business, her father sent her to
Malaysia for six months to apprentice in the harvest and processing of
rattan, an experience she may pass on to her 11-year-old daughter if she
decides to continue the legacy. A testament to a Swedish love of good
and simple design, Larsson Korgmakare’s style of seating is crafted
almost exclusively from the larger rattan poles, incorporating almost no
intricate weaving. Most of the pieces Larsson creates — skeletal,
honey-colored love seats and armchairs, woven in loose looping patterns
— are from the original designs created by Frank or her grandfather.
‘‘In \[my grandfather’s\] last year, when he was 80, and more or
less blind, he continued to make furniture,’’ she recalls. ‘‘He had the
knowledge in his fingers.’’
