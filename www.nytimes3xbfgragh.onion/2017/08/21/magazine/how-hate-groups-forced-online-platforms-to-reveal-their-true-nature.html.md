White supremacist marchers had not yet lit their torches when the
deletions began. The ‘‘Unite the Right’’ Facebook page, which had been
used to organize the rally in Charlottesville, was removed the day
before the event was scheduled, forcing planners to disperse to other
platforms to organize. And then, in the hours and days after a
participant drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing
32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others, internet
companies undertook a collective purge.

Facebook banned a range of pages with names like ‘‘Right Wing Death
Squad’’ and ‘‘White Nationalists United.’’ Reddit banned, among others,
a hard-right community called ‘‘Physical Removal,’’ an organizer of
which had called the weekend’s killing ‘‘a morally justified action.’’
Twitter suspended an unknown number of users, including popular accounts
associated with 4chan’s openly fascistic Politically Incorrect message
board, or /pol/. Discord, a chat app for gamers that doubled as an
organizing tool for the event, and where a prominent white supremacist
had called for disrupting Heyer’s funeral, rushed to do cleanup.

The clampdown extended beyond the walled gardens of social platforms to
a wide array of online services. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site that
promoted the march and celebrated its fatal outcome, was banned by the
domain registrar and hosting service GoDaddy, then hours later by
Google’s hosting service, then lost access to SendGrid, which it had
used to deliver its newsletter; PayPal cut off the white nationalist
Richard Spencer’s organization, which later lost access to its web host,
Squarespace; Airbnb removed the accounts of a number of Charlottesville
attendees before the event, and released a statement saying that
‘‘violence, racism and hatred demonstrated by neo-­Nazis, the
alt-right and white supremacists should have no place in this world’’;
by Wednesday, Spotify was even expunging ‘‘white supremacist’’ music
from its library.

The platforms’ sudden action in response to an outpouring of public
grief and rage resembles, at first glance, a moral awakening and
suggests a mounting sense of responsibility to the body politic. You
could be forgiven for seeing this as a turning point for these sites,
away from a hands-off approach to the communities they host and toward
something with more oversight and regulation. An inside-out version of
this analysis has been embraced by right-wing users, who have wasted no
time declaring these bans a violation of their free speech. But this is
an incomplete accounting of what happened and one that serves two
parties and two parties alone: the companies themselves and the people
they’ve just banned.

The recent rise of all-encompassing internet platforms promised
something unprecedented and invigorating: venues that unite all manner
of actors — politicians, media, lobbyists, citizens, experts,
corporations — under one roof. These companies promised something that
no previous vision of the public sphere could offer: real,
billion-strong mass participation; a means for affinity groups to find
one another and mobilize, gain visibility and influence. This felt and
functioned like freedom, but it was always a commercial simulation. This
contradiction is foundational to what these internet companies are.
Nowhere was this tension more evident than in the case of Cloudflare, a
web-infrastructure company. Under sustained pressure to drop The Daily
Stormer as a client, the company’s chief executive, Matthew Prince,
eventually assented. It was an arbitrary decision, and one that was out
of step with the company’s stated policies. This troubled Prince. ‘‘I
woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn’t be allowed on the
internet,’’ [he wrote in an email to his
staff](http://gizmodo.com/cloudflare-ceo-on-terminating-service-to-neo-nazi-site-1797915295).
‘‘No one should have that power.’’

**Social platforms** tend to refer to their customers in euphemistic,
almost democratic terms: as ‘‘users’’ or ‘‘members of a community.’’
Their leaders are prone to statesmanlike posturing, and some, like Mark
Zuckerberg, even seem to have [statesmanlike
ambitions](https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-america-travels/).
Content moderation and behavioral guidelines are likewise rendered in
the terms of legal governance, as are their systems for dispute and
recourse (as in the ubiquitous post-ban ‘‘appeal’’). Questions about how
platforms like Twitter and Reddit deal with disruptive users and
offensive content tend to be met with defensive language invoking free
speech.

In the process of building private communities, these companies had put
on the costumes of liberal democracies. They borrowed the language of
rights to legitimize arbitrary rules, creating what the technology
lawyer Kendra Albert [calls ‘‘legal
talismans.’’](https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/luncheons/2016/10/Albert)
This was first and foremost operationally convenient or even necessary:
What better way to avoid liability and responsibility for how customers
use your product? It was also good marketing. It’s easier to entrust
increasingly large portions of your private and public life to an
advertising and data-mining firm if you’re led to believe it’s something
more. But as major internet platforms have grown to compose a greater
share of the public sphere, playing host to consequential political
organization — not to mention media — their internal contradictions have
become harder to ignore. Far before Charlottesville, they had already
become acute.

In [a bracing Vice
documentary](https://news.vice.com/story/vice-news-tonight-full-episode-charlottesville-race-and-terror)
about the rally, a man identified as a writer for The Daily Stormer told
the reporter Elle Reeve, ‘‘As you can see, we’re stepping off the
internet in a big way.’’ He saw the turnout as confirmation that what
he’d been a part of online was real. ‘‘We have been spreading our
memes, we’ve been organizing on the internet, and so now they’re coming
out,’’ he said, before digressing into a rant about ‘‘anti-white,
anti-American filth.’’ This sentiment was echoed in active and
longstanding far-right communities on Reddit and 4chan and adjacent
communities on Facebook and Twitter.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is worth noting that the platforms most flamboyantly dedicated to a
borrowed idea of free speech and assembly are the same ones that have
struggled most intensely with groups of users who seek to organize and
disrupt their platforms. A community of trolls on an internet platform
is, in political terms, not totally unlike a fascist movement in a weak
liberal democracy: It engages with and uses the rules and protections of
the system it inhabits with the intent of subverting it and eventually
remaking it in their image or, if that fails, merely destroying it.

But what gave these trolls power on platforms wasn’t just their
willingness to act in bad faith and to break the rules and norms of
their environment. It was their understanding that the rules and norms
of platforms were self-serving and cynical in the first place. After
all, these platforms draw arbitrary boundaries constantly and with much
less controversy — against spammers, concerning profanity or in response
to government demands. These fringe groups saw an opportunity in the gap
between the platforms’ strained public dedication to discourse
stewardship and their actual existence as profit-driven entities, free
to do as they please. Despite their participatory rhetoric, social
platforms are closer to authoritarian spaces than democratic ones. It
makes some sense that people with authoritarian tendencies would have an
intuitive understanding of how they work and how to take advantage of
them.

This was also a moment these hate groups were anticipating; getting
banned in an opaque, unilateral fashion was always the way out and, to
some degree, it suits them. In the last year, hard-right communities on
social platforms have cultivated a pre-emptive identity as platform
refugees and victims of censorship. They’ve also been preparing for this
moment or one like it: There are hard-right alternatives to Twitter, to
Reddit and even to the still-mostly-lawless 4chan. There are alternative
fund-raising sites in the mold of GoFundMe or Kickstarter; there’s an
alternative to Patreon called Hatreon. Like most of these new
alternatives, it has cynically borrowed a cause — it calls itself a site
that ‘‘stands for free speech absolutism’’ — that the more mainstream
platforms borrowed first. Their persecution narrative, which is the most
useful narrative they have, and one that will help spread their cause
beyond the fringes, was written for them years ago by the same companies
that helped give them a voice.
