[Irma](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/hurricane-irma-florida.html),
now a tropical storm, is weakening, but dangers still remain as it tears
a path through the Southeast with rain and lashing winds. The Times,
which has journalists deployed through the region, is providing free
digital access to all storm news.

For the latest dispatches, read our [live Monday
briefing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/hurricane-irma-florida.html).
([This overview of the storm’s impact on
Florida](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/us/irma-florida-keys-gulf-coast.html)
was published this morning.)

You can also track the [storm’s
path](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/05/us/hurricane-irma-map.html)
with our interactive maps, look at journalists’ [photographs of the
hurricane](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/09/world/americas/hurricane-irma-photos.html)
or view [striking videos and other images from social
media](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/irma-videos-damage.html).

Many readers have asked about donations or other ways to help. [You can
find that information
here](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-irma-help-donate.html),
along with tips for avoiding fraud.

Desperation is mounting on some Caribbean islands where the storm first
made landfall on Wednesday. Read about how people there are handling
[severe food and water
shortages.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/world/americas/irma-caribbean-st-martin.html)
how [This story describes how Puerto
Ricans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/us/puerto-rico-virgin-islands.html),
who were spared the worst of the storm, have been helping their
neighbors.

For hurricane-hardened Florida, [Irma was
different](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/us/key-west-naples-florida.html).
Millions of people were ordered to evacuate, and hundreds of thousands
scrambled into crowded shelters and onto jammed highways.

As it reached Florida, Times journalists and others in its path
[described what they saw, in this collection of
dispatches.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/us/miami-key-west-scene.html)
(You might also be interested in reading about [how TV storm coverage
has ignited a
debate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/business/media/hurricane-irma-broadcasts-safety.html).)

The Daily Podcast spoke with two Miami residents, one who refused to
evacuate and one who drove north, only to end up in Irma’s path. [Listen
here.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/podcasts/the-daily/voices-from-florida-irma.html)

Amid the fear and destruction, there have been moments of uplifting
heroism and levity. [Read about them
here.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/hurricane-irma-heroes-rescues.html)

The Times also chronicled efforts to [rescue pets and other animals in
this
story,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/09/us/hurricane-irma-animal-rescue.html)and
[explained here how insurers may have to turn to their own
insurers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/business/irma-florida-homeowner-insurance.html)
to cover claims from the storm.

This weekend, President Trump and his cabinet were [monitoring the storm
from Camp
David](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/09/us/politics/trump-hurricane-irma-camp-david.html).
Read what [scientists are saying about the Trump administration and
climate
change.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/climate/hurricane-irma-climate-change.html)
You may also be interested in[learning about how Hurricane Irma become
so huge and
destructive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/08/climate/how-hurricane-irma-became-so-huge-and-destructive.html),
and how experts [gathered data on the
storm.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/06/upshot/how-to-follow-hurricane-irma.html)

## A bit of advice

If you must travel somewhere in the path of the storm, [here’s what you
should
do](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/06/travel/irma-hurricane-tips.html).

The task of rebuilding after a disaster can be daunting. In Houston,
[many are still
recovering](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/houston-harvey-home-displaced.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)
from Hurricane Harvey.

[Survivors of Hurricane
Katrina](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/08/health/katrina-harvey-children.html)
also have advice for the long term.

And, again, if you want to help with donations, [be careful to avoid
scams](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-irma-help-donate.html).
