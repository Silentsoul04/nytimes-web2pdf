\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/hurricane-irma-florida.html}{Irma},
now a tropical storm, is weakening, but dangers still remain as it tears
a path through the Southeast with rain and lashing winds. The Times,
which has journalists deployed through the region, is providing free
digital access to all storm news.

For the latest dispatches, read our
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/hurricane-irma-florida.html}{live
Monday briefing}.
(\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/us/irma-florida-keys-gulf-coast.html}{This
overview of the storm's impact on Florida} was published this morning.)

You can also track the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/05/us/hurricane-irma-map.html}{storm's
path} with our interactive maps, look at journalists'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/09/world/americas/hurricane-irma-photos.html}{photographs
of the hurricane} or view
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/irma-videos-damage.html}{striking
videos and other images from social media}.

Many readers have asked about donations or other ways to help.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-irma-help-donate.html}{You
can find that information here}, along with tips for avoiding fraud.

Desperation is mounting on some Caribbean islands where the storm first
made landfall on Wednesday. Read about how people there are handling
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/world/americas/irma-caribbean-st-martin.html}{severe
food and water shortages.} how
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/us/puerto-rico-virgin-islands.html}{This
story describes how Puerto Ricans}, who were spared the worst of the
storm, have been helping their neighbors.

For hurricane-hardened Florida,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/us/key-west-naples-florida.html}{Irma
was different}. Millions of people were ordered to evacuate, and
hundreds of thousands scrambled into crowded shelters and onto jammed
highways.

As it reached Florida, Times journalists and others in its path
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/us/miami-key-west-scene.html}{described
what they saw, in this collection of dispatches.} (You might also be
interested in reading about
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/10/business/media/hurricane-irma-broadcasts-safety.html}{how
TV storm coverage has ignited a debate}.)

The Daily Podcast spoke with two Miami residents, one who refused to
evacuate and one who drove north, only to end up in Irma's path.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/podcasts/the-daily/voices-from-florida-irma.html}{Listen

Amid the fear and destruction, there have been moments of uplifting
heroism and levity.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/hurricane-irma-heroes-rescues.html}{Read
about them here.}

The Times also chronicled efforts to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/09/us/hurricane-irma-animal-rescue.html}{rescue
pets and other animals in this story,}and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/business/irma-florida-homeowner-insurance.html}{explained
here how insurers may have to turn to their own insurers} to cover
claims from the storm.

This weekend, President Trump and his cabinet were
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/09/us/politics/trump-hurricane-irma-camp-david.html}{monitoring
the storm from Camp David}. Read what
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/climate/hurricane-irma-climate-change.html}{scientists
are saying about the Trump administration and climate change.} You may

experts
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/06/upshot/how-to-follow-hurricane-irma.html}{gathered

If you must travel somewhere in the path of the storm,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/06/travel/irma-hurricane-tips.html}{here's
what you should do}.

The task of rebuilding after a disaster can be daunting. In Houston,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/11/us/houston-harvey-home-displaced.html?hp\&action=click\&pgtype=Homepage\&clickSource=story-heading\&module=b-lede-package-region\&region=top-news\&WT.nav=top-news}{many
are still recovering} from Hurricane Harvey.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/08/health/katrina-harvey-children.html}{Survivors
of Hurricane Katrina} also have advice for the long term.

And, again, if you want to help with donations,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-irma-help-donate.html}{be
careful to avoid scams}.
