A lawyer for the rapper Meek Mill has accused a Philadelphia judge of
inappropriate and ``vindictive'' behavior toward his client after she
sentenced the rapper this week to two to four years in prison for
probation violations.

Judge Genece E. Brinkley, who has overseen Meek Mill's case since he was
known by his given name, Robert Rahmeek Williams, scolded the rapper in
court on Monday for the violations, which stemmed from a 2008
conviction.

``I gave you break after break, and you basically just thumbed your nose
at this court,'' she said.

The rapper, a 30-year-old Philadelphia native, was convicted in 2008 on
charges related to the possession of guns and drugs, and served eight
months in prison. He was then placed on probation for five years, a
period that has been extended several times.

The violations include two arrests in the past year, the first for a
fight at a St. Louis airport and the second for reckless driving while
filming a music video in New York City. Charges
\href{http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8006993/meek-mill-misdemeanor-airport-assault-charges-dropped}{were
dropped} in the first case and the rapper
\href{https://pagesix.com/2017/10/11/meek-mill-catches-break-on-popping-wheelies-case/}{took
a dismissal deal} in the second. The judge also cited the rapper's
repeated scheduling of concerts in areas where she had barred him from
performing.

In a phone interview Tuesday, a lawyer for Meek Mill, Joe Tacopina, said
that Judge Brinkley had behaved inappropriately over the course of the
case, saying, for example, that the judge had requested that the rapper
include her name in a song and had given him unsolicited advice on who
should manage him.

``She's exhibited enormous bias,'' he said.

Judge Brinkley did not respond to multiple messages requesting comment.
Mr. Tacopina said that the rapper's legal team would appeal the ruling.

This is the second time that Meek Mill has been sent to prison for
parole violations related to the 2008 conviction. In July 2014, about a
year after Judge Brinkley ordered him to
\href{http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/rapper-meek-mill-ordered-etiquette-classes-article-1.1386399}{take
etiquette classes}, he was jailed for five months, again for performing
out of state without permission. He

Billboard} that he spent much of that time in solitary confinement.

Judge Brinkley's ruling Monday came after a prosecutor and a probation
officer had recommended against prison time. Her decision set off
protests from many of the rapper's

supporters}.

Facebook}, Jay-Z called the sentence ``unjust and heavy-handed.'' (Meek
Mill is signed to Roc Nation, the entertainment company founded by
Jay-Z.)

The repercussions from the 2008 conviction have cast a shadow over what
has otherwise been a successful career for Meek Mill, an
