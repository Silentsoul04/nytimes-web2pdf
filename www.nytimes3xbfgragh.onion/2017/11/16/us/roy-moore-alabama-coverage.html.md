*Updated on Dec. 11.*

That a Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama would cruise to
victory seemed almost a foregone conclusion. But after a series of women
came forward to accuse that candidate, Roy S. Moore, of sexual
misconduct, less is certain in an unlikely nail-biter of a race that
could have major implications for the party’s ability to govern in
Washington.

President Trump has gone from largely avoiding mention of Mr. Moore, a
former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, to unequivocally
endorsing him. Many Senate Republicans distanced themselves from the
candidate, and some called on him to withdraw from the race.

Democrats, for their part, are contemplating the near-impossible:
flipping a seat in a deeply red state that last elected a Democratic
senator in 1992.

As voters prepare for the special election on Tuesday, here is a
breakdown of The New York Times’s coverage on the race since the
accusations emerged.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## What are the allegations?

On Nov. 9, [The Washington Post
reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.c2d840a6fc79)
that four women said Mr. Moore had pursued them sexually or romantically
when they were 18 or younger and he was in his 30s. One of them said
that he touched her sexually when she was 14, below the state’s age of
consent.

Over the next several days, a woman accused Mr. Moore of [sexually
assaulting
her](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/13/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-senate.html)
when she was 16 ([read her statement
here](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/13/us/politics/text-beverly-young-nelson-statement.html)),
and [four more
women](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/15/us/roy-moore-alabama-republicans.html)
accused him of sexual misconduct or unwanted overtures.

Mr. Moore, 70, [remains
defiant](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/11/us/roy-moore-alabama-senate.html),
trying to discredit the accusers while denying the most serious charges
against him — though he has not denied that when he was in his 30s, he
dated women in their teens. He has claimed that his accusers are part of
a conspiracy against him, and that he is opposed by “the forces of evil
who are attempting to relegate our conservative Christian values to the
dustbin of history.”

On Nov. 27, [The Post
reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic—and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?utm_term=.1c605c2cd9a0)
that a woman working for a conservative group had attempted to trick the
newspaper into publishing false allegations against Mr. Moore,
apparently in hopes of damaging The Post’s credibility.

On Friday, one of Mr. Moore’s accusers, Beverly Young Nelson, said she
[added a
note](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/08/us/alabama-moore-nelson-allred.html)
to an inscription in her high school yearbook that she says was written
by Mr. Moore.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## How have Republicans reacted?

At first, President Trump remained largely silent, but he then [began
defending Mr.
Moore](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/21/us/politics/roy-moore-trump-alabama.html)
and saying that voters should reject Doug Jones, the Democrat in the
race. After he formally endorsed Mr. Moore on Dec. 4, the Republican
National Committee [restored its financial
support](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/04/us/politics/roy-moore-donald-trump.html?_r=0).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Friday, Mr. Trump [held a political
rally](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/08/us/politics/trump-moore-florida-alabama.html)
in Pensacola, Fla., less than 30 miles from the Alabama border, and
urged Alabamians to vote for Mr. Moore.

“We need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our Make America
Great Again agenda,” Mr. Trump said.

Our reporters [examined why Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/25/us/politics/trump-roy-moore-mcconnell-alabama-senate.html),
who has also faced sexual harassment and assault allegations, [has stood
by Mr.
Moore](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/25/us/politics/trump-roy-moore-mcconnell-alabama-senate.html)
while the Alabama race split national Republicans. Many of [his party’s
national
leaders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/10/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-republican.html)
have said that Mr. Moore should drop out of the race, which veteran
Alabama politicians describe as [unlike any they’ve ever
seen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/09/us/politics/even-in-unruly-alabama-politics-never-seen-anything-like-this.html).

The dean of the state’s congressional delegation, the Republican Senator
Richard C. Shelby, excoriated Mr. Moore in a rare national television
appearance on Sunday, [telling
CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/10/politics/richard-shelby-roy-moore-sotu-cnntv/index.html)
that Alabama “deserves better.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The allegations against Mr. Moore have aggravated the hostility between
[the populist and establishment
factions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/16/us/politics/republican-party-division-roy-moore.html)
of the party. You can check out how Alabama party officials [have
staunchly defended Mr.
Moore](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/10/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-republicans.html)
or [watch a video of many of his
defenders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/us/politics/100000005552332/roy-moore-and-his-supporters-fire-back-on-misconduct-accusations.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader —
who has said “I believe the women” and took the stand for weeks that Mr.
Moore should drop out of the race — said last week that the race was
[for the people of Alabama to
decide](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/03/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-roy-moore.html).

Mr. McConnell’s colleagues have discussed the possibility that, if Mr.
Moore is elected, he could be subjected to an ethics investigation, or
even expelled from the Senate.

In a tight race, any votes cast for a little-known write-in candidate,
[Lee
Busby](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/28/lee-busby-alabama-senate-race-spoiler-261775),
might affect the outcome.

## What do voters think?

Mr. Moore’s solid lead in voter surveys evaporated just after the
scandal broke, but his poll numbers later edged upward again.
Conflicting polls [have
highlighted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/11/us/alabama-roy-moore-doug-jones.html)
how difficult it is to predict an unusual December election.

Standing in Mr. Jones’s way, [our Alabama team
reported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/03/us/doug-jones-alabama-democrats-.html),
is the deeply negative view of Democrats that is held even by many
Alabamians who dislike Mr. Moore.

Few women [interviewed by our reporters in a Birmingham
suburb](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/10/us/alabama-women-roy-moore.html)
were fans of Mr. Moore, but many felt he had a good chance of being
elected anyway. Our reporters also talked with residents in Gadsden, his
hometown: To them, [he was more divisive than
ever](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/14/us/roy-moore-gadsden-women.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At recent church services, [we found mixed
feelings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/19/us/roy-moore-churches-senate.html)
about Mr. Moore among parishioners. We also examined [Mr. Moore’s
combative
history](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/18/us/roy-moore-alabama.html).
Five of Mr. Moore’s supporters told us [why they plan to vote for
him](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/08/us/roy-moore-alabama-supporters.html).

Though polls indicate about half of voters think the accusations against
Mr. Moore are not the most important issue in the race, policy questions
[have largely been
ignored](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/09/us/alabama-poverty-jobs-roy-moore.html).

Nate Cohn, an elections analyst for The Upshot, took a look at [how Mr.
Jones might
fare](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/15/upshot/could-a-democrat-actually-win-a-senate-seat-in-alabama-precedents-are-few-but-telling.html),
and how the race tests the limits of party loyalty in what might be the
most Republican state in the country. You can check out [the latest
polls on the
race](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2017/senate/al/alabama_senate_special_election_moore_vs_jones-6271.html#polls)
at RealClearPolitics.

## How are Democrats responding?

National Democratic organizations and the party’s most prominent figures
[had largely steered
clear](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/14/us/politics/alabama-doug-jones-roy-moore-democrats.html)
of the race, [our political correspondents
reported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/14/us/politics/alabama-doug-jones-roy-moore-democrats.html),
which had initially left Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, to
[mostly go it
alone](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/19/us/jones-alabama-democrats.html)[.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/29/us/doug-jones-roy-moore-black-voters.html)
But in the last, frenzied days of the campaign, a constellation of
outside liberal groups [discreetly launched a multimillion-dollar
operation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/10/us/politics/richard-shelby-roy-moore.html)
to get out the Democratic vote. Mr. Jones is relying heavily on [turnout
by black
voters.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/29/us/doug-jones-roy-moore-black-voters.html)

[We took a closer look at Jones in
September](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/02/us/politics/doug-jones-democrats-alabama-senate-roy-moore.html),
and you can read [our 2001 profile on
him](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2001/05/05/us/public-lives-an-alabama-prosecutor-confronts-the-burden-of-history.html).
