This month Meek Mill was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/07/arts/music/meek-mill-jail.html}{sentenced
to two to four years in prison} for violating his probation. \#FreeMeek
hashtags have sprung up, and hundreds of his fans rallied near City Hall
in Philadelphia to protest the ruling.

On the surface, this may look like the story of yet another criminal
rapper who didn't smarten up and is back where he started. But consider
this: Meek was around 19 when he was convicted on charges relating to
drug and gun possession, and he served an eight-month sentence. Now he's
30, so he has been on probation for basically his entire adult life. For
about a decade, he's been stalked by a system that considers the
slightest infraction a justification for locking him back inside.

What's happening to Meek Mill is just one example of how our criminal
justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black
people every day. I saw this up close when I was growing up in Brooklyn
during the 1970s and 1980s. Instead of a second chance, probation ends
up being a land mine, with a random misstep bringing consequences
greater than the crime. A person on probation can end up in jail over a
technical violation like missing a curfew.

Taxpayers in Philadelphia, Meek Mill's hometown, will have to spend tens
of thousands of dollars each year to keep him locked up, and I bet none
of them would tell you his imprisonment is helping to keep them safer.
He's there because of arrests for a parole violation, and because a
judge overruled recommendations by a prosecutor and his probation
officer that he doesn't deserve more jail time. That's why I stopped my
show in Dallas last week to talk about Meek.

Look at what he's being punished for now:

In March, he was arrested after an altercation in a St. Louis airport.
After video of what had actually happened was released, all charges were
dropped against Meek. In August, he was arrested for popping a wheelie
on a motorcycle on his video set in New York. Those charges will be
dismissed if he stays out of trouble.

Think about that. The charges were either dropped or dismissed, but the
judge sent him to prison anyway.

The specifics of Meek's case inspired me to write this. But it's time we
highlight the random ways people trapped in the criminal justice system
are punished every day. The system treats them as a danger to society,
consistently monitors and follows them for any minor infraction --- with
the goal of putting them back in prison.

As of 2015, one-third of the 4.65 million Americans who were on some
form of parole or probation were black. Black people are sent to prison
for probation and parole violations at much higher rates than white
people.

In Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of people are on probation or
parole. About half of the people in city jails in Philadelphia are there
for probation or parole violations. We could literally shut down jails
if we treated people on parole or probation more fairly.

And that's what we need to fight for in Philadelphia and across the
country. The racial-justice organization
\href{http://freemeekmill.org/}{Color of Change is working with people}
in Philadelphia to pressure the courts there and make that vision a
reality. Probation is a trap and we must fight for Meek and everyone
else unjustly sent to prison.
