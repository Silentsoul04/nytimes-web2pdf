CAIRO --- A
\href{http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/14/africa/libya-migrant-auctions/index.html}{CNN
report} about the sale of African migrants as slaves in the North
African nation of Libya has incited outrage in recent days, prompting a
protest in central Paris, condemnation by the African Union and an
official investigation.

Hundreds of protesters, mostly young black people,
\href{https://twitter.com/RemyBuisine/status/931887038680522753}{demonstrated}
in front of the Libyan Embassy in central Paris on Saturday --- with
some carrying a sign that said, ``Put an end to the slavery and
concentration camps in Libya,'' and chanting, ``Free our brothers!'' ---
three days after CNN aired footage of migrants being auctioned off in
the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

``We have to mobilize --- we can't let this kind of thing happen,'' one
of the protesters told the television station France 24. ``Did we really
need to see such shocking pictures before taking a stand? I don't think
so.''

French police officers fired tear gas to disperse the

which had turned violent.

Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairman of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/african-union?inline=nyt-org}{African
Union Commission} and the foreign minister of Chad, issued a
\href{https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20171118/statement-chairperson-african-union-commission-plight-african-migrants-libya}{statement}
after the rally, calling the auctions ``despicable.'' He urged the
\href{http://www.achpr.org/}{African Commission on Human and Peoples'
Rights} to assist the Libyan authorities with the investigation that
they opened in response to CNN's report.

The Guardian
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration}{reported
in April} that West African migrants were being sold in modern-day slave
markets in Libya, based on information from the International
Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency. And Reuters
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-migrants-slavery/world-turns-blind-eye-to-libya-slave-trade-photographer-idUSKCN18D283}{reported
on the issue} in May.

The International Organization for Migration estimates that there are
\href{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-iom-libya/eu-should-pay-more-to-return-african-migrants-home-from-libya-malta-says-idUSKBN1672CJ}{700,000
to one million migrants} in Libya, and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/27/world/europe/italy-plans-naval-mission-off-libya-to-stop-migrant-boats.html?rref=collection\%2Ftimestopic\%2FLibya\&action=click\&contentCollection=world\&region=stream\&module=stream_unit\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=9\&pgtype=collection}{more
than 2,000} have died at sea this year.

Most of the migrants in Libya are fleeing armed conflict, persecution or
severe economic hardship in sub-Saharan Africa. Their journey usually
begins with a deadly trek through vast deserts to Libya and then
involves either braving the Mediterranean Sea on rickety boats headed to
Europe or
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/12/world/africa/migrants-africa-libya.html}{struggling
to survive} in one of the overcrowded detention centers run by smugglers
on the Libyan coastline.

Forced labor, sexual abuse and torture are widespread in these camps,
\href{http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/LY/DetainedAndDehumanised_en.pdf}{according
to the United Nations}.

Since the Arab Spring uprising of 2011 ended the brutal rule of Col.
Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's coast has became a hub for human trafficking
and smuggling. That has fueled the illegal migration crisis that Europe
has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/28/world/europe/africa-migrants-europe.html}{scrambling
to contain} since 2014.

Libya, which slid into chaos and civil war after the revolt, is now
divided among three main factions: a feeble but internationally backed
government in Tripoli; an ultraconservative Islamist government, also in
Tripoli; and an anti-Islamist government in the east.

The reactions on Saturday highlight one of the many challenges facing
the internationally recognized authorities in Libya, which are still
struggling to restore order, win popular support and restore basic
services like water and electricity.

The CNN report, published on Wednesday, detailed the horrors that
African migrants experience while trying to reach Europe in search of a
better life. It included video footage of a slave auction last month
outside Tripoli, where about a dozen migrants were sold as slaves in a
matter of minutes. That auction was one of many, CNN said.

The network attributed the recent emergence of slave markets in Libya to
the sharp
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/18/world/europe/migrant-crisis-italy-libya.html?rref=collection\%2Fbyline\%2Fpatrick-kingsley\&action=click\&contentCollection=undefined\&region=stream\&module=stream_unit\&version=latest\&contentPlacement=25\&pgtype=collection}{fall
in migrant arrivals} in Europe over the summer. The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/17/world/europe/italy-libya-migrant-crisis.html}{Italian}
government reportedly began paying the warlords controlling Libya's
coast to curb the flow of migrants earlier this year. In August alone,
the arrivals of migrants in Italy fell 85 percent.

This drop, CNN said, appears to have created a backlog of customers for
Libya's smugglers, who have responded by auctioning off migrants for as
little as \$400.

In his statement, Mr. Mahamat, of the African Union Commission,
announced that the union would hold talks with Libya and other
stakeholders in the region to find ``practical steps'' that would
``address the plight of the African migrants in Libya.''

He vowed that the union would ``spare no effort to help bring these acts
to an end.''
