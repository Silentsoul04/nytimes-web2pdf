\emph{--- From ``The Mountain'' (Simon \& Schuster, 2017, Page 167), a
collection of six short stories by Paul Yoon, author of ``Once the
Shore'' and ``Snow Hunters.''}

In the middle of the night, a woman sits alone on the ground outside,
ill and exhausted. She is a factory worker in China. A truck full of
people happens to pass by. It stops. A woman inside reaches down in a
gesture of care --- a surprisingly tender moment in an otherwise brutal
world. The narrator's description of the motion is perfect: ``She
reached down with a gentleness that reminded Faye of an arm underwater,
the completion of a stroke.''

Describing nonverbal communication is tricky. As human animals, we are
fluent in vast, complex languages of gesture and posture and expression.
We read the micromotions of the people around us so easily and
constantly that we're hardly even aware we're reading. But how do we
translate that nonverbal language into verbal language? There are plenty
of words for it, of course: People smirk, loom, flinch, slump, scowl,
tremble, stride, nod, stare. Even such vivid verbs, however, are only
rough approximations of the expressive richness of the motions they
describe.

An arm reaching down is one of the more familiar movements in the human
lexicon. It can express all kinds of things, from menace to boredom to
exhaustion. The narrator's description here transposes that familiar
gesture into a different element altogether. The end of a swimming
stroke is something we normally don't see; it happens as a kind of
footnote, underwater, to the visible part of the stroke. The drag on the
arm, which in the swimming stroke would be provided by the resistance of
the water, is here a result of an emotion, a gentleness.
