WASHINGTON — President Trump has escalated his fiery attacks on the news
media, seizing on a recent string of mistaken reports to bolster his
case that he is being persecuted by a left-leaning establishment out to
bring him down and fueling a national debate over truth, accountability
and a free press.

In a series of broadsides reflecting his own profound grievances while
also resonating with his populist conservative base, Mr. Trump
castigated ABC News for a [“horrendously inaccurate and dishonest
report,”](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/937145025359761408?lang=en)
declared that CNN’s slogan should be “[THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN
NEWS](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/939485131693322240)”
and insisted that a Washington Post reporter [“should be
fired](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/939634404267380736).”

While every president has groused about his coverage, Mr. Trump has
proved to be the most vocal and visceral news media critic in the Oval
Office in at least a generation. In recent days, news outlets have
provided him ammunition with reporting errors. But the barrage has
deepened concern among media executives about what they see as a
concerted campaign to discredit independent journalism.

The tension erupted Monday in the White House briefing room when Sarah
Huckabee Sanders, the president’s press secretary, engaged in a testy
exchange with reporters. She said bias in news reports has gotten “out
of control” and “should be taken seriously,” dismissing journalists who
attributed recent errors to honest mistakes that were corrected.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“You cannot say that it’s an honest mistake when you’re purposefully
putting out information that you know to be false,” she told reporters,
“or when you’re taking information that hasn’t been validated, that
hasn’t been offered any credibility, and that has been continually
denied by a number of people, including people with direct knowledge of
an instance.”

“Are you speaking about the president?” one reporter asked in light of
Mr. Trump’s own history of making claims that have not been validated
and have been continually denied.

While news organizations targeted by Mr. Trump have corrected factual
errors and in one recent case suspended a reporter, Mr. Trump has never
backed down, for instance, from unsubstantiated claims that President
[Barack
Obama](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/barack-obama)
wiretapped [Trump
Tower](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/04/us/politics/trump-obama-tap-phones.html)
or that millions of illegal immigrants [cast
votes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/23/us/politics/donald-trump-congress-democrats.html)
last year, swinging the popular tally against him.

Just last month, Mr. Trump shared with nearly 44 million Twitter
followers [anti-Muslim
videos](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/29/us/politics/trump-anti-muslim-videos-jayda-fransen.html)
without verifying them; one purported to show a Dutch boy being beaten
by a “Muslim migrant” who in fact was not a Muslim migrant. Mr. Trump
issued no correction, and Ms. Sanders at the time said it did not matter
if the video were real because “the threat is real.”

Mr. Trump has had a long history of interacting with the news media from
his days as a New York developer, but it was largely transactional as he
sought favorable coverage. During his business days, he planted items in
gossip columns and even called reporters and used a false name,
pretending to be his spokesman.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By his own account, he has always craved media attention, but his
encounters with the Washington press corps have turned increasingly
bitter. At one point, Mr. Trump labeled some outlets [“the enemy of the
American
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/17/business/trump-calls-the-news-media-the-enemy-of-the-people.html),”
and at another, he said, “It’s frankly
[disgusting](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/10/11/donald-trump-nbc-media-write-whatever-it-wants-sot.cnn)
the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write.”

For the most part, Mr. Trump’s blasts at the news media have been
rhetorical. But he has warned that he might go beyond name calling, such
as when [he
threatened](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/11/us/politics/trump-nbc-fcc-broadcast-license.html)
to try to revoke a broadcasting license for NBC after a [news
report](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/trump-wanted-dramatic-increase-nuclear-arsenal-meeting-military-leaders-n809701)
he challenged. Networks like NBC do not hold federal licenses
themselves, but their individual television stations do.

Mr. Trump’s administration has taken aim at CNN’s corporate ownership.
The Justice Department has [gone to
court](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/20/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-merger.html)
to block AT\&T’s purchase of Time Warner, which owns Turner
Broadcasting, CNN’s corporate parent. AT\&T officials have said the
department insisted that AT\&T divest either Turner Broadcasting or its
valuable DirecTV service in return for approval, which government
officials denied.

Analysts said Mr. Trump’s criticisms represented an effort to undermine
faith in journalism. “It is a common thing in the authoritarian playbook
to discredit the media so that they are the only source that can be
trusted,” said Indira Lakshmanan, who holds the Newmark chair in
journalism ethics at the Poynter Institute. “Making it so there is no
objective truth is the most dangerous thing of all of this.”

The raft of recent reporting errors made that easier. During a rally on
Friday in Florida, Mr. Trump berated news outlets. “Did you see all the
corrections the media has been making?” he asked. “They’ve been
apologizing left and right.”

He ramped up attacks over the weekend on Twitter, calling for the firing
of [“lonely Brian Ross at ABC
News”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/939480342779580416)
for
[misreporting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/02/us/brian-ross-suspended-abc.html)
that Mr. Trump as a candidate directed his adviser Michael T. Flynn to
contact Russians. (He did so after the election as president-elect.) He
denounced CNN for [erroneously
reporting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/08/business/media/cnn-correction-donald-trump-jr.html)
that his campaign received a heads-up email from WikiLeaks before it
released hacked Democratic Party documents. (The email came after the
release.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump later targeted Dave Weigel, a reporter for The Post, who
tweeted a [misleading
photograph](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/10/us/politics/trump-dave-weigel.html)
about the crowd size at Mr. Trump’s Florida rally. “Demand apology &
retraction from FAKE NEWS WaPo\!” [Mr. Trump
wrote](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/939616077356642304).
[Mr. Weigel did just that, deleting the picture and expressing
regret](https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/939616810684514304),
saying he did not realize it was taken before the rally started.
Unsatisfied, Mr. Trump said Mr. Weigel should be fired.

Mr. Trump’s supporters said that he has a point — that such mistakes
stem from a predisposition by reporters to believe the worst about him.
Rather than complain when Mr. Trump points out flawed stories, they
said, the news media should be more searching about its responsibility
to provide balanced coverage of the president.

“Naturally, the elite media responded — not by admonishing Weigel over
his inexcusably inaccurate trolling — but with their favorite claim that
Trump is the one man in America who does not have the First Amendment
right to criticize the media,” [wrote John
Nolte](http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2017/12/10/trump-blasts-wapos-dave-weigel-reporter-heckles-fake-photo/)
of Breitbart News, the site run by Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist,
Stephen K. Bannon.

Mr. Trump turned his attention on Monday to The New York Times,
disputing [an
article](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/09/us/politics/donald-trump-president.html)
describing his television habits. “Another false story, this time in the
Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day,” [he
wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/940223974985871360).
“Wrong\! Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I
consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the
‘dumbest man on television\!’ Bad Reporting.”

Mr. Trump posted the message about a half-hour after a segment on
MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” focusing on a line near the bottom of the
article reporting that Mr. Trump sometimes watched Mr. Lemon on CNN to
get worked up.

“We stand by our reporting, sourced from interviews with 60 advisers,
associates, friends and members of Congress, including many who interact
with President Trump every day,” said Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman
for The Times.

CNN issued a statement likening Mr. Trump to a bully. “In a world where
bullies torment kids on social media to devastating effect on a regular
basis with insults and name calling, it is sad to see our president
engaging in the very same behavior himself,” the statement said.
“Leaders should lead by example.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The effect of the news media criticism remains debated. A
[Politico/Morning
Consult](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/18/trump-media-fake-news-poll-243884)
poll found that 46 percent of Americans believe the news media makes up
stories about the president. A separate study by the Poynter Institute,
on the other hand, found that overall trust and confidence in the news
media, while low, has actually increased somewhat under Mr. Trump. The
partisan divide, however, has become pronounced. Among Democrats, nearly
75 percent expressed confidence in the news media compared with only 19
percent of Republicans.

While previous presidents criticized the news media, analysts said that
Mr. Trump’s attacks strike at the fundamental notion of truth in a way
that can make the customary response of news organizations standing by
their articles feel insufficient. It is not just the facts he is calling
into question, but the very institution of journalism, which some
believe demands a more vigorous reply from the mainstream media.

“When he attacks one of us, he’s actually attacking all of us,” said
Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times. “We’re now confronting a
guy who attacks us in ways that we’ve not seen before,” he added. “And I
think maybe we should be thinking about ways to push back not just on
behalf of our particular institutions but to push back on behalf of
journalism itself.”

But a common response seems unlikely. “Journalistic organizations are by
nature competitive, and it’s sort of hard for them to unite that way,”
said David Lauter, the Washington bureau chief for The Los Angeles
Times. “And I think there’s also always concern about making it seem
like you’re creating an institutional fight rather than just reporting
the news.”

Cameron Barr, a managing editor at The Post, said competition is “in the
DNA” of news organizations. “I’m a little wary of suggestions that
somehow journalistic institutions should be banding together against the
chief executive,” he said. “I think that quickly ends up in an
uncomfortable place, to say the least.”
