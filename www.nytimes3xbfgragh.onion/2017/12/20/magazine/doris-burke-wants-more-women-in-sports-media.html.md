**In September, you were named a regular ESPN N.B.A. game analyst,
making you the first woman to do so full time at the national level. How
did you get into sports?** My dad was a sports fan, and college
basketball was appointment viewing. I distinctly remember watching Al
McGuire, Billy Packer and Dick Enberg and loving every single second of
their coverage. When I was 7, we moved to Manasquan, where I picked up
the game of basketball. I probably had to walk 100 yards to the
basketball court from my front door. I won this purple jacket in a
free-throw-shooting contest, and that would be my warm-up jacket — there
was a set of hedges in front of my home, and I would take my ball and
run out of those hedges like I was running out of the locker room onto
the basketball floor and go emulate everything I had seen.

**You were the point guard on the Providence College basketball team. Do
you still play?** The last time I played basketball it was eight weeks
after I delivered my second child. You know that expression — the mind
believes and the body would not follow? That was me on that particular
day.

**How did you get into sports media?** My career is a happy accident. In
1990, I was an assistant coach at Providence College, but I knew I
wanted to get married and have children. I did not think I could be a
great basketball coach and be a great mom. There were women doing that
at a high level at that time — Pat Summitt and Rene Portland — but I
wasn’t sure it would work out very well. The year I left coaching to get
married, Providence College decided to put its women’s basketball games
on radio, and because I had played and coached in the program, the
athletic director asked if I’d like to give it a try.

**How do you approach calling a game?** Dick Vitale was adamant that the
viewer is not tuning in to hear how smart you are — the viewer is tuning
in because he or she wants to enjoy the game. When I was covering men’s
college basketball, I thought that I had to prove that I was a smart
basketball person, because there weren’t many female analysts. I always
wore this navy blazer, because the man next to me was in a blazer and a
tie, which I thought projected a certain air. But once, my son and I
were watching the Olympic announcers clearly enjoying themselves, and he
told me that when I’m having fun on the air, the viewer is having fun.

**Does it ever sink in that you could be someone’s Dick Vitale?** It’s a
terrific feeling when young women tell me they’re excited for me — I
think it makes them aware of what is possible. We are in a seminal
moment for women in sports broadcasting — Beth Mowins calling a “Monday
Night Football” game may be the most important thing I’ve seen a woman
do in this field in my time. ESPN has taken a lot of hits, but I believe
the one thing you cannot be critical of is its role in revolutionizing
sports broadcasting for women and its willingness to put women in roles
they have been traditionally excluded from. John Skipper, our president,
has changed things for women. *\[Update: After this interview was
conducted, The Boston Globe published* [*a
report*](https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2017/12/14/women-who-worked-espn-say-its-problems-far-beyond-barstool-sports/L1v9HJIvtnHuBPiMru6yGM/story.html)
*on complaints of sexual harassment and misconduct at ESPN. And on
Monday, Dec. 18, John Skipper*
[*resigned*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/18/sports/espn-john-skipper-resigns.html)*,
citing the need to treat a substance addiction.\]*

**What are the story lines you’re most excited about for this season?**
It’s funny: The casual fan might say Golden State is going to win the
championship in June, there’s nothing really interesting going on.
That’s not exactly the case, right? All of a sudden, the young players
for the Boston Celtics that needed to take a step forward, Jaylen Brown
and Jayson Tatum, have done so in this incredible way. Even in the
absence of Gordon Hayward, the Celtics are crushing it right now. LeBron
James — we take that man for granted. He’s made greatness seem ordinary.
I’m guilty of it, too\! I voted him third in the M.V.P. voting, so I’m
criticizing myself as much as everybody else. The emergence of Giannis
Antetokounmpo — this guy at his size is doing things where it’s just
eye-popping, and he’s so young, still\! The Golden State Warriors are
playing at their highest level — it is truly extraordinary and beautiful
basketball to watch. It all captures my imagination, to be honest with
you. I can’t wait for the next game.
