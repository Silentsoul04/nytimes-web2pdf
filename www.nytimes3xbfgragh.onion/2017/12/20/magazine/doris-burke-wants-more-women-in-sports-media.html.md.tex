\textbf{In September, you were named a regular ESPN N.B.A. game analyst,
making you the first woman to do so full time at the national level. How
did you get into sports?} My dad was a sports fan, and college
basketball was appointment viewing. I distinctly remember watching Al
McGuire, Billy Packer and Dick Enberg and loving every single second of
their coverage. When I was 7, we moved to Manasquan, where I picked up
the game of basketball. I probably had to walk 100 yards to the
basketball court from my front door. I won this purple jacket in a
free-throw-shooting contest, and that would be my warm-up jacket ---
there was a set of hedges in front of my home, and I would take my ball
and run out of those hedges like I was running out of the locker room
onto the basketball floor and go emulate everything I had seen.

\textbf{You were the point guard on the Providence College basketball
team. Do you still play?} The last time I played basketball it was eight
weeks after I delivered my second child. You know that expression ---
the mind believes and the body would not follow? That was me on that
particular day.

\textbf{How did you get into sports media?} My career is a happy
accident. In 1990, I was an assistant coach at Providence College, but I
knew I wanted to get married and have children. I did not think I could
be a great basketball coach and be a great mom. There were women doing
that at a high level at that time --- Pat Summitt and Rene Portland ---
but I wasn't sure it would work out very well. The year I left coaching
to get married, Providence College decided to put its women's basketball
games on radio, and because I had played and coached in the program, the
athletic director asked if I'd like to give it a try.

\textbf{How do you approach calling a game?} Dick Vitale was adamant
that the viewer is not tuning in to hear how smart you are --- the
viewer is tuning in because he or she wants to enjoy the game. When I
was covering men's college basketball, I thought that I had to prove
that I was a smart basketball person, because there weren't many female
analysts. I always wore this navy blazer, because the man next to me was
in a blazer and a tie, which I thought projected a certain air. But
once, my son and I were watching the Olympic announcers clearly enjoying
themselves, and he told me that when I'm having fun on the air, the
viewer is having fun.

\textbf{Does it ever sink in that you could be someone's Dick Vitale?}
It's a terrific feeling when young women tell me they're excited for me
--- I think it makes them aware of what is possible. We are in a seminal
moment for women in sports broadcasting --- Beth Mowins calling a
``Monday Night Football'' game may be the most important thing I've seen
a woman do in this field in my time. ESPN has taken a lot of hits, but I
believe the one thing you cannot be critical of is its role in
revolutionizing sports broadcasting for women and its willingness to put
women in roles they have been traditionally excluded from. John Skipper,
our president, has changed things for women. \emph{{[}Update: After this

citing the need to treat a substance addiction.{]}}

\textbf{What are the story lines you're most excited about for this
season?} It's funny: The casual fan might say Golden State is going to
win the championship in June, there's nothing really interesting going
on. That's not exactly the case, right? All of a sudden, the young
players for the Boston Celtics that needed to take a step forward,
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, have done so in this incredible way. Even
in the absence of Gordon Hayward, the Celtics are crushing it right now.
LeBron James --- we take that man for granted. He's made greatness seem
ordinary. I'm guilty of it, too! I voted him third in the M.V.P. voting,
so I'm criticizing myself as much as everybody else. The emergence of
Giannis Antetokounmpo --- this guy at his size is doing things where
it's just eye-popping, and he's so young, still! The Golden State
Warriors are playing at their highest level --- it is truly
extraordinary and beautiful basketball to watch. It all captures my
imagination, to be honest with you. I can't wait for the next game.
