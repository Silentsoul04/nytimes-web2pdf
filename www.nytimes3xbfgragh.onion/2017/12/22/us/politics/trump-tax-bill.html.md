WASHINGTON — President Trump signed the most consequential tax
legislation in three decades on Friday, even as he complained that he
has not been given credit for his administration’s accomplishments
during a turbulent first year.

Mr. Trump decided against doing a formal signing ceremony early next
year because television news networks questioned whether he would keep
his promise to sign the legislation before Christmas.

Mr. Trump said he saw the coverage Friday morning and hastily called his
staff to say that the legislation needed to be signed “now,” prompting a
last-minute Oval Office ceremony for the president’s greatest
achievement in his first year in office.

“We did a rush job today,” Mr. Trump said at the bill signing. “It’s not
fancy, but it’s the Oval Office. It’s the great Oval Office.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It marked another improvisational moment in a presidency already known
for abandoning the norms of the office.

The bill was the most significant legislative victory for Mr. Trump, who
has struggled during his first year in office to pass major bills that
would deliver on campaign promises, even with Republicans having the
majority in both chambers of Congress. Republicans promise the new tax
law will benefit the middle class, but Democrats have warned that the
law could be harmful to many lower-income taxpayers and to the nation’s
fiscal health.

“It’s going to be a tremendous thing for the American people,” Mr. Trump
said.

Before signing the legislation on Friday, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter
post that companies were celebrating the bill’s passage with bonuses for
workers.

During the signing ceremony, Mr. Trump said, “Corporations are literally
going wild over this.” A handful of companies, including AT\&T, which is
seeking government approval of a major acquisition of Time Warner, have
announced that they would give bonuses to
workers.

There was some discussion in Congress and at the White House that Mr.
Trump should consider delaying the signing until early 2018 as a way to
delay automatic spending cuts that could have been triggered by the tax
cuts. In addition, some companies said that delay would give them more
time to adjust to the major changes that the new tax code will mean for
their businesses.

However, once Congress reached a deal this week to avoid the possibility
of the spending cuts, White House officials signaled that Mr. Trump
wanted to sign the bill into law as soon as possible.

Mr. Trump often reacts to television news, and Friday was no different.
The president delayed his travel to Florida for the holidays by an hour
to stave off potential criticism.

“Every one of the networks was saying, ‘Will he keep his promise?’ ” the
president said.

Shortly after 10 a.m., Mr. Trump announced in a [Twitter
post](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/944222979147337728)
that the bill would be signed “in 30 minutes.”

Earlier in the morning, the president suggested that he would not get
credit for what he said were extraordinary accomplishments for a first
year.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Under the new tax law, individual rates will be lowered, but those cuts
are set to expire in 2025. The standard deduction, which will almost
double, is likely to become more popular. The tax credit for children
will also double, which Republicans have said will benefit lower-income
families. The largest cut by far in the new tax law — which will not
expire — benefits corporations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new law has been criticized by lawmakers representing states with
high taxes, because the bill caps state and local tax deductions at
$10,000.

The law also eliminates the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that most
people have health insurance or pay a penalty. Mr. Trump has said that
amounted to repealing President Barack Obama’s signature health care
law, but 8.8 million Americans signed up for coverage, according to
figures his administration announced on Thursday. The law is not
repealed, but the mandate had been considered an important feature of
it.

Mr. Trump also signed a stopgap spending bill in order to avoid a
government shutdown. In addition to extending government funding, the
bill includes $4 billion for missile defense, among other provisions.
