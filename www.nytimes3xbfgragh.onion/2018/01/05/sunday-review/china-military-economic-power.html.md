# A Chinese Empire Reborn

The Communist Party’s emerging empire is more the result of force than a

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I am the son of two empires, the United States and China. I was born in
and raised around Washington in the Nixon-to-Reagan era, but my parents
grew up in
[villages](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/12/04/world/asia/04taishan.html)
in southern China. My father was [a member of the People’s Liberation
Army](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/18/world/asia/mongolian-warriors-and-communist-soldiers-a-frontier-town-in-china.html)
in the 1950s, the first decade of Communist rule, before he soured on
the revolution and left for Hong Kong.

So it was with excitement that I landed in Beijing in April 2008 to
start an assignment with The New York Times that stretched to almost a
decade. I had just spent nearly four years reporting on [the bloody
failure of the American imperial project in
Iraq](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/06/03/weekinreview/03wong.html),
and now I was in the metropole that was building a new world order.

China had entered a honeymoon phase with other nations. For years,
anticipation had built for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Though China had
[suppressed a Tibetan
uprising](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/03/24/world/asia/24tibet.html)
that spring, it earned international good will after a [devastating
earthquake](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/05/13/world/asia/13scene.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

People flocked to Beijing for China’s “coming out” party. Foreign
leaders gawked at [gleaming
architecture](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/07/13/arts/design/13build.html)
and [opening
ceremonies](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/08/09/sports/olympics/09china.html)
that signaled the nation’s ambitions. After the festivities ended, the
world arrived at another inflection point — the implosion of the
American financial system and the global economic crisis. China’s growth
buttressed both the world economy and a belief among its officials that
its economic and political systems could rival those of the United
States.

Though unabashedly authoritarian, China was a magnet. I was among many
who thought it might forge a confident and more open identity while
ushering in a vibrant era of new ideas, values and culture, one
befitting its superpower status. When I ended my China assignment last
year, I no longer had such expectations.

From
[trade](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/09/business/donald-trump-china-trade-xi-jinping.html)
to the
[internet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/17/business/dealbook/alibaba-sales-revenue-first-quarter-profit.html),
from [higher
education](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/02/magazine/the-parachute-generation.html)
to
[Hollywood](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/29/world/asia/wang-jianlin-abillionaire-at-the-intersection-of-business-and-power-in-china.html),
China is shaping the world in ways that people have only begun to grasp.
Yet the emerging imperium is more a result of the Communist Party’s
exercise of hard power, including [economic
coercion](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/12/21/world/asia/21china.html),
than the product of a gravitational pull of Chinese ideas or
[contemporary
culture](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/world/asia/culture-and-control-in-china-series.html).

Of the global powers that dominated the 19th century, China alone is a
rejuvenated empire. The Communist Party commands a vast territory that
the ethnic-Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty cobbled together through
war and diplomacy. And the dominion could grow: China is using its
military to test potential control of disputed borderlands from the
[South China
Sea](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/06/17/world/asia/spratly-archipelago-china-trying-to-bolster-its-claims-plants-islands-in-disputed-waters.html)
to the
[Himalayas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/26/world/asia/dolam-plateau-china-india-bhutan.html),
while firing up nationalism at home. Once again, states around the world
pay homage to the court, as in 2015 during a huge [military
parade](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/03/world/asia/beijing-turns-into-ghost-town-as-it-gears-up-for-military-parade.html?_r=0).

For decades, the United States was a global beacon for those who
embraced certain values — the rule of law, free speech, clean government
and human rights. Even if policy often fell short of those stated
ideals, American “soft power” remained as potent as its armed forces. In
the post-Soviet era, political figures and scholars regarded that
American way of [amassing power through
attraction](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148580?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
as a central element of forging a modern empire.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China’s rise is a blunt counterpoint. From 2009 onward, Chinese power in
domestic and international realms has become synonymous with brute
strength, bribery and browbeating — and the Communist Party’s empire is
getting
stronger.

At home, the party has imprisoned [rights
lawyers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/23/world/asia/china-crackdown-human-rights-lawyers.html),
[strangled the
internet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/14/opinion/net-neutrality-china-internet.html),
compelled companies and universities to [install party
cells](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/12/opinion/china-the-party-corporate-complex.html),
and planned for a potentially Orwellian [“social credit”
system](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/04/business/china-alibaba-privacy.html?_r=0).
Abroad, it is building military installations on disputed Pacific reefs
and infiltrating cybernetworks. It pushes [the “One Belt, One Road”
infrastructure
initiative](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/13/business/china-railway-one-belt-one-road-1-trillion-plan.html?_r=0)
across Eurasia, which will have benefits for other nations but will also
allow China to pressure them to do business with Chinese state-owned
enterprises, [as it has done in recent
years](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/12/21/world/asia/21china.html)
throughout Asia and Africa.

So far, Chinese soft power plays a minor role. For one thing, the party
insists on [tight control of cultural
production](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/world/asia/culture-and-control-in-china-series.html),
so Chinese popular culture has little global appeal next to that of the
United States or even South Korea.

No nation knows China’s hard ways better than Norway. China [punished it
by breaking diplomatic and economic
ties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/19/world/europe/china-norway-nobel-liu-xiaobo.html)
for six years after the independent Nobel committee in 2010 gave the
Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy writer imprisoned in China
(he [died of cancer in
July](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/13/world/asia/liu-xiaobo-dead.html)).

President Xi Jinping is the avatar of the new imperium. The 19th Party
Congress in October was his [victory
lap](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/24/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-communist-party.html).
Party officials enshrined “Xi Jinping Thought” in the party
constitution, putting him on par with Mao Zedong. Mr. Xi said China had
entered a “new era” of strength and the party would be the arbiter of
public life. Mr. Xi holds appeal for foreign leaders aspiring to
strongman status — President Trump openly admires him.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many Chinese people told me they still believed the country’s top
leaders looked out for ordinary people, even if the party was rotting.
This belief was rooted in abstract hope rather than empirical evidence.
It was like peering through the [toxic air enveloping Chinese
cities](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/08/04/sunday-review/life-in-a-toxic-country.html)
in search of blue sky.

The culture of hard power goes from top to bottom. In the provinces,
party officials move quickly to suppress any challenges to their
authority. When they sense rising mass resistance, they buy off or
imprison the leaders.

I saw this in my first year in China, when officials separately broke
the will of parents furious over [deadly tainted
milk](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/10/17/world/asia/17milk.html)
and ones grieving over thousands of children [who had died in shoddily
built
schools](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/05/world/asia/05china.html)
during the Sichuan earthquake. I learned this was typical of the
approach taken by Chinese officials. Most Chinese do not run afoul of
the party, but those who do pay a high price.

The abuse of power is frequent, and many Chinese say corruption is their
top concern. All other issues, from environmental degradation to [wealth
inequality](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html),
are linked to it. Mr. Xi is canny enough to capitalize on the
discontent: He leads an anticorruption drive that allows him to oust
rivals and enforce party discipline.

None of that results in the rule of law. And China’s domestic security
budget has exceeded that of its military in recent years, even as both
grow rapidly, highlighting the nation’s investment in hard power.

I learned in 2016 that Tashi Wangchuk, a young entrepreneur who had
spoken to me about his advocacy for broader Tibetan language education,
had been detained in his hometown, Yushu, by police officers. In
microblog posts, Mr. Tashi had asked local officials to promote true
bilingual education, and he had [appeared in 2015 in Times articles and
video](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/11/29/world/asia/china-tibet-language-education.html?_r=0).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Tashi is the kind of citizen China should value — someone working
within the law to recommend policies that would benefit ordinary people
and ease tensions. But two years later, Mr. Tashi remains imprisoned. A
court tried him on Thursday for “inciting separatism” despite [criticism
from Western diplomats and human rights
groups](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/18/world/asia/china-tibetan-education-advocate.html).

The party’s style of rule threatens to turn sentiments against China
even as the empire grows in stature. History teaches us about an
inevitable dialectic: Power creates resistance. While the state can bend
people to its will, those people meet it with fear and suspicion. The
United States learns this lesson each time it [over-relies on hard
power](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/vietnam-67).

I traveled often to the [frontier
regions](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/07/25/world/asia/25tibet.html)
because it was there that [the dynamic of power and
resistance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/19/world/asia/china-climate-change-nu-river-greenhouse-gases.html)
was most evident, and that I got the [clearest
look](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/10/25/world/asia/china-climate-change-resettlement.html)
at how China treats [its most vulnerable
citizens](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/02/26/world/asia/26tibet.html),
those [outside mainstream ethnic Han
culture](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/10/25/world/asia/china-climate-change-resettlement.html).
No other areas better embody the idea of imperial China. Conquered by
the Manchus and reabsorbed by Mao, [these
lands](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/10/24/world/asia/living-in-chinas-expanding-deserts.html)
make up at least one-quarter of Chinese territory. Party officials fear
they are like the Central Asian regions under Soviet rule — always on
the verge of rebellion and eager to break
free.

In October 2016, I quietly entered the sprawling Tibetan Buddhist
settlement of [Larung
Gar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/28/world/asia/china-takes-a-chain-saw-to-a-center-of-tibetan-buddhism.html)
and watched the government-ordered demolition of homes of monks and
nuns. In parts of Xinjiang populated by ethnic Uighurs, the tension is
even greater, fueled by [cycles of violence and
repression](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/07/12/weekinreview/12wong.html).
Uighurs speak in hushed tones of [restrictions on
Islam](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/10/19/world/asia/19xinjiang.html)
and mass detentions. Signs across Xinjiang forbid long beards and full
veils, and surveillance cameras are everywhere. On my last reporting
trip in China, to [the Silk Road oasis of
Kashgar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/19/world/asia/dodging-chinese-police-in-kashgar-a-silk-road-oasis-town.html),
I saw police patrols in riot gear rounding up young men.

An important bellwether is Hong Kong, the former British colony from
which my parents emigrated to the United States. On this southern
frontier, as in the west, the party works [to silence the voices of
students, politicians and other residents critical of its
rule](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/17/world/asia/hong-kong-joshua-wong-jailed-umbrella-movement.html).
Agents have even abducted booksellers. But those moves have actually led
to more resistance and strengthened [Hong Kong and Cantonese
identity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/08/world/asia/hong-kong-people-looking-in-mirror-see-fading-chinese-identity.html).
They have also stoked greater fears of Beijing among citizens of Taiwan,
the self-governing island that the party longs to rule.

It is not a stretch to say the party’s ways of governance perpetuate a
lack of trust by the Chinese in their institutions and fellow citizens.
And its international policies light the kindling of resistance
overseas, from
[Australia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/19/world/australia/australia-china-backlash-influence.html)
to
[Ghana](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/06/07/world/africa/ghana-arrests-chinese-in-gold-mining-regions.html).

Chinese citizens and the world would benefit if China turns out to be an
empire whose power is based as much on ideas, values and culture as on
military and economic might. It was more enlightened under its most
glorious dynasties. But for now, the Communist Party embraces hard power
and coercion, and this could well be what replaces the fading liberal
hegemony of the United States on the global stage.

It will not lead to a grand vision of world order. Instead, before us
looms a
void.
