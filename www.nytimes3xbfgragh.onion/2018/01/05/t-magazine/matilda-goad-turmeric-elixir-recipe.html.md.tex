\emph{To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the
homemade recipes they count on to detox, cleanse --- and refresh.}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2018/01/02/t-magazine/oakImage-1514916795764/oakImage-1514916795764-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

``When I have my back issues, that's really just my body screaming at
me,'' says the creative consultant Matilda Goad. ``I always think I'm
not stressed out. But it is hard being a one-man band.'' Goad, 28, has
gained a reputation in London thanks to her work for everyone from
Shrimps (the purveyors of faux-fur coats beloved by millennials) to the
traditional furniture brand Soane Britain; in February, she launched her
\href{http://matildagoad.com/}{eponymous home-goods website}, which
sells the scallop-edged rattan lampshade that is one of this year's most
coveted décor items.

Behind the scenes, in lieu of drawing a bath or making a cup of hot
cocoa after a long day in the studio, **** Goad prepares a turmeric
latte as part of her nightly de-stressing routine. The drink is part of
her active approach to wellness to keep her stressors in check; she also
schedules regular cranial osteopathy, reflexology and acupuncture
sessions with the **** local Ladbroke Grove practitioners. It was a chef
friend who introduced Goad to ``golden milk,'' a warming blend of spices
and turmeric served in coconut milk that is prized for its
anti-inflammatory properties. Rather than purchasing a ready-made
option, Goad prefers the process of making her own homemade brew. She
picks up the ingredients from the Spice Shop off Portobello Road and
assembles it mostly by eye, smelling and tasting the mixture and then
making adjustments.

Goad counterbalances the drink's all-embracing soporific effect with a
box-set binge (right now, the terrifying crime series ``The Tunnel'' is
in her DVR). ``It's like a hug,'' she says of sipping the evening
elixir. ``It switches me into a different mentality. You're certainly
not going to reply to an email after you've drunk this.''

Here, she shares the recipe with T.

\subsubsection{Matilda Goad's Turmeric and Coconut-Milk
Elixir}\label{matilda-goads-turmeric-and-coconut-milk-elixir}}

∙ ½ a turmeric root, grated and chopped

∙ ½ teaspoon grated nutmeg

∙ ½ teaspoon dried cinnamon

∙ ½ teaspoon cardamom

∙ 1 cup coconut milk

1. Add one cup of coconut milk to a pouring pan. (Goad likes Labour \&
Wait's
\href{https://www.labourandwait.co.uk/products/enamel-milk-pan}{enamel
milk pan}.)

2. Peel and then grate one small turmeric root, before chopping slightly
and adding to the pan.

3. Grate a little nutmeg, and then add it to the pan together with the
cinnamon and cardamom.

4. Keep on a low heat stirring regularly for around five minutes until
slightly steaming. Do not boil as the milk will burn.

5. Check for taste and add more spice as required.

6. Once ready, use a wooden spoon to strain the turmeric from the liquid
as you transfer into a cup. For extra comfort, warm the cup with hot
water before pouring the liquid from the pan. Makes one serving.
