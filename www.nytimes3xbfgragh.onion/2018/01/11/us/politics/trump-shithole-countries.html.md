WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday balked at an immigration deal
that would include protections for people from Haiti and some nations in
Africa, demanding to know at a White House meeting why he should accept
immigrants from “shithole countries” rather than from places like
Norway, according to people with direct knowledge of the conversation.

Mr. Trump’s remarks, the latest example of his penchant for racially
tinged remarks denigrating immigrants, left members of Congress from
both parties attending the meeting in the Oval Office alarmed and
mystified. He made them during a discussion of an emerging bipartisan
deal to give legal status to immigrants illegally brought to the United
States as children, those with knowledge of the conversation said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting.

When Mr. Trump heard that Haitians were among those who would benefit
from the proposed deal, he asked whether they could be left out of the
plan, asking, “Why do we want people from Haiti here?”

The comments were reminiscent of [ones the president made last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html)
in an Oval Office meeting with cabinet officials and administration
aides, during which he complained about admitting Haitians to the
country, saying that they all had AIDS, as well as Nigerians, who he
said would never go back to their “huts,” according to officials who
heard the statements in person or were briefed on the remarks by people
who had. The White House vehemently denied last month that Mr. Trump
made those remarks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a written statement, Raj Shah, the White House deputy press
secretary, did not deny the account of the meeting on Thursday or
directly address Mr. Trump’s comments.

“Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries,
but President Trump will always fight for the American people,” Mr. Shah
said. “Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President
Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger
by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy
and assimilate into our great nation.”

But the president’s vulgar language on a delicate issue left the fate of
the broader immigration debate in limbo and had the potential to torpedo
the chances of achieving the deal being sought to protect about 800,000
undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. And they
drew a backlash from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, many of whom
called Mr. Trump’s utterances unacceptable at best and plainly racist at
worst.

Representative Mia Love, a Republican of Utah who is of Haitian descent,
demanded an apology from the president, saying his comments were
“unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nation’s
values.”

## A Year Later, Trump Is Less Popular Across Voting Blocs. See by How Much.

President Trump’s approval rating fell across many demographic groups
over his first year in office, including among those seen as important
to his base.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation,” Ms. Love
went on in an emotional statement that noted her heritage and that said
her parents “never took a thing” from the government while achieving the
American dream. “The president must apologize to both the American
people and the nations he so wantonly maligned.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As an American, I am ashamed of the president,” said Representative
Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois. “His comments are
disappointing, unbelievable, but not surprising.” He added, we can now
“say with 100 percent confidence that the president is a racist who
does not share the values enshrined in our Constitution or Declaration
of Independence.”

The reactions were extraordinary bipartisan rebukes to a sitting
president, but they only fanned what has been a long-simmering debate
over Mr. Trump’s views and talk on race.

Mr. Trump sought to have the final word late Thursday, [posting on
Twitter shortly before
midnight](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/951675713089888256):
“The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our
country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the
process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans.
We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery & Chain. USA\!”

As a candidate, Mr. Trump, who rose to political prominence questioning
the validity of President Barack Obama’s birth certificate, branded
Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, called for a ban on Muslims
entering the United States and was slow to disavow the support of the
former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

As the president, Mr. Trump has ordered a broad immigration crackdown
while privately railing against immigrants from predominantly black
countries and has repeatedly stoked racial divisions, denouncing “both
sides” for violence after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville,
Va., and singling out black athletes for failing to stand for the
national anthem before their games.

The episode at the White House, first [reported by The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html?utm_term=.8de714470fbf),
unfolded as Mr. Trump was hosting a meeting with Senator Lindsey Graham,
Republican of South Carolina, and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of
Illinois, who are working to codify the protections in the Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, the Obama-era initiative
that provided temporary work permits and reprieves from deportation to
immigrants brought to the United States as children by their parents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Also present were Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of
California and the majority leader; Senator David Perdue, Republican of
Georgia; Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas; and Representative
Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the chairman of the
Judiciary Committee.

None of the lawmakers would comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks.

The plan outlined by Mr. Graham and Mr. Durbin, according to people
familiar with it, would also include more than $2.5 billion for border
security and a grant of protected status for the parents of the
immigrants, known as Dreamers, who would be barred from sponsoring their
parents for citizenship.

Mr. Trump grew angry as the group detailed another aspect of the deal —
a move to end the diversity visa lottery program and use some of the
50,000 visas that are annually distributed as part of the program to
protect vulnerable populations who have been living in the United States
under what is known as Temporary Protected Status. That was when Mr.
Durbin mentioned Haiti, prompting the president’s criticism.

When the discussion turned to African nations, those with knowledge of
the conversation added, Mr. Trump asked why he would want “all these
people from shithole countries,” adding that the United States should
admit more people from places like Norway.

About 83 percent of Norway’s population is ethnic Norwegian, according
to a 2017 [C.I.A. fact
book](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html),
making the country overwhelmingly white.

Mr. Trump has long argued that the United States should base legal
immigration on merit and skills rather than family ties, seeking new
entrants who are highly educated, capable of assimilating and unlikely
to use government programs for the poor. Some people familiar with his
comments argued privately on Thursday night that the president had only
tried to press that point, using salty language.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But it was the language he used that shocked and appalled many lawmakers
and created a public outcry — the vulgar phrase Mr. Trump uttered
quickly began trending on Twitter — overshadowing the substance of the
DACA talks, and with it, the future of the immigrants at risk of
deportation should those discussions fail.

Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and the
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, called the president’s
closed-door comments “yet another confirmation of his racially
insensitive and ignorant views” and said they reinforced “the concerns
that we hear every day, that the president’s slogan, ‘Make America Great
Again,’ is really code for ‘Make America White Again.’”

Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, described the
comments as “the most odious and insidious racism masquerading poorly as
immigration policy,” and argued that they would make it more difficult
for the two parties to reach consensus on an immigration deal.

“It inflames and encourages the worst instinct and the basest dark side
of immigration issues,” Mr. Blumenthal said. He added that he had spoken
with several Senate colleagues who expressed “a combination of disbelief
and a sense of repugnance” at what the president had said.

Mr. Durbin spoke with reporters briefly after the White House gathering,
but did not share what the president had said. Looking dejected, he said
he and Mr. Graham had gone to meet with Mr. Trump hoping to get the
president’s blessing for their bipartisan plan.

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">After President Trump used vulgar
language about immigrants, TV news grappled with a question: Were his
comments
racist?</span>](https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2018/01/15/us/politics/tv-news-still/tv-news-still-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The president is not prepared to do that at this moment,” Mr. Durbin
said, adding, “I don’t know what happens next.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The meeting had gotten off to a grim start after Mr. Durbin and Mr.
Graham, who had been summoned by Mr. Trump to discuss their compromise
proposal, arrived to find a gaggle of Republicans they had not expected,
including immigration hard-liners who have been skeptical of a DACA
deal, filing into the room to discuss the plan.

One of them, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, later offered a
blistering appraisal of the Durbin-Graham deal, calling it “a joke of a
proposal” and arguing that Democrats had not offered Republicans
“anything legitimate in return” for accepting legal status for the
Dreamers.

The White House session was the second time this week that Mr. Trump has
met with members of Congress to address the fate of the Dreamers, whose
protections under DACA are set to expire in March after Mr. Trump [moved
to rescind the
policy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/05/us/politics/trump-daca-dreamers-immigration.html)
in the fall.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump convened a televised bipartisan negotiating
session on the issue in which he said he wanted lawmakers to negotiate a
“bill of love” for the DACA recipients and tasked the Democratic and
Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate to negotiate a final
deal.

Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and the No. 2 Senate
Republican, said Thursday that any immigration compromise could not
simply be hammered out by a small group of senators, referring to Mr.
Durbin and Mr. Graham.

“I think what the president told them is it’s fine for them to have
negotiated what they think is a reasonable proposal, but what they need
to do is share that with others so that it will have broad enough
support to actually get passed,” Mr. Cornyn said, adding, “We need to
have more than six votes for a proposal.”

When he first moved to rescind the DACA program, Mr. Trump gave
lawmakers six months to come up with a replacement. But Democrats have
pressed to include a solution in a broad spending package, which must be
completed by a deadline of next Friday, when a short-term bill funding
the government will expire. They are under extraordinary pressure from
their progressive base to withhold their votes to keep the government
open unless the immigration measure is included.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of the Senate negotiators, Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, cast
doubt on passing a bill by that deadline. But he expressed hope that the
deal being put together by Mr. Durbin’s group could move ahead soon.

“It’s the only game in town,” Mr. Flake said. “There’s no other bill.”
