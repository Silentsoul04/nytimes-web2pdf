Snakes move in mysterious ways. Sometimes they slither along in the
grass as you might expect, if snakes are ever expected.

Sometimes they rise straight up as if levitating. They leap across wide
gaps. [They even
fly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/science/100000002721454/sciencetake-flying-snakes.html),
some of them, or at least glide, launching themselves into the air from
trees they have climbed.

And then there’s [the sidewinder, which takes its name from its hypnotic
motion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/09/science/secrets-of-the-sidewinder.html).

Their movements have captured the attention of scientists and poets
alike. The scientists, like Bruce Jayne, at the University of
Cincinnati, observe and measure, deciphering what muscles the animals
use to wind and bend their way along the ground, through the grass or up
a tree.

But poets also have their findings about snakes. [Emily Dickinson, whose
powers of
observation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/17/science/emily-dickinson-lost-gardens.html)
would put many a field researcher to shame, wrote in a poem called “[A
narrow Fellow in the
Grass](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49909/a-narrow-fellow-in-the-grass-1096)”
of “a Whip Lash Unbraiding in the Sun,” which, when investigated,
“wrinkled and was gone.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And Rudyard Kipling, no mean chronicler of animals himself, although he
gave them human personalities, describes the progress of the [great
python Kaa, as he “seemed to pour his way across the
ground.”](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/jngl-Hunting.html)

That description is close to the kind of locomotion that Dr. Jayne and
his graduate student, Steven J. Newman, analyzed in a recent issue of
the [Journal of Experimental
Biology](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/early/2017/12/05/jeb.166199).

Unlike most snake forms of movement, this one involves moving in a
straight line, with no bending. It is not swift, as Kaa’s progress was
in Kipling’s “Jungle Book,” but it is eerily liquid. Slyly, slowly, the
snake flows without bending.

The motion had not escaped students of snakes. A scientist named Hans
Lissmann described it about 70 years ago and produced a hypothesis about
what muscles the snakes used to propel themselves, and how those muscles
acted.

Lissmann, Dr. Jayne said, [“did some classic work”
on<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“rectilinear
locomotion,](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/26/4/368.full.pdf)”
(scientific language that suggests why the world needs poets).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Jayne said, “We had an extremely good idea of all of the movements,”
and Lissmann hypothesized how the muscles might work. “But what we were
really lacking were any direct observations of how the muscles work,”
Dr. Jayne said.

To do those observations, Mr. Newman inserted fine wire electrodes in
the snakes’ muscles to record their activity, something like the way
sensors record heart activity in an electrocardiogram.

What the scientists found was that Lissmann was mostly right, but not
exactly so. Here’s how it works:

As the snake is moving forward, a muscle in its belly skin shortens the
skin and stays tensed. Then a muscle running forward from the tip of one
rib to the skin tenses to pull the skeleton and body forward over the
skin.

Another muscle that runs toward the tail from the middle of a rib to the
skin pulls the skin forward.

Lissmann did not expect the skin muscle to stay tensed, and he thought
the skin muscles did the work of pulling the body forward, whereas it is
the muscle running from the tip of a rib to the skin.

Why do the details matter? Scientists and poets alike want to get things
right, whether it’s a matter of the precise word or the electrical
activity of the muscle.

And in terms of practicality, the makers of soft, snakelike robots meant
to find their way through nooks and crannies without troublesome legs to
snag on obstacles, might find the exact nature of the motion useful, as
snakes have for millenniums.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Interestingly, Dr. Jayne said, the slow, liquid crawl he and Mr. Newman
studied seems to be used more by the heavier snakes — boas and pythons.

Like Kaa.
