<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — Since the 2008 financial crisis, conservative economists
and Republican politicians have claimed several policy errors were
holding back economic growth and contributing to a painfully slow
recovery, including lackluster wage growth. The government was spending
too much, it was borrowing too much and it was sowing “uncertainty” in
the business world with expiring tax cuts and other bitter policy
battles, they said.

If Republican leaders still believe that, they’re not acting like it.

In a year of controlling power in Washington, President Trump and
Republicans in Congress have run up federal spending, approved
deficit-swelling tax cuts and presided over a marked increase in “policy
uncertainty” in the economy. They still talk about the importance of
fiscal discipline, but they have yet to enforce it.

The [$4.4 trillion budget Mr. Trump released on
Monday](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/budget-fy2019.pdf)
spends as much over 10 years as any budget offered by President Barack
Obama, whose policies Republicans blamed for ballooning the size of the
federal government and hobbling the economy. It does not attempt to
achieve balance at the end of that time, despite optimistic [economic
growth projections that far
exceed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/spec-fy2019.pdf)
what most economists say is possible.

Instead, it projects that deficits will grow $7 trillion over the next
decade as the United States continues borrowing huge sums of money — a
number that could double if the administration turns out to be
overestimating economic growth and if the $3 trillion in spending cuts
the White House has floated do not materialize in Congress.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The promised $3 trillion in nonmilitary spending cuts do not appear to
be high priorities for the president or Republican leaders. A key
proposal for self-imposed fiscal restraint, the so-called “two penny
plan” that would reduce nondefense discretionary spending by 2 percent a
year, is a holdover from last year’s budget proposal. Americans have
heard almost nothing about it from the White House in the intervening
year. Mr. Trump has talked a bit more about his “welfare reform”
ambitions to help cut federal costs but, again, has not mounted a
serious pressure campaign to urge Congress to enact them.

Congressional Republicans appear unlikely to even attempt to pass a
budget resolution that could allow them to push cuts of that sort
through the Senate without any Democratic votes, having reserved that
move last year not for spending cuts, but for tax cuts that the Joint
Committee on Taxation estimates will add more than $1 trillion to the
national debt, even after accounting for increased economic growth.

The most energy the party put last year into actually reducing spending
and deficits was its attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which
failed after three Republicans defected. Mr. Trump’s budget assumes that
effort will now succeed, somehow. Party leaders have downplayed
suggestions floated by Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, among others,
that Congress could move this year to reduce future spending on safety
net programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

“Republicans will still tell you that runaway spending hurts the
economy,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative
Manhattan Institute who is a former chief economist for Senator Rob
Portman, Republican of Ohio. But the party, he said, “isn’t even talking
about Social Security and Medicare reform anymore. And that to me is the
sea change. There’s no constituency for it, and Republicans have
essentially given up.”

While Mr. Trump has pushed to freeze or roll back regulations in
Washington, his election — and the unpredictability of his
administration — has coincided with a resurgence of uncertainty in the
United States.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since Mr. Trump won election in November 2016, an [index of economic
policy uncertainty](http://www.policyuncertainty.com/us_monthly.html),
developed by economists from Stanford University, the University of
Chicago and Northwestern University, has jumped 25 percent from its
average level for the preceding four years. Mr. Trump has regularly
dangled the possibility of quitting the North American Free Trade
Agreement, for example, and his signature tax law sets all of its
individual cuts, and a key business provision, to expire in a few years.

Democrats look at that evolution and see Republicans revealing a new set
of economic preferences for the Trump era: lower taxes, less regulation,
more federal spending — including an infrastructure proposal that could
further swell the deficit — and mounting piles of federal debt.

That combination looks less like the economics of the Tea Party, circa
2010, and more like the policies of President George W. Bush — the very
policies that [conservatives blamed for their party losing its
way](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/10/AR2006051002040.html),
and control of Congress, in 2006.

“On certainty, smaller deficits and less government spending, I do see
shifts,” said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative
American Enterprise Institute. “But I don’t think those shifts are as
significant as many are making them out to be. George W. Bush inherited
a budget surplus and left large deficits. He expanded Medicare without
paying for it. Dick Cheney said ‘deficits don’t matter.’ Reagan said
that the deficit is big enough to take care of itself. The G.O.P. has
not restrained federal spending when it has held the White House.”

The official line, from the White House to congressional leadership, is
that Republicans remain committed to spending restraint, but have been
forced by Democrats to cut deals that run up more spending. That is
their rationale for [last week’s
agreement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/08/us/politics/congress-budget-deal-vote.html)
to lift Obama-era restraints on defense and nondefense discretionary
spending by $300 billion, in order to secure the defense spending
increases that conservatives say are crucial to national security. (Many
also contend that the new tax law will generate enough growth to offset
any lost federal revenues, although no detailed independent analysis
supports that
claim.)

## Budget Deficits Are Projected to Balloon Under the Bipartisan Spending Deal

The two-year budget agreement reached by Senate leaders would contribute

Some leading conservative economists say the party has not lost its core
convictions on spending and debt, which, they contend, remain solely a
problem of rising safety net spending in the years to come as the
population ages and the [Baby Boom

“I think their view all along has been that spending and debt are not
immediate threats to growth,” said John H. Cochrane, an economist who is
a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. “They know
that right now, a fundamental reform of entitlements won’t happen. So,
they have avoided weekly chaos and gotten needed military spending
through by opening the spending bill, and they got an important
reduction in growth-distorting marginal corporate rates through by
accepting a bit more deficits. They know that can’t be the end of the
story.”

Mr. Cochrane likened the economic threat of rising spending and debt to
living on an earthquake fault, poised to rumble at any moment. He said
those risks may be making markets “jittery”, and that Republicans may be
running out of time to follow through on their convictions, but he
expressed hope that Republicans and Democrats might find a way to work
together to reduce future spending growth.

Republicans [declined to make such an agreement under Mr.
Obama](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/04/01/magazine/obama-vs-boehner-who-killed-the-debt-deal.html),
who was willing to reduce Social Security spending but wanted to
increase taxes as part of a deal. They seem unlikely to make that gamble
now under Mr. Trump, who, many conservative economists note, promised in
his campaign not to touch Social Security or Medicare, and whose actions
during last year’s Obamacare repeal debate left some Republican leaders
feeling scarred.

“When push came to shove last year, he [described entitlement reforms as
‘mean,’](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/06/13/trump-told-senators-obamacare-repeal-bill-he-once-celebrated-mean/102826114/)
and completely cut their legs out from under them,” said Douglas
Holtz-Eakin, an economist who advised President Bush and is now
president of the conservative American Action Forum. “So where do they
go from there, with any confidence?”

The president continues to send mixed signals. On the first page of his
budget released Monday, he warned that “the current fiscal path is
unsustainable, and future generations deserve better.” But late last
month, in his State of the Union address, deficits and debt [were not at
the top of Mr. Trump’s
mind](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-deficits-debt-state-of-the-union_us_5a71d823e4b0be822ba25139).
His was the first such speech in a generation not to mention those
issues at all.
