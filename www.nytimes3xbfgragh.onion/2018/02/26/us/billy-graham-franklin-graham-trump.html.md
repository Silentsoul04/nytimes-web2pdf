The Rev. Billy Graham admitted in his later years that he had learned a
hard lesson after the Watergate scandal exposed his cozy complicity with
President Richard M. Nixon: Pastors should not become too enmeshed with
politicians and partisan politics.

“Looking back I know I sometimes crossed the line, and I wouldn’t do
that now,” [he
said](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/januaryweb-only/qabillygraham.html)
to the magazine Christianity Today in 2011.

Now, the movement that he helped spawn is divided over the very danger
that Mr. Graham — who died last week at age 99 — had warned about.
Evangelicals have become locked in a tight embrace with President Trump
and the Republican Party, and some of them are now asking whether they
have compromised the Gospel message.

Among Mr. Trump’s most vocal evangelical supporters, few are as
high-profile as Billy Graham’s eldest son and the heir to his ministry,
the Rev. Franklin Graham, who is 65. Though admired among evangelicals
for his aid work in hardship zones with the charity he leads,
[Samaritan’s Purse](https://www.samaritanspurse.org/), he has drawn
criticism for his unstinting support of the president.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Franklin Graham has defended the president on
[television](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/24/politics/graham-evangelicals-support-trump-don-lemon-cnntv/index.html)
and [social media](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/FranklinGraham/)
through the white supremacist [rally in
Charlottesville](https://twitter.com/franklin_graham/status/896878033147244545?lang=en),
Va., the [crackdowns on immigrants and
refugees](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/FranklinGraham/posts/1394064260649751),
the [Stormy Daniels
scandal](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/evangelist-franklin-graham-defends-trump-against-stormy-daniels-reports-n839496),
and [the
slur](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/369399-franklin-graham-defends-trumps-sh-hole-comments-hes-being)
against Haiti and Africa.

“People say that the president says mean things. I can’t think of
anything mean he’s said. I think he speaks what he feels,” Mr. Graham
said in a wide-ranging telephone interview last week. “I think he’s
trying to speak the truth.”

Billy Graham’s funeral in North Carolina on Friday, which Mr. Trump will
attend, will likely serve as a reminder for some evangelicals of how
their movement has mutated and splintered from one generation to the
next. Before the funeral, Mr. Graham’s body is lying in repose at the
Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, N.C., on Monday and Tuesday, and then
will be moved to the Capitol rotunda in Washington on Wednesday and
Thursday.

In his lifetime, Billy Graham shepherded evangelical Christianity from
the margins of American life to its center. His massive revivals,
magnetic presence and media stardom earned him [entree to President
Harry S. Truman and every president
since](https://billygraham.org/gallery/billy-graham-pastor-to-the-presidents/),
both Republican and Democrat.

His funeral [is expected to
draw](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article201496869.html)
politicians from both political parties, showcasing Billy Graham’s
success at bipartisanship. The eulogy is to be delivered by his son,
Franklin, who has honed a reputation as a polarizing partisan.

When Barack Obama was president, Franklin Graham fanned the “birther”
conspiracy that claimed the president was not an American citizen. He
falsely suggested that Mr. Obama was not a Christian and might secretly
be a Muslim.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Franklin Graham held rallies in
50 states to pump up evangelical turnout on what he called a “Decision
America Tour.” Once Mr. Trump landed the Republican nomination, Mr.
Graham avoided explicit endorsements at those rallies, but left no doubt
about his preference.

After the election, Mr. Graham said that Mr. Trump’s victory was
evidence that “God’s hand was at work.” He was one of the six clergy
members chosen to offer prayers at the inauguration, and is among the
evangelical pastors who serve as informal advisers to Mr. Trump and Vice
President Mike Pence.

In doing so, Franklin Graham has become a prominent leader of the
evangelical faction that is white, older, conservative on immigration,
L.G.B.T. issues and guns, and loyal to the Republican Party and Mr.
Trump. Some 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump,
[according
to](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/)
the Pew Research Center.

But there is another wing of the evangelical movement whose members are
more moderate politically, many of them black, Latino, Asian, or city
dwellers, or young. Some of these evangelicals have grown increasingly
discomfited by the close association with the Republican Party, and now,
with Mr. Trump.

For years, there had been muted criticism of Franklin Graham by some
evangelicals. It began after the Sept. 11 attacks, when Mr. Graham
branded Islam a “very wicked and evil religion,” and escalated during
Mr. Graham’s stoking of the “birther” slander. But given his status as
evangelical royalty and respect for his charitable work, the misgivings
mostly remained private.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Billy Graham chose not to pass judgment on his son, at least in public.
When asked in [an interview at his
home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/06/12/us/spirit-willing-one-more-trip-down-mountain-for-graham.html)
in 2005 whether he agreed with his son’s words about Islam, he would
only respond, “Let’s say, I didn’t say it.”

Now with some evangelical leaders concerned about the direction of their
movement, the concerns about Franklin Graham have begun to emerge.

“I think that Franklin Graham has failed as a Christian leader, both for
what he endorses and for what he has failed to criticize. I speak for a
lot of people on that one,” said [Richard J.
Mouw](https://fuller.edu/faculty/richard-j-mouw/), president emeritus
and professor of faith and public life at the evangelical Fuller
Theological Seminary, [the nation’s largest full-time
seminary](https://juicyecumenism.com/2016/08/01/americas-largest-seminaries/).

“A lot of us were deeply grateful to Billy Graham for acknowledging that
he aligned himself in unhelpful and actually non-Christian ways with a
person in power,” Dr. Mouw said in an interview last week. “We’re
grateful that he said, ‘I was wrong, that was a dangerous thing to have
done.’ And now, here we see the same patterns repeated, even by his own
son.”

Jerushah Armfield, one of Billy Graham’s granddaughters, has chastised
her uncle Franklin and other evangelical leaders for their willingness
to overlook behavior by Mr. Trump that is widely seen as immoral and
un-Christian.

“It’s sending the wrong message to the world about what Christianity is,
and what evangelicals are, or I guess, have become,” she [recently said
on
CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/26/us/jerushah-armfield-bill-graham-granddaughter-erin-burnett-outfront-jim-sciutto-cnntv/index.html)
(After her grandfather died, she declined a request for an interview).

Franklin Graham said his critics may be complaining to the news media,
“but they haven’t talked to me.”

But he said he had no reservations about his alliance with Mr. Trump,
whom he was drawn to in 2011, while Mr. Trump was carrying on the
“birther” campaign against Mr. Obama.

He said that Mr. Trump has delivered for evangelicals on every issue —
from abortion, to religious freedom to vowing to abolish the Johnson
Amendment that inhibits churches from endorsing politicians.

“In my lifetime, he has supported the Christian faith more than any
president that I know,” Mr. Graham said. “That doesn’t mean he is the
greatest example of the Christian faith, and neither am I, but he
defends the faith. There’s a difference between defending the faith and
living the faith.”

He said the media has lied about Mr. Trump, but when asked whether Mr.
Trump has told any lies, he said, “I don’t know of any.”

Mr. Graham was dismissive of questions surrounding Mr. Trump and Russian
government interference in the 2016 race. “I’ll be honest with you. This
whole thing on Russia? I don’t believe it. I don’t believe he has
collusion with the Russians,” Mr. Graham said. “And I think if somebody
in his campaign was involved, the president would have fired him.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

William C. Martin, a senior fellow in religion at Rice University’s
Baker Institute, interviewed father and son for his biography, “A
Prophet With Honor: The Billy Graham Story.” He said that Franklin was
more like his mother — outspoken and not hesitant to offend. Billy was
“always auditioning, wanting to be accepted,” said Mr. Martin,
paraphrasing a friend of the elder Graham.

Billy Graham had three daughters and two sons, all of whom have carried
on the work of Christian evangelism, whether through preaching, writing
or running ministries. So have many of his grandchildren, but each has
interpreted the calling differently. And like the evangelical movement,
they are not all on the same page when it comes to politics.

Boz Tchividjian, whose mother, Gigi, is Billy Graham’s eldest daughter,
is a former prosecutor who founded the organization GRACE — Godly
Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment — to investigate and
prevent child abuse in evangelical ministries. [He said his grandfather
inspired
him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/02/21/my-grandfather-billy-graham-was-my-hero/?utm_term=.b64df1e5742a)
to work “with those who are hurting and have been marginalized by
society, and quite frankly, the church.”

It was his sister, Ms. Armfield, who criticized their uncle Franklin on
CNN. Ms. Armfield, who is married to a Baptist pastor, is not the only
one in the family who feels that way, Mr. Tchividjian said.

“It’s a large family, and it’s a large family that doesn’t agree on
everything,” said Mr. Tchividjian, who is also a professor at Liberty
University School of Law, in Virginia.

When Billy Graham handed Franklin the reins of the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association in 2001, many people in the organization did
not think he was ready for the role, Mr. Martin said.

“Franklin turned out to be better in some ways than they thought he
would be” at running an organization and preaching, Mr. Martin said.

“People are worried now that Billy Graham’s legacy will be diminished by
some of the actions and positions that Franklin has espoused,” he said.
“But I don’t know that that bothers Franklin. Or his supporters.”
