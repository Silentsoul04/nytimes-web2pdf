When I was in my 20s, I worked at a video-game company in Silicon
Valley. We were expected to work 12-hour days and at least one weekend
day per week. The pay was terrible, as was the product. Even so, it was
part of the job to feel lucky to have it, and, being young and
replaceable, we were in no position to complain. To complain would have
made us “entitled,” which we were not entitled to be. The company, on
the other hand, was entitled to claim our every waking hour, and to
treat its rush to meet deadlines for clunky, slow-moving shooter games
as a collective labor of love. It felt difficult to square the
democratic world outside the office with the feudal arrangement inside
it; I spent a lot of time marveling at the cognitive dissonance of it
all.

It wasn’t just that office, of course. There has always been a
disconnect between what we claim to deserve as human beings and what we
believe is deserved in specific circumstances — by citizens or
noncitizens, workers or owners, “makers” or “takers.” Lately, “entitled”
is the scalpel we use to divide one from the other, affirming the things
we believe are owed to us, then turning around and shaming others for
expecting anything beyond that. It lets us claim that certain rights are
fundamental, granted by a higher authority, and it lets us accuse others
of being grasping, arrogant and superior. It swaps hats, darting
frantically from post to post, defending and attacking as the need
arises.

Any survey of news and headlines will illustrate the tangled nature of
the word. For every negative usage, a positive one seems to follow; for
every allowance we’re granted, another will soon be taken away.
“Millennials have an entitlement complex,” you will read, but “All
Americans are entitled to opinions.” Then there’s “Millennials in the
workplace — not entitled, just different.” An article about the travel
arrangements of the head of the Environmental Protection Agency fashions
a quote from a senator into a headline that affirms as it undermines:
“Pruitt ‘Entitled’ to Fly First Class.” Other benefits might have been
earned the hard way: After Georgina Chapman announced that she was
leaving Harvey Weinstein, numerous articles speculated that she was
legally “entitled” to at least $300,000 for each year they were married.
One article declares that Melania Trump is “entitled” to some privacy,
while another notes that noncitizens brought to this country as children
are not “entitled” to court-appointed immigration lawyers. On a recent
episode of “The View,” the host Joy Behar challenged Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand over her calls for Al Franken to resign his Senate seat,
noting that the president had been accused of worse sins and was not
about to step down. Gillibrand agreed that she’d like to see Trump
resign too, then carefully divided the things that were owed to Franken
from the things that were not: “He’s entitled to a hearing. He is. But
he’s not entitled to my silence, Joy.”

This double-sided use of entitlement tends not to tell us a great deal
about the subject it’s applied to, whether that subject is privacy,
legal representation or airline upgrades. It does, however, tend to
reveal a great deal about us, the people having the conversation — about
what we believe human beings should expect from life and about what we
owe to one another. And it hints at all the bad feeling and zero-sum
thinking that pervade our arguments over who deserves what: our envy,
our fear of missing out, our paranoia that the rights of others are
constantly threatening to impinge on our own.

**The way we** use “entitled” feels less strange when you consider that
its two meanings have slightly different origins. Once upon a time,
“entitlement” was, quite literally, something granted by a higher
authority: A “noble” person pleased the sovereign, perhaps by acquiring
land or fighting bravely, and in return the sovereign bestowed upon him
special rights and privileges, perks not afforded to a commoner,
including the right not to have their estate expropriated by the crown.
“Entitlement” was a recognition of service, a promise of specific
legal benefits. In some cases it came with an actual title, like the
feudal “baron.”

Something similar has been true in the United States, where
“entitlements” refers to government benefit programs not subject to
budgetary discretion — assistance that the state was obligated, on
levels both legal and societal, to provide to all eligible citizens.
According to the linguist Geoff Nunberg, it was sometime after the
publication of “The Culture of Narcissism,” an influential 1979 book by
Christopher Lasch, that a certain negative connotation began to spread.
Legitimate “entitlement” and an illegitimate *sense* of entitlement
merged. You might now be an entitled person: someone whose privilege
leads to arrogance, snobbery and rudeness, someone who expects to be
waited on, provided for, deferred to.

This was an unfortunate development for those who depended on
entitlement programs, who were increasingly cast as undeserving — people
who “chose” to be poor, via laziness and lack of responsibility, and yet
felt “entitled” to governmental support. Even before Lasch’s book,
Ronald Reagan, during his first run for president, held up an actual
career criminal — a con woman, identity thief and suspected kidnapper
believed to have bilked the government of untold thousands of dollars —
as a symbol of excess, conjuring around her a world of fantastical
“welfare queens”: enemies of the bootstrapping individualist spirit of
America, coddled and demanding and overly dependent on programs they
were, in fact, legally entitled to use. The apotheosis of this concept
was laid out by Mitt Romney in 2012, when he declared that 47 percent of
voters were dependent on the government, saw themselves as victims and
believed “that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to
you name it. That that’s an entitlement.” It was not his job, he argued,
to care about such people, whom he’d “never convince” that they should
“take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Of course, it did not escape American voters that as the very wealthy
scion of a very powerful family, Romney was the epitome of an “entitled”
man in the original, feudal sense; his entitlement was hereditary. And
he was, above all, in a position to make influential judgments about
what others had, what others wanted, what people deserved or did
not.

**The entitlements that** infuriate us most, it seems, involve the sight
of other people chasing determinedly after things we’d never dare to
pursue. Many of our most pitched intergenerational arguments revolve
around precisely this issue: the question of what it is reasonable to
expect from the world and what we must learn to bear quietly. Older
people come to believe that they spent their youth working very hard and
expecting little in return, and express awe and outrage over the extent
to which their children expect the world to be made decent or fair or
nice. At the moment, it’s millennials who are accused of this kind of
entitlement, despite their shrinking access to nice things — secure
jobs, employer-provided health care, affordable housing — that baby
boomers took for granted. But similar complaints echo backward.
Twenty-five years ago, it was Generation X that was criticized for the
same things, in the same terms, sometimes in the same publications.
“Grow Up, Crybabies, You’re America’s Luckiest Generation,” sighed a
1993 Washington Post headline. “They’re impatient waiting for job
promotions and want all the perks associated with ‘paying one’s dues’ ”
— a bank employee said that in a 1997 article in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. To read a 2013 article in Time magazine calling
millennials “lazy, entitled, selfish and shallow” feels like having
dozed off years ago and woken up just in time to see history repeated.

We are clearly galled by people we believe think they deserve something
the rest of us don’t. The unsettled issue, of course, is what anyone
deserves in the first place, a question over which we are constantly
erupting into pitched battles. Sometimes the issues are broad and
societal. (Do you deserve health care, or a home, or a lawyer? Should
the government formally entitle you to more of these things?) Sometimes
they are personal or mundane. (Do you deserve a thank-you card or to
have your text responded to? Is it “entitled” to expect either?) We are
able to bring a surprising emotional intensity to our fights over any of
these things.

Still: We tend to use “entitled” to argue out these questions case by
case and person by person, as if it were possible to settle huge,
overarching questions about the kind of society we want to live in one
situation at a time. We take what could be useful conversations about
rights and values and turn them into ad hominem attacks, accusations of
arrogance and greed. (Calling someone “entitled” doesn’t suggest they
hold a different conception of social responsibility; it suggests poor
character.) No matter which direction the word points, it tends to serve
as a cudgel. And yet its ubiquity may still be a useful sign, pointing
at deep questions about fairness and equality, about our very different
conceptions about what a person can, or should, expect from life. It
embodies an impasse we’ve reached — and it suggests that if we ever
could sort out the details, we might find that we’re entitled to far
more than we’re getting.
