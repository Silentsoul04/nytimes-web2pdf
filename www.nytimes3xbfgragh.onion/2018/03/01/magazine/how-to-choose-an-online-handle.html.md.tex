Take an anthropological approach. It helps to know something of the
mythology and culture of a place before you decide what you'll be called
there. ``If you're going into a new environment --- whether that's a
video game, or a social-media platform, or a subreddit --- look into the
social norms of that community first,'' says Nikki Crenshaw, a
researcher at Blizzard Entertainment, the maker of World of Warcraft and
other online games.

Crenshaw got her doctorate in informatics last year from the University
of California, Irvine, where she studied naming practices in online
video games. Many of Crenshaw's research subjects considered their
online names to be as important to their identities as the ones given to
them by their parents. But even if you're not a serious gamer and just
want to jump in and play, don't be too offhand about making your alias.
The moniker might stick to your digital embodiment whether you like it
or not. One of Crenshaw's study subjects ended up being known as
``Stinkypeen,'' after initially choosing it as a joke.

Think through how much demographic information you want to reveal about
yourself. ``People generally associate A's and E's at the ends of names
as being female,'' Crenshaw says. Given the pervasive misogyny found
online, female gamers sometimes opt for a gender-neutral tag. Some
platforms allow names to include numbers. If you want to suggest your
age, people tend to read two digits at the end as a birth year. One of
Crenshaw's first online handles was ``Gazelle,'' an offline nickname
from her gangly preteen years. The name morphed over time to ``Gazzy''
and now ``Gaiazelle.''

Consider signaling your interests with cultural references to things you
like (millions can play these games, of course, and your desired name
might be taken). Pick a word that's easy to type; if, say, ``Legolas''
is taken, don't try to spell it with an umlaut. Unlike your given name,
this one is not bound by law or familial expectations. If you've grown
out of a handle, give yourself another (note that some game makers
charge a fee of around \$10 for a name change). ``People are always
learning new things about themselves,'' Crenshaw says. ``Your name can
evolve with you.''
