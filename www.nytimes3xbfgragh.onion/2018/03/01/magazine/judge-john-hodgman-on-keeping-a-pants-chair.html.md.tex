\textbf{Stephen writes:} \emph{When I get home, I take my jeans off and
rest them on the ``pants chair'' in my living room. This way I don't
have to go upstairs, and it allows me to quickly dress if unexpected
company arrives. My wife believes that the chair is an eyesore. Please
order her to stop hassling me.}

Friends of Stephen! This is The New York Times Magazine telling you that
he lounges around in his underwear until the moment you ring his bell.
There. Now no one will visit you again! The real aesthetic crime is not
so much your pants flopped over a chair as it is you exposing your
nonupstairs-going skinny legs as you swan around your house. You may
certainly buy some tasteful sweats for indoor relaxation. But first get
those jeans onto a valet chair in your bedroom, give your legs some
exercise and rejoin society!
