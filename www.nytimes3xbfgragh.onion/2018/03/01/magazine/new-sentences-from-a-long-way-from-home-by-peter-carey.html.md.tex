\emph{--- From ``A Long Way From Home'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 2018, Page
39), the 14th novel from the Australian writer Peter Carey.}

How do we know how smart we are? We weigh our minds, constantly, against
pieces of the world around us. We solve puzzles --- knock-knock jokes,
forgotten account logins, what to say next in a conversation --- and we
watch others solve those same puzzles, and we compare results. Our
estimation of our own intelligence booms and crashes like an internal
stock market. We win a chess game and feel smart; we are flummoxed by a
lawn mower's engine and feel dumb again.

It is tempting to avoid feeling dumb --- to build a wall between
ourselves and the world, which is, after all, an infinite showroom of
our ignorance. But feeling temporarily dumb is how we become smart, in
the same way that feeling temporarily weak is how we become strong.

One character in Peter Carey's new novel is an Australian
radio-quiz-show genius. His mind is dense with facts, from the origins
of carbon paper to the many varieties of rope. But the quiz show ---
knowledge as public display --- is, for him, a dead end.

By the end of the book, he finds a kind of redemption by embracing his
ignorance. He comes into contact with Australia's indigenous people, a
group maligned by colonists as uneducated. (Western civilization has
often made itself feel smarter by walling itself off from forms of
intelligence that threaten it.) This character begins to understand the
vanished brilliance of the native culture; he leaps the wall,
confronting his ignorance in full. The book ends with the radical notion
that ``our mother country is a foreign land whose language we have not
yet earned the right to speak.''
