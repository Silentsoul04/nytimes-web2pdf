More than half a million Rohingya refugees face looming disaster from

The world’s largest refugee camp, a temporary home to more than half a
million people that sprawls precariously across barren hills in
southeastern Bangladesh, faces a looming disaster as early as April when
the first storms of the monsoon season hit, aid workers warn.

“It’s going to be landslides, flash floods, inundation,” said Tommy
Thompson, chief of emergency support and response for the World Food
Program. “It’s going to be a very, very challenging wet season. That’s
if we don’t have a cyclone.”

Nearly [600,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees live in the
camp](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/180225_weeklyiscg_sitrep_final.pdf),
at Cox’s Bazar, near the southern tip of Bangladesh. Cyclones, which can
occur from March to July, would considerably worsen the situation beyond
the dangers of flooding and landslides.

The Rohingya camp — known officially as the Kutupalong-Balukhali
settlements, and informally as the megacamp — is the most urgent example
of the new calamities that come with the global refugee crisis: a huge
influx of desperate people fleeing war or persecution, only to face
natural disaster in an ecologically fragile area potentially made more
precarious by climate change.

“We can definitely see how this is going to be a catastrophe, no matter
what,” said Mélody Braun, who studies risk reduction strategies at the
International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia
University and is visiting the camp this week. “There’s really no space.
People are everywhere. Slopes are really high.”

Before the Rohingya started crossing into Bangladesh from Myanmar in
large numbers in the summer, fleeing attacks on their villages by the
army and allied mobs, the hills were dotted with
forest.

But then, in a matter of weeks, as refugees poured in by the tens of
thousands, trees were hacked away. Canals were dug. Bamboo-and-tarp
shacks went up. More trees were cut as refugees scrambled to find
firewood.

The hills, where elephants recently roamed, are now bare. Even the roots
have been pulled out, leaving nothing to hold the parched soil together
as rainwater washes downhill, potentially taking tents and people with
it and quickly inundating low-lying settlements. The United Nations says
[100,000 refugees are at acute
risk](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/13/world/asia/rohingya-monsoons-myanmar-bangladesh.html)
from landslides and floods.

The early rains — known in Bengali as kalboishakhi, which translates
loosely as the storms of an “evil summer” — are a precursor to the
full-on monsoons. They strike when the soil is still dry and especially
susceptible to mudslides. The only warning of their approach is usually
hot winds that send the dry earth of summer swirling through the air.

“You have whirlwinds of dust,” said Iffat Nawaz, a spokeswoman for BRAC,
an international relief agency that is based in Bangladesh. “Suddenly it
gets dark in middle of the day and it pours. We usually welcome that.
It’s cooling. This year in the middle of the refugee crisis, it’s not
something to look forward
to.”

Southeastern Bangladesh is already one of the wettest parts of a wet
country, with 12 feet of rain on average every year. A warming
atmosphere can hold more moisture and unleash more intense downpours,
and make wet places even wetter. That may already be happening in and
around Cox’s Bazar. Total pre-monsoon rainfall in the region has
increased by about one inch every five years over the past five decades,
a 2014 [study by researchers from Bangladesh University of Engineering
and
Technology](http://teacher.buet.ac.bd/akmsaifulislam/reports/Heavy_Rainfall_report.pdf)
found.

When the rains come, latrines are likely to overflow, bringing the risk
of cholera and other waterborne
diseases.

In February, United Nations agencies began dispatching engineering crews
to clear blocked sewage canals at risk of overflowing in the rainy
season. They distributed compressed rice husk, an alternative to
firewood, but that met only a small fraction of the refugees’ needs. The
government has yet to allow the United Nations refugee agency to
distribute gas stoves that would decrease the demand for firewood.

Bangladesh, one of the poorest, most densely populated countries in the
world, opened its borders to the Rohingya in August, when they began
arriving with tales of [massacres by the Myanmar
military](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/02/world/asia/rohingya-myanmar-bangladesh-refugees-massacre.html).
They crossed a swollen river to get to safety, walking through muddy
fields and sleeping under the open sky with their children. The
Bangladeshi government let them settle around an area where there was
already a relatively small Rohingya refugee camp.

A spokeswoman for the International Organization for Migration, which
manages the camp, said aid agencies were well aware of the natural
disaster risks, but that they struggled in the early months to provide
basic services and focused on immediate needs: water, food and
shelter.

Bangladeshi and United Nations officials say they are preparing land
elsewhere to relocate roughly 100,000 refugees from the megacamp. In one
instance, the United Nations is leveling a hilly area allocated by the
government to relocate refugees. And officials are distributing more
tarp, bamboo and sandbags to refugees to shore up their tents before the
rains begin.

Could any of this have been prevented? Mr. Thompson said it would have
helped to set up a camp on flatter land and to prevent the clear-cutting
of the forest.

“We will be looking at decisions that were taken in the first six months
of this operation,” he said by phone from Cox’s Bazar. “We always learn
from our previous experiences and get better. Having said that, we find
ourselves in circumstances we couldn’t have imagined.”
