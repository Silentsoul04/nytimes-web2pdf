Even when you don't know it is Gertrude Stein in Picasso's portrait
(1905-1906), you can admire the work's brush strokes, colors and
composition. This poem is stunning even if you don't know the back
story. A declarative, compassionate, mysterious feeling radiates from
turns of phrase like ``Grace-panic. Warehorseman, split.'' ``The man you
wore'' rings as literal and figurative. But make no mistake: This
magnificent poem only deepens when you learn Michael L. Johnson's story.
Read it, then reread it. \emph{Selected by Terrance Hayes}
