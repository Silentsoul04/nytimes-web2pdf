CHARLESTON, S.C. — The unmarked property, beside a big, bland postwar
apartment building, is now an empty grass lot and de facto park. Cabin
cruisers gently bob at a pier.

In this part of Charleston, just north of the historic, postcard
district, industry has increasingly been giving way to boxy condominium
developments with names like The Gadsden, after this city’s
Revolutionary War-era patriot, merchant, and sometime slave trader,
[Christopher Gadsden](http://teachingushistory.org/lessons/Gadsden.htm).

Justice delayed, as the saying goes.

If it’s to be served, that empty plot, still waiting on private
donations and $11 million in state funding, will be occupied by a
subdued, modernist, 47,000-square-foot pavilion raised above the ground
on thick columns clad in precast oyster-shell tabby.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It will house the [International African American
Museum](https://iaamuseum.org/).

A graceful project, long discussed and years overdue, the museum has
brought together two very different talents, the veteran architect Harry
Cobb, from Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, and Walter Hood, the landscape
designer from Oakland, Calif.

Its louvered windows facing the waterfront will direct views past Fort
Sumter toward the Atlantic Ocean — and Africa. In and around the plaza
created below the lofted building, a memorial garden, planted with
native grasses, will lead toward a shallow tidal pool whose stone floor
is inscribed with the shapes of bodies crammed together, as slaves were,
in the bowels of ships that landed here.

Right here. The spot used to be Gadsden’s Wharf. Historians estimate
nearly half of all African slaves brought to America arrived in
Charleston, most of them at Gadsden’s Wharf. At 840-feet-long, it was,
two centuries ago, the largest wharf in America. Thousands of Africans
waited in the wharf’s warehouses to be auctioned
off.

In what has become a parking lot, just inland, 700 of them froze to
death.

For millions of African-Americans today, the site is “ground zero,” as
the Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has put it, for “blackness,
black culture, the African experience, the African-American experience,
slavery — however you want to slice it.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Every era erects, removes, amends — or ignores — monuments. Monuments
and historical museums are always mirrors, advertisements, time bombs.
Hardly a street or building in Germany today lacks some sign or plaque,
redressing the past. It was the proposed removal of a Jim Crow-era
statue of Robert E. Lee that became the excuse for the neo-Nazi rally in
Charlottesville, Va., last year, where a white nationalist is to go on
trial late this year in the murder of a protester at the event.

Unlike Virginia, South Carolina hasn’t taken down Confederate monuments.
Much has changed here but much has not. The state’s most [recent
proposal](https://www.postandcourier.com/news/proposed-s-c-social-studies-standards-don-t-mention-mlk/article_8492b92c-075d-11e8-bfaa-0fa934b57487.html)
for social studies standards in public schools doesn’t mention the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., or Rosa Parks.

The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston where a
young white man massacred nine black congregants in 2015 is virtually in
the shadow of what’s still the city’s tallest monument (another Jim Crow
relic) of the antebellum vice president and proud white supremacist John
C. Calhoun.

It has been nearly two decades since Joseph P. Riley Jr., Charleston’s
mayor at the time, floated the idea of a museum of African-American
culture and history, on a different site, nearby. A dozen years passed,
then more.

Mr. Riley retired in 2016, after 40 years in office, having been elected
during the 1970s as a racial bridge builder. White racists called him
“L’il Black Joe” when he appointed a black police chief in 1975.
Charleston prospered over the intervening decades.

But gentrification had its effects. Two-thirds black in the early 1980s,
the population has become 70 percent white. I suggested to Mr. Riley the
other day that Charleston can come across to a visitor as Disneyland for
the Confederacy, still enthralled by its era of slavery, with a monument
on seemingly every downtown corner commemorating some Confederate
soldier, plantation aristocrat or antebellum judge who opposed Lincoln.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s a process,” he replied. “We worked hard while I was mayor to avoid
alienation, to make this a city where everyone feels welcome. When I was
in school, they didn’t teach us about slavery. I really only learned the
truth about how slaves were treated when I had already been in office
for many years. That’s when I began to think seriously about the
museum.”

But without enough money or much public enthusiasm, the plan sputtered.
Then excavations turned up traces of Gadsden’s Wharf in the muck beneath
the grassy lot. Through the exhibition designer Ralph Appelbaum, Mr.
Riley reached out to Mr. Cobb.

Pretty much the architect’s first question: Why not build on the
location of the wharf?

By that point, the city had sold the property to a local restaurateur,
unaware of its history. Mr. Riley spent a tidy sum buying the land back.

“Sometimes you quick-cook something, it’s a mistake,” rationalized the
former mayor, who has taken to calling the museum his “most important
work,” especially after the church murders. “It turned out to be good
that we had a lengthy germination period.”

Now 91, the soft-spoken Mr. Cobb is known for designing the John Hancock
Tower in Boston, [7 Bryant Park in New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/11/19/arts/design/7-bryant-park-embraces-its-place-in-the-city.html),
and a variety of big, sleek buildings in between, the best of which are
geometrically eloquent and deceptively simple. Working here with the
structural engineer Guy Nordenson, he describes this project as an
“unrhetorical work of architecture.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But that’s not quite true. On the edge of the cobblestoned tourist area,
with its ornate Gothic Revival-style churches and Queen Anne houses, the
museum’s plain-spoken modernism comes across as almost whisperingly
defiant, a turning of the page, promising a deliverance from history,
modernism’s originating
goal.

Moody Nolan are the architects of record. Slender brick cladding
underscores the pavilion’s long horizontal spans and extended
cantilevers on either end. Pointed columns are meant to make the
structure’s mass appear to float. Perching the museum on piers will take
account of rising waters. But it’s also hard not to see an allusion to a
wharf.

Inside, galleries will document the many diverse cultures Africans
brought to America, and a family center will let visitors trace their
roots to Gadsden’s Wharf.

For his part, Mr. Hood has reimagined a constrained and narrow property,
about a football-field long. The late, great Brazilian architect Oscar
Niemeyer was an inspiration. Mr. Hood creates a shaded public plaza, in
the breezy space underneath the raised structure, where people may
congregate around the building’s double-sided staircase, so the museum
can become a gathering spot, not just a pilgrimage site.

The memorial garden and tidal pool, at the same time, insure that it’s
recognized as hallowed ground, a place for contemplation.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The budget for building the museum is $75 million. The goal is for
bulldozers to start digging later this year and for construction to
finish in 2020. But there’s a hitch. No shovel will be lifted until all
the money is raised. Charleston has committed its $25 million share,
along with the land, and private donations are approaching the $25
million goal.

But the South Carolina legislature, after an understanding that it would
contribute $25 million over five years, allocated $14 million, and now
won’t promise the remaining $11 million. The clock is ticking. The
current legislature remains in session only until the end of May.

State Representative Brian White, a Republican who heads South
Carolina’s House Ways and Means Committee, is one of those holding the
money back. The museum “is not a state project and we have a lot of
state needs right now that far outweigh a municipality’s request,” he
recently told [the Greenville
News](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/2018/03/08/former-charleston-mayors-museum-mission-cant-rest-until-ive-done-my-duty/340719002/),
citing competing priorities like education.

Bobby Hitt, South Carolina’s commerce secretary, by contrast, has
pointed out that the museum will help attract businesses to the state.
It adds a work of architectural dignity. And as for educational value,
plainly it fills a
gap.

One recent morning I toured the site with Mr. Hood and Michael Boulware
Moore, the museum’s president, then we looked out over the harbor. Mr.
Moore said his ancestors were among the slaves who arrived in shackles
at Gadsden’s Wharf.

His great-great grandfather was [Robert
Smalls](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/thrilling-tale-how-robert-smalls-heroically-sailed-stolen-confederate-ship-freedom-180963689/),
who commandeered a Confederate ship, turning it over to Union forces and
winning freedom for himself, his family and his crew. Smalls became a
crusading state legislator and United States congressman during
Reconstruction. He brought free public education to South Carolina.

A plaque honoring Smalls was installed on a squat little pillar downtown
not long ago. Mr. Moore showed me a picture of it.
