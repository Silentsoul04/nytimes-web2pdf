Growing up in Merrick, Long Island, [Michael
Kors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/michael-kors) was
surrounded by women who loved fashion: “My mother was a former Revlon
model, my grandmother was obsessed with Bill Blass and beige and I had
two midriff-bearing aunts who idolized Cher,” says the designer, who
drew dresses in the sand at the family beach club, where he first
observed the leisure-class glamour that would become his eponymous
label’s signature. “Everyone would arrive to their cabanas wearing
bikinis and leave for dinner in evening gowns,” Kors recalls. After high
school, he attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan,
but dropped out after two semesters to work as a window dresser and
“sales boy” at Lothar’s clothing boutique on Fifth Avenue (a favorite
of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Diana Ross) where he also began
selling pieces — crisply tailored blazers, sporty sheaths and maxi
skirts — of his own design.

Kors officially launched [his label](https://www.michaelkors.com/) in
1981 when, at age 21, [he
debuted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1981/07/28/style/notes-on-fashion.html)
an 18-piece collection of white crepe de Chine dresses and streamlined
leather separates made for the resort season. “New York in the early
’80s was like the wild, wild West; anything could happen, there was so
much possibility,” says Kors. “Glamour in those days was everything. I
would send my muses out at night wearing gold lamé gowns with cashmere.”
Four decades later, he has over 650 stores worldwide. In 2010, he became
the youngest designer in history to receive the CFDA’s Lifetime
Achievement Award. But the Broadway fanatic and dedicated AIDS activist
has never forgotten what women actually *want* to wear. Indeed, his
famously loyal customers, including Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and
Oprah, seem to be his greatest source of inspiration. As Kors puts it,
“I have always thought that you are truly only as good as the people
you dress.”

Here, Kors shares some of his many
inspirations.

auditioning, but I’m a terrible
