\subsection{New this week:}\label{new-this-week}}

\textbf{FAILING UP} By Leslie Odom Jr. Read by the author. (Audible.)
The Broadway phenom who originated the role of Aaron Burr in
``Hamilton'' and won a Tony for it draws on his own life, and success,
to offer advice about living to your fullest potential. \textbf{THE
RADICAL KING} By Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Edited by Cornel West. Read
by Wanda Sykes, Mike Colter, LeVar Burton, Gabourey Sidibe, Danny
Glover, et al. (Audible.) West and a cast of many voices want to restore
King's identity as a fierce and unyielding social democrat, defender of
the poor and working class, in a tradition of political radicalism ---
it's a different look at the man mostly remembered now for his words of
conciliation and peace. \textbf{IN CONCLUSION, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT} By
Lauren Graham. Read by the author. (Random House Audio.) The beloved
``Gilmore Girls'' star expands here on a 2017 commencement speech she
gave at her hometown high school, reflecting on her past and giving
advice to the young. \textbf{ALL THE WAYS TO SAY I LOVE YOU} By Neil
LaBute. Read by Judith Light. (Audible.) LaBute, the bad boy of
Broadway, presents a one-woman play about a schoolteacher with a secret,
struggling mightily with her own guilt. Light, who won plaudits for the
2016 stage production, now picks up the role in this audio version.
\textbf{THE LAST JEDI: STAR WARS} By Jason Fry. Read by Marc Thompson.
(Random House Audio.) For those who can't get enough ``Star Wars,'' this
is the official adaptation of the most recent film in the franchise,
written with input from the director Rian Johnson, full of portent and
force.

\emph{In which we ask colleagues at The Times what they're reading now.}

``As someone who's been writing about technology forever, I have a
strong interest in people who can use lateral thinking and creative
problem-solving skills to move the world forward. I'm also a
military-history buff, so I'm loving Giles Milton's well-researched 2016
book, published in the United States as \textbf{CHURCHILL'S MINISTRY OF
UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE}, about the secret British government department
tasked with creating new weapons, waging guerrilla warfare and thinking
up inventive ways to whack Nazis during World War II. Milton's dry,
witty narrative style helps balance descriptions of some ghastly
maneuvers, making a pretty lively read. I'm learning about brilliantly
mad makers like Cecil Clarke, who developed the prototype for an
underwater mine crafted (in part) from a tin Woolworth's bowl, aniseed
candy balls, blasting gelatin and a condom --- and cost less than £6 to
make. Now that's innovation.''
