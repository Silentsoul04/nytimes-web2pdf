OKLAHOMA CITY — The anxiety and seething anger that followed the
disappearance of middle-income jobs in factory towns has helped reshape
the American political map and topple longstanding policies on tariffs
and immigration.

But globalization and automation aren’t the only forces responsible for
the loss of those reliable paychecks. So is the steady erosion of the
public sector.

For generations of Americans, working for a state or local government —
as a teacher, firefighter, bus driver or nurse — provided a comfortable
nook in [the middle
class](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/11/business/economy/middle-class-but-feeling-economically-insecure.html).
No less than automobile assembly lines and steel plants, the public
sector ensured that even workers without a college education could
afford a home, a minivan, movie nights and a family vacation.

In recent years, though, the ranks of state and local employees have
languished even as the populations they serve have grown. They now
account for the [smallest share of the American civilian work
force](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=ju4l) since 1967.

The 19.5 million workers who remain are finding themselves financially
downgraded.

on Thursday — are just one thread in that larger skein.

“I was surprised to realize along the way I was no longer middle class,”
said Teresa Moore, who has spent 30 years investigating complaints of
abused or neglected children, veterans and seniors in Oklahoma.

She raised two daughters in Alex, a rural dot southwest of the capital,
on her salary. But when she applied for a mortgage nine years ago, the
loan officer casually described her as “low income.”

At 57, Ms. Moore now earns just over $43,000, which she supplements with
a part-time job as a computer technician.

The private sector has been more welcoming. During 97 consecutive months
of [job growth](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm), it
created 18.6 million positions, a 17 percent increase.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But that impressive streak comes with an asterisk. Many of the jobs
created — most in service industries — lack [stability and
security](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/31/business/economy/volatile-income-economy-jobs.html).
They pay little more than the minimum wage and lack predictable hours,
insurance, sick days or parental leave.

The result is that the foundation of the [middle class continues to be
gnawed
away](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/16/business/economy/bump-in-us-incomes-doesnt-erase-50-years-of-pain.html)
even as help-wanted ads multiply.

Reducing state and local payrolls, of course, is a goal that has
champions and detractors. Anti-tax crusaders, concerned about cost and
overreach, have longed for a smaller government that delivers only the
most limited services. Public-sector defenders worry that shortages of
restaurant inspectors, rat exterminators, mental health counselors and
the like will hurt neighborhoods. Pothole-studded roads and unreliable
garbage pickup don’t entice businesses, either.

Yet whether one views a diminished public sector as vital to economic
growth or a threat to health and safety, it is undeniable that it has
led to a significant decline in middle-class employment opportunities.

“It’s a tough time to be working in government,” said Neil Reichenberg,
executive director of the International Public Management Association
for Human Resources. Once there were several attractions to public
employment in addition to the mission of making a difference in your
community, he added, but incentives like good health insurance and
retirement benefits have disappeared. “There’s been a lot of cutbacks
that have made government a less competitive employer,” he said.

From the late 1950s through 1980, the United States added 350,000 new
state and local workers a year. The rate slowed in the mid-1980s through
the early 2000s, but payrolls still grew annually by 300,000
workers.

Government hiring failed to bounce back after the recession in both
Republican- and Democratic-led states, and states continued to shed
workers through 2013. The recovery’s slow pace held down revenues at the
same time as baby boomers began retiring and [generous pension and
benefit
commitments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/14/business/pension-finance-oregon.html)
made in fatter years came due.  

“They couldn’t pay their obligations,” said Edwin Benton, a political
scientist at the University of South Florida and the managing editor of
an [academic journal](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/slgb), State and
Local Government Review. “The epidemic has grown to almost every city
and state.”

“We’re in uncharted waters,” he added.

In the past 12 months, local and state payrolls grew by 31,000, a
fraction of the historical rate. There are now fewer such workers per
capita than there were three decades ago.  

Nonetheless, those combined payrolls dwarf those of the federal
government, which employs about 2.8 million civilians, including postal
workers. That number has shrunk slightly in recent
years.

The government employment pinch especially hurts in small and rural
counties, where President Trump and other Republicans are popular. These
areas tend to lack the number and diversity of private employers found
in larger cities, and are therefore more dependent on government jobs.

Oklahoma is one of several Republican-led states where persistent
anti-tax sentiment and severe budget cuts have guided policymaking,
particularly since 2010, when many candidates supported by Tea Party
voters won local offices.

Then, the newly elected governor, Mary Fallin, [led the
charge](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/19/533556306/in-oklahoma-gop-lawmakers-support-tax-increases-to-solve-budget-crisis)
to reduce the state’s top income-tax rate and shrink the tax on oil and
gas production to 2 percent from 7 percent for new wells. But a sharp
drop in oil and gas prices in 2014 delivered an unexpected wallop. Tax
revenue evaporated, leaving huge
[budget](https://okpolicy.org/budget-trends-outlook-march-2018/)shortfalls
since then.

Justin Fortney, 41, was one of 200 employees laid off by the state
health department this year. “It’s getting more difficult to be a public
employee — whether that’s a teacher or public health officer — and see
yourself as part of a thriving middle class,” he said.

Mr. Fortney, who lives with his wife and son in Guthrie, 30 miles north
of the capital, was forced to start job hunting. “We always made it
work,” said Mr. Fortney, who was employed by the state for 12 years and
earned about $50,000 annually. “But if you’re going to choose to be a
public servant, you have to have in mind that you will live in a small
home and drive a sometimes unreliable vehicle.”

He said he worried that talented workers will opt for the private
sector. Staffing shortages are common in states across the country.

In Houston, pinched by a property tax cap, the police chief has said his
department is [short 1,500 to 2,000
officers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/where-the-jobs-are-houstons-police-shortage.html).

Back in Oklahoma, state prisons are at 153 percent capacity, while the
corrections department has lost a tenth of its staff since 2009. “Our
folks are only armed with their self-defense training, a can of pepper
spray, and a wing and a prayer that someone will come and help them if
they get in trouble,” [Joe
Allbaugh](http://www.newson6.com/story/37780039/doc-asks-for-15-billion-for-new-prisons-training-and-pay-raises),
the director of the corrections department, has said publicly.

Since 2009, staffing at the state mental health department in Oklahoma
is down more than 20 percent, and at the Office of Juvenile Affairs by
nearly a quarter. The state Office of Fire Marshal once employed 30
workers, but now has 18.

A [report on 2017 state
compensation](https://www.ok.gov/opm/documents/2017AnnualCompensationReport.pdf)
in Oklahoma found that average salaries were 27 percent lower than for
comparable jobs in the private sector.

Many government workers take a second job to make ends meet. Eldon
Johnson, 40, who cares for children with cerebral palsy and autism at a
group home in Norman, works from 2:45 to 10:45 p.m., earning $12.50 an
hour, less than some clerks at 7-Eleven. He then drives directly to his
better-paying second job at a private mental health center, where he
works until 8
a.m.

“There’s no way I could make it without a second job, unless I lived in

state for 10 years.

Advocates for disadvantaged groups like foster children or the disabled

families with school-age children.

Parents from affluent Republican suburbs like Bixby and Jenks outside
Tulsa, for instance, car-pooled for a 100-mile trip to the State Capitol
last month to lobby lawmakers for more education funding and raises for
teachers.

“My adjusted gross income is $28,000,” said Shala Marshall, a Spanish
teacher at Jenks High School. A 17-year veteran with a master’s degree
and a finalist for Oklahoma teacher of the year, Ms. Marshall has two
children. “I can’t support a family on that,” she said.

So she puts in another 30 hours or so a week tutoring students and
selling online the luminescent pink LipSense gloss she wears. That pays
for soccer cleats, camp and school pictures, as well as her children’s
health insurance.

On April 3, Governor Fallin signed [a
bill](http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/capitol_report/fallin-signs-common-ed-budget-bills-giving-raises-to-school/article_22e39f1b-7d7e-593c-a189-f9aff8a984ab.html)
to increase taxes for the first time in 28 years to pay for teacher
raises of roughly $6,000 and additional funding for schools. Dozens of
Republican lawmakers voted for the
measures.

“No one wants to raise taxes, but we’ve got to pay the bills,” said Josh
West, a freshman Republican from Grove, where his four children attend
public school.

He was one of several lawmakers to meet with Bixby and Jenks parents
over box lunches from Chick-fil-A. An Army veteran, Mr. West said he had
been criticized by conservative groups for refusing to sign a pledge to
never to raise taxes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“My district just wants to fix the problem,” Mr. West said. “They don’t
care if you’re Republican or Democrat.”

Several Republicans in the administration and Legislature now concede
that tax cutting got out of hand. “I was rather vocal last year as the
appropriations chair that even as a Republican, we had gone too far and
it was time to start investing again in Oklahoma,” said [Leslie
Osborn](http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/03/29/oklahoma-tax-cuts), a
representative from Mustang.

The recent budget also includes small pay raises for other state
workers. Ms. Moore, for instance, who watches over vulnerable adults, is
slated to get an additional $750 a year.

But the Department of Human Services, where she works, won’t be able to
restore any of the 1,200 jobs eliminated over the past three years,
leaving the agency with 6,109 full-time employees. Those figures don’t
include 800 vacancies that cannot be filled because the budget is
overstretched.

So Ms. Moore will still be responsible for roughly a third of the state,
covering 25 counties, 19,000 square miles, and more than 100 long-term
care institutions that care for older or disabled residents as well as
those with dementia.

“That’s a lot of windshield time,” she said.

Because of the cuts, the agency extended the deadline for maltreatment
investigations at nursing homes. Rather than beginning within seven days
of a complaint, they must now start within 30 days.

Ms. Moore’s friends and neighbors hold conflicting views of her
taxpayer-funded job. “The minute they have someone in the nursing home
they perceive to be mistreated, we’re the first people they come to,”
she said. “They want us when they need us. And when they no longer need
us again, they don’t want us.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some are resentful that they are being asked to pay for benefits that
they themselves struggle to afford.

“I asked my brother, ‘How do you feel about this pay raise?’” Ms. Moore
recalled. “He said: ‘I want you to have it. You deserve it. But we don’t
feel like we should pay for it.’”

“Well,” she said, “who do you want to pay for it?”
