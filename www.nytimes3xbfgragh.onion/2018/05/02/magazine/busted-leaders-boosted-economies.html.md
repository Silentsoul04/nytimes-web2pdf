As the rogues’ gallery of fallen world leaders grows, you might be
tempted to conclude that ours is the most corrupt era in history. Early
last month, the former South Korean president Park Geun-hye was
sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $17 million for bribery,
extortion and abuse of power. That same day, the former South African
president Jacob Zuma, forced to resign in February by his own party,
appeared in court to face charges over a $2.5 billion arms deal. The
next day came an even bigger blow: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s
former president and current front-runner in polls for October’s
presidential election, began serving a 12-year jail term on corruption
charges — in a federal police building he himself inaugurated more than
a decade ago.

Lula is a casualty of what may be the largest corruption scandal ever.
An octopuslike bribery scheme carried out by the Brazilian construction
giant Odebrecht has spawned investigations in more than a dozen
countries, implicating leaders from Chile to Colombia, Mexico to
Mozambique. (The scandal has also led to a $3.5 billion fine levied by
the United States Justice Department against Odebrecht and inspired a
new Netflix series.) In Peru alone, three former presidents are facing
trial or serving jail time on Odebrecht-related charges.

With the crisis still metastasizing, it was hard not to be cynical when,
in mid-April, the region’s presidents gathered in Lima for the Summit of
the Americas to deliver high-minded speeches on this year’s theme:
“Democratic Governance Against Corruption.” Donald Trump skipped the
meeting, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his stead. It was a
measure of the speed of these unfolding scandals that the White House
couldn’t keep up. Pence’s official schedule initially included “a
banquet hosted by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru.” The only
problem: Kuczynski was forced to resign three weeks earlier, one day
before he was to face certain impeachment on corruption charges.

Behind all these grim headlines, however, lies a larger and more
encouraging truth: Corruption is being exposed, denounced and prosecuted
more vigorously, and at higher levels, than ever. In Latin America, at
least, these are not just momentary flare-ups at the scandal du jour;
they seem to be the rumblings of a historic shift. “Judges, journalists
and the public now have the strength to take on high-level corruption,”
says Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica and
senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue. “It’s not that corruption
is getting worse or better, but that societies are more willing and able
to uncover it.”

**Corruption, of course,** is an ancient temptation. Aristotle pondered
its significance back in the 4th century B.C.E., around the same time
the Indian philosopher Kautiliya enumerated the “40 ways of
embezzlement.” Throughout history, there has been a spirited debate
about whether corruption acts like “grease” (smoothing the way past red
tape) or “sand” (clogging the system with unproductive costs and scaring
off investment). In the 18th century, the Anglo-Dutch economist Bernard
Mandeville contended, in his “Fable of the Bees,” that private vices by
the “dextrous management of skilful politicians” could be turned into
“publick benefits.” More recently, some academics have argued that
corruption can serve as an economic lubricant in societies that have low
levels of trust, weak legal institutions or feckless governments. As the
political scientist Samuel P. Huntington wrote: “In terms of economic
growth, the only thing worse than a society with a rigid,
overcentralized, dishonest bureaucracy is one with a rigid,
overcentralized, honest
bureaucracy.”

The “sand” argument, however, has gained far more traction in recent
years. “At this point, the evidence is fairly settled that corruption is
a drag on long-term growth,” Casas-Zamora says. The World Bank estimates
that bribes siphon off around $1.5 trillion from the global economy each
year — about 2 percent of world’s gross domestic product and 10 times
the value of overseas development aid. Much of that money, the bank
says, goes into the pockets and foreign bank accounts of elites rather
than into the public investments — schools, courts, hospitals, roads —
that are needed to lift economies over the long haul. By degrading
social norms and civic virtues, not to mention the rule of law on which
investment depends, corruption rots the foundations of a healthy
economy.

For citizens in the developing world, this is not an academic debate.
They see the costs of corruption every day: in shoddy public services;
in “public servants” suddenly driving luxury cars; in small businesses
pushed into the informal economy out of fear that taxes and laws will be
unfairly applied. Corruption is, in effect, a regressive tax. According
to the World Bank, poor families in developing countries often spend
twice as much of their income on bribes as high-income families. As the
World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, put it: “Every dollar that a corrupt
official or a corrupt business person puts in their pocket is a dollar
stolen from a pregnant woman who needs health care; or from a girl or a
boy who deserves an education; or from communities that need water,
roads and schools.” He concluded: “In the developing world, corruption
is Public Enemy No. 1.”

Just a few years ago, Peru was growing so fast that it was considered,
with Mexico, Chile and Colombia, one of the “Pacific Pumas.” But the
collapse of commodity prices hit hard — Peru depends heavily on mining —
and the Odebrecht payoffs in exchange for major infrastructure projects
laid bare the country’s vast inequalities and injustices. Corruption has
plagued Latin America since the days of colonial occupation, but in this
case, the cure hurts almost as much as the disease. The Odebrecht
scandal has paralyzed construction ventures across Peru, says Eduardo
Dargent, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of
Peru, “but it is also making the government more prudent for new public
investment projects.” It’s bitter medicine, but if it helps Peru begin
to overcome its culture of corruption, the economy will be far healthier
in the long run.

**Back in the** 1990s, when I lived in South America, Brazilians used a
common refrain, often delivered with a shrug of the shoulders, that
captured their tolerance for corrupt leaders: *“Rouba mas faz”* —
roughly, “He steals but he gets things done.” That passive acceptance is
disappearing fast, in Latin America and around the world. Part of the
change is demographic: Over the last decade, Latin America’s middle
class has grown by roughly 40 million people and now outnumbers those
living in poverty. The middle class wants more than jobs or survival,
more than *“rouba mas faz.”* As taxpayers, they want honest government
and are no longer willing to overlook abuses of power. With the help of
another new phenomenon, the mobilizing power of social media, this
rising middle class has led the anticorruption charge into the streets,
not just in Lima, Bogotá and Guatemala City but also in Baghdad,
Bucharest, Tel Aviv and beyond.

A central driver of the anticorruption movement is a young generation of
judges and prosecutors armed with greater independence and, in some
cases, tough new transparency laws. Many countries in Latin America have
adopted stricter accountability laws in the last two decades, though
only Brazil has tested them effectively. Sérgio Moro, the lead
prosecutor in Brazil’s biggest corruption cases, has leaned on two other
new tools, plea bargains and whistle-blower protections, to persuade
underlings to testify against top bosses and leaders, including Lula.
“Twenty-five years ago, there were no rules, no conventions, no
jurisdictions against corruption,” says Delia Ferreira Rubio, chair of
the global anticorruption group Transparency International. It’s the
collective responsibility of governments, civil society and businesses,
Ferreira Rubio says, “to ensure that impunity does not prevail.”

After an earlier wave of corruption scandals led to the fall of
presidents in Brazil and Peru, daily life resumed, and corruption only
worsened. Will this time be different? The social and legal progress
over the last 20 years may signal a tectonic shift. But corruption
fights back, too. In some countries, threatened elites are trying to
curb civil society, weaken prosecutors and attack the press. Even top
prosecutors say corruption cannot be rooted out with only court cases,
even ones that break the spell of impunity. The goal is to build
“systems of integrity” throughout society. And that requires
commitment greater than the platitudes emanating from the Summit of the
Americas. Such a prospect may be years, even generations, away. But the
biggest psychological obstacle may have fallen already. As Casas-Zamora
says, “The sense of fatalism about corruption is disappearing.”
