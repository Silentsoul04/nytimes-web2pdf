A new video series goes inside the process for creating the covers of
The New York Times Magazine. This week, a look at mothers who struggle
to get off drugs for their babies.

Jake Silverstein, editor in chief: ``It can be difficult to take a great
photograph of a subject who does not want her identity revealed. But
this shot is arresting, the perfect image for Jennifer Egan's article
about opioids and pregnancy. The way this woman is bent over her
innocent baby, embracing and protecting her while at the same time
burying her face in the child's back --- it seemed to us to perfectly
capture the feelings of agony, resilience and hope that the mothers in
Egan's article experience.''
