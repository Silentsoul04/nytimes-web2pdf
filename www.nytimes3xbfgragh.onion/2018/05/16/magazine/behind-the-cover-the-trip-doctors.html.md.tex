Gail Bichler, design director: ``In Michael Pollan's story about
mainstreaming the use of psychedelic drugs to treat mental disorders, he
describes his own experience taking psilocybin. We decided to have some
fun with that idea on our cover. We like how Christoph Niemann's trippy
image of Pollan plays with the viewer's visual perceptions.''
