Anthony Falco is an international pizza consultant. That is his actual
job. Before that, he was for years the pizza czar (another actual job!)
at Roberta's, the lauded pizza palace in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Now he
travels the world --- Brazil, Kuwait, India, Spain, Colombia --- to help
people get pizza businesses up and running. He helps them design their
kitchens and ovens, helps them figure out their naturally fermented
dough, teaches them to make mozzarella, shows them how to cook pies. He
designs logos for the pizzerias --- skeletons, wizards and sunglasses
are frequent motifs --- and helps train their staffs. Falco cooked
things that weren't pizza for a while, as a line cook in restaurants.
But for more than a decade he has been all pizza, all the time. He
shrugged when I asked him about it recently. ``I just like a pizza
party,'' he said.

Falco grew up in Austin, Tex., in a Sicilian family that came to central
Texas at the turn of the 20th century to farm. His great-grandmother
made the first pizzas he ever ate, and he ate them a lot: ``Super legit
Sicilian grandma pies,'' he told me. ``Lots of sauce, bread crumbs and
olive oil, onions and green olives, very little cheese.''

Falco liked those pizzas, he said. He really liked them. But he was a
child in suburban Texas in the 1990s, and the pizza he loved ---
passionately --- was the one everyone else loved, too: personal pan
pizza from Pizza Hut, sweet-sauced and pillowed with mozzarella, above a
thick, golden crust. He would tell his grandmother that, and reflecting
on the memory now, he said, ``I wish I could go back in time and punch
that kid in the face.'' But not because the Pizza Hut pizzas were bad!
They weren't, Falco said. They were delicious in their own particular
way, buttery of crust and stringy with salty cheese, swabbed with sweet
red sauce.

The memory of those pizzas stayed with Falco, as the memory of childhood
pizza stays with every American, a touchstone of pleasure, a
cheese-topped madeleine. You may have grown up with Greek restaurant
pizza or New Jersey bar pies or Domino's delivery or frozen supermarket
Tombstones. (I grew up on slices from Fascati, on Henry Street in
Brooklyn.) Whatever it was, that first pizza love represents an
important taste in your life, a benchmark. You crave it, sometimes. And
if you were an international pizza consultant, wouldn't you try to
develop a recipe for it yourself?

Falco did so between trips abroad, cooking in his home kitchen. The
recipe he came up with over the course of a few months of testing is
easy if time-consuming, a project of more than a few days. The
butter-rich dough hydrates and proofs and proofs, gaining flavor as it
sits at room temperature, rests in the chill of the refrigerator
overnight, then rises once more on the counter before it meets its
maker. The sauce is honeyed and tomato-rich, faintly spicy, with a pinch
of oregano added at the end for pungency. There are two kinds of
mozzarella: the store-bought commercial kind with skim milk in it,
low-moisture, super-melty; and fresh and creamy whole-milk cheese on
top, for maximum coverage. You cannot add too much. Pepperoni follows
before the oven, and the ruddy grease it releases acts like threads of
saffron in a paella, red-yellow above the pizza's crunchy, caramelized
crust.

The combination results in a pizza party of the very first order: pizzas
that recall the look and feel of corporate delivery pies while being
their very opposite. I said as much to Falco. He laughed and said, ``I
like to use nostalgia as a weapon.''
