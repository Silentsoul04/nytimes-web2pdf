\subsection{`The past sleds behind
him.'}\label{the-past-sleds-behind-him}}

\emph{--- From Christine Schutt's ``Pure Hollywood: And Other Stories''
(Grove Press, 2018, Page 96). Schutt is the author of two previous
collections and three novels, including the National Book Award finalist
``Florida.''}

What an excellent verb: ``sleds.'' What a weirdly specific way to
visualize time. In just five quick words, this sentence converts the
entire history of everything --- the whole past --- from its usual state
of formless abstraction (an energy field, a tidal wave, a void) into
something fabulously active and small: a kid on a toboggan, scraping and
sliding behind you, bumping over little hills, cheeks red from the cold,
pompom bouncing yarnily on top of a winter hat. The past becomes perky
and alive and attentive, always on your heels, even as you trek
perpetually forward.

As a lifelong mope, I tend to imagine the past very differently --- as
fundamentally huge and sad. It is a kind of ocean, always running
backward toward low tide, receding, draining away from me, and I stand
stuck on the edge of its shore, knowing that it contains everything I
have ever known --- my father and mother, the old maple tree, a black
dog and an orange cat, my grandmother's terrifying clock --- but all of
that is under the surface now, suspended in the water that rushes away
from me, and I will never be able to enter it, will never recover what
has sunk, and it causes me real pain. All of the water that happens to
be inside of me, the cellular plasma, keens for all of that other water
leaving, because it knows there will be no high tide.

But language is a powerful thing. Change an image, and so much changes
with it. The past can be a broom closet stuffed with receipts. The past
can be a heron hunting the frog of the now. The past can be Bigfoot ---
a legendary thing, blurry, possibly real and possibly not, swinging its
arms through precisely the forest you are not currently in. Or the past
can be a sled. Just turn around and look.
