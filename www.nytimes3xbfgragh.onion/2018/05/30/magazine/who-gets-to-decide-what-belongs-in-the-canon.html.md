Sometimes, it’s not enough to love something. You have to take that
thing — album, author, song, movie, show — and do more than love it. It
needs to be placed beyond mere love. You need to take that thing, wrap
it in plastic or put it on a pedestal. You need to dome it under a force
field so that other people’s grubby hands, opinions and inferior fandoms
can’t stain or disrespect it. You need not only to certify it but also
to forestall decertification. Basically, you need to make it “canon.”

The phrase didn’t originate on the internet but is *of* the internet and
its wing of antidiscursive discourse. It places a work, a person or an
idea beyond reproach. It pre-resolves debate. That is, of course, what a
canon is — a settled matter. It’s established rules and norms. It’s the
books of the Bible. It’s the approved Catholic saints. It’s Jane Austen,
the Beatles, Miles Davis, Andy Warhol and Beyoncé.

Traditionally, the people drawing up our cultural canons have been an
elite group of scholars and critics who embraced a work of art and sent
it aloft to some deifying realm. That consecration has spread from
academia to, say, Reddit, where fans gather around movies, TV dramas,
video games and comic books the way the academy threw its weight behind
Dostoyevsky, Joyce, Faulkner and Updike. “Battlestar Galactica” and “The
Simpsons,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and the DC and Marvel universes —
they’re canonical, too. And now “canon” has migrated from noun to
adjective, giving the word thunder and muscle and curatorial certitude.

In this sense, “canon” wants to keep something like “Star Wars”
heresy-free and internally consistent (so yes, there are canons within
canons). The series sprang more than 40 years ago from one man’s mind
and a single movie. Now it’s an industrial complex whose thematic
integrity desperately matters to its constituents. So when an
installment infuriates fans — the way, in December, “The Last Jedi” did,
with its apparent warping of the bylaws and powers of the “Star Wars”
galaxy (*this ISN’T how the Force WORKS\!\!*) — they don’t simply
complain. They say, “That’s not canon.” Last winter, a Change.org
petition circulated, calling for Disney to “Strike Star Wars Episode
VIII from the Official Canon” — as though it were some kind of Taco Bell
tie-in, and not, as the title clearly states, the eighth part of a
never-ending story — and more than 104,000 people signed on. The
receptive response to that not-entirely-serious campaign underscores
where we’ve been for some time with “canon”: nervous about the unfixed
quality of all kinds of art and unyielding in policing both its meaning
and
possibilities.

**On its face,** canon-making is a fairly human impulse: *I love this*.
Everyone else should, too\! Over time a single book becomes a library;
the library becomes a school of thought; the school of thought becomes a
prism through which the world is supposed to see itself. That enthusiasm
hardened, through curriculums, book clubs and great-works lists, into
something more authoritarian, so that canon became taste hammered into
stone tablets.

For many years its Moses has been Harold Bloom, whose “The Western
Canon: The Books and School of the Ages” was a best-selling sensation in
1994, for what it argued was — and by way of omission *wasn’t* — canon.
In his introduction, Bloom went so far as to pre-emptively dismiss
complaints about his biases as coming from the “school of resentment.”
Asked in a 1991 Paris Review interview whom this school comprised, Bloom
explained that it’s “an extraordinary sort of mélange of latest-model
feminists, Lacanians, that whole semiotic cackle.” These people, he went
on to say, “have no relationship whatever to literary values.”

But these people — women, along with nonwhite, nonstraight folks —
certainly could have shared Bloom’s literary values while also applying
prerogatives of their own. Interrogators of both the canon and the
canonizers have been dismissed as identity politicians rather than
critics or scholars. The old guard claims that they’re missing the point
of literature, thrusting morality upon an amoral pursuit, sullying the
experience. Often however, they’re arguing not for literature’s
restriction but for its expansion — let’s include Kafka, obviously, but
also Toni Morrison, Marilynne Robinson and Jhumpa Lahiri no less
obviously.

This questioning of the canon comes from places of lived experience.
It’s attuned to how great cultural work can leave you feeling irked
and demeaned. For some readers, loving Herman Melville or Joseph Conrad
requires some peacemaking with the not-quite-human representations of
black people in those texts. Loving Edith Wharton requires the same
reckoning with the insulting way she could describe Jews. Bigotry recurs
in canonical art. And committed engagement leaves us dutybound to
identify it. Shakespeare endures alongside analyses of his flawed
characterizations of all kinds of races, nationalities, religions and
women. Your great works should be strong enough to withstand some
feminist forensics.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But resisting these critiques — whether it’s of “The House of Mirth” or
the House of Marvel — with an automatic claim of canon feels like an act
of dominion, the establishment of an exclusive kingdom complete with
moat and drawbridge, which, of course, would make the so-called
resenters a mob of torch-wielding marauders and any challenge to
established “literary values” an act of savagery. Insisting that a canon
is settled gives those concerns the “fake news” treatment, denying a
legitimate grievance by saying there’s no grounds for one. It’s shutting
down a conversation, when the longer we go without one, the harder it
becomes to
speak.

**Canon formation, at** its heart, has to do with defending what you
love against obsolescence, but love can tip into zealotry, which can
lead us away from actual criticism into some pretty ugly zones. Our
mutual hypersensitivities might have yanked us away from enlightening,
crucial — and fun — cultural detective work (close reading, unpacking,
interpreting) and turned us into beat cops always on patrol, arresting
anything that rankles. That results in a skirmish like the one during
last summer’s Whitney Biennial, which culminated in the insistence that
Dana Schutz lose her career for an underwhelming painting of Emmett Till
because, as a white woman, she couldn’t possibly understand this black
boy’s death. The protests didn’t feel like an aesthetic demand but a
post-traumatic lashing out. Canceling her might be harsh historical
justice, but it denies me an understanding of why the painting fails.

This is to say that fandom and spectatorship, of late, have grown darkly
possessive as the country has become violently divided. Especially in
this moment when certain works of canonical art are in fact at risk of
becoming morally obsolete — both art that degrades and insults and the
work of men accused of having done the same. There’s a camp of fans —
who tend to be as white and male as the traditional canon makers — who
don’t want that work opened up or repossessed. They don’t want a
challenge to tradition — so please, no women in the writers’ room, say
superfans of the animated comedy “Rick and Morty,” and no earnest
acknowledgment that Apu is a bothersome South Asian stereotype, say the
makers of “The Simpsons.” It’s all too canonical to change.

You can see the reactionary urge on every side. We’ve reached this
comical — but politically necessary — place in which nonstraight,
nonwhite, nonmale culture of all kinds has also been placed beyond
reproach. Because it’s precious or rare or not meant for the people who
tend to do the canonizing. If Korama Danquah, writing for a site called
Geek Girl Authority, asserts that the sister of Black Panther is more
brilliant than the white billionaire also known as Iron Man, she doesn’t
want to hear otherwise. “Shuri is the smartest person in the Marvel
universe,” goes the post. “That’s not an opinion, that’s canon. She is
smarter than Tony Stark.” “Black Panther,” according to this argument,
is canon not only because it’s a Marvel movie but because it matters too
much to too many black people to be anything else.

But that’s also made having conversations about the movie in which
somebody leads with, “I really liked it, but ...” nearly impossible.
This protectionism makes all the sense in the world for a country that’s
failed to acknowledge a black audience’s hunger for, say, a black
comic-book blockbuster. But critic-proofing this movie — making it too
black to dislike — risks making it less equal to and more fragile than
its white peers.

The intolerance of the traditional gatekeepers might have spurred a kind
of militancy from thinkers (and fans) who’ve rarely been allowed in.
Bloom’s literary paradise is long lost, and now history compels us to
defend Wakanda’s. But that leaves the contested art in an equally
perilous spot: not art at all, really, but territory.
