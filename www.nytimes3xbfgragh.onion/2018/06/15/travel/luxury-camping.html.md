# Glamping Slips Into the Mainstream

The allure of luxury camping has brought a wave of new destinations this
year, and they aren’t always in the
wild.

Camping in the wild with all the comforts of a deluxe hotel, including
real beds, plush furnishings and attending stewards, has been around
since 19th-century African wildlife safaris. Now known as glamping —
short for glamorous camping — the hybrid of camp and resort has
exploded, bringing a wave of new glamping destinations this year in a
variety of price ranges.

For travelers, the camps offer convenient access to nature without an
investment in equipment or the chores of firewood-gathering and the
common camping hazards of splinters, sleeping in the rain and waking up
cold.

“People nowadays desire real change from the grind of their daily
commutes, the dreary workplace environment with its ever-present noise
pollution and the constant invasion of smartphones,” said George
Morgan-Grenville, the founder and chief executive of
[Red](https://www.redsavannah.com/)[Savannah](https://www.redsavannah.com/)[,](https://www.redsavannah.com/)
a high-end travel company. “Glamping is the ultimate realization of
‘disconnect to reconnect.’”

Indicative of glamping’s growth, the biggest American camp collectives
are on an expansionist spree. Both [Under
Canvas](https://www.undercanvas.com/) and [Collective
Retreats](http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Hotel-News/Glamping-expansion-Collective-Retreats-gets-10M-investment)
recently secured new funding, $17 million and $10 million, respectively.
The 37,000-acre [Resort at Paws Up](http://pawsup.com/) in Montana, one
of the earliest, in 2005, to erect fancy tents with framed art on the
canvas walls, rugs on the wood floors and downy duvets on the log-frame
beds, introduced glamping’s first three-bedroom, two-bathroom tents last
summer.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Popular glamping sites are expanding in ways that resemble more
traditional hotels, too. [Firelight
Camps](http://www.firelightcamps.com/) in Ithaca, N.Y., plans to open a
Catskills location next fall that will include a restaurant from its
co-founder and chef Emma Frisch, who recently published a cookbook,
“Feast by Firelight,” which includes recipes served at the camp’s
daily breakfasts and occasional dinners.

[Glamping.com](http://glamping.com/) lists nearly 800 locations
worldwide, including lodges, tree houses and cabins — essentially, any
accommodation in a natural setting with luxury-level service — but the
following new glamping sites follow the classic definition: tent-based.

### <span>URBAN GLAMPING</span>

Light pollution, noise and nocturnal pests, human and otherwise, haven’t
discouraged glamping entrepreneurs from setting up in cities. The most
significant camp to put down city stakes, [Collective
Governors](https://www.collectiveretreats.com/retreat/collective-governors-island/)[Island](https://www.collectiveretreats.com/retreat/collective-governors-island/),
will feature 37 tents on the car-free island in New York Harbor once
it’s fully open in July (from $150). The company Collective Retreats
has been setting up seasonal camps since 2015 when it opened in Vail,
Colo. The New York camp will have its own restaurant, offer massage
services and equip some tents with their own bathrooms. Others will
share facilities but all will have furnished porches and wood-frame beds
with 1,500-thread-count linens.

A spate of luxury hotels is newly offering glamping on the private
terraces of its top suites, including the [Gwen
Hotel](http://www.thegwenchicago.com/) in Chicago, the [Beverly
Wilshire, a Four Seasons
Hotel](https://www.fourseasons.com/beverlywilshire/) in Beverly Hills,
Calif., and [Le Méridien Denver
Downtown](http://www.lemeridiendenverdowntown.com/), running between
$3,500 and $15,000 a night.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>INTO THE WILD</span>

Under Canvas operates seasonal glamping resorts near national parks,
among them<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Yellowstone, Zion
and Glacier.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Last month, it
opened [Under Canvas
Rushmore](https://www.undercanvas.com/camps/mount-rushmore/) in South
Dakota through Oct. 1. The solar-powered forest compound of 80
four-person tents, each with a wood stove and some with attached
bathrooms, offers views of Mount Rushmore (from $209). Guests can eat
hearty breakfasts and campfire dinners of smoked, grilled and roasted
meats on site, and the kitchen packs box lunches for those heading out
to climb, bike or take Jeep safaris.

On Aug. 30, [Under Canvas Great Smoky
Mountains](https://www.undercanvas.com/camps/great-smoky-mountains/)
will open in Gatlinburg, Tenn., with 54 tents on 200 acres near the
national park (from $199).

[Collective Hill
Country](https://www.collectiveretreats.com/retreat/collective-hill-country/),
the second opening this summer of a glamping resort by Collective
Retreats, will spring up on a 225-acre ranch near Austin, Tex., offering
activities like horseback riding and winery tours. Guests in its 12
tents will dine on campfire dishes like jalapeño and Cheddar grits and
wild boar osso buco (from $400).

On the Hudson River in Kingston, N. Y., [Terra
Glamping](https://www.terraglamping.com/catskills/) is slated to open
this month at [Hutton
Brickyards](https://www.huttonbrickyards.com/#section1), a riverside
event venue, with 25 tents featuring memory-foam mattresses, down
bedding, Turkish towels and robes (from $225). Guests can borrow bikes,
kayaks and stand-up paddleboards, as well as lanterns and flashlights
after dark.

For beach lovers, [Wild Lotus](https://www.wildlotuscamp.com/) operates
a tented camp on the Caribbean island of Antigua. Tents come with blowup
mattresses, coolers and ice, and guests have access to showers at a
neighboring beach bar (from $149). Or you can glamp at the company’s
rain forest camp on nearby
[Montserrat](https://www.wildlotuscamp.com/montserrat).

Among the truly glamorous new<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>glamping facilities, the [Rosewood Luang
Prabang](https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/luang-prabang) opened in
March in a forested setting near the Laotian city with six deluxe tents
among its 23 accommodations (from $724). While residing closer to
nature, guests of the tent suites have access to the resort’s many
amenities: a pool, tented spa villas, restaurant and activities such as
cooking classes and Mekong River cruises.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like the Rosewood property, the celebrated designer Bill Bensley also
designed the new [Capella Ubud](https://www.capellaubud.com/) opening in
Bali in June. The Indonesian retreat will host 23 tents, furnished to
evoke 19th-century colonial travel. Even the gym will be based under
canvas, as will the Officers Tent lounge (from $838, including
breakfast).

### <span>ON THE MOVE</span>

Tents were created to provide shelter in the wilderness and upscale
versions can be found increasingly in remote locales accessible on
multiday trips.

This summer, Off the Map Travel is introducing three-night trips on
Norway’s [Lofoten
Islands](https://www.offthemap.travel/experiences/glamping-in-lofoten-islands/),
a mountainous and fjord-filled region above the Arctic Circle, based in
tepee tents decorated in the style of the indigenous Sami people.
Itineraries include kayaking, hiking and whale watching (three-night
trips, June through August, from 1,499 pounds, or about $1,995).

In September, [Peru Ecocamp](https://www.peruecocamp.com/) will open
with five deluxe camps strung out along the Salkantay trail leading to
Machu Picchu. Guests will hike between the high-altitude, solar-powered
camps, which will feature dome-shaped sleeping tents with bathrooms,
showers and wood stoves. Each camp will operate a dining dome, organic
garden and bar tent (seven-night trips from $3,791).

This year, REI Adventures will expand its [Signature
Camping](https://www.rei.com/adventures/trips/signature-camping)
program, which brings deluxe mobile camps to remote locales, with the
addition of Mount Kilimanjaro. Two different routes up Africa’s highest
peak will feature overnights in camps set up ahead of arriving guests
and include sizable tents with cots and lighting as well as a furnished
communal area and staff cooks (10 days from $4,999).

To celebrate the spring and fall equinox, Hotel Chaco in Albuquerque,
N.M., and the tour operator Heritage Inspirations are offering two-day
trips to the Pueblo ruins at [Chaco Canyon National Historic
Park](https://www.heritageinspirations.com/chaco-tours/chaco-canyon-glamping-overnight/).
After a five-course dinner, stargazing and sleeping in furnished tents,
guests rise to track the sunrise, which aligns with the east-west
orientation of the astronomically influenced sandstone-and-timber
buildings. The next tour departs Sept. 22 ($750), though private tours
are also available.
