Last month, when I returned from a trip to China, I knew for sure that
it would take me about 12 days to recover from having spent time in a
place that was 12 hours ahead of home in New York. I resigned myself to
a dozen mornings of waking up before dawn and just as many afternoons of
finding myself fuzzy-headed at 4 and ready for bed soon after. What I
didn’t anticipate were the fierce cravings that struck at all hours.
Throughout the days and into some nights, I wanted both what I loved in
China and what I missed while I was there. I dreamed of congee drizzled
with vinegar, soup dumplings, slurpable noodles, tofu so fragile it
wriggled off a spoon. But what I yearned for most was what I’d had
least, sweets with crunch — lots of crunch, full-on crunch — a texture
that hardly turned up in Shanghainese cooking.

I’ve always liked crunch. As a kid, I ate Rice Krispies straight from
the box, no milk. I liked Nestlé Crunch, but only when it was frozen to
peak crunchiness; little sesame candies (we used to call them birdseed)
that could send you to the dentist if you didn’t bite down on them just
so; and the thick sugar coating on Jordan almonds and pralines. Crunch
is fun, but it’s also a bit of magic for a baker: Add some and almost
any dessert becomes more exciting.

Consider the here-and-there crunch of chips or small chunks of chocolate
in cookies and ice cream, toasted nuts running through a plain butter
cake, well-baked golden brown streusel on top of almost anything, cookie
crumbs, cocoa nibs or crushed pretzels over something creamy or soft,
slippery or gooey, and all kinds of crushed, bumpy, crackly bits over a
sundae, especially shards of hard caramel that snap at first bite.
Crunch is to sweets what a bold spice is to a savory dish: a culinary
speed bump — as soon as you hit it, you slow down and
focus.

It seems odd that a texture with so much personality can so generously
play sidekick to almost every other texture. Odd, too, that crunch is
something we often crave when it’s absent and take for granted when it’s
present. I don’t think a velvety truffle bonbon would be nearly as
alluring if it weren’t wrapped in a thin layer of brittle chocolate. And
crème brûlée might be loved only half as much without the contrapuntal
crackle of burned sugar. When something is too creamy, too spongy, too
soft, too airy, unremittingly smooth, chewy or mushy, that’s when we
miss crunch.

During those long, jet-lagged days and nights, what I wanted most were
biscotti, the crunchiest dessert I know how to make. Biscotti are
Italian cookies that are baked twice. The first round in the oven, when
the dough has been cajoled into two logs that look unpromising no matter
how much you fuss with them, is to bake them until just shy of done. The
second, after you’ve sliced the logs into cookies and lined them up on a
baking sheet like members of a marching band, is to dry them and set
their signature texture, which covers the spectrum of crunch: They’re
crunchy at the center; crunchier as you make your way down to the ends;
and crunchiest at their tips.

The biscotti I baked the day I got home were chocolate, made with cocoa,
studded with chips as well as sliced almonds, their texture bolstered by
the addition of cornmeal, an ingredient that doesn’t cede its
characteristic roughness under heat. I loved their looks — slender,
gently arched and slightly tapered at the ends. The cookie’s shape is
sophisticated, but its spirit is renegade: No matter what you may have
been taught about the impropriety of dunking, these sweets demand to be
dipped in milk, espresso or even red wine. Really, biscotti should be
double, triple and quadruple dipped — a dip a bite is perfect. That it’s
impossible to eat them quietly almost goes without saying. And abandon
all hope of corralling the crumbs, the exuberant fallout from breaking
biscotti.

While the cookie you’re eating won’t last long no matter how slowly you
nibble, the batch of biscotti does. Because they’re dry to start with,
they don’t get stale quickly, making them ideal for picnics, parties,
tailgaters, treks and trips to China. I’ll be packing them the next time
I go.
