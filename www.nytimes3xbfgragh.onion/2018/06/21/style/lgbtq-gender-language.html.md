***Updated on June 7, 2019***

When I came out as gay more than 10 years ago, there were only four
letters commonly used to group various sexual and gender minorities: L,
G, B and T.

These letters were an evolution toward inclusion — an expansion of the
language used to represent a disparate group that had often just been
called “the gay community.”

Despite their intent, the letters proved to be limiting.

Times and attitudes have changed, and the language used to discuss
sexual orientation and gender identity has also changed. As a result,
the established L.G.B.T. abbreviation has acquired a few extra letters —
and a cluster of ancillary terminology around both sexuality and gender.
Not everyone has adopted them yet.

Take, for example, the addition of “Q” that became increasingly popular
as the 20th century turned into the 21st. Some insisted this stood for
“questioning,” representing people who were uncertain of their sexual
orientations or gender identities. Others declared it was for “queer,” a
catchall term that has shed its derogatory origins and is gaining
acceptance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now there’s also I, for intersex; A, for ally (or asexual, depending on
whom you’re talking to); and often a plus sign meant to cover anyone
else who’s not included: L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+.

However that’s just the beginning. In the year since The New York Times
first published this article in Summer 2018, the language used to
describe the gender and sexuality spectrums has grown, with new terms
becoming more prominent.

As World Pride, the annual celebration of L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+ identity,
comes to New York City for the month of June, The Times is asking
readers to [share how they
identify](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/nyregion/nyc-pride-identity.html).
We have updated this list to reflect more common themes among the
responses.

## Tell Us Who You Are

Ahead of World Pride in June, we want to capture the ever-evolving ways
in which we describe ourselves. What labels do you choose for yourself?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What follows is a by-no-means inclusive list of vocabulary.

**GAY AND LESBIAN** It’s important to start with the basics, and “gay”
and “lesbian” are as basic as it gets. As “homosexual” began to feel
clinical and pejorative, gay became the de rigueur mainstream term to
refer to same-sex attraction in the late 1960s and early ’70s.
Gradually, as what was then called the gay liberation movement gained
steam, the phrase “gay and lesbian” became more popular as a way to
highlight the similar-yet-separate issues faced by women in the fight
for tolerance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Gay is still sometimes used as an umbrella term, but these days, it also
refers specifically to men, as in “gay men and lesbians.”

**BISEXUAL** Someone who is attracted to people of their gender or other
gender identities. It is not a way station from straight to gay, as it
had once been described.

The stereotypes around bisexuality — that it’s a transitional stage or a
cover for promiscuity — have been at the center of fraught conversation
within L.G.B.T.Q. circles [for
years](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2005/07/05/health/straight-gay-or-lying-bisexuality-revisited.html).
The musical television show “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” which features a
bisexual male character, had [an entire song refuting
this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7844P77Is).

As advocates speak out more about what they see as “bisexual erasure” —
the persistent questioning or negation of bisexual identity — the term
has become resurgent. But some people also argue that the prefix “bi”
reinforces a male/female gender binary that isn’t inclusive enough.

**PANSEXUAL** Someone who is attracted to people of all gender
identities. Or someone who is attracted to a person’s qualities
regardless of their gender identity. (The prefix “pan” means “all,”
rejecting the gender binary that some argue is implied by “bisexual.”)

Once a more niche term used by academics, pansexual has entered the
mainstream, pushed in part by celebrities bringing it visibility. The
singer Miley Cyrus [identified as pansexual
in 2015](https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/news/a27520/miley-cyrus-interview-october-2015/).
In April, after the singer [Janelle Monàe came out as
pansexual](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/cover-story-janelle-monae-prince-new-lp-her-sexuality-w519523)
in a “Rolling Stone” article, searches for the word on Merriam-Webster’s
website rose 11,000 percent, according to the dictionary.

**ASEXUAL** Or “ace.” Someone who experiences little to no sexual
attraction. They are not to be confused with “aromantic people,” who
experience little or no romantic attraction. Asexual people do not
always identify as aromantic; aromantic people do not always identify as
asexual.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More generally, some people (asexual or otherwise) identify as having a
romantic orientation different than their sexual orientation. The
terminology is similar: homoromantic, heteroromantic, biromantic and so
on.

**DEMISEXUAL** Someone who generally does not experience sexual
attraction unless they have formed a strong emotional, but not
necessarily romantic, connection with someone.

**GRAYSEXUAL** Someone who occasionally experiences sexual attraction
but usually does not; it covers a kind of gray space between asexuality
and sexual identity.

**CISGENDER** Someone whose gender identity matches the sex they were
assigned at birth.

**TRANSGENDER** A wide-ranging term for people whose gender identity or
gender expression differs from the biological sex they were assigned at
birth.

**TRANSGENDERED** Not a word. Often used as one.

**TRANS\* OR TRANS+** Two umbrella terms for non-cisgender identities.

**GENDER NONCONFORMING, OR G.N.C.** One who expresses gender outside
traditional norms associated with masculinity or femininity. Not all
gender-nonconforming people are transgender, and some transgender people
express gender in conventionally masculine or feminine ways.

**NONBINARY** A person who identifies as neither male nor female and
sees themselves outside the gender binary. This is sometimes shortened
to N.B. or enby. One notable example: Taylor Mason, a financial analyst
on [the show
“Billions,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/billions-tv-recaps)
who is believed to be the first gender nonbinary character on television
and is played by the nonbinary actor Asia Kate Dillon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**GENDERQUEER** Another term often used to describe someone whose gender
identity is outside the strict male/female binary. They may exhibit both
traditionally masculine and feminine qualities or neither.

**GENDER FLUID** A term used by people whose identity shifts or
fluctuates. Sometimes these individuals may identify or express
themselves as more masculine on some days, and more feminine on others.

**GENDER-NEUTRAL** Someone who prefers not to be described by a specific
gender, but prefers “they” as a singular pronoun (the American Dialect
Society’s [2015 Word of the
Year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/31/fashion/pronoun-confusion-sexual-fluidity.html))
or the honorific “Mx.,” a substitute for “Mr.” or “Ms.” that [entered
the Oxford English Dictionary
in 2015](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/07/style/me-myself-and-mx.html).

**M.A.A.B./F.A.A.B./U.A.A.B.** Male-assigned at birth/female-assigned at
birth/unassigned at birth.

**INTERSEX** A term for someone born with biological sex characteristics
that aren’t traditionally associated with male or female bodies.
Intersexuality does not refer to sexual orientation or gender identity.

**+** Not just a mathematical symbol anymore, but a denotation of
everything on the gender and sexuality spectrum that letters and words
can’t yet describe.
