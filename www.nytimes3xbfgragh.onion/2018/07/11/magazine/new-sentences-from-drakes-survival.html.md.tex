\subsection{`My Mount Rushmore is me with four different
expressions.'}\label{my-mount-rushmore-is-me-with-four-different-expressions}}

\emph{--- From ``Survival,'' the lead track on Drake's new album,
``Scorpion.''}

Mount Rushmore --- the gigantic collection of souvenir busts on
America's national mantel --- has become, in recent years, shorthand for
greatness of any kind. It is a modern parlor game. We ask each other,
about every subject: Who is on your Mount Rushmore?

The question can be applied to Disney princesses (Ariel, Jasmine,
Cinderella, Mulan) and Major League Baseball mustaches (Don Mattingly,
Goose Gossage, Dennis Eckersley, Rollie Fingers). It works equally well
for backyard birds (cardinal, mourningdove, blue jay, robin) and Jelly
Belly flavors (Buttered Popcorn, ToastedMarshmallow, Juicy Pear,
Watermelon).

The challenge is always to pick only four. Each figure has to be
individually great but also collectively meaningful --- together, your
quartet must support, like pillars, the entire history of the subject at
hand. The differences are as important as the similarities. It's always
harder to choose than it seems.

Drake, however, has no difficulty choosing at all. His Mount Rushmore
includes four Drakes. It's a classic rap boast --- his ego is so
monumental that it becomes a literal monument. What I love about this
all-Drake Rushmore, though, is that it doesn't depict him at different
ages, or in different phases of his career, or with different beard
styles. The variations come down to just one thing: facial expression.
Drake is, above all, a performer of moods. His most delicate emotional
modulations --- anger, melancholia, joy, pain --- are the wellspring of
his multi-multi-multi-platinum success.

And so his Rushmore joke, in addition to being funny, is also in some
sense correct: It probably would be an appropriate tribute to carve, in
granite, each little shift in the muscles of his face and eyes and
mouth, each outward sign of his very famous internal states. Mount
Drakemore, eternally feeling all the feels.
