A basketball-size chunk of molten rock, known as a lava bomb, crashed
into a tourist boat off Hawaii's coast this week, injuring 23 people who
were there to watch lava flow off the Big Island, officials said.

The Coast Guard has opened an investigation into whether the boat was in
a restricted zone when the lava struck.

The boat was touring near a lava flow around 6 a.m. on Monday in Kapoho
Bay, on the island's east coast, when molten lava showered down on the
vessel's metal roof, leaving a gaping hole, according to a
\href{http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2018/07/16/nr18-140/}{statement} from
Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources.

After the boat returned to shore, 13 people were transported to the
hospital and 10 people with minor injuries were treated on site. One
passenger, a 20-year-old woman, seriously injured a leg, the statement
said.

The source of the lava was Kilauea, one of the world's most active
volcanoes, which has attracted tourists in recent months who are eager
to see the piping hot rock for themselves.

After the episode, all vessels were restricted from traveling within 300
meters, or about 330 yards, of the lava flowing into the Pacific Ocean,
the Coast Guard said in a statement on Monday. Previously, tourist boats
with experienced professional captains could get permission to operate
50 meters or more away from the lava, but they will no longer be able to
do so, said Matthew West, a Coast Guard spokesman.

The captain of the boat, Shane Turpin, said he was well outside the zone
at the time of the explosion,

reported} on Tuesday. Mr. Turpin did not respond to a request for
comment.

of an explosion} that was captured from another lava tour boat around
the time the boat was hit shows a huge plume of dark smoke and red lava
on the water's surface.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/17/us/eruption-volcano-hawaii-kilauea.html}{Kilauea
volcano erupted} from its summit earlier this year after days of small
earthquakes. The lava flow has destroyed hundreds of homes and other
buildings, and the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/07/us/hawaii-volcano-kilauea.html}{urged
tourists to steer clear} of the area in May.

The volcano was active as of Monday morning, according to the
\href{https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/status.html}{United
States Geological Survey}.

The company that operated the boat, Lava Ocean Tours, is based in Hilo,
Hawaii, and advertises itself as an ``exciting way to experience the
molten hot lava entering the sea.'' The ``Hot Spot'' vessel that was hit
by the lava bomb can seat up to 49 passengers, and each three-hour tour
costs \$225 to \$250, according to the
\href{http://seelava.com/big-island-boat-tours/}{company's website.}

The explosion can be explained by molten rock coming in contact with
ocean water, which causes the water to boil quickly, sending off plumes
of steam, said Einat Lev, a volcanology expert and assistant professor
at Columbia University. As the gas expands, it sets off the blast.

This interaction causes a ``corrosive seawater plume'' laden with
hydrochloric acid and volcanic particles, which can irritate the eyes,
skin and lungs, according to the Geological Survey.

Dr. Lev said the Kilauea volcano has had an ``ocean entry,'' or a
location where the lava comes in contact with water, since the 1980s,
attracting tourists who are willing to accept some risk to see the
spectacle.

``People have been trying to look at this ocean entry for many years,''
she said. ``This one is flowing a little faster, so they might have been
a little too close.''

Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources is also investigating
the episode.
