\textbf{Kathy Ryan, director of photography:} ``George Soros sat for
this portrait by Damon Winter in July at Soros's Hamptons estate. Winter
carefully lit the portrait to capture the `texture and history in the
lines of his 87-year-old face.' This simple, unadorned photograph draws
its emotional power from the way in which his face emerges from the
darkness, and from the gleam of light on his watery eyes.''
