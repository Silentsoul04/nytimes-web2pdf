``The physical absence was the first thing I noticed,'' says Katie Reid,
29, who gave up her iPhone in February for a flip phone. ``It felt like
something was missing from my body.'' This phantom-limb-like sensation
will last about a month; a flip phone will never have that same hold on
you. To make the transition tolerable, wean yourself slowly. For Reid,
who is the director of digital media at a boys' school in Baltimore, the
process took years. First, do a smartphone self-diagnosis. ``If there's
something in your gut telling you this isn't good for you, explore
that,'' says Reid, who found that the constant access to social-media
sites, Twitter especially, made her anxious and sad.

She began by removing the social-media apps from her iPhone. That might
be enough, but if you continue to feel a compulsion that makes you
uneasy, consider flip-phonedom. Start paying more attention to
geography. Reid worried most about the loss of GPS-enabled maps. Without
them, you'll need to plan ahead by looking up directions and printing
them out or writing them down. ``I bought some maps for my car,'' Reid
says. You will occasionally get lost. Still, take comfort in the fact
that smartphones are all around you; nearly 80 percent of adults in the
United States have one. You can ask for directions. Others can order an
Uber or Lyft for you. Recently, Reid's 1-year-old daughter had a
birthday party. ``I didn't take any pictures,'' she says, but of course
she knew that someone else would.

Prepare for clunky predictive-texting technology. For Reid, this T9
texting --- that is, without a full keyboard --- is the most irksome
thing about the flip phone. You'll end up calling people more often.

Social interactions will be challenging. People will tease you or
apologize sheepishly for using their phones in front of you. Your
parents might be frustrated. Onlookers will assume you hate technology.
Maybe you do, but Reid doesn't. She spends long stretches of her days in
front of a computer, but she has no desire to go back to a smartphone.
``There was this expectation that I was going to be reachable all the
time,'' Reid says. ``I like not having to answer to that.''
