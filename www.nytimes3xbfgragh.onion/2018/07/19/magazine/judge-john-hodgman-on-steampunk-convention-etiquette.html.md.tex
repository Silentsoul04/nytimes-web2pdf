\textbf{Samantha writes:} \emph{My sister and I go to steampunk
conventions together. A while ago she said she might go as a steampunk
version of Carrie from ``Carrie.'' She asked if she could use a dress I
own. I agreed, but she never made the costume. This year, I would like
to go as Steampunk Carrie. It's my dress, but it's her idea. Can I use
it?}

You're asking me because you know that, were you to ask your sister, she
would probably say no. Steampunk Carrie is an amazing idea for a
costume, and amazing ideas are in short supply. Magazine court order or
no, were you to steal it without her O.K., you would deserve to be
doused in a bucket of clockwork blood. Especially when the fair solution
is obvious: Your sister goes as Carrie; you wear a steampunk version of
William Katt's powder-blue prom tux.
