\emph{Selected by RITA DOVE}

Who among us hasn't looked back at youth with rueful bemusement --- all
that impatience and hunger and certitude, that yearning for tragic
emotion, for an adult heartache that will come all too soon? Clocking in
at one line longer than a sonnet, Jenny Xie's poem takes us through
those salad years with a list of trials overcome or succumbed to.
Fragmentary details from a life --- the poet's? ours? --- emerge in bits
and spurts, until the last two lines coalesce into the first full
sentence. This poem is both inventory and warning: You can take stock,
but there is always more to come.
