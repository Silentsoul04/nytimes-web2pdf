\emph{For the latest updates on the Mendocino Complex Fire, read}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/07/us/california-fires-mendocino.html}{\emph{this
story}}\emph{.}

A fire that has been growing for nearly two weeks in Northern
California, becoming the largest in modern state history, continued to
rage overnight, as firefighters battled to keep the edges from eating
into residential areas, officials said on Tuesday.

The Mendocino Complex Fire, which is burning northwest of Sacramento,
reached more than 290,600 acres as of Tuesday morning, said Cal Fire,
the state's fire agency. It overtook last year's 282,000-acre Thomas
Fire on Monday to become the most sizable California fire in a century
of record-keeping.

Benjamin Nicholls, a division chief of Cal Fire, said on Tuesday morning
that crews were battling the expanding blaze along the northern edges of
the fire, where it extends into mostly forested areas. He said crews
were working on hot spots to make sure the fire does not creep into
residential areas in the south.

``The increase of acreage is into the forest,'' he said in an interview.
``The fire is holding on the south side.''

Lynne Tolmachoff, a spokeswoman for the agency, said on Monday that the
state was in only the middle of its fire season, noting that the worst
fires often occur later in the year, as the land becomes increasingly
dry and weather patterns create windy conditions.

``We've got a long road ahead,'' she said.

Larry Dietz, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said there were about 500
people in six Red Cross shelters and in one other shelter that is not
affiliated with the agency. Residents are given bedding, kits with
toiletries and meals.

``It is kind of smoky here,'' he said, speaking by telephone from
Middletown, which has a population of about 1,300 people. `We have a
very high proportion of people that are in the shelter requiring
significant medical care, such as mobility issues and use of oxygen
tanks. It is my understanding that they had to evacuate a skilled
nursing facility.''

The Mendocino Complex Fire is a combination of two fires that ignited a
few miles apart, Ms. Tolmachoff said. In instances where multiple blazes
are close enough together and affect the same area, she said, officials
consider them one fire, called a complex.

Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which started on July
27 and was 34 percent contained as of early Tuesday, Cal Fire
\href{http://cdfdata.fire.ca.gov/admin8327985/cdf/images/incidentfile2175_3899.pdf}{said
in its latest update}.

It has destroyed 143 structures as of Tuesday: 75 residences and 68
other types of structures.

Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms.
Tolmachoff said. By contrast, the Carr Fire, which is also burning in
Northern California, has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/05/us/carr-fire-california-wildfires.html}{killed
seven people} and destroyed more than 1,600 buildings. It is the 12th
largest in California history, at about 164,000 acres.

Of the
\href{http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/downloads/fact_sheets/Top20_Acres.pdf}{top
20 largest wildfires in California}, about half have come in the last
decade, according to Cal Fire.

``That says a lot about the way things are changing in California,'' Ms.
Tolmachoff said.
