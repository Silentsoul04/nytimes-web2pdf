World}\label{inside-angela-missonis-rainbow-colored-world}}

The Italian designer has a photographic memory of every fabric, look and
accessory that her family's brand has ever made.

``My mind is like a mosaic of rainbow-colored memories,'' says
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/25/t-magazine/fashion/angela-missoni-milan-fashion-week.html}{Angela
Missoni}, the Italian designer who is celebrating her 21st year as the
creative director of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/slideshow/2018/02/24/fashion/runway-womens/missoni-m-w-fall-2018.html}{house
her parents built} in 1953. Starting with a few simple chevron-patterned
wovens produced in a small factory in Gallarate, Italy,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/11/t-magazine/rosita-missoni-garden-home.html}{Rosita}
and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/05/10/fashion/ottavio-missoni-is-dead-at-92.html}{Ottavio
Missoni} pioneered the now widely used space-dying technique for yarn
--- still the magic ingredient in the house's signature kaleidoscopic
knits. By the time Angela was a teenager, she was shadowing her mother
as she worked on runway collections, and she soon started designing
accessories. Since taking over the company in 1997, Angela has continued
the family's vibrant legacy --- introducing beachwear and updating the
once-weighty zigzag knit with lighter Lurex yarns and gauzy
constructions for evening. She's also crystallized what it means to be
Missoni: a luxe-bohemian mix of bright Amalfi-inspired colors, rich
cashmeres and wools, and a lavishly layered mismatch of happy florals
and crooked stripes.

``For me, Missoni is ingrained and instinctual --- it's not something I
have to study to understand,'' says the 59-year-old, who is indeed a
walking house archive, with a photographic memory of every fabric, look
and accessory the brand has ever made. She picked her favorites of
these, resurrecting cotton and wool patterns from the past two decades,
for the patchwork overcoats shown in her resort collection this year,
which also happens to be Missoni's 65th anniversary.

``Here I am with two stone crab claws in Florida. If you look closely,
you can see my two earrings are different. It's my thing.''

in 1968, came out when I was 9 years old. My mom knit me a little
two-piece and a miniskirt in the same pattern. I still have them
today.'' \emph{Right:} ``I've been carrying an
\href{https://www.iacobella.com/about-1/}{Iacobella bag} every day for
the past two years, and so have my daughters. So we asked the designer
Iacobella Gaetani to do a version of the bag for us at Missoni. This one
is made from tie-dyed shearling.''

\emph{Left:} ``I have a couple of Tibetan tiger rugs in my bedroom next
to my bed. I used one as a reference for my current collection. I love
how an animal print can become an abstract graphic.'' \emph{Right:} ``In
April, I visited Lima for the first time, with my son. We were exploring
when we came across this peace statue by Víctor Delfín.''

\emph{Left:} ``This was supposed to be my daughter Margherita's bedroom
at my house in Brunello, but by the time it was finished being
renovated, she had a house of her own, so it became a guest room. The
rug is Sardinian, and I found the night tables at a flea market.''
\emph{Right:} ``When I was young, we used to vacation on a tiny Croatian
island called San Clemente, where we'd rent a little fisherman's house
without electricity or running water: the simple life. The jugs at my
feet probably held drinking water --- and wine.''

\emph{Left:} ``I collect ceramic deer figurines in various sizes and
colors. I use them to decorate the table for Christmas dinner.''
\emph{Right:} ``Every season for many years, Disegno Brunetta would do a
special illustration for Missoni. This one was for my parents' 1971
`Moda Moda' show in Cortina, an Italian ski town. The boots had a sole
like a slipper's, and would have been terrible for snow.''

``This was the mood board for our
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/slideshow/2018/02/24/fashion/runway-womens/missoni-m-w-fall-2018.html}{fall
2018 collection}. At a time when the world is globalized but not united,
I felt nostalgic for the creative melting pot of late-70s New York.
Basquiat and Lisa Bonet were both big inspirations.''

\emph{Left:} ``Here's the pool and winter garden in my house. Ann
Craven's `Pink Thinking of You' hangs above a 1950s-style couch from
Franco Albini, and the plants rest on vintage stools. In the background,
you can see a bit of a metal sculpture by the architect George
Bergstrom, who designed the Pentagon.'' \emph{Right:} ``This is a lovely
fruit tart that my daughter Teresa made for my nephew's birthday. My son
had been wanting us to do a cookbook for years --- he recognized that
the way we eat as a family is special --- and we finally did this spring
with
