\textbf{Morgan writes:} \emph{I'm on my university's equestrian team. I
attend weekly riding lessons and compete in weekend horse shows while
dressed like a cowboy. My best friend, Mac, attends team meetings and
never misses a horse show. Her family also owns horses. But every time I
suggest she join the team, she shoots me down. Please order her to begin
riding with us.}

Since you claim you are friends, you must acknowledge that Mac is a
human being whom you cannot make jump and canter for your pleasure, or
lead to water and make drink from your horse-club Kool-Aid. Accept that
she enjoys your company but does not want to join the team or dress like
a cowboy. The court understands. In a similar vein of affluent
collegiate weirdness, I partied with the Yale Whiffenpoofs a lot (come
at me, ladies), but never wanted to be a Yale Whiffenpoof. Too much work
and tux time! Some of us are just in it for the hang.
