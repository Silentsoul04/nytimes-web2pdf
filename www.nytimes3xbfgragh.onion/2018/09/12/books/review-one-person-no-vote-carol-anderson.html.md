As the elaborate post-mortem of the presidential election drags on —
amid all the diagnoses of Russian interference, Clintonian blunders and
white-working-class resentment — Carol Anderson wants to direct your
attention to one simple fact: In November 2016, black voter turnout fell
by 7 percent.

Anderson rebukes anyone who takes this as a facile statement of how
black voters felt about Hillary Clinton. “Minority voters did not just
refuse to show up,” she writes in “One Person, No Vote: How Voter
Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy.” “Republican legislatures and
governors systematically blocked African-Americas, Hispanics and
Asian-Americans from the polls.”

The 2016 presidential election was the first in 50 years to be held
without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. Three years
before, in 2013, [the Supreme Court had
revoked](http://archive.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2013/06/25/us/annotated-supreme-court-decision-on-voting-rights-act.html)
the part of the law that required states with a history of voting
discrimination to get federal approval in order to change their voting
statutes. The ruling effectively left voters at the mercy of state
legislators. Some of these law makers, like the Republican Party itself,
didn’t draw significant support from minority communities. So in the
interests of self-preservation, Anderson says, they changed the laws in
ways that made it harder for minorities to vote. President Donald J.
Trump is just one result; a profound and polarizing distortion of
American democracy is another.

Anderson’s argument isn’t new. Ari Berman, the author of the excellent
[“Give Us the
Ballot”](http://https//www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/08/30/books/review/give-us-the-ballot-by-ari-berman.html)
(2015), has been making a similar case to anyone who will listen. His
book also included original reporting, and interviews with lawyers,
activists and government officials who experienced the implementation of
the 1965 Voting Rights Act firsthand.

Anderson, a professor of African-American studies at Emory University,
has written a slender volume that is one part historical primer and one
part spirited manifesto, and is clearly timed for the midterms. (Don’t
let the number of pages fool you; more than 100 of them are for
endnotes. Anderson has a distracting tendency to quote even basic
factual phrases — like “the State’s federal public housing residents” —
instead of simply stating or rewording them.)

“One Person, No Vote” reads like a speedy sequel of sorts to her
previous book, the elegant and illuminating best-seller [“White
Rage”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/26/books/review/white-rage-by-carol-anderson.html)
(2016), which traced how periods of black progress have so often
triggered a backlash that “wreaks havoc subtly, almost imperceptibly”
through the legislatures and courts. “White rage doesn’t have to wear
sheets, burn crosses or take to the streets,” she wrote. “Working the
halls of power, it can achieve its ends far more effectively, far more
destructively.”

Her new book seems to have been written from a state of emergency, in an
adrenaline-fueled sprint. Anderson is a stinging polemicist; her book
rolls through a condensed history of voting rights and
disenfranchisement, without getting bogged down in legislative minutiae.
This is harder than it looks; as Anderson explains, it’s often through
legislative minutiae that voting rights are curtailed.

The lurid violence of voter suppression looms large in the public
imagination, but ever since black men were granted the franchise in the
wake of the Civil War, politicians have also devised discriminatory
rules “dressed up in the genteel garb of bringing ‘integrity’ to the
voting booth.” Before the Voting Rights Act took effect, poll taxes and
literacy tests were the favored methods of voter suppression; they have
since been replaced by gerrymandering and extreme measures to combat
[the phantom menace of voter
fraud](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/06/11/upshot/vote-fraud-is-rare-but-myth-is-widespread.html).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The trick is to keep everything constitutional, Anderson says, staying
within the boundaries of the 14th and 15th Amendments, which promised
“equal protection” and barred discrimination “on account of race.” As
the Virginia politician Carter Glass put it candidly in 1902,
“Discrimination\! Why, that is precisely what we propose.” It was, he
said, an elected official’s duty “to discriminate to the very extremity
of permissible action under the limitations of the Federal Constitution,
with a view to the elimination of every negro voter who can be gotten
rid of, legally.”

Contemporary rhetoric isn’t so frank and incendiary. Anderson describes
Georgia’s Exact Match system and the Interstate Crosscheck as modern
incarnations of old efforts to restrict the vote. Cloaked in anodyne
phrases like “voter roll maintenance,” those database-matching programs
“gave the illusion of being clean, clinical, efficient and fair,”
Anderson writes, when in fact they had a “horrific effect on voter
registration, especially for minorities.” Tiny typographical errors
triggered wrongful purges of eligible voters. According to one team of
researchers, the Crosscheck program — which was vastly expanded by
Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a staunch Trump ally currently
running to be the state’s governor — had [an astonishing error rate
of 99
percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/07/20/this-anti-voter-fraud-program-gets-it-wrong-over-99-of-the-time-the-gop-wants-to-take-it-nationwide/?utm_term=.f1ecacd402ec).

From the perspective of federal enforcement, Anderson says, the
situation for minority voters is looking even more perilous now than a
couple of years ago. The Department of Justice under Attorney General
Jeff Sessions — who as a United States attorney in Alabama tried (and
failed) to obtain a conviction of [three African-American activists for
voter
fraud](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/09/magazine/the-voter-fraud-case-jeff-sessions-lost-and-cant-escape.html)
and once called the Voting Rights Act [“an intrusive piece of
legislation”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/08/us/politics/jeff-sessions-attorney-general.html)
— has demanded that no fewer than 44 states detail their programs for,
yes, voter roll maintenance. The Presidential Advisory Commission on
Election Integrity (after reading this book, you won’t be able look at
the word “integrity” the same way again) is chaired by two figures who
presided over aggressive anti-voter-fraud measures in their home states:
Kobach and Vice President Mike Pence.

But at the grass-roots level, Anderson believes that things might be
looking up. She offers a surprisingly riveting play-by-play of last
year’s special senate election in Alabama, in which Doug Jones, a
Democrat, won a startling upset over the Republican Roy Moore. She
concedes that Moore, [buffeted by allegations of sexual
assault](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/16/us/roy-moore-alabama-coverage.html),
was an especially unappealing candidate, whatever one’s politics. But
she also shows how groups like the N.A.A.C.P. mobilized local efforts to
help people register to vote and — in a state where poll closures made
even getting to the voting booths an issue — to offer crucial
transportation.

Behind the tactics deployed by both sides looms a larger question: What
kind of future should this country pursue? Should it be a democracy that
is, in Anderson’s words, “vibrant, responsive and inclusive”? Or should
it be a system that maximizes “the frustration of millions of citizens
to minimize their participation in the electoral process”? To that end,
this trenchant little book will push you to think not just about the
vote count but about who counts, too.
