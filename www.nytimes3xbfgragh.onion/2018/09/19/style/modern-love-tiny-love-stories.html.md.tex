What kind of love story can you share in two tweets, an Instagram
caption or a Facebook post? Tell us a love story from your own life ---
happy or sad, capturing a moment or a lifetime --- in no more than 100
words. Include a picture taken by you that complements your narrative,
whether a selfie, screenshot or snapshot. We seek to publish the most
funny and heart-wrenching entries we receive. We call them Tiny Love
Stories. They are about as long as this paragraph. They must be true and
unpublished.

Love may be universal, but individual experiences can differ immensely,
informed by factors such as race, socio-economic status, gender,
disability status, nationality, sexuality, age, religion and culture. As
in the main Modern Love column, we are committed to publishing a range
of experiences and perspectives in Tiny Love Stories. We especially
encourage Black and Indigenous people and other people of color to
submit, as well as writers outside of the United States and those who
identify as members of L.G.B.T.Q. communities.

Share your story today.
