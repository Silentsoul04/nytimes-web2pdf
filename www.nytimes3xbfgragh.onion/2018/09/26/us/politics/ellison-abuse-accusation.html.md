Representative Keith Ellison, a progressive Democrat from Minnesota and
deputy chairman of the Democratic Party, has asked the House Ethics
Committee to investigate recent allegations of abuse made against him by
a former girlfriend.

Mr. Ellison, who is also running for state attorney general in
Minnesota, made the announcement Wednesday in a statement shared with
news media outlets. In it, Mr. Ellison denied the allegations, but
called for an investigation nonetheless in an attempt to clear his name,
he said.

“I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this
entire matter resolved,” Mr. Ellison said. “These allegations have
lingered in the public sphere, and remain unsubstantiated. I welcome an
investigation by the House to allow us to move on.”

Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said she supported Mr.
Ellison’s call for a House ethics inquiry.

“It is essential that due process be respected and that all involved are
given the opportunity to be heard,” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement
Wednesday.

Mr. Ellison’s request comes about one month after his former girlfriend,
an environmental political organizer named Karen Monahan, [publicly
accused him of emotional
abuse](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/13/us/politics/keith-ellison-abuse-karen-monahan.html)
and said he once tried to drag her off a bed while shouting profanities
at her. She said initially that she had a cellphone video of the
incident but has declined to share it, saying that victims should not be
forced to prove their claims.

“Four people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to
them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared
multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him
and much more,” Ms. Monahan [tweeted
recently](https://twitter.com/KarenMonahan01/status/1041675772329570304).
“As I said before, I knew I wouldn’t be believed.”

Republicans, and some state Democrats, have seized on the allegations
against Mr. Ellison, particularly as he attempts to win the Minnesota
attorney general position this November. Mr. Ellison has said he has
been cooperating with an independent inquiry into the matter, in
addition to calling for the House Ethics Committee to investigate.

Still, the continuing questions may not deter Mr. Ellison from ascending
to the attorney general post. In August, he won the Democratic primary
by [about 30
points](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/08/14/us/elections/results-minnesota-primary-elections.html)
just days after the allegations surfaced. Recent polling
[shows](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/09/18/minnesota-poll-ag-race-close-as-ellison-abuse-accusation-lingers)
Mr. Ellison holds a lead — albeit a slim one — against his Republican
opponent in November.
