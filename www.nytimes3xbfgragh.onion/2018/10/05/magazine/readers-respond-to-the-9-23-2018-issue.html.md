[**RE: Listen to the
World**](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/09/21/magazine/voyages-travel-sounds-from-the-world.html)

*From the crunch of lava in Kilauea to the songs of Madagascar lemurs,
our fall Voyages Issue was dedicated to sounds from across the world.*

What a huge treat to listen to the Voyages Issue of The New York Times
Magazine. I normally like to sneak away with the paper while my young
kids are occupied with their Legos, but today I was able to involve them
completely, and they absolutely loved listening to the cries of the
lemur and the rattling sounds of the lava. Please do this again — though
maybe consider a kids’ version with just the sounds (and no narration)
so we can play a guessing game and try to match the pictures with their
corresponding sounds. *Heather Birchall, Sunnyvale,
Calif.*

Congratulations on yesterday’s issue. It was extraordinary. We are an
international community of nuns in Chicago, and we listened to your
issue with a sister from India, one from Colombia and three Americans.
We thought your creativity deserves an A-plus. We all enjoyed it very
much. *Mary Ellen Moore, Chicago*

I just listened to your audio NY Times Magazine and was reminded of the
tours I do at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon for blind or low-vision
visitors. The verbal is what I work with when I describe works of art,
but I am now inspired to try audio with our visitors. Audio takes the
verbal description to another level — a closer, more intimate level that
one would normally not hear. This issue is wonderful. It is almost
spiritual in its association with various sounds emitted by objects and
living organisms. Thank you so much for taking my listening experience
to new heights\! *Barbara Hart, Portland, Ore.*

You made me feel sentimental about the chaos of a Nigerian intersection.
That is what good writing can do, with the help of the stunning
soundtrack you provided. This demonstrates that one person can step into
another’s shoes and see the world differently. “Sublime” is an
understatement. It was so impactful and spiritually touching. What a
great way to inspire all of us, at any age. When there is such a high
bar to keep our attention due to our overstimulating environment, you
succeeded to go beyond entertainment and provided inspiration and awe
with the simplicity of nature. This is a wake-up call to all of us to
save our greatest asset, the environment. *William
Hoskyns*

Congratulations on today’s issue of The New York Times Magazine. The
sound editing was perfect; the photography beautiful. I was moved by the
stories and voices. Thank you for the reminder that our world is so
special, even in these times, and that we can always find awe, delight,
wonder and joy in it, if we only listen. In gratitude. *Leslie George,
Syracuse*

**I just wanted to say** bravo and thank you for the most recent edition
of The New York Times Magazine (the fall Voyages Issue). Having an audio
tour of the photographs was brilliant, and a really stirring experience.
I also loved how it connected to an article in the Travel section of the
paper a few Sundays ago about an audio tour of London led by a woman
with synesthesia. The idea of picking destinations based on experiencing
new soundscapes is delightful, and makes the world wider and more full
of wonder. *Jarom McDonald, Oceanside, Calif.*

What a delightful new journey for the reader/listener in the sound and
photography of this issue. Additionally, while my husband and I listened
to the audio on speaker phones, my puppy was very engaged at hearing the
indris sing from Madagascar — every note brought her closer to the
phone. *Jenelle Lozano, Huntersville,
N.C.*

**What a wonderful audiovisual** experience you and your team have made
available for anyone willing to take the time\!  

Thank you very much for this superb innovation. I so hope that numerous
subscribers and other readers of The New York Times get to enjoy this
artistic masterpiece as much as I have, and that they, too, will express
their appreciation. Keep up your excellent work. *Nicholas S. Molinari,
Brick, N.J.*

**I just listened to**/read the magazine from the past weekend and I was
impressed with the result. I was initially not happy when I saw that my
magazine did not have the regular features that I enjoy. But after
listening I thought it was brilliant. *Larry Comparone*
