\emph{--- From ``All the Answers'' (Gallery 13, 2018, Page 210), a
graphic memoir by the artist Michael Kupperman.}

There is no substitute for the nowness of now. I realize that sounds
like a rejected U2 lyric, or a line from an off-brand Yoda T-shirt, but
it's hard to talk about the experience of time. One of the odd luxuries
of being alive is this feeling of currency: that each of us, however
humble, represents breaking news 13 billion years in the making. The
whole huge bounty of the past, every dinosaur fight and asteroid blast
and flood and war and ice age and invention and mistake, has led to this
particular second --- to me sitting here at my desk eating a peanut
butter chocolate protein bar, worrying that my pants are too tight,
writing these words about the nature of existence. No bush has ever
rustled precisely the way the bush is rustling outside my window right
now. No one has ever inhaled exactly the bouquet of fresh molecules that
you just inhaled, this very moment, into your unique wet lungs.

And yet our moments are also constantly dying. We pass through time like
someone walking through a swarm of mayflies: The moments come so thick
that we hardly notice them dropping around us, and we can't imagine they
will ever be gone.

This makes it hard to relate to history. We tend to look at ancient
paintings or black-and-white photos through the lens of an inborn
chronological bias. Our time, we think, is the most important time ever,
simply because it is happening now. How could anyone have been so
careless as to not exist today? Existence can never really comprehend
the reality of nonexistence.

The truth, of course, is that we are not special. Everyone who has ever
lived inhabited a now as urgent and sparkling and uncertain and hustling
with drama as our own. Our contemporary motives are just as mysterious
and self-defeating as the past's. We are contiguous with everything that
is gone. We are history. This moment is already over.
