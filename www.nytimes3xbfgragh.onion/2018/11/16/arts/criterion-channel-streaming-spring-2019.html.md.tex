The Criterion Collection will soon have a new home online. On Friday,
the collection, a video distribution company known for championing indie
and art-house films, announced that it will offer a free-standing
subscriber-based service called the Criterion Channel, beginning in
spring 2019.

The news comes after several weeks of uncertainty regarding the
collection's fate. Late last month FilmStruck, a partnership between the
Criterion Collection and Turner Classic Movies, announced that it would
shutter after just two years; according to Turner and Warner Bros.
Digital, the ``loyal'' fan base was too ``niche'' to justify keeping it
around as a merger between AT\&T and Time Warner Inc. takes hold.
Filmstruck will go dark on Nov. 30.

``The Criterion Channel will be picking up where the old service left
off, programming director spotlights and actor retrospectives featuring
major Hollywood and international classics and hard-to-find discoveries
from around the world,''
\href{https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6044-new-independent-criterion-channel-to-launch-spring-2019}{Criterion
said in a statement on its website}. It will also include the special
features and curated series currently on FilmStruck, including the
Friday Night Double Feature and Art-House America.

The stand-alone channel does not appear to involve TCM, based on the
statement --- although the channel will also be made available through
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/10/business/media/warner-media-streaming.html}{WarnerMedia's
new online platform}, which is scheduled to debut late next year as a
home for Warner's own library of films and television shows.

Anyone interested will have to sign up for the new channel, as Criterion
is ``starting from scratch.'' So between now and spring of next year,
once you've
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/29/movies/filmstruck-closing-best-movies.html}{binged
all those hard-to-find gems} on the soon-to-be gone FilmStruck, you can
\href{https://www.criterion.com/channel}{become a charter subscriber},
with benefits that include a membership card and a 30-day free trial.
