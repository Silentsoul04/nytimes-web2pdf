# Lucas Hedges and His Father Never Meant to Make a Movie Together

Peter Hedges knew his Oscar-nominated son wouldn’t want to star in “Ben
Is Back.” Then, to be supportive, Lucas read the script and everything

There’s a story Peter Hedges likes to tell about the moment he knew his
son Lucas would be an actor.

Young Lucas was in seventh grade, playing Smike in his school’s
production of “Nicholas Nickleby” with such committed intensity that
even members of the high school drama club had been assigned to study
his performance. At least, that’s how Peter remembers it.

“In the very first scene, when he came up onstage, his eyes were filled
with tears,” said Peter, beaming. “And I’m not kidding, I felt the
theater gasp.”

“The whole theater,” said Lucas, “or just you?”

Father and son may quibble about the particulars of that night, but
Peter’s hunch would prove correct: Lucas, now 21, is one of Hollywood’s
most in-demand young actors. He earned an Oscar nomination for
[“Manchester by the
Sea”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/18/movies/manchester-by-the-sea-review-kenneth-lonergan-casey-affleck.html)
and has already put together an enviable résumé, including roles in two
other best-picture nominees, [“Lady
Bird”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/31/movies/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan.html)
and [“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing,
Missouri.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/08/movies/review-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-martin-mcdonagh.html)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His father, meanwhile, has worked in Hollywood as a writer and director
of emotional dramedies like [“Pieces of
April”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/10/17/movies/film-review-second-helpings-of-hollow-cheer.html)
and [“Dan in Real
Life.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/10/26/movies/26dan.html)
You might think, then, that as Peter wrote his new film, “Ben Is Back,”
about a recovering addict who makes a surprise Christmas Eve visit to
his mother (Julia Roberts), he would have had his son in mind to play
the titular role.

*\[Read our* [*review of “Ben Is
Back,”*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/05/movies/ben-is-back-review.html)
*a Critic’s Pick.\]*

The reality was much more complicated, they told me during a visit to
the Brooklyn brownstone where Lucas and his older brother, Simon, grew
up and Peter and his wife, Susan, still live. Though Lucas moved out,
his father has preserved his childhood bedroom as though in amber: The
walls are covered with a teenage boy’s doodles, and glow-in-the-dark
stars are still glued to the ceiling. “I won’t paint these walls until
they drag us out of the house,” said Peter, his eyes welling up.

The elder Hedges readily admits to being the cry-at-commercials type,
and during our conversation, Lucas gently looked for ways to deflate his
dad’s proud hyperbole. “He’s very romantic about the notion of
fatherhood,” Lucas said. “I remember whenever I would walk home with him
from school, I’d ask him if I could get candy, and it was a ‘yes’ every
single time. He was like, ‘Do you think I could ever say no to that?’”

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

**Peter, as a parent, did you have any concerns as Lucas’s career
started to take off at a young age?**

**PETER HEDGES** The only thing for me was I genuinely just wanted him
to have positive experiences. Lucas, I don’t know if you know this, but
Frances McDormand came up to me on the set of “Moonrise Kingdom,” and
she said, “This is it, right? This is the only movie, and you’re not
going to let him do any more?” And I said, “Well, that’s going to be up
to Lucas.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**LUCAS HEDGES** You served it up\!

**PETER HEDGES** Ironically, of course, he later did “Three Billboards”
with her, which was great. But when Lucas was young, a casting director
called our house and asked if he would audition for a film, and my wife
said, “He can’t audition for movies until he’s 18.” She called me up,
kind of proud that she’d drawn this line, and I said, “Hey, did you ever
think about asking Lucas what he wants to do?” So, she said to Lucas,
“There’s a movie they want you to audition for,” and he said, “I just
have one question. Is Dad directing it?” She said no, and he said, “Then
I’m interested.”

**Lucas, what made you so convinced early on that you didn’t want to
work with your father?**

**LUCAS HEDGES** Because I hadn’t established myself at all. I would
have felt a lot better if I felt like this was my career rather than
some birthday present, and I couldn’t help but feel it looked like that
if I was just doing my dad’s movies. But it’s a valid thing to feel that
a lot of why I did have success at a young age is because I was raised
to some extent in this world. I don’t think people would give me the
part if they didn’t believe in me, but at the same time, I can’t imagine
there isn’t some nepotism going on. I’m in good favor because of my
family, I think.

**So Peter, you didn’t write “Ben Is Back” expecting Lucas to do it?**

**PETER HEDGES** I very much believed that he would not be in a film of
mine, and that he certainly didn’t need to be in a film of mine, with
the way things were going. But with “Ben Is Back,” I did want to write
something that both of my boys would be proud of, that they could look
at and go, “That’s my dad.” I sent the script to Julia, she said yes,
and when I talked with her, I came with a list of actors that could play
Ben. And she didn’t ever want to see the list. She just wanted Lucas.

**LUCAS HEDGES** It would have taken a lot for me to want to do it,
because I had no intention of doing it. But I heard people were
receiving the script well, and I wanted to read it more as his son
supporting him. So I read it late one night, and I was just really blown
away by it. There was a part of me that was like, “O.K., maybe I’m going
to want to throw my hat in the ring here.”

**But you didn’t say yes right away. What was holding you back?**

**LUCAS HEDGES** Just sheer discomfort. My dad giving me notes seemed
just as uncomfortable as us talking about sex. But I sat with it longer
and did the I Ching, a thing a lot of hippies did in the ’70s: You roll
some dice and get your fortune told. I got really good results, and it
struck me that the role was similarly special to Patrick from
“Manchester by the Sea,” a part that I felt blessed to play. And I
wanted to be of service to my dad in some way, during a big moment in
his life. So I signed on, and it was hard and rewarding.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**What was it like to be directed by your father?**

**LUCAS HEDGES** Honestly, it was difficult at first. I was only ready
to listen to him direct if he said what I wanted him to say.

**PETER HEDGES** I wasn’t aware that it was as hard as it was for you.
The moment I remember distinctly, which is not a moment you would be
aware of, was at the end of the third day of filming. I put you in the
van to go back, and I went quickly back to the producers, and I burst
into tears. The producers said, “Why are you crying?” And I said. “I’m
crying as a father. I’m so afraid I’m going to fail him, and he put his
trust in
me.”

**What made that so fraught?**

**PETER HEDGES** It struck me what a gift he was giving me by doing the
film, because the reason it’s so important to me is that it’s about a
family dealing with heroin and opioids, but in my childhood, it was
alcoholism. It’s one thing to be a father directing his son, but then
there’s a much deeper thing, which is that I’m Carol Hedges’s son, and I
didn’t know her sober until I was 15. She’s not here to see this movie,
but without her, I would never have written \[“What’s Eating Gilbert
Grape,” based on his novel\]. I would have been an accountant living in
Ames, Iowa.

**LUCAS HEDGES** Do you actually think you wouldn’t have gone into this
line of work had it not been for your mom’s actions?

**PETER HEDGES** Well, it made perfect sense that I originally wanted to
be an actor because every Sunday, we walked into church and we acted
like we were the happiest, most together family.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**LUCAS HEDGES** He wanted more than anything to be an actor, and
there’s an experience he had as a young actor that’s the most
heartbreaking story I’ve ever heard.

**PETER HEDGES** What happened was I was in this Christian film, and I
needed to cry in this scene. No actor ever wanted to cry more than me,
and I prepped and prepped, and I could not cry. We were at take 36, take
37, and finally, the director brought me into a room ——

**LUCAS HEDGES — —** and he said, “Let’s face it, Peter, you can’t act.”

**PETER HEDGES** And then I burst into tears. I was so humiliated that I
just started weeping. If you wanted John Gielgud to cry, he could say,
“Which eye?” But I trained with [Sanford
Meisner](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1997/02/04/theater/sanford-meisner-a-mentor-who-guided-actors-and-directors-toward-truth-dies-at-91.html),
and he said Gielgud was such a phony: “If crying were acting, my Aunt
Martha would be the greatest actress in the world.” So it’s an
interesting thing.

**LUCAS HEDGES** And yet everyone in high school was assigned to see me
cry.

**How does it feel, then, to have worked together and gotten a peek into
Lucas’s process firsthand?**

**PETER HEDGES** One of the things that I see in his work, and it’s
really evident in “Ben Is Back,” is Lucas has such a rich inner life
that in moments that could just be toss-offs, you watch and you go, “Oh
my God, there’s so much going on here.” It’s very rare to see someone
that age fill moments with so much life and complexity. Sorry, I didn’t
mean to embarrass you.

**LUCAS HEDGES** \[Joking\] You’re humiliating me.

**PETER HEDGES** Lucas is living the life that I wanted, but I want to
be clear, I don’t feel there’s been any pressure for him to live it.
It’s just he is the artist, at 21, that I wanted to be. His capacity
to be authentic and inhabit his truth, he can do that much earlier than
I was able to.

**LUCAS HEDGES** I feel like I’m very much open to the emotion of the
world and very empathetic. I can feel my feelings, sometimes to a fault.
And I think I got that from my dad.
