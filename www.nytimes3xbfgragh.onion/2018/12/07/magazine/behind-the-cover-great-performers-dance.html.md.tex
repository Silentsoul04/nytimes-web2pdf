\textbf{Amy Kellner, associate photo editor:} Oh, the places we sent our
photographer Philip Montgomery this year!
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/06/07/magazine/new-york-love-rikers-jail-visit.html}{Rikers
Island,}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/06/07/magazine/new-york-love-club-lust.html}{Club
Lust} in Brooklyn and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/03/22/magazine/voyages-joshua-tree-lost-hiker.html}{Joshua
Tree National Park,} among others. But maybe nothing better prepared him
to shoot this year's Great Performers Issue than
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/09/21/magazine/voyages-travel-sounds-from-the-world.html}{his
trip to Hawaii,} where he took close-ups of blazing, fast-flowing lava.
Heat and motion --- just the sort of rehearsal for taking pictures of
stars dancing. Or,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/12/05/magazine/great-performers-dance-photos.html}{in
the case of Ethan Hawke}, having him fling tablecloths full of cutlery
at you. (``It's scarier to be photographing such extraordinary talent
than it is to be at an active volcano,'' Montgomery says.) Whatever it
takes to get the picture. • Justin Peck, who created and directed the
dances for our actors, faced a different challenge. He had to make
nondancers light on their feet and comfortable moving their bodies in
new ways --- with almost no practice time. Sometimes that involved
working with mops as partners, wobbling on construction beams or getting
Julia Roberts to act like Fred Astaire in a subway car. Whatever it
takes to make the magic.
