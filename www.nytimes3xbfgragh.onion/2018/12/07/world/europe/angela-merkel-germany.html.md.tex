BERLIN --- Angela Merkel has been chancellor of Germany and unofficial
leader of Europe for 13 years.

When she was first appointed, George W. Bush was still in the White
House and Tony Blair ran Britain. There was no Twitter and no iPhone.
Liberal democracy was in seemingly inexorable expansion mode, with the
Orange Revolution having recently swept through Ukraine. Mariah Carey
had topped the charts for months with ``We Belong Together.''

On Friday, Ms. Merkel's conservative party
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/18/world/europe/merkel-germany-conservatives.html}{chose}
her successor as party leader, marking the beginning of the end of her
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/05/world/europe/merkel-legacy-germany.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{long
political life}. She is on her third American president, her fourth
French president and her seventh Italian prime minister. Democracy seems
increasingly under threat. ``Solo,'' by Clean Bandit, is playing on the
radio.

\emph{{[}}\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/06/world/europe/germany-conservatives-angela-merkel.html}{\emph{Who
will replace Angela Merkel as the conservatives' leader, and what will
it mean for her party?}}\emph{{]}}

Over the years, Ms. Merkel has put
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/12/world/europe/vladimir-putin-angela-merkel-russia-germany.html}{President
Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in his place} (even when he tried to
intimidate her with his dog). She bonded with President Barack Obama and
stood up to President Trump. She became an icon of hope for refugees and
an object of scorn for populists. As Europe's most powerful leader, she
became an inspiration to women in a world dominated by men.

Her political career, which began in an era of hope after the Berlin
Wall came down, is ending at a time of great uncertainty. It is a
journey from the end of history and back.
