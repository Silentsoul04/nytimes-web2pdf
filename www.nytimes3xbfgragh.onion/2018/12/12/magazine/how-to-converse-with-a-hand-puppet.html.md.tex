``Ventriloquism is more than just knowing how to speak without moving
your lips,'' says Cecilia Ustav, a Swede who performs as Zillah and
appears with a two-foot-tall chimpanzee puppet named Totte. Still,
that's where you should start: in front of a mirror, with your mouth
slightly open in a smile, teeth close but not touching. Practice saying
the same sentences over and over, until any movement in the jaw and lips
becomes undetectable. Ustav, now 29, went to a weekend ventriloquism
workshop when she was 12. It took her five years of regular practice to
master it. At 18, she won Sweden's version of the ``Got Talent''
franchise which led to fame, television shows and a busy performing
schedule, sometimes in front of as many as 15,000 people.

You will need to learn new ways to articulate what emanates from your
larynx. To make particularly tricky sounds like \emph{B, P} and
\emph{M,} use your tongue and the back of your throat rather than
pressing your lips together as you normally would. Give your puppet its
own character. When delivering its lines, look inquisitively in its
direction, as if you're unaware of what might be said next --- your
facial expressions should be those of the listener, not the speaker.
Totte is a cheeky, know-it-all 3-year-old who makes Ustav laugh. Once
you're familiar with your puppet's persona, improvise dialogue. It is
this lifelike affinity, and not your mouth mechanics, that will hold
people's attention. ``You want the ventriloquism part to disappear,''
she says.

In 2008, at a convention in Kentucky --- some 450 ventriloquists all
staying in the same hotel --- Ustav was taken aback by how many people
pushed their puppets in strollers, or otherwise coddled them as if they
were real children. Don't forget that the puppet is inanimate; in the
end, the relationship is all you, talking to yourself. ``It's an
illusion,'' says Ustav, who keeps Totte in a bag in her closet when
she's not performing. Even so, allow your puppet's character the freedom
and space to evolve, just as you let your understanding of yourself
change over time. ``Totte started out shyer and younger,'' Ustav says.
``But now he's just more --- more of everything.''
