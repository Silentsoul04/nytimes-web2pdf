Like the run-on title of Blas Falconer's spare yet luminous poem, the
couple driving through the Puerto Rican countryside are suspended in
time. Who they are and where they'll end up is a mystery; we never see
the man, and the woman has set her thoughts adrift as memories swirl,
unspoken, between them. Inside their traveling capsule, history and fate
are immaterial, hovering outside where the road scrolls past --- until,
in one brilliant stroke, the membrane is pierced, and the interminably
vast sorrows of an entire island rush in. \emph{Selected by Rita Dove}
