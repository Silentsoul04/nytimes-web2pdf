“Second Act” is a workplace comedy with Jennifer Lopez as Maya, a
brand-new 40-year-old who gets passed over for a promotion at the Queens
superstore she manages. The white guy (Dan Bucatinsky) who gets the job
is a stooge with a Duke M.B.A. She has a G.E.D. Fortunately, her best
work friend (Leah Remini) has a whiz-kid son who sends out a doctored
résumé and cooks up a phony Facebook page that turns her into the
mountain-climbing go-getter she swore she’d never be. But the bogusness
wins her a corporate consulting gig competing to develop organic face
gloop, anyway.

This is Jenny from the blah. The movie was written by Justin Zackham and
Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and directed by the Adam Sandler and spoof
veteran Peter Segal. We’re supposed to find what they’ve done with this
story suspenseful. Just who at this company of divas, nerds and snakes
will be the first to smell a rat? (Vanessa Hudgens, Charlyne Yi, Freddie
Stroma and [Annaleigh
Ashford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6AuKn9PCV8), who pockets the
movie with debutante snark, are on the payroll.) How long until the plot
goes from having Maya disappoint her man (Milo Ventimiglia) by reminding
him that she doesn’t want kids to our finding out why and then watching
her secret cause her joy and insufficiently plumbed pangs of emotional
torment. I never see plot twists coming, but this one made me feel like
Nostradamus.

“Second Act” is enough like “[Working
Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odR6tGpZTis),” Mike Nichols’s
corporate-ladder romantic comedy from 30 years ago, that you wish it was
even more like it. Maya isn’t cunning, conniving and savvy the way
Melanie Griffith got to be in that movie. She doesn’t have a plan. She
doesn’t even really make a decision. Every significant development
happens *to* Maya. It’s done for her or requires her reluctant
participation, from the ruse at work to her great big secret, to the
dance party that breaks out in Remini’s kitchen on Maya’s way to work.

This is to say that a movie like this plays to none of Lopez’s strengths
— if your star is known for, among other things, dancing, why stick in a
scene of her suppressing the urge to dance? But passivity rather than
assertiveness has come to define Lopez in movies. It’s been 20 years
since “Out of Sight” helped make her a star (and stuff like “Money
Train,” “Jack,” “Anaconda,” “Selena” and “U-Turn” promised that she’d be
one), and, despite some relentlessness on her part (dozens of movies,
some hits, a couple of fiascos) nothing she’s done has threatened to
dislodge from my heart the impossible blend of hard and soft, of
playfulness, sensuality and wit, that she found in that film.

Part of the problem is that, in all that time, she hasn’t had a role
that good. But she doesn’t need one that good. All she needs is a movie
that gets her to exert even some of the same confidence and competence,
instead of parts that ask her to suffer and dither and hide as the price
for eventually being able to, say, slay a very bad husband or a worse
lover. Basically, it’s been 20 years, and I’m still waiting to see her
let all the way go, to be as natural, funny, sharp, overjoyed,
surprising, and *open* as she can be [in
interviews](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jennifer-lopez-directing-comedy-world-dance-interview-1114022),
on Instagram, as a competition judge and as a recording artist. This
impossible mix of glamour and realness keep her among the world’s most
beloved famous people. But film acting seems to freeze all that up.
Filmmakers — or maybe Lopez herself — won’t let her be her. All she does
is work hard for these movies — deferring, apologizing, peacekeeping.
When are the movies going to start working for her?
