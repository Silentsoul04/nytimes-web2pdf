It’s no mere coincidence that Jeffrey R. Brown, the dean of the Gies
College of Business, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
is also a scholar of risk management. At his first faculty meeting four
years ago, Brown fretted that his school had become, like many American
universities, overly dependent on a single source of money — roughly a
fifth of tuition revenue came from Chinese students. “I saw our reliance
on China as a risk,” says Brown, noting that 800 or so of the
university’s nearly 5,800 Chinese students attend the business school.
“At the time, I was concerned that China could pull the plug on students
coming to America. But then the U.S. political landscape shifted, and we
were vulnerable to changing visa and immigration policies here, too.
Both were threats we could not control.”

Brown approached the problem as a risk manager, which meant doing what
no school has been known to do before: buying insurance to protect
against a sudden drop in Chinese enrollment. The three-year policy
requires the university to pay $424,000 annually for up to $60 million
in coverage. The insurer, Lloyd’s of London, will pay out a claim if a
specific incident — a visa ban because of a government action, for
example — causes the number of Chinese students in the colleges of
business and engineering to decline by 18.5 percent over a 12-month
period. The political risks have only grown since the policy went into
effect. The trade war with China, visa restrictions and the
anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from the White House are making it more
complicated for international students to come to America. “It’s a tough
environment right now,” Brown says. But the insurance gives him peace of
mind. The school continues to invest in China, he says, but now “with
the confidence that we are not doubling down on risk.”

Over the past decade, the explosion in the number of international
students has turned education, almost by stealth, into one of the most
vital American exports. The idea that a student taking classes in Iowa
City or Ann Arbor can be counted as an export might seem strange. In
economic terms, however, the student’s situation is not so different
from, say, a Japanese company buying American soybeans: Foreign money
flows into the United States from abroad — except that in this case, the
product doesn’t leave the country.

Nearly 1.1 million international students attended American colleges and
universities in 2017. They generated $42.4 billion in export revenue,
more than double the amount eight years ago, according to the Bureau of
Economic Analysis. (Because far fewer Americans study abroad, the United
States ran a $34.2 billion surplus in education in 2017.) Nafsa, a
nonprofit group that supports international education, estimates that
students from abroad created or sustained more than 455,000 jobs in the
United States, almost nine times the number of American coal miners. The
value of education is almost double the revenue from America’s top
agricultural export in 2017, soybeans ($21.6 billion). When other
student spending is factored in — food, cars, clothes — education’s
total export value rivals that of pharmaceuticals ($51 billion) and
automobiles ($53 billion). “In the public at large, there’s little
awareness that higher education is one of America’s biggest exports,”
says Rajika Bhandari, senior adviser for research and strategy at the
Institute of International Education. “Or that this export drives
American competitiveness.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**America’s reputation as** a beacon for the world’s students, however,
is now faltering. In 2016, for the first time in decades, new
enrollments of international students in United States colleges and
universities fell, by 3.3 percent, according to an Institute of
International Education report. In 2017, the decrease steepened, to 6.6
percent. An 8.8 percent drop in graduate students from India led the
decline, while China’s torrid pace of enrollments slowed. The downturn,
which the institute reports continued in the fall of 2018, albeit at a
lesser rate, is not solely in response to American politics. The first
drop, after all, reflected decisions made in 2015, when Donald Trump was
just one of 17 Republicans battling for the party nomination. Other
factors have also been altering the calculus for international students:
rising tuition costs in the United States; growing competition from
other countries like Australia and Canada; heavy investment in higher
education in their home countries; and a fear of American gun
violence.

Still, the “Trump effect” acts as a powerful deterrent. Shortly before
the 2016 election, I spoke with Chinese students at the University of
Iowa who were so convinced that Trump’s travel ban would extend to
Chinese nationals that they canceled trips home out of fear that they
would not be let back into the United States. Some of their friends in
China opted to study in England to avoid the uncertainty. Their fears
seemed unfounded at first. But as the trade war has escalated, along
with reports of espionage and intellectual-property theft, Chinese
students find themselves squarely in Trump’s cross hairs. In November,
according to The Financial Times, the White House even briefly discussed
the idea of imposing a total ban on Chinese students — a radical option
that inevitably brings back memories of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which
kept out most Chinese for nearly 60 years before the outbreak of World
War II.

As a practical matter, the tightening of American visa restrictions hits
students harder than dark grumblings. Beyond generating more visa
denials and delays — the issuance of F-1 student visas declined 17
percent from 2016 to 2017 — Washington is targeting foreign students who
apply for graduate work or training in technological areas. In June,
citing national-security concerns, the government announced that visas
for Chinese students in robotics, aviation and high tech could be
reduced to just one year from five years. Last month, 65 colleges and
universities signed a letter supporting a legal challenge to a new
United States government policy that would make it easier to ban
international students for overstaying their visas, calling
international students “essential to the fabric” of higher education.”
Esther Brimmer, executive director and chief executive of Nafsa, laments
the hostile turn: “It could take us years to rebuild the reputation of
America as a nation that welcomes all to our campus communities.”

**Some universities** are trying to buck the trend. Chief among them is
the University of Illinois, where a commitment to welcoming Chinese
students stretches back more than a century. In 1906, when the policy of
excluding Chinese was still in force, the president of the university,
Edmund James, wrote a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt proposing a
scholarship program to bring some of the first Chinese students to
American universities. “China is upon the verge of a revolution,” he
explained. “The nation which succeeds in educating the young Chinese of
the present generation will be the nation which for a given expenditure
of effort will reap the largest possible returns in moral, intellectual
and commercial influence.” Roosevelt agreed. Over the next half century,
the University of Illinois received roughly a third of all Chinese
students who came to the United States.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Today, again, Illinois is leading a pack of universities trying to “reap
the largest possible returns” from international students — and, with
its insurance policy, to avoid any sudden losses. The number of Chinese
students at Illinois, 5,797, remains one of the highest in the country,
but in 2018, for the first time in decades, Chinese enrollment there
dropped, by 2.2 percent. (The business school, Brown says, suffered no
decline.) Even as national policy tightens, universities are
intensifying recruitment efforts beyond China and India and trying to
make students feel more welcome. In recent years, Purdue University has
begun to reduce its intake of Chinese students in a move that will
diversify its student body.

It’s shortsighted to think of this issue solely in terms of revenue:
International students and scholars also spur American innovation and
growth. Today, nearly a quarter of the founders of billion-dollar United
States start-up companies first came here as international students,
according to the National Foundation for American Policy. And the
National Science Foundation says that more than a third of the
postdoctoral researchers in science, engineering and health in American
labs are temporary visa holders. “We don’t have enough Americans trained
for these jobs in engineering, computer science, even economics,”
Richard Startz, an economics professor at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, says.

For all the growing concerns about national security, the United States
can’t afford to close the pipeline of talent and tuition that supports
its education system and drives its economic future. As Yu He, a postdoc
research scholar at the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy
Sciences, wrote in the online magazine ChinaFile, “If the secret sauce
to the success of the United States is the ability to attract and retain
‘the best and the brightest,’ why is it shooting itself in the foot
today?”
