Raj Shah, a top spokesman in the White House press office, has left and
joined an arm of a Florida-based lobbying firm, officials said Monday.

\subsection{The Turnover at the Top of the Trump
Administration}\label{the-turnover-at-the-top-of-the-trump-administration}}

Since President Trump's inauguration, White House staffers and cabinet
officials have left in firings and resignations, one after the other.

Mr. Shah will lead the Media Group, the press wing of
\href{https://ballardpartners.com/}{Ballard Partners}, a lobbying firm
with offices in Florida and Washington. He will work with Jamie Rubin, a
Democrat who was a spokesman for Madeleine Albright, the former
secretary of state, officials said.

Mr. Shah, a former researcher at the Republican National Committee, had
been in the administration since Mr. Trump took office. His portfolio
recently included helping prepare Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh for his
Senate confirmation hearings to the Supreme Court.

His departure comes as the White House press and communications teams
have been depleted. Several aides have moved on to roles at government
agencies or have left the Trump administration entirely.
