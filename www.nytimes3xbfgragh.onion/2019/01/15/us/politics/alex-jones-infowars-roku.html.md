WASHINGTON — After an uproar, Alex Jones’s mass media revival proved
short-lived.

Last year, Mr. Jones, the Infowars conspiracy theorist, was erased from
virtually every major social media platform for violating standards
against hate speech, among others. This week, it came to light that Mr.
Jones had a new, free channel on the streaming service Roku, which
brings online video content to users’ televisions, granting Mr. Jones
access to Roku’s 27 million users.

No more.

News that Infowars was available on Roku ignited a social media fury,
coming months after Apple, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and others banned
Infowars content.

“After the Infowars channel became available, we heard from concerned
parties and have determined that the channel should be removed from our
platform,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday evening. “Deletion
from the channel store and platform has begun and will be completed
shortly.”

Among those expressing shock that Roku had added Infowars to its lineup
were lawyers for the families of victims of the 2012 mass shooting at
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., who have been threatened
and harassed by people who believe the bogus theory spread by Mr. Jones
that the massacre was a hoax. The company’s announcement that it would
yank the Infowars channel came hours after the lawyers publicly
criticized Roku’s move.

Social media platforms had vastly expanded Mr. Jones’s audience for
incendiary false claims, including, in addition to the Sandy Hook hoax,
that the financier George Soros is a Nazi and that Democratic leaders
operated a child sex ring from a Washington pizzeria.

News of Roku’s Infowars channel had been [reported on Tuesday by
Digiday](https://digiday.com/media/roku-adds-infowars-channels-six-months-platforms-banned/),
and the company, a leading maker of streaming devices, initially
defended Infowars’s presence in its lineup, saying, “We do not curate or
censor based on viewpoint.”

Roku said at that point that “to our knowledge” Infowars had not
violated Roku’s policies “that prohibit the publication of content that
is unlawful, incites illegal activities or violates third-party rights,
among other things.”

“If we determine a channel violates these policies, it will be removed,”
the company said earlier on Tuesday.

Mr. Jones did not respond to a request for comment.

He uses Infowars radio and online broadcasts to peddle diet supplements,
survivalist gear and gun paraphernalia. [The New York Times
reported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/07/us/politics/alex-jones-business-infowars-conspiracy.html?module=inline)
last year that the bulk of Infowars’s revenue — which was more than $20
million in 2014, according to court documents from that time — came from
the products Mr. Jones sells on the show.

For years, Mr. Jones [spread bogus
theories](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/23/us/politics/alex-jones-trump-sandy-hook.html)
that the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting of 20 first graders and six adults at
Sandy Hook was a hoax, and the families of the victims were “actors.”
The resulting harassment by Infowars followers forced some of the
families into hiding.

Victims’ parents repeatedly pleaded with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and
other platforms to remove Infowars’s content about the shooting. Last
year, the families of 10 Sandy Hook victims [filed three separate
defamation
lawsuits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/31/us/politics/alex-jones-defamation-suit-sandy-hook.html)
against Mr. Jones, who has maintained that he should be protected by the
First Amendment.

Last week, a judge in Connecticut [delivered a partial victory to the
families](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/12/us/alex-jones-infowars-lawsuit.html)
of eight Sandy Hook victims, ruling that they must receive access to
Infowars’s internal documents, including letters, memos, emails and
texts. The Connecticut complaint said Infowars profits by stoking
paranoia to amass more followers, to whom it can sell more products.

The families of two more victims suing Mr. Jones in his home state,
Texas, are demanding similar access to Infowars’s internal records.
Lawyers for the victims’ families are also seeking to question Mr. Jones
personally.

The lawyers blisteringly condemned Roku on Tuesday after the disclosure
of Mr. Jones’s channel.

Infowars’s presence on Roku “interferes with families’ efforts to
prevent people like Jones from profiting off innocent victims whose
lives have been turned upside down by unspeakable loss,” Josh Koskoff,
the lawyer representing eight Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut
suit, said in a statement. “There is no amount of anticipated revenue
that could possibly justify Roku’s calculated decision.”

Mark Bankston, the lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families suing Mr.
Jones in Texas, called Roku “indifferent to the suffering caused by Mr.
Jones’s continued onslaught of cruelty and reckless lies.”

Before its decision to join other social media platforms and ban
Infowars, Roku made clear it was not promoting or being paid to
distribute Mr. Jones’s channel. “We do not have any commercial or
advertising relationship with Infowars,” Roku’s earlier statement said.
