In December of last year, the Senate Intelligence Committee [released
two
reports](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/press/new-reports-shed-light-internet-research-agency%E2%80%99s-social-media-tactics)
it had commissioned concerning Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016
election. The outline of the interference effort has always been easy to
make out, but key questions about its significance — Could Russia really
affect voter sentiment by posting? Did trolls really lower voter turnout
in key states? — are still, in large part, matters for speculation. And
the committee’s findings did little to change that.

On the subject of Facebook, for example, the reports analyzed new
internal data on the campaign efforts of the Internet Research Agency,
Russia’s “troll farm,” and offered some examples of its work. We know
that there were more than 76 million “engagements” with content from the
Russian group — likes, comments, shares and clicks — but it is not
currently possible to know how many came from real people. “Since
Facebook did not provide data about any sock-puppet accounts involved in
the distribution of the content or the existence of ‘fake Likes’ from
these accounts,” one report says, “we are operating under the assumption
that this engagement was from real people and that this content was
pushed into the News Feeds of their Friends as well.”

Those are two enormous leaps. We do not currently know for sure whether
these engagements were carried out by humans or bots or a mixture of the
two, so the researchers were left to assume the worst. It’s worth
scanning other recent Facebook narratives for similar assumptions. Did
Facebook cause the *gilets jaunes* protests in France? Is the movement
“a beast born almost entirely from Facebook,” as [a recent BuzzFeed
piece](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/france-paris-yellow-jackets-facebook)
suggested? Or are the [protesters just using
Facebook](https://popula.com/2018/12/19/five-notes-on-the-yellow-vest-movement/)
as they sustain a long tradition of civil unrest in France?

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The latter theory is obscured by the basic difficulty of discerning why
an individual feels a certain way, much less a diverse nation of
millions. The former, however, feels as though it has been hidden from
us, because Facebook should, in theory, be able to shed light on this
question. Its users live in a state of full surveillance, with them and
everything around them subject to near-total tracking. The company is at
least capable of knowing how a piece of content found its way from one
user to thousands or how a *gilets jaunes* group functions on the social
platform. Far more than any outside researchers, Facebook is capable of
answering questions about the Internet Research Agency in 2016: For
example, how many of the accounts that interacted with the group’s posts
went on to interact with other political content? Was the audience for
these posts even real in the first place or part of the operation
itself? (Both reports criticized tech companies for doing the bare
minimum to assist in the committee’s efforts.)

The biggest internet platforms are businesses built on asymmetric
information. They know far more about their advertising, labor and
commerce marketplaces than do any of the parties participating in them.
We can guess, but can’t know, why we were shown a friend’s Facebook post
about a divorce, instead of another’s about a child’s birth. We can
theorize, but won’t be told, why YouTube thinks we want to see a
right-wing polemic about Islam in Europe after watching a video about
travel destinations in France. Everything that takes place within the
platform kingdoms is enabled by systems we’re told must be kept private
in order to function. We’re living in worlds governed by trade secrets.
No wonder they’re making us all
paranoid.

**The original sin** of our current tech hegemons is that in order to
work, the rest of the world can’t know how they work. How does Google
trawl the web and produce search results? That’s a secret that helped it
become the dominant search engine and that sustains its business model.
How does Facebook choose what comes next in your News Feed? How do
YouTube recommendations work? Too much transparency, the defense goes,
would expose them to reverse-engineering or abuse by bad actors.

The technologist Anil Dash recently described some of the internet’s
biggest platform businesses as [“fake
markets.”](https://medium.com/humane-tech/tech-and-the-fake-market-tactic-8bd386e3d382)
These are businesses that purport to be marketplaces, making money by
connecting parties — people who want rides with drivers, advertisers
with eyeballs — but are not actually markets in the strict sense of the
word. They’re centrally and often assertively managed and manipulated.
Some hardly resemble markets at all. Dash singled out Uber: In that
“market,” drivers don’t set prices, consumers don’t actually have much
choice and resources are allocated by trade-secret algorithms. Our
ignorance of how such things work is easier to ignore when a platform is
establishing itself and sharing the benefits of its growth. This dynamic
only starts to bother us after a platform wins, when there are fewer
alternatives or none at all.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When platforms become entrenched and harder for users to leave, the
secrets they keep are reflected back to them as resentments. On
Facebook, where every user’s experience is a mystery to all others — and
where real-world concepts like privacy, obscurity and serendipity have
been recreated on the terms of an advertising platform — users
understandably imagine that anything could be happening around them:
that their peers are being indoctrinated, tricked, sheltered or misled
on a host of issues. These gaps in knowledge are magnified once a
platform becomes involved in real-world events. Twitter is broadly
understood to be a catalytic political force, but this understanding is
usually half hunch — its relationship to the Arab Spring is still in
dispute; its usefulness to Donald Trump will never be fully understood;
and Twitter seems to be in no hurry to help figure it out. Similarly: Is
YouTube reflecting a rise in reactionary politics, enabling it or
creating it? These are already impossible questions to answer in full;
that everything is unfolding inside of a closely guarded attention
marketplace makes them difficult to even
approach.

So, did Facebook cause the gilets jaunes uprising in France? Maybe,
interesting theory; meanwhile, though, I don’t even know why it’s
recommending I friend someone I’ve never heard of. Did Facebook swing
the 2016 election? Could have, as far as we know; anyway, I can’t even
guess why Instagram started showing me a bunch of photos of a certain
breed of dog or why it’s suddenly serving me ads for meal kits. I know
how these things make me feel, but Facebook knows how they made me
behave — knowledge it won’t soon share.

It appears to be the tendency of the press, and of our imaginations in
general, to extend these theories in a particular direction. After years
of Facebook’s telling us how good it is at connecting people and
influencing their decisions, it is tempting to say something like: Yes,
O.K., then wouldn’t it have been easy to use these same tools to
persuade people to vote for Donald Trump? Facebook has equivocated on
this question in a telling way. It’s helpful to imagine what it would
have to say to successfully combat claims Russia used its platform to
swing the election: Sure, this many users saw propaganda but only for a
moment; and besides, this content didn’t seem to affect their behavior
in any way at all; sure, this amount of money was spent on ads, but
those ads don’t appear to have done anything; yes, these Instagram
accounts had that many followers, but more than half of them were bots
themselves; O.K., 76 million people were exposed to this content in some
way or another, but they mostly glossed over it, like spam.

They’ve inched tellingly in this direction but going all the way would
involve unflattering disclosure — the sort that would need to be legally
compelled. Mainly, it would be tantamount to admitting that the systems
we’re not allowed to know about — and the metrics we aren’t allowed to
see — might not be quite as valuable, or as worthy of trade secrecy, as
Facebook needs us to think they are. While it’s true that perceptions of
the tech industry have shifted, they aren’t necessarily closer to
reality. These companies mythologized their own omniscience when it was
a boon to their business. Versions of these myths persist, but they’re
no longer under their creator’s control — and they’re starting to bite
back.
