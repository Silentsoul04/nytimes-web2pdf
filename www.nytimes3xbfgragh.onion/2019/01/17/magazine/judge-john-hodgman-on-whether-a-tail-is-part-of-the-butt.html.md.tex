\textbf{Paul writes:} \emph{My wife, Samantha, and her grandmother Gigi
have a disagreement about whether a creature's tail is part of its butt.
Gigi says that because poop can get stuck to a tail, it is part of the
butt. Sam argues that a tail only starts at the butt. Are tails butts?
(Specifically a dragon's tail, which is what sparked this argument.)}

What a surprise twist at the end! Before we walked through this wardrobe
into fantasy land, I was confident in my ruling: Tails are NOT butts, as
they have specific and separate balance and display functions. And also
let's face it: Poop can get on anything. But as I am no expert in dragon
anatomy, I turned to the actual George R.R. Martin, whose number I
actually have, who reports: ``Poop can also get stuck to a dragon's leg,
but that does not make it part of the butt. Dragon poop is hot, by the
way. Fire hazard.''
