In this charming yet sobering lyric, Jericho Brown confronts his own
image as a black man --- what those on the outside imagine they see, and
what he can't help carrying inside, locked from view. Driven by the lilt
of the blues (ghosted in the buried rhymes of books/looks, concern/earn,
blue/new, cracked/black), the layers multiply and intersect with sad,
irrefutable logic. A relentless dismantling of identity, a difficult
jewel of a poem: painfully candid one minute, in your face the next ---
and as we approach Martin Luther King Jr. Day, still distressingly
apropos. \emph{Selected by Rita Dove}
